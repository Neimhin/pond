I‚Äôm well aware nations, including Asian neighbours, performing even better us. However original comment replied dribbling western nations ‚Äògiven up‚Äô. also true. incensed China doing, see awful human rights record invalidates numbers. They're completely separate things, evidence far points China virtually virus control. Look another way, US awful human rights record well, yet trust numbers government reports. reopened everything summer life got back normal (bars, restaurants, parties..). think important note infections occurred beginning 'second wave' majoritarily young people 'at risk' categories. Schools opened September, leading parties such. translates lot people getting mild symptoms symptoms all, sniffles feel like necessary get tested. virus sneaky. think can; last checked March couldn't, fair enough. appreciate optimism people care here. promise you. stopped cheek kissing, even think twice catching group 10 inside bar apartment Population density complicated one, too. There's difference overall density (population/area) effective density. Somewhere like Australia low overall density, mostly live cities, population density experience higher. Hahahahhahaa believe China. Nz tiny island.  Get real. Portugal exception Southern Europe comment. Flights Ive pretty focused masks, even banning bandanas, masks valves.

There‚Äôs already agreements place original statement ‚Äòall western nations given trying fight virus‚Äô 

All provided two examples western nations absolutely given up, live one them. we're talking percent tested

Okay, bad then, sorry. Blood doesn‚Äôt keep long either yeah gets used pretty quickly. still call local area see need put list do.  don‚Äôt care wear mask \[at market\]. pride loving atmosphere here.‚Äù 

Well, caring obviously sign love. love people care safety. can't really fix stupid, red hats lack masks make easier identify. South Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan

You add Vietnam list! I'm 20ft away closest coworker air conditioned office. wear mask day. he. individual freedom America mate.  Well, we're talking percent *tested*, population general.

In town Brazil hit 100% last Thursday. 8 new tests, 8 positives.

So, 100% mean ""tests short supply, testing symptomatic"". busy hassling muslims Oh really, here‚Äôs us thinking it‚Äôs gone forever /s aren‚Äôt dumbasses. Literally Completely unsurprised shitshow RER B weekend Guy girl, onion type shit, ridiculous funny part true. keep long takes. strong faith medicine social measures Australia New Zealand compared individualists many countries, especially United States.

We‚Äôve also quarantined specific states Australia, NZ locked specific regions. result, community transmissions, states, like mine reopens select parts country today, haven‚Äôt single case five months. like Lord Farquad (business owners) he's standing balcony telling peasants (workers) die sacrifice he's willing make (for profits may even materialize). 1. speculate day we‚Äôll never know. attempt manipulate stats shouldn‚Äôt numbers holding fast going down? Maybe you‚Äôre right administration retarded can‚Äôt even fake stats right

2. Yes awful thing

3. yes Let's hope Santa wears mask, else he'll turn super-spreader. /s yeah, thought really odd. must extremely stupid took lot precautions guard something real. .... realize numbers looking made public, right? entire point phase 3 trials prove efficacy vaccines mentioned article phase 3. phase 3 trials complete, numbers compiled, analyzed, released public. evidence go word Fauci medical experts access still private incomplete numbers education experience necessary interpet them. Releasing incomplete dataset public would harmful, armchair analysts like would scream fraud missing data. Nobody provide numbers *none numbers available public*. However i'm content trust word access numbers say we're close. Thanks source. can't believe happened big issue. florida might manipulating covid stats? Nah, let virus rip, that‚Äôs true government Thankfully I've Australia population took seriously today, whole country finally control. second wave state, crushed lockdown.

But back USA, second wave, first wave needs end, looking data, definitely happened.

Yes, maybe states has, whole, America still technically first wave. I'm sure people argue this, trust rest world views guys still first wave. Way more. That‚Äôs confirmed. Actual cases projected 5-10x amount. did, thankfully, wouldn‚Äôt compare cities state Hell Paso. remember living San Antonio, gorgeous place live in. Loans, matter low interest rate, add risk business owner way make revenue. Yeah. Bubonic plague believed endemic certain animal populations, bobak marmots. Usually big issue human beings since there's ton interaction animals eating bitten infected animal cause infections human beings. 50% seen US particular local areas parts NYC). think several EU countries hitting positive rate, basically means idea many cases there. Well WWI got free pandemic thrown free end, really situation us would want repeat 100k deaths beyond attributed covid. That's period 8 months annualise 150k.

Death rates (not counts - rates % population) projected grow bit 1% p.a. (without covid) population growing 0.5% p.a. total deaths would expected grow 1.5% p.a.

Expected deaths report (it seems) calculated using average 2015-2019 average 3 years 2020. would thus actually expect deaths 4.5% higher expected deaths figures used report.

Number deaths US (without covid) p.a. c.2.8 million, 4.5% 126k. Compare 150k annualised figure calculated earlier.

So that's right, 80% unexplained excess deaths actually attributed changes population size mortality rates rather hidden covid deaths.  Ummmm 14 day quarantine anyone coming country- it‚Äôs tightly controlled that‚Äôs Victoria ended going second lockdown. there‚Äôs hardly flights coming in. real, think government hasn‚Äôt thought that?? citizens giving fuck.

It kinda is, tho'. More, I'd say cultural. Look Asian countries quite splendid (a handful new cases, compared many thousands) - that's cultures people used okay playing rules greater good.

Whereas many Western cultures there's tradition ""individual freedom"" turns pretty deadly enemy viral contagion.

Just make clear, I'm one ""western"" cultures. Ok, yeah understand that. guys legends! Us kiwis struggled short lockdown guys kept going till aced Deaths per million :
USA: 688
France: 514 shit Sherlock? people travelling domestically only, course country billion population relatively little incoming tourism would see massive spike borders closed. first lady makes $100K work 3-4 months broke?  


LOL! Seriously? sympathy stupidity. Sho could predicted it? Oh yeah - anyone paid attention science consider option using 45% effective vaccine using vaccine (ie 0% effective vaccine). better vaccine emerge, would use instead. neighbors fail, fail. 

That's really big assumption absolutely evidence back up. üßê Fucking insane trivializing locking millions people homes ‚Äúchildren allowed go outside play‚Äù. Plasmapheresis therapy used many people, conditions. immune system cvids.Perhaps efficiency plasma changes donator experienced different infections recipients, perhaps depends recipient secondary infections might be. really hope losing previous use stop people donating. many people still need it, could still effective different strains infections Covid.

If allowed donate, please consider it. Plasma saves lives also makes lives worth living. Add Australia list ‚Äì 25k total, lockdown happened relatively early (esp compared Europe). weird Europeans saying Australia lacks freedom can't travel (ie holiday) easily. go out, largely without worrying invisible virus ‚Äì that's greater freedom. French famous speaking languages French.... No. Comparing smartness countries, interesting relevant? still first wave 
We never two.
Or end one. I‚Äôve tried donate 4 times since March turned (stupid forehead inaccurate thermometer) showing 99.6 temperature, machines hot, able donate twice that. also donated February started feels good donated 3 times. next donation December bring 1 gallon club! amount HIV positives there, I'd expect deaths written HIV related deaths. Whats black white tests false negatives, even test positive virus load high enough...yet.

See: Trump two Swedish towns perfect

Do seriously believe difference Norway Sweden two towns?

The study linked, one involving percentages, mention evidence seek willing look it. Open up, search ""pre-trend"" perhaps ""pretrend"", findings indicated trend Norway slowed _BEFORE_ measures would've effect.

So two towns different Norway Sweden Norway trend COVID-19 statistics *before* able observe difference due ""strategy""?

By means take time one, I've got year.  trump attack situation Lol stop ok make sense. Pressing X one. Parts Australia operating close normal. mandatory masks, schools bars sporting matches. seem think whole country operating lockdown, that‚Äôs true all. Restrictions vary across country. company work French brand, I‚Äôve met many people France business typically greet kiss cheek, kind of. Sweden well though. also proportional increase healthcare workers, hospitals, money everything else. argument 10x population works amount infrastructure smaller countries. like every person 330m pop goes see doctors, uses contact tracers ends hospital. We've fucked planet. Perhaps irreparably. 

Biden right, though. can't stop something something replace it, something essential power.

I think things need moving much rapid pace currently are. Solar power, wind power, nuclear energy appropriate NECESSARY kill Earth, bluntly, hage nowhere else go. technology required terraform planet human habitation exactly technology would using clean energy society. can't one without other.

I think Biden needs create specific task force this, needs name Bernie Sanders head task force. would put us best path planet. Ok work even suggest useless federal mandate first post.

Like, fuck cares Japan seriously. We're discussing American federal govt happily suggesting extra govt mandates able back efficacy 

Just admit wrong no, US federal govt adding extra laws they'll useless. thing Oregon. Idaho causing issue too. mostly seem pretty well. 3rd wave? Nahh mate, first wave never stopped, getting bigger. Cowabunga! üåä üèÑ ü§ô don‚Äôt even see it‚Äôs debatable. Acting like gigantic country super connected seems weird. What‚Äôs happening Delaware basically relation what‚Äôs happening New Mexico. I've donated twice since beginning, three times year. donate Xmas. However, surprised instilling fear disrupting normal human activity lockdowns killing people. still pretty crazy though. They're 1/5th population US 2/3rds US peak. also hope pull blue :-) wanna play basketball friends ü•∫ I'm away working another country. They're pretty careful, expect anything stupid still. China owns 4% us debt. Less Japan. 

The know. They're trying balance economy public health. calculations go stuff complex multifaceted, despite graduates Reddit School Medicine say. another limiting factor if/when healthcare workers get infected. know PPE situation like Utah specifically, many places around country still ration N95 masks. contrast several bars Tuscaloosa jam packed Bama-Georgia game last week. Although limited 50% capacity, Rounders instance full 600 people. mask required except entering ordering drinks. pandemic I‚Äôve spent majority time SF also spent time LA, Manhattan, Hamptons. 

The major difference I‚Äôve seen feels like world war 3 Bay Area. Everywhere else, people seem bit relaxed virus. like speeding

Everyone drives like fucking mad dog asshole California, every days pre-lockdown I'd see huge wreck somewhere freeway cleaned up. say ""Oh, died car crash, bad luck""

It bad luck, exactly expect happen 17 million stupid dickheads drive work 10-20 speed limit, 2-3 car lengths apart every day didn‚Äôt. Unless it‚Äôs compared USA Austin here. mildly freaking Governor horny open things again. Good thing early voting huge far can't wait 2022 kick attorney general curb. I'm frustrated irritated too. Especially became clear people ""minimum"" restrain holiday get togethers back spring/summer, seeing anyone without mask, seeing people online news act like important. I've accept people responding kinds ways this. cautious knowing even cautious me. Everything risk assessment, avoid risky (as typically clear are) limit exposure them. pisses off, stresses out, exasperates loneliness isolation know people acting like fine. wish inconsistent messaging government. think part reason felt full effect virus communities people part, even realize appreciate it, least know positive impact. No, sure shit ton money commerce rest world relies global economy believe otherwise divorced reality. Same. OH FEEL GREAT. THANKS! @joerogan Letting spiral beneficial GOP right now. lose (likely) biden campaign 1 2 things:

Lock properly, hurt economy (justified) prove correct fears sold conservative voters

Take gentle approach, see cases reach peak election, since things handled like garbage right now, GOP say ""see?? Things got worse soon democrats took over!!""

They win fuck containment short-term necessary WW1 WW2,

Honestly took convince population make sacrifices wars. forget government run mass campaign rationing food goods. famous ""Ugh Jim wearing 'Fuck Teachers' shirt playground again!"" paradox. could something roofs involved, know. city actually follows mask mandates. People sf actually social distance wear masks. proven help. Across country. Across globe.

Wear mask. Social distance. I‚Äôm El Paso. County Judge emphasized importance voting press release. said vote normally would elector‚Äôs office taken necessary precautionary measures ensure safety. 

Voting really issue here. broke voting records first couple weeks early voting drop mail ballot relatively simple. Lots early voting locations, plus open 10PM. year get vote election site, usual assigned one. Here‚Äôs hoping voting trend continues. story decades, described exactly said. pendulum constantly struggling take step forward back again. know unpopular opinion, fact is, people keep putting beliefs expectations democratic party simply true. enjoy values democrats, means, vote Democrat. problem people voting favored party ideals, majority progressives voting Democrat rhetoric says ""we gain power again, we'll change democratic party progressive, win first.""

No, that's ridiculous statement. would organization fight political war one platform, fact, change stances anything?

Yes, democrats vastly better Republicans, still line political beliefs. Green party absolutely that's support. progressives pushed party represents ideals instead waiting party power accept them, we'd already additional party seriously playing field. Real change country come things like ranked choice voting ""radical"" legislation, status quo parties. I'm fully aware Australia's geographic location. point was, Australia entering summer, Canada (in northern hemisphere) entering winter. Canada lockdowns spring, summer COVID cases quite low. Now, exponential increase cases. may headed hard lock , remains seen. cheer pat back want right now, backyard barbies beach parties harbouring virus. Come May, see resurgence. Okay get rapid test, quarantine 7 days(since quarantining anyway), get another rapid test, go family. renal colic today. Waited 3-4 hours pass deciding go ER, reason... I've already paid 3k today expecting Radiologist ER physician.

I've one high deductible plans. end ER, tend you, fuck every hole available without even offering lube. many chin-diapers dick-noses grocery store! Makes angry. even saw woman would put mask grocery store employee came near her, immediately take employee sight. Shameful. Purely anecdotal, following guidelines flu, cold, even strep throat year. Statistically speaking area get COVID sooner later, least yearly dance devil. Well, bioengineer virus think English say 24h H24 churches ok go to. signed another former PM opposite side party system, promising. Wilmington, Del. Friday, Democratic nominee president Joe Biden said, ‚ÄúFirst, I‚Äôll go **every governor** urge mandate mask wearing states and, refuse, I‚Äôll go **mayors county executives** get local mask requirements place nationwide.‚Äù Âêå‰∏ÄÂ§©Â¢®Â∞îÊú¨Â∑≤Áªè0Êñ∞Â¢û 0Ê≠ª‰∫° wrong. timeline still decided virus. vaccine grant us instant, even permanent immunity coronavirus. I've seen single study leaning degree. hope least slow period time, administering vaccine likely billions across several countries take considerable amount time. 

The reality virus *doesn't care*. **now**, *wear masks* *social distance*. Take care what's possible hoping miracle. miracle would everybody growing taking responsibility current actions. Protesting masks inconsiderate, also dangerous contributes prolonged effect virus slowing down. bad. Really bad. big wave *starting* hospitals already getting full?

State Federal govts little months prepare big wave going kill lot people. Appreciate sentiment, USA 300 million people Australia spread around lot metro areas. connected interstate highways short regional flight routes. long road go contain this, especially good chunk everyone business usual now. Schools mandate masks inside, might able outside? dress code lol. state law think. tested also dry cough, time, much else.

You symptomatic  obvious experience business.  Honestly, failed opportunity whole mask wearing thing. Like taken approach wear mask protect protect grandma/pa. think it‚Äôs made abundantly clear selfish general population crisis. 

I‚Äôm saying people selfish vast majority put us spot selfish ideologies.

I also saw World War Z :/ wow I'm el paso curfew 10pm 8am Washington state ok now, except far east Idaho. mostly terrified scare first, think. anxiety went deep it‚Äôs taken root. literally TX right drive people around? scenario mask driving? I'm sorry loss. Props good letting contacts know, however. lot would ashamed condone Typhoid Mary. Kudos. It‚Äôs easy lie figures. bet places around world act much earlier 

That would really stupid bet make given simply look back April see rest world when. Remember whole world shut down? would lose bet fantastically.  wear condom even though fianc√© pill. But.... emails? don‚Äôt mind asking, handling election city? call Trump Plan. Unlike Trump Alaska huge problems seasonal depression drinking goes along that, I'm worried winter coming lot mask denial came top: direct Trump, hangers-on. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd still seen it, anything like badly, without them.

We saw Houston, Republican governor wrung hands said believed *small* government it‚Äôs place make requirements whole state COVID, we‚Äôre big varied state, job local officials. Houston judge declared mask mandate numbers started really spiking. 

And ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs job‚Äù governor immediately squashed declared locals power enforce mask mandates people (to rabid cheers ‚ÄúThat‚Äôll show (*insert varied insulting terms Democrats, women, Hispanics*) place!!‚Äù)

....until numbers KEPT spiking, and, ironically, think El Paso figured loophole: mask mandates *businesses*, *people*! Let people store restaurant without mask it‚Äôs fine business! Gov. Abbott pretended like that‚Äôs meant along rest us stupid figure out. ...really. No, really.

Too late though, really crafted political statement. police departments even declared wouldn‚Äôt enforce even new ‚Äúprotecting individual freedom‚Äù version mandate.

Ugh. UGH.

One biggest worries Biden elected blamed mess he‚Äôs handed clean up. Trump exactly kind man try sabotage replacement top that, make look better comparison. left wing boog bois. I‚Äôm pretty sure don‚Äôt actually know anything Boog Bois. said we‚Äôre far-right, racist anything else media says. literally call everything don‚Äôt like racist far-right. don‚Äôt want people take guns. That‚Äôs literally it. makes cringe. Hopefully engagement months long least. Cops wear masks.

That's something *really* pisses off. mostly control due pretty strong measures put place. Masks mandatory (with hefty fines) public transport public indoor places practically since March. I've probably seen dozen police officers (out force patrol enforce mask mandate) fucking masks noses. 

That's unacceptable. weird mandate comes judge rules limited ballot placement governor really. 30% avoid, 30% support 40% us aren‚Äôt fucking going anywhere regardless there‚Äôs goddamn pandemic happening right now. Beds easiest part. Gotta staff, PPE, highly technical equipment. dragged burn rate docs nurses increases. They‚Äôre human lament position continue put in. Yeah, alcohol doesnt disappear quickly, thing changes feel intoxicated actual alc-content blood. good 24 hours even needed full bottle vodka return ""sober"" karen skarem PEI also hosted [bubble 2020 Canadian Premier League season came went zero cases helping local economy. Well unexpected. reason, Sweden 'right' ones believe masks.

But they're also typical racist, climate change denying a-holes.

The world weird. blame ""wanting woke"" ahead everyone else.  Something stuck me. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt think year one hottest 100 years, think one coolest next 100 years.‚Äù ‚Äúsniffed COVID‚Äù catchy ‚Äúdrank Koolaid? Used live Cruces, confirm. could absolutely still infect someone situation.  bruh even find cases symptoms shown Elimination viable strategy virus a-symptomatic exponentially due high infectious resilient nature.

New Zealand went elimination pretty much achieved except looks like quarantine breach. opened borders back parts Australia mitigation strategy.

The difference New Zealand US is, apart population geography; New Zealand locked enforced measures allow almost quash virus.

Same Australia, outside outbreak Victoria due piss poor management hotel quarantine, we‚Äôve far, fingers crossed, got virus control initially locking down, getting contact tracing testing par lock down, slowly reducing restrictions, reintroducing them, allowed/needed.
NSW dodged multiple bullets early (like letting ruby princess disembark it‚Äôs passengers testing one), done good job managing local outbreaks since (so far).

America doesn‚Äôt seem done above. ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù (which large parts country wasn‚Äôt enforced) was, best, increase hospital capacity testing capacity. appears effort establish contact tracing limit travel states whatever. would harder, doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt done...you‚Äôre richest country world almost limitless resources... America never went lockdown - happened rich fled summer homes middle class boarded work remotely poor forced errands deliver things them. FOH shaming essential workers. Lived rgv one worst US. Definitely felt blown nobody knew got it. takes one person know die go hospital care don‚Äôt really need wear mask driving (unless you‚Äôre taxi driver bus driver course). really hope U.S. starts come senses. 


This funny typical ""My rights"" American stuff first. 


It's funny anymore, Sort out. Seems like would good people couple work full time could take care things outside work... Yep...a colleague lost parents Milan (!) ER waiting room earlier spring. 

Everyone throws around mortality numbers functioning HC system. start rationing HC services, mortality explode. city really making mockery itself.. Pay then. stfu forget Abbott said poll workers can't force people wear mask make leave refuse. next two weeks gonna worse entirety year. Ive stocking little little every grocery shop months. Looks like Im leaving grocery shop/ one reason left house since March/. Yep Im lockdown. Colorado. guess way. Sucks!!!!! took plan, leadership, supportive government everyone sacrificing good all, no. timeline progressive. Fuckin I'm feeling like much country would better full blown stay-at-home order, longer one(s) spring. wish could get tested asymptomatic local hospital refuses show symptoms. spend day working retail. also dry cough, time, much else. infected someone. gonna get lot worse. ignorant aholes saying they're paid actors. Bet. Yeah, hope see many Good News posts coming weeks going away /s That's development. Large scale manufacturing still needs occur

Development vaccines completed long ago, testing developed vaccines now. Large-scale manufacturing already started months ago. I‚Äôm El Paso. confirm  PA lockdown things would worse. 

Look Asian cities. Everywhere lock people complied fine.

Adhering basic health safety plus lockdown best approach. rounding corner... go straight charts. be. We'll shitter soon. Even ""make it"" covid without imploding economy, climate change going so, much worse. hope parents make speedy recovery. hope safe LA. Wish folks best. Yeah, people like hiim/that believe lthat money answer everything. good.

His covid stunt reinforce thinking. Never. We're undoubtedly fucked now. 

When government says jump (cuz virus), we'll forever say ""how high"".

Healthy Americans ordered wear face coverings isolate assumption respiratory droplets danger others. 

World gone crazy 226 active cases whole country. quarantine half population months covid Spreads winter.

The reson low really locked areas affected compulsory measures plus really improved/good contract tracing - due seasonal behaviour. certainly easier dont share land border anyone. afraid surpass them, current wave deaths beginning less 8 000 positive tests daily worse coming next three weeks numbers increased / basically doubled. hard lockdown stop now, still need handle wave already incomming. fact never go anymore, talking time could. Maybe calmed bit, wouldnt insulting people reason making look like fool. Thank you. plan that. Actually that‚Äôs good idea. know shortage. pretty obvious millions people care themselves. early on, (NZ) understood anything near required number ICU beds available ever broke out. strategy go hard, go early, flatten curve. 
As turned out, successful enough aim elimination strategy, time vaccine available. 
Now, apart anything related international travel, we're back normal functioning lives. wont listen. serious punishments given, assholes continue share covid like shit facebook political opinions he's darker sheet paper they'll ask birth certificate.  Neither true Florida parks. many seem listened him. noticed decrease mask-wearers grocery runs since event. Qarens Qens staring people masked up, give dirty looks they‚Äôre single stupid thing I‚Äôve ever laid eyes on.  election right around corner, course we're going experience socially engineered terrorism.

The increasingly delusional desperate dems. last hurrah. This. kills is, people starting get confident understand virus well. I‚Äôm talking regular joes, MDs infectious disease specialists. Somehow virus something beat now. SMH!! lmao anyone actually think worth it? Absolute nightmare fuel. cases come back they're open. makes grateful Trump wonder offer would've year ago. must starving medical staff now. took grain salt. thank you. appreciate it. bit much.

That said, sounds like understand severity virus, please take care yourself. brutal las winter/spring. care people know die, long still go friends. I'm one stay home, knows friends say behind back?!? almost like think I'm good person. Us Australians even good contact tracing app. second wave Melbourne, CovidSafe app pick anyone, contact tracing mostly done manually huge amou tof effort.

I hate thing  Even Europe closed borders first wave, really completely close. still travel across trade allowed. case EU controlled main roads, like big walls around country barbed wire top. Completely closing borders France Germany impossible.

Though agree least limit travel again. feels like whatever France way less considering extremely high numbers. people wonder cases deaths rising. Wow, really bashed several threads comment. think people realize might dealing with. lived NYC 6 years. sense literally difficult would survive winter, pandemic, surges again. There's doubt mind happened lived NYC, would've died (I high risk factors).

Do need do. idea country live in,but UK get flu jab lot high st pharmacies , pretty quick Step-1 ? Google translation extract:

In eagerness crack coronavirus, even Danes small amounts non-living virus throat diagnosed ""positive"", even though neither ill infected. unnecessary waste society's resources, says professor, says limit value declared corona positive moved.

A standard PCR test identifies coronavirus isolating amplifying genetic material retrieved pharynx. done running sample material machine several cycles. coronavirus detected ten cycles, gets CT value ten.

In Denmark, limit little coronavirus triggers ""corona detected"" response. 35 cycles - ie. CT value 35 - sample still considered positive, even amount virus time vanishingly small. CT value 12, example, ten million times much viral material present CT value 35.

‚ÄòStudies shown three per cent patients CT scores 35 live virus throat. remaining 97 percent infected all. Yet send home isolation, detect infection, class workplace shut down. absurdly expensive personal societal level, ¬´says Christine Stabell Benn \[epidemiologist clinical professor global health University Southern Denmark\].

If live covid-19 fight several years, would good idea make 'positive limit' e.g. CT value 35, suggests:

‚ÄúThen, three 100 cases, send someone may contagious. think room that. savings would huge. ""  human. like pretend kind things, essence, we're animals. go them, mean much, spread 'normal' behavior,an a-b interval must.

it kill lot us, rain rain worms, go die sun later on.

perfectly natural. evolution best. Depends live. countries already like Congratulations every single Victorian! mainly good 7 day average trends show slowing positivity rate deaths. 
However, festive season start surely upward trend sooner later Speak yourself, Spain masks mandatory everywhere Yes too. Murdoch media refers premier dictator dan that's official title. republican run town? problem ruling politicians UK absolutely fucking clueless. couldn‚Äôt organise piss brewery, let alone pandemic response. donated last week. worker processed donation said haven‚Äôt busy since 9/11. Never would guessed. Maybe places masks something different. Way better yes, I'm salty still since original plan go got 5 case average less 5 mystery cases another 2 weeks. look situation France, population density definitely factor. departments greater numbers people / km2 far greater numbers Bad people. I've slowly stocking TP since Easter. people really claiming virus spread contact aerosol isnt prevalent densely populated areas? Evidence support please, French government's Covid map shows complete hell people doing?? mother lives France, says it‚Äôs mostly men aren‚Äôt wearing masks. whole family supermarket, father mask-less.

How spread covid chemtrails 25 km still way better 5 km though. fade away time. relate you‚Äôre saying. I‚Äôm British live France. can‚Äôt escape stupid. U.K. it‚Äôs ‚Äúwe need leave deal!

Sadly see people ignore advice prevent spread. wear masks properly take second walking store. moment pay start move comes! see friend way do! Hug double cheek kiss. Ffs. 

Oh well two years pretty nice life moving guess stupid everywhere. I‚Äôd sore three days deliberately obtuse. numbers publicly available yet.  one data asking for, suspect already know that. go point word people participating effort seen numbers haven't. currently say things looking good coming finish soon. common examples, South Korea*, New Zealand Australia land borders. EU, borders practically non-existent due huge land borders hard police, freedom movement part EU anyway. 

*Okay, SK does, effectively doesn't. Positivity rate time low that's comforting We've got testing pretty much whoever wants it, plus contact tracing seems pretty good breakouts.

We've contained last 8 breakouts well, even people lied they'd What's number H1N1? live Paris see young (17 less) saying ""Hello"" kissing ""la bise""...

So surprise... bubble one-way (NZ AU). returning New Zealand, still go managed isolation 14 days, pay it.

Basically Greenfield development reserved well advanced lots ready reasonable payment usually provided 10-20k, allows developers manage cash flow better. thing though price purchase set value plot land point reservation practice people making deposits houses want buy sprang could sell deposit onto 3rd party increased amount time buy came around.

Issue price housing lot actually goes going whole lot issues. Watch go, protecting health economy. testing 120k every week almost 2% working age population. enough. tried, weights, got incredibly short breath cardio. Yes fact populace wants guaranteed payments Americans. slim sliver hope, gets office, plastered crime investigations sued left right, might actually flee country already ""joked"" lately, actually might end jail. outcomes would kinda prevent running 2024.


Of course, since ""Justice rich justice everyone else"" system US seems protected Trump far, idea would face actual consequences life, seems still far fetched. Especially since &amp; GOP nominated many Judges last four years probably call favours. letting aside whole ""I pardon advance everything"" situation brought early term. said beginning, slim sliver hope... really want let what's trapped there? Canada...please stay home heal country. unemployment insurance issued state state, different eligibility requirements, vastly different benefit amounts. benefits paid usually fraction earned working, huge amount pressure federal government reinstate $600/week unemployment boost. Additionally, outdated computer systems handle unemployment cases, well staff, overwhelmed volume cases. even slight complication someone's case, may get anything all.

So answer question: depends. Anecdotally: filed unemployment April heard anything them, wife filed late May first check direct deposited first week June. found job May (I actually got offer day wife laid hers), savings would gone would lost house. feel like eating restaurant asking trouble. get takeaway? 

I guess ""fun"" let little ole flu keep partying? people necessarily horrible people, though fail understand reasoning.

Recently saw couple old people masks chins went elevator also wanted take, held pace avoid taking together them. However, considerately held elevator waiting me, I‚Äôm embarrassed go say thank you...I would asked don‚Äôt wear masks properly wasn‚Äôt awkward. Coronavirus like humans. mean put regulations slow destruction world, like try stop virus, may seem work, may better minute, goes back destruction. we're killing planet bit slower before, we're still going kill it. Well including international travellers NSW like 6 smth im talking community transmission. lack plan plan Depressing foreshadowing climate change future guess believe invisible friend believe anything Almost like Mother Nature‚Äôs defence mechanism. guy says help poor healing sick! ... obviously communist places like Canada second wave, months limited hospital use, used time ramp testing, proceed procuring additional PPE therapeutics, put place lot infrastructure required help prevent spread (social distancing requirements, plexi-glass ""cubicles"" waiting rooms, negative pressure chambers, etc). far better shape 2nd wave, said that, false pretenses may get locked again. fair specified protesting pandemic. unfortunate time protests, totally agree lose-lose changes needs protested. I've seen lot comments like make Trump different ways, one seriously thinks France's failure fault. Lol what? *far* effective. reason flu vaccine inconsistent start working roughly six months flu season using strain currently east Asia. influenza virus mutates constantly time reaches us, fairly different looking virus working with. Hence flu shot iffy.

The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine created using currently buttfucking country. While, yes, numerous strains there, mutations seem lie epitopes (little viral surface proteins elicit immune response). various vaccines way hopefully much effective, especially compared flu vaccine. hyperbolic opinion supporting facts also argument (or least one worth time arguing with), instead hope loved ones get little pain possible can't expect everyone keep wearing matter routine this, hope experience least normalized idea temporarily wearing one cold something similar still go out. could really make dent future cold flu seasons people change thinking somewhat. ""But think children!""

I member! state run poorly citizens behave incredibly selfishly.

Victoria well way disaster took actions necessary suppress it.

You perhaps reflect situation different. really asking provide source Poland‚Äôs total population, number COVID deaths, average number people die daily Poland?

Google Covid 19 Poland see multiple reputable sources choose facts. disclosing findings top secret academic study here. easy find country level facts. know better, still act like internet points.

Great.  guess one likes narcs, like done I‚Äôm 36 spent last 4 years dealing one random surprise health issue foresight hindsight guiding far away covid possible. treatments guaranteeing won‚Äôt end long-hauler, 50% population vaccinated, won‚Äôt rolling dice anytime soon. enough smart friends hang with, I‚Äôm awesome fucking company myself, rest life important year sacrificing social shit. Well ya that's point trade union nothing more. wish least little more. ones highest risk first perhaps US stop harping death count next year ?

I fear media start focus good news US changes leaders may take months still it‚Äôs going refreshing know wheels least starting turn. BNO Newsroom Index (BNI) starting get frightening. That's metric need know track infection risks. Yes talking roll whole time. want that, hell, want way better that... getting coming months... honest start meant: ""because decades underfunding cutting public services, fucked doctors hospital beds even mild novel respiratory disease bring us close collapse. Therefore, going destroy livelihoods, mental health finances 2022 deal virus kills 0,2% 1% infected. Sorry fuck all"".

This taken well wondered could fastracked people intensive training particular covid procedures may indeed complicated learn less year.

Ireland this, graduated medical students 1 year left school sent straight work believe.

Unfortunately seems governments world gone variation hands approach, whether say publicly (US Brazil) (France, UK). hey, keep mind parts US, Covid leading cause death age 18-44. already gets downvoted. Lol, haters gonna hate, guess. well tbh. think that's misconception got. NY Times legit. solid article backed we‚Äôve experienced AL. opening K-12 big success story isn‚Äôt told enough. We‚Äôre week 10-11 issues - it‚Äôs Fall‚Äôs pleasant surprise far crazy year!

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll downvoted, it‚Äôs true least am. Opening in-person schools bright spot bleak year‚Äô! Hence words. That's ""just"" quotes, ... 

One reason previous government, lot factories eastern parts either closed moved west, money was. good business decision, really jumpstarted economy left lot people without money perspective. gave right-wing government, target eastern communities Catholic values, traditional Polish families (no degenerate western LGBT) handing hard cash. last one policy PiS implemented kind worked. Everything else designed dismantle checks balances gather power. think either already passed going pass law makes blameless decision made pandemic (a lot money vanished).

Most people put charge yes-men. opinion party tells so. president puppet without remorse. 

It's mess. That's lives fucked, longer able use delta forever That's crazy talk!

/s Right, sense yet steep curves get deaths relative sharp spike cases. Comparing spring useful since testing improved much. clear, doubt deaths going spike coming weeks, question get worse spring/summer peaks not. Well come essentially Pfizer FDA going push one appease Trump news outlets broke story. whole hubbub FDA changing going back emergency authorization stuff recently Trump got pissy at. I'll absolutely take it. Saves way less people dying/permanently suffering.  realize higher needs kid lost progress may take long time catch ever? see parents post kids (sometimes even special ed) meltdowns middle school sessions helplessly trying help younger grades. 
Those sacrifices made top sacrifices.

Everyone quick dismissing need schools ""regular"" students time everyone forgot special ed kids exist America like 80,000 weekend, Saturday Sunday. start started shopping work getting home deliveries, pay step foot supermarket normal hours point. even ruins portfolio

Don‚Äôt even make choice getting control virus vs stock market / economy.

If shutdown get control virus, would great stock market / economy.

Virus killing people bad stock market / economy. actually sent email non mask wearing HR actually came spoke us. Kinda wild. 

My one coworker hardly wears says ‚Äúyou need mean can‚Äôt take desk?‚Äù

Where anyone get idea it‚Äôs okay you‚Äôre desk? bc you‚Äôre 6ft away? think using silly euphemism swab test. 552 per 100k people; total number infected way 200.

But yes, also guess even whole Aachen, 7 day stuff 199 today, going towards lockdown. Although much later, remembering spring, Bavaria always first NRW always last enforce strict rules. There's wondrous places world Evangelicals considered cult???? Educate, discuss, confront...that's solution.

Ridicule, hate silencing never work. bad info. 6 feet sufficient closed door situations, even worse 1 person wear mask indoors. know COVID lingers air spreads farther 6 feet.. Yes I‚Äôd put Australia among countries clear strategy, i.e. elimination border closure. Kudos (although don‚Äôt think would doable Europe America) increasing steadily last couple months. kind growth happens look particularly alarming does. People cowering beds afraid virus IFR 0,2% would last seconds WW2 point like refusing live without ever getting flu. virus continue mutate become virulent less deadly.

At point that's call, question would ""why?"" commerce secretary Wilbur Ross said deadly coronavirus outbreak China could positive American economy. Well, looks like wrong. joking virus making people sick. revealing world gaps US defences; fragility it. fear day defences tested, already alas that's creeping conspiracy hate theories. Christmas 2021.  realize pandemics happened right? permanent. never first plan. [Utah closed. Take emergencies better right, ... They're using pooled testing initial rounds, China done. Get virus control, massively test, quarantine contacts, isolate positives. Yes, works like France too. might valid excuse, wondered could fastracked people intensive training particular covid procedures may indeed complicated learn less year.

The number patients intensive care units ridiculously small (3 000 moment), figure would found solution train hundred thousand people prevent second lockdown 65 million people. maybe impossible suppressed virus hard way instead thinking could control it. im hospitals 80-95% rural areas sending patients us...and people still acting like normal. AL Here. Same. We‚Äôve 10-11 Weeks issues. Opening Traditional schools back much better expecting. expecting shut within week months later issues. scary first, feel sorry cities won‚Äôt let in-person schools resume. Let‚Äôs pray success back school continues! General use early 2021 ambitious, given much depends it, I‚Äòm sure everything humanely possible done make happen. Would fantastic spring! first get Oxford one early emergency use. really difficult say. western vaccines, ones China &amp; Russia, one India 1st generation. go various statements released vaccine manufacturers, made clear vaccines aimed reducing severe symptons diseases.

So I'd say

Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, Gamaleya (Russia), Sinovac, Sinopharm, CanSino, Bharat Biotech (India), AstraZeneca (Britain) 1st generations.


The second generation vaccine ones aimed eliminating shortcomings 1st generation. good example would 2 vaccines developed Codagenix University Washington respecitvely administered intranasally.

These 2 vaccines developed keeping mind shortage needles syringes + waste cause. vaccines single dose target upper respiratory system, first site infection many cases according experts.

If provide immunity upper respiratory tract theory, prevent virus replicating due neutralising antibodies turn prevent infection, diseases, severe onset symptons well spread.

There also vaccine form pill taken orally believe Merck &amp; IAVI.

Not say that, good luck, one first generation vaccine proves super effective well prevent infection/viral shedding spread, silver bullet.

Like anybody else, also want thing over. try stay optimistic timelines. Maybe year full adverse unfortunate event, maybe end might hit gold 1-2 first generation vaccines prove super effective time one also needs manage expectations.


For anyone interested suggest checking NY times vaccine tracker. compiled good research.


Edit: ask me, 2nd generation, promosing vaccines imo would 2 intranasal single dose vaccines mentioned with

Merck &amp; IAVI (because used technology produce Ebola vaccine)

Imperial College self amplifying mRNA vaccine thoughts exactly. data released? think even unblinded phase 3 clinical trials yet? Frontline workers, folks underlying conditions, younger folks work public populations. keep senior citizens care homes sequestered tbh likely aren‚Äôt working easily isolated become available. Old news Yeah, people admitting it‚Äôs breaking highly affected areas. Let‚Äôs smug. actually wondering big bullet humanity dodged original SARS hit Asia instead west.

Not big Nipah virus outbreaks, monster fatality rate 50-70% we're supposed stop pointing truth tired hearing/reading it? Latin America seems also bad Well, good you, soldier! want 100 cookies go quarantine? money, shopping year. Black Friday nonissue many. WTX? deal ton oil industry conspiracy folks you. Asia still masked up.

They masked COVID, no? lot publicity links including sub locate trials area. sign contact determine eligibility based health history. I‚Äôm Oxford get $100 per visit get sick requires appointments. Also, drop point (the two years required stated above). example, vaccine released, get vaccine longer eligible study. think dodged massive bullet 2009 - 2016, somehow go forever.

It can't, won't. Wow, hoax getting *really* elaborate. ü•¥
 
Fun activity: sort controversial bathe hot Republican tears. ‚ÄúStop deleting posts PLANdemic!!‚Äù üòÇ Isnt guys favorite publishing? But, like said, linked stats it. whatever. anything change minds massive, harsher, blanket lockdowns. tradition one country much worse another doesn‚Äôt mean abdicate responsibility citizens. Corruption still really bad dia. ask someone raped, honour killed done wrong someone higher caste. 

I guarantee someone along way keeping vaccines make quick buck. Well, 552 today, we're far away it. thing get? Baesweiler almost nowheresville. nothing farms, cows, cowshit.

What people spreading virus?   Hell, US used recognize 18th 19th centuries. FAUCI TRUST think there's couple things here. First all, Poland reasonably calm first wave compared European countries totally underestimated second wave we're now. seeing lack readiness lack funds. hand, Poland hit harder economically EU states hence financial injection going towards (so called ""anti-crisis shield"" healthcare plan barely mentioned). 

As health standards, norm Poland really depending are. big cities find tiers quality health service outside big cities serious lack quality. 

To conclude, think pictures unique we've seen almost every country point pandemic. think shows lack funding rather lack capacity limits healthcare institutions worldwide one hand complete lack readiness hand. seem anxious person reason probably would lived us aswell Found article local news site. compensation $120 visit, 3 initial visits 3 long term visits, $5 week fill symptom tracker. things correlate strongly low life expectancy. Less old people = less covid deaths. could short sharp lockdown like China, NZ, Australia.

Exactly eastern european countries drowning bodies did. point exactly?

God, something want end lockdowns figure hobby epidemologist. California, Oregon, Washington - mask wearing probably among highest entire Anglopshere, positivity rates still dirt low.

&amp;#x200B;

Masks work, right wing media trying make sure talk west coast successful we've been. remember downvoted subreddit back March suggesting wear masks that's China. Apparently allowed contradict Fauci, even he's saying makes zero sense. Well, technically Phase IV, general population lab rats, case, they'll time collect data first round people, cops firefighters, etc, pushing rest us.

Children probably last, all, get it. Covid actually China, first discovered there. covid strain europe OLDER strain China.  Hey there. kept successful Russian vaccine keeping numbers down. doing? üéµFirst thing I'm gonna do

Is slide corner booth

And take whole damn family out

And buy buddies round

Pay extra tab

Catch movie, catch cab

Probably over-wash handsüéµ Wow, that's great thing. J&amp;J going vaccine 3rd world countries, possibly every country requires 1 dose. one thinks clothes essential, essential anyone buys right now. 

How know this? Obviously 99% people, *right now* - isn't. could 1%, proportion 1% may online access. feel like people really want new normal. intrusive would say restrictions? US accepted pandemic moving lives.

People tend feel hopeless alternative. sure that's 'acceptance' straight tory policybook lol. make argument lockdowns (maybe people would listen would quickly, maybe bailouts non-essential businesses keep afloat...). know people even begin make argument masks. Literally put mouth nose go business. little girl going live rest life, even Santa Magic help. large population septagenerians. Yes fact numbers start slowly go down...we hope again. and...they headed community near weeks. Sigh. Let's real California, Illinois, New york exploding cases clearly Democratic governors effective Republicans'.

Less reporting, less obesity know starvation, people probably dying home counted. really think people would meaningful number 'non-essential' quarter supermarket remained open. punitive policy serves almost benefit.

You might well cordon confectionary area could make exact argument. wonder Visegrad leaders fall Covid-19. They're incompetent populists answers real issues.

Fauci jail saying work difference growth rate huge, Marro said really think people would meaningful number 'non-essential' quarter supermarket remained open. punitive policy serves almost benefit. It‚Äôs sad never held accountable killing people droves. lost translation, Wikipedia labels ‚Äúprovince -level division‚Äù Oh forgetting ‚ÄúJust 2 weeks stop spread‚Äù rhetoric. goalposts moved nasty side effects lockdowns revealed(Economic destruction, increased DV, higher suicides,etc.) blame shifted people couldn‚Äôt lockdown 2 weeks ‚ÄúIf done 2 weeks would back normal.


We ample evidence countries locked right still second waves. won‚Äôt eradicate virus hey let‚Äôs keep locking destroying livelihoods process Less obesity countries younger populations.

You said could people take seriously. 

I‚Äôm pointing no, taking virus seriously cure virus people still die. *ends* vaccine (and even it‚Äôs new flu season likely). 

It‚Äôs negative effects mitigated greater degree, yes. also welcome look around countries. doesn‚Äôt end. aunt thinks wearing mask good get ‚Äúa little bit Covid‚Äù helps immunity. 

I wish kidding. get idea immunity comes attenuated viruses? case, deliver spike protein virus uses enter cells, without giving ability actually so. immune system responds triggers antibodies.

You can't trigger ""generic antibody surge"" ‚Äî genuine immune response. 

Think like football supporter walking bar full opposing team's fans wearing side's shirt, trying start fight everyone generally loud obnoxious leaving backing down. next time actually dangerous thug shows wearing football shirt, bouncers ready go bar door.

While definitely need monitor long term know exactly long immunity lasts for:

1. stop transmission (e.g., enough people immune0 virus stops prevalent community quickly (look Melbourne, instance); 
2. T-cell response, antibodies matter much less. 

There monoclonal antibody treatments, treatments confirmed infected, preventative measure (because body make itself, learn how). work specific virus (or least, anything looks enough like virus immune system). infected, anything, infected, hyper-targeted reinforcements immune system. One floor hospital isnt ""at capacity"" number people UK steady access online services, may present due work obligations accept deliveries. big news happened. yes, they‚Äôre definitely manipulating stats. 

Of course, isn‚Äôt big issue public outrage comes goes government stacked people really anything - re: Trumps entire presidency, even getting impeached doesn‚Äôt shit little search tell are, trail 2012, 8 years outbreak Sars.  skeptical whether knows logistics rolling vaccine work.

Please, don‚Äôt bother answering rhetorical questions, every person functioning brain already knows answer.

If locked properly first place wouldn‚Äôt even discussion. Kids would able go back school without even worrying masks safety protocols. Adults would able go back work without fearing health safety. Instead, idiots like fueling resurgence cases. You‚Äôre dense listen experts. You‚Äôre selfish respect health safety others.

Hard believe went that. dont think everyone said lock 2 weeks, wouldnt work one family could one person infect another incubation periods top lockdown far longer, plus lockdowns reduce spread dont stop people still need food etc. stops spread lockdowns, behaviour changes, contact tracing, education measures like business public event closures. 

The first time locked down, didnt whole infrastructure, governmental mistakes well peoples behaviours, second wave state. much likely keep lid things avoid unnessecary dealths / long term illness lot people.

Lockdowns dont kick road, Coronavirus spread like US inevitable every country. measures place till vaccine developed rolled out, measures dont need nearly draconian, somewhat return normal life lockdown lockdowns successfull. headline inaccurate. Governor Abbott allow El Paso shelter place order. screenshot staying home curfew. curfew, 10pm 5am, started last night. Otherwise El Paso open business. That's honestly terrible credo. everyone thinks crazy probably crazy. [Mizoram, north-eastern Indian state one seen 0 covid related deaths, re-entering state 2.5k cases population 1.1 million people. ~200 active cases. tested around 10% population far.

After opening schools senior high school students last week finding grand total 15 students testing positive, closed schools again. decided institute designated shopping hours, regulate traffic movement, brought 8:30PM night curfew, theatres still remain shut workplaces still capacity limitations.

This despite single covid death hospitals overrun.

The state officials argued small state cannot afford lax overrun pandemic. termed next two weeks ""Covid-19: Tolerance Fortnight"". exit criteria built in.

I know ""there's pandemic going on"" that, even so... seems like *huge* overreaction. feel way you? least see, I'm sure I'm seeing whole story right, I'd like feedback local something. Mizoramians here? literally can't find anything confirms using specific words.

It take much brain power figure allowing people enter country places high infection rates lead higher infection rates said country. extreme example: China completely isolated world moment outbreak started, one outside China would virus.

I‚Äôm guessing going 0 positive affect, possibly negative one me. you‚Äôre essentially telling don‚Äôt believe actual blood shortage. 

And 1) didn‚Äôt read entire article; and/or 2) you‚Äôre intentionally obtuse says. **blood centers still reporting significant declines blood collections**, leaving blood supply United States critically low levels, according joint statement issued late last week AABB (formerly known American Association Blood Banks), American Red Cross America‚Äôs Blood COVID-19, **coupled wildfires Western states, recent hurricanes storms**, led ‚Äúunprecedented fluctuations‚Äù supply demand **More 80% blood collected American Red Cross comes blood drives**, returned pre-pandemic levels, schools opt virtual learning people continue work home. demand blood strong ever, hospitals back scheduling elective surgeries. Fair point. lived apartment first 6 months pandemic analogy makes sense me.

Unfortunately think trust parents take precautions. go breakfast every Saturday even though mom works healthcare. direct exposure regularly works others exposed point. mention they've already scheduled cruise vacation March. Oh, mom ER Friday asthma attack. think dumber sounds.

It's still 2 weeks away might cancel depending week goes. Oh know, got control last spike, faith again. always rounding corner circle. controlled spread begin would already tapering likely would gotten sick. rest world getting control. They‚Äôre gatherings watching sports stadiums. Yet somehow richest powerful country earth, deaths simply ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù. basically US government current given American people. officially coming going pretend disease exist, send many people hospitals possible hope suffering death results minimized barely effective therapies weak vaccine come eight months best.

At least 230,000 people lost lives COVID today. Around 900k still suffering long term effects disease. most, 9 million Americans put least two weeks hellish suffering exist, way worse flu. that's counting communities families crippled emotionally loss loved ones, economically desperate measures individual communities take barely keep medical services running, businesses shut down, kids missed school pandemic continues rage control.

But that's part makes angry. part makes really angry nobody seems care. expect outrage instead hear total silence. Silence corporate America, silence celebrities, silence academics, silence public officials. Nobody taking streets mass demonstrations fact country thrown towel. We've fought wars casualties far fewer this. people really making noise conspiracy theorists agree administration COVID big deal. disgusting unforgivable hate much outright admission US government lives health matter provokes deafening silence basically *everyone*. age morons feel pride telling invite killer virus infect loved ones, yes /s absolutely necessary. see well parents look children lockdown again.
Well might job anymore, might money feed sleep bridge.

But looking children. mean tax payers owning risk. can‚Äôt complain pay, lack appreciation. saying medical staff saying, ‚ÄúI quit‚Äù, saying it‚Äôs hard leave months fight battle different front there‚Äôs battle already are. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt care people El Paso, it‚Äôs lot risks unknowns going local hospitals hitting capacity I‚Äôm contract Texas, would want here. 

If something one small area effected, would different. bridge collapse, mass shooting, something like Oklahoma city, could keep hospital. would working much legally could help. 

Normally one can‚Äôt go another state practice without applying licensure there. They‚Äôve changing rules since pandemic started. want believe half population ‚Äústupid‚Äù, realize stupidity much situational subjective, think allude here. 

I‚Äôm saying pilots training instructors aren‚Äôt stupid, I‚Äôm saying UND best keep instructors students safe non-stupid way.

Maybe think smart enough run flight training program middle worlds worst COVID outbreak. so, power you. Wait... letting people go life playing risk back fired??! would thought?! Ok, that's all. [estimated influenza numbers 35.5 million sick influenza

* 16.5 million went health care provider illness

* 490,600 hospitalizations

* 34,200 deaths influenza

So I'm guessing would support nationwide mask mandate every year Oct Feb.

EDIT: looked 2017/2018 numbers. Holy smokes:

* 45 million influenza illnesses, 

* 21 million influenza medical visits, 

* 810,000 influenza hospitalizations, 

* 61,000 influenza deaths I'd suggest likely 95% people going half often.

Sure, that's possible, think see extremely low numbers cases per day months crowded city everyone going half much. essentially impossible social distance walking around NYC going out. trying argue argument's scientific tenets, I'm unsure whether Americans would morale accept message worded sich way. see ""goalposts"" move many times, they'll notice something's up.

That's everyone saying last year: ""Keep school closed rest school year; reopen next fall it'll good."" people would see ""shifting goalposts"", point obvious flaw argument. Can‚Äôt ‚Äúcriminal‚Äù negligence pass law prevent prosecution handling pandemic (taps forehead)... SARS easier quarantine, asymptomatic spread nearly issue. That's temperature checks would actually made big difference. Sorry I‚Äôm stupid but, would follow precautions you‚Äôre vaccinated? Combine cold dark Boston Winter, cases skyrocketing, work home work home routine. Yep! sucks thousands people get sick die January. Fair enough. good day. New York Milan saw hospitalized mortality skyrocket spring healthcare system overloaded. around 27% back then, compared 2%-5% now. sure much due demographic factors much due incapacity care, fatality rate absence quality medical care really scary. democratic president president congress voted in. every GOPer country fuck economy purpose next four years. Count it. know sarcastic directed you, say worked ER flu season particular sentiment makes ANGRY bc shows little people realize bad flu season hospital systems human body. social work haaaated ER calls flu season people would lining halls looking like death. people say ""its like flu"" I'm like even true would still nightmare new virus. Bump morbidity mortality *smidge* fucking disaster. hospitals turning ambulances away. mortality gets bad enough, see anti-maskers switch gears ""we nothing let run course"" ""oh nothing could've done"", ratfuck narrative avoid responsibility actively making things worse everyone. Mean Green? child matter

I never got sick kids. infect like 5x year sure.. family Dr, Canada, suggested Mid summer things approved use Canada end year. Now, DR may knowledge people, one decorate Drs City. reason Germany couldn‚Äôt staff bed wanted ? problem France government says it‚Äôs takes time train people. People aren‚Äôt really buying nobody knows what‚Äôs true anymore. you... SEX?! üò≤ First wave made 'restrictions'. Always wear mask public space, keep distance, gatherings ect. 

Here's shitty part - although police issuing fines left right, issuing restrictions speech form law. comes paying up, fines thrown judges.

We would go special 'Natural Disaster' mode enforce them, would mean paying lost profits various businesses. Especially 'foreign' businesses (or public media propaganda said).

Amid initial chaos, disregard restrictions members ruling party. masks, distancing, visiting graveyards closed public ect. 

Minister health spent bunch money respirators never arrived. money gone, minister resigned, investigation far I'm aware. Company provide respirators somehow connected ex-minister.

Then came presidential elections May/July. clusterfuck, president prime minister declaring COVID gone, everyone, especially old people, vote ect. They've elections slight margin old people. spent next couple months attacking LGBT community funding far-right nationalist groups Catholic Church.



When schools begged remote teaching September, new shitclown Education Minister declared would remote teaching.

About two weeks later happened huge spike cases unable control.

TL;DR government corrupt ineffective. Individual ministers parrott whatever party leaders tell long maintain political power. actions handling pandemic inconsistent lead distrust conspiracy theories. Typhoid Trump Wondering causes uptick.

A new strain virus
Catching guarantee immunity indefinely
More indoor gatherings due colder weather 
Pandemic ""fatigue""
Large gatherings people without masks 
Schools reopening
More people bars restaurants 
Pro, college high school sports resuming, higher capacity stadiums
People voting person

Just trying think... changed could lead increase? similar debugging software code getting different result previous test. change code, data, system, factors? sure worries appreciate disclaimer. 

Also speculating wildly. 

I wouldn‚Äôt surprised. COVID international news (I‚Äôm talking like December mid January - sure news mid Jan huge story yet) mom talking gnarly flu season was...how gnarly flu seasons happen time time, 2019-2020 especially bad. US people pay hospitals. Ain't gonna affect either. would fun watch wall street pirates jump windows though. 50,000 people died NJ NY since began less 800k confirmed cases. anybody really believe fatality rate area 6%?

Can't trust testing numbers, look hospitalizations god? Odin? covid. covid, necessarily severe enough warrant hospital bed isolated room. takes turn worse risk liability. Canada worst hit country SARS outside Asia although we're OK, we're really fine. Fortunately people taking fairly seriously we're 2nd wave cases roughly par Poland.

The government learned nothing. stockpiled PPE threw right COVID hit expired. government kept telling us risk exploding low months well telling us masks effective. Basically, place worked closed down, lot people would starve. Quarantine social isolation that-I've busting ass whole time nothing show except worse mental health, long I'm physically able function I'm gonna keep showing I'll never stop needing money long I'm alive. Wise decision. Children disease vectors, matter cherry-picked studies ""proven""; ever worked school, logic behind pretty obvious you.

Every school America follow footsteps Duterte way back around April May: *don't open schools vaccine*! potential benefit children's education instantaneously offset risk uncontrollable increases COVID-19 infection.

Glad see even one week election, teachers Chicago still letting politics get way science. Legitimately excited next week. kbbq booking work crew weird ups downs due restrictions easing restrictions.

Its fucking long man. light end tunnel. would say: Tremendous! best! dont know anyone whose life destroyed supposed police state. comparison, million people life ended prematurely due Covid im glad less 1000 fellow Australians. value lives fellow Aussies able go watch movie go bar staying home saves lives would 100 times over. honest, im NSW life pretty much like pre-covid minus standing apart lines grocery store. participants get infected report receive positive test? could inform quickly meet threshold data readouts mean, linked study....
Now study working people Tokyo, probably higher general population study. Regardless, experience Japan (and E Asia general) totally unlike Europe Americas, seems unlikely racist ‚Äògood Asian‚Äô rationale promoted story others likely reason. +airport bathrooms  pediatric ward... Warp Speed specifically USA----it's definitely national program .I'm necessarily saying that's good, is.  I'm still laughing. difficult prevent again. Everyone wear damn mask, keep social distance, stop fucking social gathering. blow mind much people put ""precious party"" fucking lives. Stay fuck home system running there's chance breath/coughs could get sucked house air filter slot concerned airborne transmission (many people aren't). environments pretty much separate. Polish hospital? see things outside hospital. curious: draw line? let government name public health? re-opened later European countries.

When people wake country.

We watched last time wondering we'd go way countries. did, worse. Oh know don‚Äôt. strategy now...is working.  close school next fall, know sucks, I'm college living home freshman year, next fall party, fun, wear masks, etc. Honestly I'm talking shit making assumptions. 

The truth truth found years decades later. speculation that, speculation. know originated feeling going world far longer understand.  Mask compliance indoor public spaces high even current wave. Kids went back school, parents probably went back work. Also, seems like started whole Europe time, might caused part something like weather daylight duration, dunno. think it‚Äôs clear global perspective countries really succeeding countries 1)locked hard managed eliminate ie New Zealand AU 2) countries instituted MASSIVE test trace system (most Asian countries). EU/US strategy managing restrictions/social distancing/masks isn‚Äôt working. probably inevitably, never really going work well. Second waves losers shithole countries /s doesn't. like 300 cases total two weeks traced back event. We're break 100k day. event even related. think safe hold big weddings month two? Try year two. doctors working confirmed Covid patients isolating staff, might ok except city, going work, possibly public transit contact people could get infected. Probably better sleep hospital. But, contact non-Covid patients non-Covid staff, disastrous policy. Better recruit replacement doctors areas, beef PPE use safety protocols hospital. large percentage staff getting infected via patient contact, something wrong safety measures. happening. doses January 2021.

Yeah, GLOBALLY. US. global production expectation, use across globe. Still seems sooner stated past. complaining, I‚Äôll take soon possible. Same! wear mask uphold social contract stupid study. least reported.

Choose random event. Choose counties cases increase event. Ignore others. Publish random event caused case increase.

I mean, worth looking evidence surges cases campaign stops. loose credibility cherry picking like that. ""It could sos *last christmas* !!"" thrown us already response ""well I'm trying ensure getting sick"" Obviously, tons factors.

In US, major city done best second-most population dense i. US, example (San Francisco). 

Seoul, SK really dense, they've done incredible job.

Meanwhile, Idaho Dakotas have, like, 4 people entire state COVID right now, lol. Apparently people, going store maskless throwing tantrum easier simply wearing mask. least aren‚Äôt American right now. president directly responsible 200,000 deaths try fire nations leading expert pandemic administration admitted, unapologetically, anything control pandemic. Poland. call bullshit.

So saying media reports comments people confirm bad situation false? tell stop using angel dust  wonder world learn vaccine finally available...

Probably sweep rug forget places guess. (God hope wrong) two make living bashing China since went back US, point interview ""Chinese experts"" Falun Gong sponsored channel (rofl). They're guys rely want unbiased information.

I certainly would take say enormous grain salt. enjoyed viewing serpentza content past fairly balanced, far I'm concerned lost credibility long time ago. Reuters says Latin America. 

However go WorldOMeters continents 3 regions reached 250,000

North America 344,000 deaths population 580 million

South America 290,000 deaths population 423 Million


Europe 251,000 deaths population 750 Million

Asia close 234,000 deaths population 4500 million

Africa Oceania less 50,000 them. probably even need say Midwest US. times reevaluate *Im* overreacting bc people keep family friend get together numbers KC tell crazy all. project warp speed website literally says goal 300M doses January 2021. isolated rest country policies place, international world based international airports closed. 

As far know beyond implemented anything anyone else hasn't? options. variety reasons. significant portion population still think virus hoax. Ah mais vous avez acc√®s l'eau des volcans cest cause de cela :D 
Ici dans l'est connaissance peut se r√©unisse 20 dans des apparts peut etre les ""jeunes"" (&lt;30ans) mais je ne les fr√©quentes pas trop list million negative things country, half things listed aren‚Äôt even true reddit popular opinion. You‚Äôve watching much American media. American fire department: ""Leeroy Jenkins!!! Fire needs fuel. Let's throw oil every floor!"" think they‚Äôll gradually go away year vaccine comes PiS right-wing, centrist. think per-person thing. Like, there's someone know... issue getting shots, conscious fear... frequently passes gets shots. came close watching someone else get one. conscious fear like really ""change attitude"" it. Chinese flu hyped propaganda. I'm quoting people making actual vaccines planning deployment. problems math, take them, me. saying would assume understand production timeline better I. doses across diff vaccines 


This Globally. US. doses need spread across globe. Oh, [thunderstorms hurricane-force winds](http://thevane.gawker.com/mondays-derecho-traveled-1-200-miles-from-minnesota-to-1717836690)...but land. Welp, thought would safe Kentucky puts damper That‚Äôs far conclusive evidence, also definitely really interesting. Surprised didn‚Äôt make bigger headlines. Thank sharing. 46%. seem likely all. 96,000 confirmed cases population 126 million people. would say England, seeds losing control virus sewn pretty much day things re-opened around July. there, ever matter time. clear anyone walking around eyes open wanton lack social distancing going cost us dear virus bit time get around.

That's say opened up, good countless businesses livelihoods, final analysis people country failed take due care face serious threat 2 3 months earlier led hospitals beings swamped verge able cope. 'Absolutely excuse.

It's going get worse well. opened later European countries we're trailing wake. 

We England lost control virus long back, France. I'm that. seems people act like they're wearing duct tape. issues wearing mask. I'm terribly handsome, wearing mask bumps five seven. ;-)  Appointments, surgeries treatment non-covid patients crucial. Canceling chemotherapy admission cancer patients good thing. pain ass chemo right Poland. People die cancer too. One friend's father get admitted hospital week ago cancer symptoms worsened. Coworker's cousin died months ago hospitals almost empty, waiting covid patients, take in. talking Poland btw. 40 grand lol. even get one year nursing home, trust me. 99 year old aunt one. bills insane place! Johnson Johnson Astrazeneca/Oxford allows confident enough December/January release talking now? talking reason? theory results supposed blinded. talking production vaccine something gain insight efficacy (such using side effects proxy predicting whether people got vaccine)? south rural areas theyre majority. anyone know happened people welded apartments?

I read way overblown, like sealing back entrances apt complexes effective contact tracing, bit sinophobia turned horror narrative. 

Who knows really, surprise anti-China rhetoric flying around (then still). Note: give hoot China discussing China, I'm saying is, lot anti-China sentiment, could easily believe sealing secondary entrances could turn welding people apartments. (as leave window something, too.) Winter June. That's solid eight months away. fine winter mean alarm know someone two arms got Covid. He's specialized surgery. intensive care emergency. Says things fucked. sure means El paso tho. Seems like came say he's doctor lol put masks finished right? Yes, is. Stay fuck home, moron. imagine stupid know brainwashed

 others, willfully ignorant engage sorts mental gymnastics justify something know would howling blood Obama it

many people literally cried ""impeach him"" 2 people died Ebola no, see irony, world totally relevant , Ebola starts E, Covid starts C, compare them?

 Also, Ebola stopped doctors health officials, Obama.  (you know ones Trump ignoring)  again, that's different.   President wore blue tie, makes different. talking about? best healthcare world. Ignoring costs. Can't wait Republicans state sue city leaders, Doolittle Abbott tell can't anything.
Maybe corrupt Attorney General Ken Paxton make open everything back up. response Texas government total shit show. going piss right people Karen. ‚ÄúRounding corner‚Äù


Sure Dumb question hasn‚Äôt government kept extra emergency beds/facilities running? Honestly send Chinese contractors made hospitals week here, we‚Äôre gonna need it. pissed educators everywhere spot skirt 2"" short recess somehow incapable enforcing masks.

Edit: clear here, right. However, reason there's financial bar schools suddenly acting like dress codes unenforceable . . . jesus christ. Consider poorly Wuhan performed... it‚Äôs really bad 

But use US benchmark guess well prepared? Problem unity, one area locked areas free over...we never able recover shit obviously. done whole country exception brave! Thank service, sir. Right. I'm saying? subsidy offering 200k per well, total well cost $8-$10 million 2-2.5% subsidy. know said ""few"", anecdotal examples really counter argument, I've seen here, acting quickly decisively seems done. 

Outbreaks nearby town led almost immediate quarantine measures, hospitals military field hospitals prepared well advance gone real stress. pretty high infection numbers definite pushback antimask people. 

So there's least places take stuff seriously. MSNBC Texas clear Trump win. talking Florida Pennsylvania toss though. I'm sure reddit going downvote anyway I'm going go ahead recommend voting 3rd party. throwing away vote. Every avalanche starts single snowflake. people voting mail? downside? Fair point, thanks! less optimistic timeline mass distribution effective vaccine. Teach ways. Meh doesnt look like antibodies provide long lasting immunity. vaccine could still take years matter Trump says. Looks like new normal really new normal. Good job. helping world hurting it. lot people can't afford financially though mad world. teachers need get shit together. Masks 6 feet common decency world. find Americans use argument little difficult understand. people streaming border Canada Mexico infecting others? blame international/interstate travel internal transmission rates roof? actually started June. figured they'd stop surprised October donation included antibody testing. Apparently, woman running drive saying there's interest continuing national study blood donations, likely keep getting extended bit literally saw many ppl partying cincinnati malolam past weekend :/ fact Woman, would use asterisk change Girl. Gee hope isn‚Äôt holiday coming next days weeks even would lead obstinate people congregating spreading unhappy educators set fail, well unhappy educators decided fail.

Edit downvoter: know actual teachers.  even tell people gtfo class without mask. example choice made. Won‚Äôt relieved magically disappears  I've 10ish Delta planes since March never felt unsafe. lot people take masks cheezits passed keep mine people done think going go route spring. cash would make process easier. suggest stopped ? It‚Äôs shame people treating Wolfe, I‚Äôm western pa I‚Äôm thankful did. Well we've closed borders too. virus came back. Even Atlantic Canada they've closed whole world virus came back.  You're.... even kidding you? strangest feeling mean literally. sad. governor pretty much us operating like nothing wrong. believe restaurants full capacity. Bars open right clubs open also. People longer fined wearing mandatory face coverings. area you‚Äôre going may operating little differently spread greater (as Sept). Last heard local restrictions hours operation yet don‚Äôt know governor allowing happen. I‚Äôm central Florida restaurants 25%, 50% others pretend don‚Äôt know C19 is. 

Do you‚Äôd normally do. Mask. Hand sanitizer. Stay away large crowds. Try go restaurants aren‚Äôt working full capacity. Patio seating taking food elsewhere.

In words, still least 2 months widespread vaccinations start. live here. many people think rules apply beyond ignorant incomprehensible. unethical - get past IRB? kids considered unable consent need parents consent legal purposes. what's purpose using children/teens specifically instead larger adult population vaccine trial? really disappointing see. course article talking ""brave"" children volunteer study instead critiquing Pfizer brazenly using children medical trials. 

&amp;#x200B;

don't get wrong - vaccine necessary get pandemic. need use GOOD participants study, like healthy, consenting adults, instead children need special protections research studies. yuck. I'm GA exactly best example fight pandemic wow went Florida last month people looked like 2 heads would walk places mask on. supposed stay 4 days cut short went back home one day beach. went coffee shop days taco place near beach saw absolutely zero masks.

Yea excuses soothing ego. encouragement presupposes Americans want something it. That, friend unfortunately case. want go away eagles, guns flags. might funniest thing I‚Äôve ever read Reddit.

Thought people started working retail last month prob 40% people don‚Äôt wear masks wear nose out. sucks mean expect state? Decent people concern public health? HAHAHAHAHAHA Yeah power week, chill brother's place. Lost food. Fuckin pissed man. Well it‚Äôs enforced stores else won‚Äôt let in. personally don‚Äôt get grocery store anymore though, curbside now. Beyond though anytime drive pass parks shops usually see 30% people wearing one, would bit higher lot people nose thing. 

Also, people really bad social distancing inside buildings, it‚Äôs worst. exactly backup, lt gov, former far right radio host Dan Patrick regularly goes foxnews says things like ‚Äúseniors prepared die maintain way life, important thing living.‚Äù  American healthcare fucking joke talking about.? understand bitching, forget I'm wearing mask sometimes. I'll get home grocery shopping, put everything away, go bathroom see mask, remember take off. mask laws France right now? public transportation, or? control you. away school, stay there. still living home, ask wills place case die.

Vaccinated mean can't get carry virus, means body's immune response prepped battle it.

You still catch pass others. Eventually everyone base level ability fight virus that's less worry point take time.

Students required wear masks school, hand sanitiser send home policy students slightly ill. 

I cannot imagine would feeling worked US. Thanks. That's gross. Right NJ employers let come work unless flu shot. addition even nurses come place business administer vaccines there. 

I really see problem vaccinating large amount people short period time. Yes started Phaze 3 end August - 2 safety effectiveness small scale started Way earlier year.  think likely understanding expect phaze 3 based phaze 1 phaze 2. Pretty sure drug manufactures profit. university read begining summer, going share vaccine countries/manufactures increase costs. presumptuous. wife high profile job isn‚Äôt shit delay throw someone else onto count ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù Covid.

You‚Äôve replied nothing. You‚Äôve proven trash. I‚Äôve said need say arguments. that‚Äôs left make understand you‚Äôre trash. Carolina Shag state dance South Carolina. It‚Äôs essentially happens dance 1940s jitterbug steps 1960s beach boardwalk music. thing (I used lot vintage dances), it‚Äôs fun it‚Äôs great way old folks get exercise socialize. literally never ""attacked"" you. Sigh okay I'll it... cos I'm curious (and bored lol) gimme hours I'll get back ya. Obviously relying goodwill people worked out. want things get like this, perhaps next time choose TV personality actual politician, we'll choose politician. sit suffer consequences electing outright idiot protect country global pandemic. America never national mandate though? fact states removed mask mandates completely. üòÄ  think flip side though also adenovirus-vector ones around longer used/studied widely, right? 

And flip side flip side mRNA vaccine is, you‚Äôve noted, extremely easy mass produce, also cheaper could also theoretically used virus, including HIV.

But flip side flip side flip side mRNA vaccine never approved - though Moderna close cytomegalovirus vaccine COVID struck. keep protesting Covid streets? helps? Sounds like normal flu. Hospitals fill way every year. Nothing fear. What's that? normal significantly worse flu? Nah. can't be. /s Glad hear! hard though. Mental health important, especially something like this! safe important. hard balance. Take care dude. I'm Texas would believe many people wearing masks here. masks ran bakery, small business dentist's office. Even governor mandated masks, teeth city leaders said going enforce it. nonsense efficient national lockdown virtually impossible. Stop facty stuff. like feelings. Like ‚ÄúI feel like would get Trump Virus‚Äù. Unironically slave morality. Today worse yesterday, day that, day that, day that, day that... comparing death rate worst death rate past year *really* best way looking things? Great long better WORST EVER guess we're cool?

Not mention fact looking things ""is getting better worse"" still kind nonsense. *always* getting worse. rate worseness changing. 1000 people dying preventable disease makes world worse. 3000 people dying preventable disease makes world worse. 3000 die one day 1000 die next day still getting worse every day, world becoming worse worse place. rate getting worse slightly less.

It's like break leg one day, next day break toe, toe breaking make life better worse? still made life worse, made life less worse yesterday. overall broken toe *and* broken leg, still worse position beforehand. family/friends constantly lying trying wear act like them.

This worst. think makes feel better reassures need feeling little bit fear guilt experience actions. bullshit conspiracy spread worldwide. 100+ cases horrible. means small relaxation contact tracing, distancing mask wearing blow second wave.

Exponential growth scary.

Australia right way, way pre-vaccine. Everything else cope understanding simple concept exponential growth people learned high school. Please stop nonsense. [Each ""spike"" graph wave  

US 3rd wave right now. First wave April, 2nd July 3rd right now. argue possibly second wave, since April one ""that big"", definitely first wave. Rt.live uses made algorithm guess R values state. currently shows 49/50 states lied said showed 50 states.

Reality serious enough need mislead make look even serious. Came say this. last 20 years, one ever asked status seeking form medical service including getting vaccinated.  elected Andrew Gillum, bunch idiots. People bussinesses. survive this. People work sacked.

The thing point people stop going anyway get full economic activity lock down. People still know dangerous virus  Everybody Reddit thinks live movie Even hairstylist livelihood depends cutting hair agree you. get right bitter cutting bangs pandemic. perspective however, salon open since mid May 1 stylist caught know. also asymptomatic. really sure salons masking/sanitation procedures big drivers spread tbh. actually cares humans. 38k 52k 56% increase? how? 
We treatments occasionally barely rise level statistical significance. cure.  cure would obvious. still remember Europe taking piss America poorly.

Never claim victory prematurely. Thanks correction!  reinfections either extremely rare mostly asymptomatic  Really? article somewhere could check out? Also, zero Celsius Fahrenheit? Maybe it‚Äôs time stop pretended can‚Äôt, start thing can‚Äôt do, longer pretend can. fair point, morons use survival rate argue, especially considering contagious is, harm people immune systems, asthmatic, underlying conditions etc. Lady behind queue today kept inching towards makes queue go faster. Damn lady, we're British, good this! No, soon able tell me.

Because they‚Äôre dead coronavirus. questioning validity information source incivility change name sub r/snowflake. Cant discuss shit feelings hurt time. dude idiot, probably lingering issues. Oh well, take seriously either. Fuck him. radical left radical right bad sound radicalized. know thanks Kay Even Coronavirus subreddit? Usually posts downvoted heavily unless there's bridgading anti-mask crowd? think that? think people don‚Äôt want vaccine? (Genuine question. don‚Äôt know people react.) suppose maybe good bad things happening time? Like, US states spiking real hard right couple vaccines also look promising. Things nuanced. Stop blaming news reporting news. agree completely worth, I've saying months opened quickly back May early June, saying Ruby Princess big fuck quarantine, less that.
The thing I'll add ridiculous national roadmap states signed onto made allowances differing circumstances, expected follow Andrews intense pressure conform states, last weeks.
But still call. Yeah right! definitely go back last resort (like go back city something) can't home work I'm make ""eviscerating come backs."" regarding spike upward trends, another force causing people social distancing, lack masks, close proximity (e.g. cold outside, eat indoors restaurants), people giving up? words, virus adapted evolved colder weather? literally incapable meeting arguments go character instead?

Again, many times repeat this.

All reasonable goals success met.
The hospitals never overburdened. economy survived, second wave dulled. trump's executive orders now? Oh, yeah. Finding way fire Dr. Fauci! widely understandable way convey data visualization. saying we're still first wave visually implies never significantly lowered spread. look US new cases appears way. flat periods, real separation waves valleys, keeps going up. question you. chance friend infectious meet up. responsible thing would get test asap, isolate results come through. Yes hospitals empty April, lots Covid patients one else dared go hospital routine surgery. postponed lot operations backtracked, little late though.

But especially wondering capacity staff beds Germany. France fewer beds adding beds would require additional specialized staff, can‚Äôt find reasons. yes virgins, cares lmao. happy theyre baby, nice thing :)  Even cases drop back 200, would still thousands active cases within community. likely know care walking around though nothing wrong. It'd still risky going gym 200 daily cases. careful. Keep using home gym long can. buy that.

Don't buy what? changed tune end March? right, \~72 never disagreed telling people initially I'm sure point comment is. told truth, course. done sooner? course. post timeline. gotta admit catchy term. like grown adults sub actively advise depressed teens kill themselves. Really best people reddit right there. üëç Antivaxxers  threat ending COVID. millions people world able get even wanted are.  Thanksgiving coming up, millions people country seem think ignore virus everything OK

""People sick stay home. Fortunately, family sick!"" 2022 actually even worse republicans senate year is, going number seats defense Since US system profit driven, raise prices full? Agreed. irritating anytime someone brings administration pivots spins everything economy. eyes thing counts money Trump said would win. would get tired winning would win much... think we're tired winning now. think need win every category. hey... Kept campaign promise. Ah, us fooled first half I'm gonna lie. bias showing. ""But get nails done hang friends club?"" People dying hospital beds left city, think gym? happens get car accident way there? think magically make room you? I'm east coast people also drive like fucking assholes. noticed getting worse since pandemic? thought less traffic would great, people driving around douchey reckless ever here. I'm 51% sure sarcasm? yeah, Poe's Law action right there. don‚Äôt care background is.... Indeed, talked lot less lately they're bit behind mRNA vaccines especially temporary halt trials. people threat. long understand concept social distancing.  accurate representation deadly virus actually is. first started tracking virus, cfr around 10%, lead mass hysteria. want cause mass panic, stick cfr. tested positive virus, would think 2% chance living .3%? No, agree. Intent important. donate intent get free test, potentially endangering patients. fuck fools throughout US? We're abiding mask wearing requirements, social distancing, stay home work school, etc fuckers filling hospital beds dumb asses. Wall St almost completely decoupled Main St Irony. wonder would mean international travel. Like, everywhere else US gets control, what? one accept travellers US? I'm still convinced ""losing"" part master's strategy. Trump peacefully wins managed COVID reasonable way chaotic. Trump completely mismanaged COVID, loses, tries generate Constitutional crisis manipulation 2 3 branches government? That's LOT chaos.  Vaccines living. Gotta survive first. thinking thing.

Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll see conspiracy keep voting. Russia, Italy Iran or... hope everyone texas bears mind shit happened fucking vote damn authoritarian Trump stop people make individual decisions! sure even would get people believe. guy bar tonight tell hoax. Meanwhile, wife says daughter nurse real terrifying. understand think fake family member dealing directly. need cheap art deco things TONIGHT Would say regardless intent, results end blood donated parties get wanted? Hmmm.

You bet places go lock hospitals full.

Melbourne lock months without hospitals full.

My comments numbers prove point, illustrate even far, far, far fewer cases deaths, lock downs still happening long hospitals overwhelmed. People need eat. Restaurants essential. food pantry, stay home. last option taco bell, wear mask go. point is, 95% people staying home 5% going restaurants, cases plummet hospitals treat heart attack, car crash, cancer patients again. Agreed. foresee run room heaters deplete supplies. Except that's experience. happen. 

Our leaders told us truth public health officer told us June every pandemic second wave prepare respatory season.It's second wave. 

Trump minions said virus disappear hasn't. november 3rd Even around people? curious American numbers. mind cannot accept Trump extension wrong. Thus, yes, virus there, something coronavirus. Otherwise entire world view ego destroyed. It‚Äôs way acknowledging truth without confronting it. Conservatives believing god... man laughed hard long time. believe god. states building field hospitals laughs? idiot skeptic forced read actual facts getting excited post  *cue beginning kenan kell theme song* doesn‚Äôt get cold France? right? Congratulations Victoria easing restrictions midnight tomorrow!! zero local cases since like end march airport cluster.

we 339 international cases, 131 close contact cases, 12 interstate cases 9 community cases. 

It's honestly strange total freedom months watching world burn time. Best feeling cleaning glasses finally notice they're dirty. life becomes ""HD"" lol. Perspicuous. date, one word example irony found. Person asks question uses guy, fairly informal. absurd respond gendered equally casual term fake turning corner... much getting paid this? know coming days watching many turn symptomatic. Eventually, may get sick happening dragging us slowly, maybe we'll finally act decisively it. not. Probably not, think people would get tired constant shit. Carry-out only, order via delivery service.

 Really happened stimulus package could subsidize loans small businesses weather pandemic, interest rates broken later - sort stimulus save large banks financial institutions reason. turned 33 july iam super ashamed old ppl believing conspiracy theories etc. Even peers / friends (ages 25-35) dont even care still Facebook sharing conspiracies bullshit... yeah iam Czech republic even youth still far behind everything.

That 3 days ago. I'm still thrown ominous use **The**. could hear capitalization voice. number Swine Flu infections estimate. probably never know accurate estimate was, would impossible compare Covid. 

TBH, don‚Äôt even remember it. That‚Äôs little impact had. said many one billion got infected, seems completely ridiculous me. One seven humans planet got specific flu strain one year? cannot remember last time got flu maybe I‚Äôm atypical. issuing order hospitals capacity, election. Jesus Christ. everything Trump. Let's assume true. vaccine available mass quantities general public least 4 6 months. Stay clean wear God damm mask people!! Wave subsequent viruspread make benefit US would handled mask wearing, apolitically? looked track record winter went would see Australia fared well winter. Without living would hard see what‚Äôs happening. Testing encouraged anyone symptoms sewage tested weed unknown cases. keep top resurgence next winter definitely guaranteed. Possible, yes, sure thing. mean time live life close normal. haven‚Äôt community spread month case dealt quickly. 

Btw winter mild country compared northern hemisphere.  used ground services one air medical bases Phoenix; dedicated units neonatal transports airport hospital, example, need staffed 24/7. super-cushy gig takes lot seniority get there. filling in.

The base several *thousand* square feet, exercise room. Air medical types can't extra weight, (last heard) offered bonuses stay trim; get dismissed weigh much. full kitchen, excellent bunk rooms. Huge reading/TV room. Really nice gig.

The first time filling in, know anyone there; so, enough food shift, regular partner would usually grab something store restaurant. luck evening; so, driving back dropping patient, asked could stop In-n-Out could grab food. ""They close 1 AM,"" told, corrected them: Friday Saturday night close 1:30. tapped face clock: 1:20 AM. In-n-Out two blocks away.

I bit anxious, know crew, thought they'd shake heads, ""Dude, bring enough food? Dummy."" Instead, crewman passenger seat asked crewmates cab, ""Hey, anyone want In-n-Out?"" Fuck, yeah, do. Suuuper nice crew, really friendly people.

I've always liked working air crews, I've worked nurses ride ambo like them, know why. Sometimes we'd serve transport ""routine"" air flights arrive airport, get flown airport, flight crew would ask us stop Chipotle whatever, grab food. Fine me, get paid hour! we'd pick food pilot pilots, too. flight crews really surprised one us would sit back them; reason, crews standoffish, they'd sit front, flight crew back.

I always *loved* talking flight crew, I'd run several time time again, I'd jokingly refer state originally, Texas sweet blonde woman delightful, flew Wyoming (whom never saw again), swapped hydroponics tips New Mexico couple times. Texas really nice, complaining headache shift one night, partner went convenience store grub going back airport, came back Tylenol me.

I miss working flight crews. I've always thought highly them. pilots- holy shit. amazing. Every school needs campus learning. fucking simple. Year year? mean something else wrote article, someone admitting issue lot longer year?

For year year comparison would think need least 2 3 years compare. one hit us 2012. everything went black genuinely looked like tornado way wind picked second. terrifying. 

I've never seen much damage saw driving around neighborhood next day. downed trees power lines everywhere. places yes - Melbourne done this. went single digit daily new cases high 700 two months ago. Stage 4 lockdowns called it, can‚Äôt leave house except food medical. Yesterday first day zero new cases. get fucking dilaudid! Dude acts like he's special club used powerful hallucinogen it...[checks notes] made hallucinate powerfully. fair blood drives done poor job letting people know running blood drive. recent one saw sign church drive way work saying blood drive till 10a-4p drove work morning. ordered pizza picked saw flyer asked guy behind counter went said girl dropped around 11am day. thing months earlier town hall, signs flyers go opens. could start like week people would donate wait flu season fully kick in. thought 75,000 cases day US bad? Strap hold fuck Good. sooner invasive species gets overshoot path sooner equilibrium reached. Lol tell certain right gonna stick long term. Id essentially willing exactly would people way think. 

Id go back life die die. people putting effort solutions seem within grasp, take away watch house cards crumbles. Covid19 would barely ding human population large picture Id gladly take deal faced choice half 10% global population That's definition one paper came quantitative analysis. That's take anyway since paper cite sources definition. Isnt battleground state? surprise given irrational could Please remove stick ass someone hit head it. lot protection from.these types masks static charge binds virus particles become less effective quickly days. Sure, sure. That's there's literally cottage industry [medical tourists come USA care](http://www.mymedholiday.com/country/united-states). guys declare estimated tourists come every year. get tiresome, much news life returned normality China (with reasonable precautions) people refuse believe it. 

You may asking general curiosity part comments showing complete ignorance worse revel ignorance, people say ""bullshit"" people may actually know China try help understand situation completely falls deaf ears really want know anything might upset preconceived biases. 

So yeah, downvote tired explaining people want truth. like racists? likely case. Still wished nations ain't selfish. end stab foot so. florida, everyone know back florida partying hard pre pandemic.   rounded many corners back started March!  mean? people infectious know it, perfectly healthy donate. Probably sue make sure bars open MUST 110% capacity 24/7 shut down.. honest, lot people lie. I'm sure legal ramifications are. But, helps fill supply. So, i'm sure think.  Ha ha ha yeah. like previous 8 months. 226 active cases whole country. quarantine half population months covid free. Texans fleeing Texas year East-Northeast bound. Californians fled Texas, apocalypse. *Shrugs*

(I probably karma rapid-reply, live AR I've seen it. Fyi.) Yeah, combined total actual number cases, look like covid, bucket confirmed cases list. We've given trying baby.

We're putting money towards funding early retirement wife's mother, go back work.

She several extreme high risk categories... gets it, likely survive.

Count one less birth.

We alone. Damn you!!!! Naw kidding. keep alt-right nonsense minimum, totally come house pie. hope well. Everyone worried Halloween, Christmas going suck kids understand why. Hopefully next year better. local blood bank explicitly states dont covid antibody testing donations, I'm guessing varies based are. people go expecting that...make sure check local place.  worries mate. Thanks changing it! Jesus Christ, sub hates anyone literally anything isn‚Äôt sitting home day! saw someone mentioning weren‚Äôt sure could buy certain deodorant Welsh fire-breaker replies proceeded berate wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúessential‚Äù die time relatively easily avoidable reasons.

For example. Western Australia locked cases 0 Australian state black last quarter. cases controlled, could go back normal, border control. thing happened country wide businesses able operate nearly normal. Except Victoria hard lockdown hit 0 new cases day today. Technically, rounder corners now. nicest corners. countries, WISH corners. much testing, need many coroners- mean corners. Good luck. meet weight requirement, maybe eat enough cookies... definitely catch eyes. One study estimated covering eyes goggles added 11% protection mask. doubt plain eye glasses provides benefit. Unfortunately, USA way large unhinged anything effective vaccine helps us. checked link posted it‚Äôs like common across US last spring. Businesses simply encouraged close restaurants, salons, tattoo parlors stay open. Basically imagine spring lot non-essential business staying open. Sounds lot like Sweden tbh. smoke screen? paper didn‚Äôt draw assumptions, yes. New Mexico real bad You‚Äôre accounting people weren‚Äôt tested nevertheless infected. IFR anywhere 0.6 1.1 percent, means deaths would 336,000 616,000 56 million americans become infected Yes, Florida New York similar amount large metropolitan counties. would make sense two states experience similar unemployment numbers, according information. Additionally, Florida‚Äôs economy based strongly tourism, conditions, lead greater unemployment state like New York, relies white-collar finance banking. already happened countries. Mexico Costa Rica reported least day % rate 45% Mexicans allowed US since March, Americans hand could crossed Mexico along, bringing shit wherever go (not all, obviously, know type does). Realistically, no. Six months? live Texas bars, ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù weeks. like people think western countries countries world, Australia opens borders COVID-free mostly free countries, we'll like NZ nobody else.

There bunch countries could safely open borders shortly, America/Europe world. Enjoy vacation! temperature reading mouth accurate. healthy enough donate, going COVID. *weeps American* France do? That's thought too. lies. live Iowa, hotbed right now. parents live like normal. Restaurants, church, parties. maskless. They're exact people contact traced. nothing. seen since spring. I‚Äôm sorry way are. true. coaching 7-8yr olds teams wear masks all, one time coach said, ""wow I'm surprised able get wear masks!""


Like, they're fucking kids, set example tell it. Adults really pathetic. still back person school I'm comfortable knowing kids behave correctly. may want sit this, Orangemanbad exactly popular person El Paso. El pasoan here. fucking way I'm gonna follow stupid ass mandate ahahaha. Ain't nobody gonna follow haven‚Äôt using history guide far happened come across story. wanted say, hope get better sorry going this. That's point, Larger hospitals full patients already, surge excess patients result beds available anyone new (COVID19 related not). They'll deal to, stresses system people may die due lack proper care overburdened system. Biden Trump right? lack knowledge regarding current events intentional? Spring people higher means. June common folk. Thank posting this.

These long term health problems COVID (both organ damage neurological effects) need attention. many people erroneously treat binary ""you either die fully recover"". there's lot problematic morbidity two outcomes, debilitating. really willing inflict long term health problems potentially millions people? I‚Äôm even sure requires conspiracy thinking point. several days eye popping numbers leading weekend and, honestly, nobody seems care weren‚Äôt death numbers. state reported 0 deaths today low hospital ICU numbers. longer goes, less weekend reporting is. numbers catch week. fact case numbers still high alarming means it‚Äôs actually much higher. Gonna interesting week. exceptions that, look happened Costa Rica.

We put soft lockdown 14 cases (total). Many restrictions place. worked, \~600 total cases 1 3 cases per day. never mass testing, political tension Nicaragua border. government started lifting measures. took 3 weeks people parties bring surge can't control. went 600 cases 100K 5 months (In country 5 million people).

On per capita basis, reporting similar numbers US, yet government gave measures. higher chance getting hit car glasses getting fogged masks. [other group] can't possibly sympathetic [my group] know that! *Have glasses corona.   
ü§ì hometown. Hate we‚Äôre national news everyone bc people ‚Äúno te pasa nada‚Äù attitude it‚Äôs late. Great. afford give away people need help, secure knowledge they‚Äôll soaked demand abroad without causing inflation. It‚Äôs problem Residents Florida don‚Äôt need want people ‚Äúescaping‚Äù potentially spreading virus, taxing health system snowbirds. It‚Äôs common sense. sound like entitled baby. really suggest everyone play plague inc, yet. love people complain ‚ÄúParisians/the French rude‚Äù, it‚Äôs people telling rude unfriendly visiting city surprised locals don‚Äôt like that. ""Rationing care"" nice way say ""triage.""

They're gonna start sending people home die.

What shame observing countries like Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, New Zealand clearly shown method model central government apply order control virus manageable level.

There way avoid this.

This inevitable.

Every nation hit hard.

There lessons learn.

There nothing could done.

There warnings could heeded.

There advice could followed.

There cultural practices could emulated.

There plans place could implemented.

Everyone involved done great job.

We proud ourselves. Depends many potential dem. voters district. Anything 23.8%, polls closed. kissing anyone's cheeks since February March France though. handshakes. However objectively true Sweden's strategy resulted dramatically higher death toll Scandinavian county, neighbor Germany. What's smoke screen it? no, ""wait till over"" condemning victims unnecessarily. wait. Fix behavior now.

And I'll keep sucking slimy downvotes somebody needs advocate victims rampantly stupid public health policies. Covid kill even infecting directly. people lose jobs possibility get better healthcare others diseases boost mortality strokes, heart failure since people less likely able get treated pandemic.  thats cool See [El random YouTube comments say hospitals empty hoax! sarcastic young people able whatever minor restrictions country explain leftist governments world also bad covid outbreaks? Singapore here, concur. Like korea, people entering militant quarantine tested covid. daily cases, exception imports, 0-4. Though strict social distancing measures, fear going pretty much nil. That's kind freedom people places 'more freedom!!! \‚óã/' understand. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

That said watching daily cases diligently sign jump, personally going back hiding. know exponential growth would coming 14 days? speak multiple languages well unlike idiot Americans struggle speak English anyone know still true one allowed donate they've mononucleosis? Thanks. Oh I've already China (only 3 weeks though). would extended stay COVID control rest world.

I probably try check countries - South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, maybe Vietnam Taiwan. count separate category called 'asymptomatic carrier'. start show symptoms immediately reclassified confirmed case. left says Trump invested, right says Fauci invested it. I'm sure there's evidence support either claim. I'm looking forward Governor Dumbass blocking El paso like blocked mask requirements back April. ""i take responsibility all"". Im still charge Trying comment removed incivility: TIL esteemed leader USA makes claim never beer. 2 cases China reported Oct. 20. 


26 cases imported China reported S. Korea total.

China screened departing territory extremely well beginning. situation China seems stabilized moment. election postponed. people vote? exception? agree, school system problem. Italy, Spain, Greece, Argentina went things, still could go funerals ecc. didn‚Äôt amount success.

1. many cases community initiated restrictions?

2. comprehensive restrictions?

3. well community comply restrictions?

Not convinced remote helpful virus significant beachhead community. github? hope see it. old/sick/health care worker? not, LOL thinking shot arm wouldn‚Äôt moral give vaccine works kill many process Yeah unless you‚Äôre white male born US soil. 20 days state Colorado started deconstruct two alternate care sites built height COVID-19 course. university resumed in-person classes, I'd resign next day.

So almost 6 years higher average across sexes, use google smartass. public health response refuses acknowledge human behavior designed fail. let blame normal people get away job. They're supposed work society reduce death, get confrontational half act shocked half gets mad. mom rigged special pouch could cocktails. Well seem following instructions anyways given case counts. Sure, hospitalizations started rising again. sharply start, spiral control fast. least bad; who's worse? Tough call, that's like trying compare apples oranges. DENVER ‚Äî city Denver Monday alluded another stay-at-home order saying, ""what we're working,"" referring city's growing number COVID-19 cases.¬†

""We better,"" city said tweet. ""Wear mask, maintain social distancing wash hands.""                                                                 


The news comes Colorado's seven-day, moving average positivity rate 6.4% ‚Äì state's preferred 5% threshold.

Positivity number tests come back COVID-19 result. 10% could indicator enough testing done people likely COVID getting tested. World Health Organization recommended May 2020 positivity rate even lower, 5%, contain virus.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis September announced COVID-19 dial establishes restriction framework counties based metrics like positivity rate hospital capacity.

Counties use dial guide apply enter one five phases outline restrictions aimed contain spread novel coronavirus. Counties move back forth levels based metrics.

According state's COVID-19 Dashboard, Denver's status listed ""Safer-At-Home, Level 2: Concern.""

Earlier October, City &amp; County Denver made requirement wear face masks certain outdoor public settings well reduced gathering limits 10 five people.

‚ÄúWe are, county, brimming edge crisis could endanger individuals‚Äô health well damage economy,‚Äù Denver Mayor Michael Hancock said Oct. 16 virtual news conference announcing two new public health orders. Nonsense.

Nations reacted quickly got good results.

Nations slow react bad results.

Nations called hoax and/or called herd immunity got exceptionally bad results.

Give credit due.  Learn failure.  Excuses cut it. People forget whole April lockdown for. prepare surely coming winter. seeing surge world-wide fate would it. people thinking 2nd 3rd wave politicians suggest community spread pops pleases. contrary, virus entrenched communities country. take colder colder weather make transmission easier easier. States give reports everyday, national level take brake. Also, like beggining. startedafter guy reporting taken day like 4 months (not even sick covid). Spain, healthcare hands state, goverment. Yes. Making martyr acting like holier everyone else apparently discovered year infectious diseases exist give impression superiority complex. Lol airlines middle seats available while. Source: flying around country throughout entire pandemic. here. grateful avoided grocery store mayhem. thing week pre-US elections. Rinderpest (cattle plague) also eradicated. eradicating disease hard; disease also needs target narrow range species. Smallpox, far know, infect species besides humans. Rinderpest targeted even-toed ungulates, highly potent vaccine discovered it. 

Covid-19, hand, infects wide variety animals. Dogs, cats, bats, rodents primates susceptible. Even animals play big role spread virus currently, outbreaks would keep cropping due animal-human transmission even temporarily eradicated every living human. parents, grandparents close family get vaccines really care anymore. take necessarily precautions them. Given Americans masks social distancing + POTUS acting common sense find weird USA fares better Europe.  normally second wave biggest followed smaller third wave historically doubt going fully apply situation vaccines way.

This likely Spanish flu trajectory. course asymptomatic patients taking ICU beds. willing give liberties ancestors fought hard? Well flippant reply would would unlikely add OP's child domestic violence figures. serious note course ways would difficult ridden out. Although grandparents missing grand kids feature too. Saying island nothing sounds odd. It‚Äôs spreading Us, it‚Äôs spreading world pretty much uncontrolled. don‚Äôt think 90% countries incompetent politicians. Nationalistic, ultra-right wing government asking help EU general Germany particular - two political entities spent years shitting on? Fat chance.

LOL absolutely point. lot large chain stores sell pretty much everything danger tape everything werent allowed sell. bizarre. think point encourage people buy food leave. still super silly. two facts here, get mixed up.

1. VIC currently COVID-free
2. VIC covid-free, re-introduction continue threat.

Neither imply can't COVID-free. time get vaccine, COVID Victoria. inevitable remain community. sense fact life could re-introduced, never leave. wear masks? Downvote day, I've working data since day 1 this, plague compare influenza deaths, included deaths complications accompanying diseases ( attributed influenza part, covid covid) - find much deadly influenza least point need lock year. Jelly open South Australia 17 people arrived NZ. think hard enforce. Yeah, much likely get high viral load leading worse outcome. it‚Äôs cloth wash every day. Example, go Walmart petco Monday, don‚Äôt wash between. BUT, wash mask Thursday go work. even ignore anti-vaxxers, toughness virus also taken account? mean way survives long period time surfaces transmission household pets.

I clue something normal viruses. No, vaccines treatments become available several months. sociopathic let things rip kill hundreds thousands unnecessarily point. HFR demonstrably improved time. getting infected gotten infected March scenario hospitals overrun like El Paso, fewer survive. stage information anecdotal. takes time potential side effects develop, detected, pattern established, researched, confirmed actual vaccine. 

Normally takes anywhere 5 10 years fully develop vaccine. 

This moving lighting speed sample sizes (volunteers) massive spread practically continents. takes time data generated processed. Singapore island. local measures help without quarantine people arriving infected countries. European countries opened borders successfully dealing first wave, gave trying. UK US never even started trying. live El Paso. one wearing mask. :( sure it‚Äôs different places, city ambulances run fire department. I'm UK , free suspect. excuse situation whatsoever?? recorded 25 new cases June 20, household contacts one another. remember day vividly do? Ease restrictions June 22 allowing Gyms return. One week getting case numbers 70s.  


It screamingly obvious DHHS long shot ended indecisive, arrogant thinking would past cost us dearly, 800 lives lost, 18,000 infected lockdown lasted 3.5 months.  


It really matter timing Ruby Princess disaster, matters shit hits fan put fucking handbrake situation took far long take decisive action cost us big time. end day Gladys 800+ dead watch Dan come bad luck timing, comes DHHS Vic Government massively letting us May June. basing what? like... Let's real, telling people wait full vaccine rollout going effective telling people eat moderation get 30-45 minutes sunlight day simply lol Seriously? unsubstantiated Reddit post makes feel better? believe degree. least anyway. Mental health affected many people permanently. Seeing little people still bother remaining contact aren‚Äôt going stay isolated, seeing little fellow man cares neighbor, governmental distrust levels,job dissatisfaction (employers forcing people showing covid symptoms high risk individuals continue working), etc. won‚Äôt recover magically vaccine. see people using masks sanitizer publicly even believe germaphobes. Us centric answer btw that‚Äôs 2 cents dont know. RKI publishes testing data weekly sitrep tue wed. RKI sitreps also available English. Right now, curfew, there‚Äôs really many restrictions. Early voting started earlier month and, least location went to, socially distanced provided disinfecting wipes qtip press screen with. you‚Äôve contact with

Also, avoid this! that‚Äôs problem, certain classes people/jobs/businesses expected bear vastly costs others. classes among least able bear cost, most. think still job asked make destitute would willing give up, say, 30% income family lost theirs, would entitled huffy small business owners desperate stay afloat. 

The US social infrastructure either force mass transfers resources haves have-nots adopt draconian measures like trapping people apartments forced quarantine. Attempts implement going met widespread civil disobedience, matter infection numbers are. 

I don‚Äôt know answer guess another round widespread mandatory business closures end harm good. 

Ideally would make targeted limitation large indoor gatherings try provide direct economic assistance allow left without way make living survive. don‚Äôt see make happen. No, need show evidence back stupid ideas. country, government agencies news organisation backs idiotic views. hey let worry you. mean, depending desperation hospital, either 36hr 48hr work week, 3 4 shifts per week, respectively. refuse even look 48hr work week, offering 36. I've beating recruiters inboxes stick *months*. bedside RNs, 36hrs/wk (3 shifts) standard.

I rode spring summer contract small town CO, insanely fortunate incidence rates, considering dumb people act. thought going town TX amount money makes skin crawl. still leaning towards vaccines needing booster 3 months later? full year looking likely? meteor headed earth rather Donald Trump decide course action, NASA? would like see experts actually saying, state premier 2 hour long press conferences every day last 100 days lockdown answering questions. Nobody taking silly chances, dont worry. may go extinct- don‚Äôt know long effect induced (this may twice yearly shot minimum) figured exactly virus came from. could mutation new strain need develop new vaccines like flu. still haven‚Äôt eradicated polio unfortunately example. see shutting clothing stores exclusively sell clothes, purpose able buy clothes books part grocery store? EU citizens: problem old people. I'm 70+. Pandemic me, back normal.

EU governments: People dying hospital corridors, okay. Economy important, take measures. 

Asian people: disease around. Better careful common sense. 

Asian governments: Economy important, suppress disease people work produce consume without huge problems. take measures, stick rules enforce them. Indeed plans distribute several million doses december countries alreday acquired them. However, expected enough fot health professionals extremely vulnerable groups. Extensive vaccination apparently expected l earlier spring 2021... Agreed. second approved rolled Europe, Americans it. \*Laughs, Points Finger, Australian\* contrary, regional tourism actually booming. know Maleny Queensland barely keeping demand. happening parts Australia international tourists seldom visit Aussies usually skip favour overseas interstate. teach high school close 2000 students. far, we've 5 cases among students 2 among staff. None caught school though, cases friends families.

I think we're ok far we're point need close schools yet. hydroalcoolique gel dispensors every room, students teachers clean hands every time enter room (at least every two hours). We're wearing masks time, except eating. case, students respected social distance outside school quarantined week.

The thing make sense sanitary protocol PE require kids wear masks. Half seniors miss week classes case class wearing masks PE. None got sick, luckily.

I see kids kissing see shaking hands lot unfortunately. best stop them! So...with currently happening Europe, safe say America bad job handling covid left claims?

Not trying political, I‚Äôm curious...haven‚Äôt thread looking covid-related news  plummeting international reputation

Gee, wonder why. Australia isn‚Äôt going back normal. states community transmission living relatively normal, it‚Äôs normal. one, can‚Äôt travel overseas even freely within states Furthermore, sooner virus eliminated, quicker economy return normal - NZ China. Fixing Corona fixes economy. fixing Corona inevitably lead economic pain.

Yeah done back march .... now? late. Locking reallly locking Europe seem failed control virus pissed everyone enough able lockdown. KN95 China N95 USA KF94 South Korea. They‚Äôre standards Congrats! We've seen stop social distancing wearing masks, even looks like cases zero, guarenteed come back exponentially go back pre covid days. Hope everyone sticks program scepticism came Trump saying vaccine would ready election day people fearing would pressure FDA skip necessary research. Thankfully happened research approval properly carried out. 

It's still going problem convince people safe thanks false promise stunt course crazy anti-vaxxers worry about. 

Distribution actually going one bottle necks. vaccines developed need kept much lower temperatures get basic refrigerator. someone worked logistics normal refrigerated containers (called reefers industry btw) can't transport vaccines. 

The distribution system vaccines needs maintain proper temps far limited high quantity doses going need. short distribution going bottleneck. Every one office told negative pyschote ( neurotic ) said going come back vengeance winter. never said would work stated could work weren‚Äôt nation full morons selfish people.....the example Japan showing work. understand? won‚Äôt work stupid. police saying wouldn‚Äôt enforce anyway. island nation late outbreak Sweden number 12 deaths per capita world. argument disingenuous. ambulance lights? Without doxing live travel worst effected areas city heard all. looks like initiative like underway CDC/HHS - National Wastewater Surveillance System sure dashboard exists yet available still development Except plastic cause global warming. Please don‚Äôt use analogies nothing thing discussed. Polymers far useful give completely. Whereas wanted could move total renewable low carbon energy sources within decade.  Schools corona sharing at, parents, friends parents... etc sure flu deaths even relevant, Australia 99% drop flu cases year. 36 deaths first half year opposed 430 2019. 705 whole flu season (total Covid deaths 905 far) pretty close. Japan still flu season come year, australia doesn‚Äôt. exactly mean say ‚Äúsafe‚Äù?

I states donating outside. handle it. I‚Äôll sit plastic stool hold bag need to.

I upset see photos mobile donation centers operating usual, even opening windows. believe civic minded folk mostly taking virus seriously necessary assuage fears get again.

Hell, autistic number one barrier donating O- anxiety around whole process. ask friends come me. 

I trying help understand potential barriers donating could hopefully get life-juice! enlisted military. yes, would fine leaving whim aid others, even didn‚Äôt agree. peanuts! time came get want. shit hit fan would still use training help. Yada yada sacrifice service self blah blah Yeah, people seem wear masks here. Sure, many cases, take long 1) contact tracing fail 2) uncontrolled spread. pack 50 masks backpack wear whenever think people get close ‚Äì particularly trains. go train station nobody around, like 9PM, might not. Social Distancing Masks regardless efficacy rates known yet? first one approved isn‚Äôt effective one? School Universities started. Literally two Swedish towns perfect. irrelevant. said nordics comparable enough explain difference deaths. I‚Äôve given multiple sources stating exactly that. 

Now, want keep delusion, that‚Äôs fine. insist giving discussion, finally send goddamn evidence **why deaths different due strategy**. can‚Äôt provide shut fuck already. I‚Äôve given evidence you‚Äôve unable refute. Australia back normal months, sporting events crowds 50-75% stadium capacity well nightclubs festivals open happening states. Best synopsis ever. like belly beast France . Nothing seems good logic behind all. extremely frustrating moment , started hammering county very, badly. relief sight. mean like it‚Äôs conspiracy media?

Well that‚Äôs possibility one needs consider too. I
did, written ‚Äúnot even remotely likely‚Äù. Yeah like Japan seems almost rude mask outside even different social standards US. started SARS followed similar regiment reduce spread. constantly raised view individualism 

Individualism big part problem, US exceptionalism. don‚Äôt believe bad things happen USA. best way get Frenchman something reverse psychology. Source: french. sure you‚Äôve dude America second wave federal mandate think people walmart start following?

I know keep bringing Japan. federal govt Japanese, Americans.

You're avoiding answering question - think federal mandate would help admitted Americans follow it, like walmart currently. definitely time resources but, means less time spent us. We're trying come plan maybe like, gets tested day leaves, make sure negative least flying. flying i'm worried anything, works home New York self quarantine can't teleport here, issue. hard, like coming fucking military plan see family member. frustrating see everyone else caring. hanging everyone, traveling, eating out, whatever goes, we're jump hoops like this. taking mask putting back might lead cross contamination It‚Äôs taking lot families Texas sad. someone family gets it, everyone seems get it. Country big. People seeing something happening thousands miles away can‚Äôt connect 

South didn‚Äôt care surging northeast northwest. Midwest didn‚Äôt care surged south. first hit places don‚Äôt care isn‚Äôt happening areas C stands control, G IGg IGM antibodies. control line showed positive negative either antibody. point screwed. It‚Äôs 8 months didn‚Äôt take care right way I‚Äôm afraid people tired there‚Äôs solving now. live Central Illinois redneck heaven may different areas. mean, already happening. Many Asian countries (with barely cases apiece) forming travel bubbles allowing free travel one another, completely forbidding travel countries outside agreed upon bubble. Queensland community transmission cases month. We're locked everything open degree though basically anyone entering state mandatory 2 week quarantine multiple tests time. 

It done starting point *really* low. got ten cases day probably keeping control contact tracing isolating people who've contact virus riding fine line. got hundred cases day probably going lose control point. got thousand getting back box without serious intervention. do. makes sense. could done small scales one two hot spots.

The problem entire country becoming hotspot now. Believe medical resources national guard DoD unlimited. DoD's job also take care troops, citizens.

You can't magic bunch doctors nurses. Everyone stay inside want make virus dissapear. mean front page 20-30k upvotes. found local news, brief quick... thought 50K?? unsure searching, found France Europe numbers insane. like 3 times first time wave. remember like first wave. possible lot people getting bored sitting home? know feel. live abroad able see family year Christmas (I mean could technically go way going go stay at-risk parents 15-hour international flight) guilt really getting me. think ultimately right thing do. hope see families safely next year! airlifting read story. contingency plan, seems 20 ppl per day,likely Houston would better hospitals cases medical hub.

We'll see actually needed, anyways there's need fear monger potential plan b. STARTED strict lockdown here, winter. Almost exactly midwinter.

It hard bloody work, maybe get payoff. man mother died want make race. Rethink options arent limited binary shutting not. Wear masks workplace. Keep social circles small. Cook food home. Listen advice local health authority. arent churning evidence-based policies safe public health direction, tune adjacent state. live twice weekly public health briefings keep public date spread occurring effective policies reduce it. real number even higher. Take names virus optimists hold accountable yep, ambulance cover super cheap 

Family $176 

Single $88.50

Pensioner Family $106.00

Pensioner Single $53.50  Pfizer's vaccine works they'll gouging citizens first. he's old. wonder people using precautions get priority maskless social people? never cared begin with. 

It‚Äôs something say defend selfish behavior. sociopaths really care million families around world destroyed forever. War criminals. don‚Äôt towns getting smashed Covid......Walmart yeah people take em inside. Local stores enforcement. said good government would provide masks. also stated Japan wears mask respect people. country shown huge percent population stupid follow simple advice. called super spreaders. I.e. everyone exhibits level viral shedding. Yeah still sounds like normal night El Paso besides amount ambulance lights Nz entered room. quarantine two weeks, test negative twice, make trip home without going inside buildings?

we large family plus one's, it'd 20 people house, mostly young adults populated areas. way hell going let happen. dad hellbent gets PISSED disliking idea still everyone over. mom wants family think coming senses.

but planning ""her daughter"" come still. okay, med field works home think she'll take things fine. First all, there‚Äôs CLEAR difference stats CDC lost control reporting Administration. really means probably shit-ton cases reported.  
 
Second; Yes, countries Europe really going control sick. 
 
Third; Sweden‚Äôs strategy looking better better day goes by. Hard work rewarded. proud victorians. closed whole damn state less 10 cases, seeing 7 day rolling average close 1400 per day nothing act like parent continually chides naughty child never follows through. theoretically could get 100%

No, every virus there's threshold dies out. one, threshold might region 70...80%. No. house one infected person compare hospital potentially thousands infected people long periods time without proper ppe think problem US lack mask availability really? federal govt hands free masks that's turning point?

Really?

So ask, exactly would mask mandate help compared right mask mandate every store/town already. high school gf  Bro, one used 200M formula..... December January going brutal US.

Here Canada, Thanksgiving October 12th. Right (October 26th) hitting record numbers 2 weeks Thanksgiving, surely lots people got together advisement. numbers still quite low compared US countries, still worrisome, big spike us.

In US gonna way worse. US Thanksgiving November 26th. People gonna get together spread COVID around. mid-December there's gonna huge spike identified new cases... people get together holidays exacerbate it. afraid even Joe won, Trump's cult members following rules. Disney mandatory cast members wear glasses riding bus within 6 feet far it‚Äôs working well. Areas like Custodial, attractions engineering good considering 6 cases reported Aug-Oct. spending roughly hour 5 separate people within 2 week span 'basic precautions'.

This guy informed people personally. far many senators even doing. mad wrong people.

The world black white. Polarization tearing country apart. Advocating opposite extreme also harmful. 5-10k day dying would mean 500k 1 million new cases day quite time. certainly need anyone's opinion boiling point water. seen Democrat governor's office since 1985. Cox elected nothing change. Imagine two countries 30 million people each, next similar heritage culture. Every year 20 people robbed country A, 2 country B.

In instance, ten times better, B nit badly all, crime rates total low.

My point something ten times worse neccisarily make bad. That's kind freedom people places 'more freedom!!! \‚óã/' understand. ¬Ø_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I live Land Free ;) could agree more. Next couple months critical festival/wedding season winter coming up, think cases rise months manage limit rise able control well enough early 2021 wait vaccine. 460 people banned life would like losing pennies airline industry. 
 
The positive reaction something like normal members society travel frequently would absolutely worth it. defence Europe, second wave. America still first. Masks mandatory children 11. government lying spread children says risk, avoid closing schools. Classes packed 30+ pupils poorly-ventilated rooms designed &lt; 30. mean, people infected, sheer probability reinfections (if news continues report them, may not!)

But scientific evidence points towards reinfections huge cause concern.  Please call third wave.

It ""Wave 1 Phase 3"" argument test blood tests perfect anyone catch HIV/AIDS science shows us gay men catch far often groups. furious turned away, I've pretty much come terms now. truly decreases risk others, even small way, rationale pure bigotry hurt give blood away. believe places relaxed restriction recently sex another man get turned away. denied asked I'd ever sex another man going far back point 1970s! good government would provide masks. Masks work look Japan they‚Äôve got 130 million people 26+ percent elderly they‚Äôve like 3k deaths. Difference wear masks common cold respect other. Good luck country. I'm sure happy running interference them. wonder many people died media feels need ""both-sides"" issue. 460 people banned life would like loosing pennies airline industry. 
 
The positive reaction something like normal members society travel would absolutely worth it. 6 months still posts masks, truly sad state affairs. simply means perfect comparison, mean bad comparison.

I agree entirely Nordic countries great study I'm happy offer result differing methods.

But they're perfect can't pretend answers question study cited admitted answers to.

This would lot easier even 30% factual think being. Wow that's crazy! Glad okay. 23 well got it. friend 18. everywhere. D:  help. lot new infection clusters Germany started German tourists brought virus back home countries. Without causing new infection clusters numbers would lower now. summer holiday travel big mistake allowed.

The true kinds travels countries. one neighbouring country high numbers lower much harder country lower numbers stop exponential growth get time new infection clusters thanks border travellers. already hard enough limit new infections within country tests, contact tracing, masks wearing mandates, etc.. help new infection clusters start time thanks travellers coming infected countries. Epidemiologists knowledgeable subject say vaccine ~95% efficacy would ""dream scenario"" one low 50% would ""worst case still EAU approved"" situation. far we've told point, current frontrunners' data look promising, meaning efficacy land somewhere middle/upper end range. believe Fauci said somewhat recently expects 70-80%, happy with. source I'm mobile, probably googleable. Also, 85% pregnant women got pregnant using condom.

Also, contraceptive jelly effective used prior/during sex [lady parts]. put toast eat reducing odds reproduction. Pure Insanity Huh, wasn‚Äôt Europe telling us US much worse here? Seems like ones handling virus right. shock! There's always way follow rules. *picks ar15* 2 WA well (returning international travelers) Correction: people invested tech pandemic accumulated wealth. made around 6k pandemic. problem all. Hahahaha shit hole USA ""no ones life matters mine"". 


You suck fyi. many people inform? God would proud diabetic sir blood cholersterol higher side . 30 % body fat may considered obese . Normal spring 2021 probably mildly optimistic. Things probably vastly improved (for example, major national spikes, business closures, probably free see friends family whenever/however desired) quite ""normal"". imagine large gatherings still banned, mask mandates probably still place many areas, probably social distancing still recommended possible public. 

Experts Fauci predicting return full normalcy (""broadway shows without masks"" believe example he's fond of) roughly end summer 2021. People gave :(

They enough lockdowns masks, anti-virus groups, least country, growing. also setting new records cases deaths every week. countdown next lockdown started? politically impossible before.

Reminds parable man searching car keys night lamppost. Someone goes asks he's searching spot (it's obviously working) replies ""well, can't see anywhere else I?"" love French, stay strong! things going well vaccine, Biontech something? Usually, utter pablum like nothing speak rely largess others. Yeah - it‚Äôs patchy. everyone visitor coming there‚Äôs Australian going overseas - taking holiday locally. believe fo Covid only, govt picking Yes, indeed. paid airline industry.  winning...  We're well Italy. Grocery stores can't sell alcohol 18:00. mean 'paper' obviously assuming case 0 house went got it, root cause. exactly compelling argument telling everyone to... go out. Yeah, two us I'm sure one can't civil practically exudes anger ""happy one"". That's capitalism. fun? ‚ÄúThE SpIkE CaSeS GoNe‚Äù Yeah Australia here-

Last year recorded 313,061 laboratory confirmed influenza cases whole year.

This year July 13, right middle flu season, recorded 20,823 confirmed flu cases.

Measures deal covid significantly impact influenza.

I personally even cold year. told Democrat run cities worst /s joke, cannot afford shut bars restaurants fully. Yeah, turn pretty much lost respect. really impressed beginning pandemic, he's meek little man towing Republican line. proof efficacy

If kind large scale clinical trial could determine that.

Still, better reach opposite conclusion based zero evidence instead. know what's even bigger threat us all? pandemic that's killed 220k+ fellow Americans. I‚Äôm perfectly happy. You‚Äôre one needs tolerate every day, it‚Äôs seconds every then. Can‚Äôt imagine unhappy would make haha. Yes, hypermobile EDS. mild case. anesthetic issue propensity recurring skin infections concerns mostly joints bother all. stretchy pain them.

The wisdom teeth actually bad! ready come encased bone. dentist went fast could. two small holes scalpel, stuck pliers gave quick twist out. pain out. filling first time last year asked anesthetic (they work end poked poked, becoming stressed, good reason). even feel it! dentist told done thought whole time preparing area. think may high pain tolerance. 

In labor, feel contractions monitor picked got end, either, knows? going resistant anesthetics fair get lucky little impervious pain, say. Nothing life guarantee sir, except death taxes. Thankfully, wearing mask help prevent spread deadly pathogens. nothing 100% effective, wearing mask getting sick far better wearing mask getting sick. wore mask got sick likely less actual virus gets body. Hence less virus body deal with. wearing mask all, getting full dose someone merely talking highly likely.

You anti-maskers same. say masks anything yet countries world curved spread pandemic following 3 simple rules. 
- Wear mask
- Wash hands
- Social distancing
Also added mix countries ""free stupid"" United States. great deal testing contact tracing done. 

So please. Stop ignorant facts.

P.s. really calling kettle black fail realize child responses acting like someone else childish. sort monetary assistance Americans receiving Covid? people may choice sit one out. Cool. exchange paying this, get customers business one scared virus (or plain dead still spending money). 

Funding vaccine selfish, self-interested, unless actually enjoy seeing people suffer economic consequences worth you. point, congratulations, fucking psycho.

Even think profit economic disaster: don't, profit able get market lower price waiting market rebounds. Dude really obvious still is. Maybe wherever live exception look national case numbers. Every Sunday relative low point, including last several. Sometimes good guys win. We've lost fucking minds recently signed blood donations local community center. well handled. Please donate can! dont think government tell behave property affects community whole, wait til hear things like drug laws, fire codes, noise ordinances, zoning laws, many infringements individual liberty give fuck anyone else. bad news them... There's 10-14 day lag hospitalizations. mean..the US better regard now. I'd honestly tryst china's word US leadership. That's value dollar depends mining (vast majority exports) especially iron ore price. Since government artificially propped service sector mining largely unaffected price iron going way economy looks good comparatively speaking.

We'll need wait till job keeper ends see real damage. really want admit zero idea polling, statistics, math works?

I figured that's something people want keep themselves. Enemy soldiers / allied soldiers - Americans never really good distinguishing anyway. Yea one care. Advantages loose cunt downgrade considered vectors. watching movies iphones... don¬¥t close bars instead infections occur? So, include going vote? Hmm problem is, may need impose full lockdown eventually. winter harsh. 2024, Trump's appointee win. Rinse repeat.

Ever hear Grover Cleveland before? He's reason Trump's ""45th"" president despite 44 different people held office. Trump term limited yet loses year even locked prison something could prevent running chose. put past claim fraud 4 years attempt gain office hold Republican/conservative voters. Thanks insight. thought low density national state exist anymore expect desert &amp; cold place human probably catch European density within centuries, difference continent recently ""invaded"" Europeans compared old Europe. France twice size Utah Wyoming information. states seem density remote areas France countryside Auvergne. thought price houses tose states would proportionately cheaper France prices comparable France&amp; even :(. Meanwhile, El Paso schools open yet stopping athletic events. 

If stop largest daily mass social gatherings, going keep producing disease vectors. Technically allowed buy underwear shoes, either. Deutsche Bahn makes losses too, TUI. don¬¥t think see economic growth 5 percent 2021 predicted month ago. educational institutions note 1949?

OMG! Mao Central Committee could answer accuracy all!

But instead killed millions people wiped history China. needs done restaurant retail industries well. People wearing masks like conspiracy theorists climate change deniers. family gets assess risk everybody gets assess risk themselves, point point rules all. wonder, Jesus literally descended sky beam light face, told go fuck back home wear mask... they'll so, find way explain guy actually Jesus. thought managed states federal government? admit shit talking start year uncalled for.

Can't that. good idea. Non elected scientists position make decisions. ideal world, elected leaders listen advisors, scientists included make decision based wisdom science (of multiple fields) behind it. ""masks required"". thing regarding lockdown, additional limits freedom, etc.. Decisions complicated real world 1+x=2 (with x number 1 10), human factor it. 

I US Germany, ""our"" version Fauci pretty much said, position make political decisions want be. huge teams merely advice German states federal government. advice changed months. politics. politiceans taking (public) blame, scientists, advisors. still feel safe, anyway could take send them? Maybe ice something? love US breaking news orders like already implemented country wide Europe.  


One city shit lockdown. almost useless one city lockdown unless blocks roads makes strict rules coming going, test result less 48hours old.  Morons. Absolute fucking morons. Nope it'll 0 November 4th.

*Sadly mandatory /s here* nailed Crushing like champions! Funding Germany really joke everyone get complicated process get it. Many freelancers must pay back aid got first wave. Households instead people household either going all. Practically speaking difference 6 person household 1 person covid 2 person household person covid. Youre exposed pretty equally either way. Number tests performed. Better hospital preparations. quite still 25km limit leaving home many people sincerely keep masks alone airplane bathroom? quickly air bathroom ventilated ...?

the studies far consider infected passengers.

The infection vectors passengers, stewards/stewardesses. walking around, pushing carts, breathing deeply talking much.

What plane boarding unboarding, ventilators also? often everyone plane crew tested? daily? every arrival?

Since crew members highest chances infected becoming infection vectors, wearing FFP2 (or \*3) filtering masks, minimize risk.

It sufficient team crew tested regularly. crew members tested daily avoid bad luck false negative results.

(the false negative rate best average 20% : 
1: 

2: ) let's see Australia figures second part: mass testing, pooled take advantage low case load.

Because know virus find way back sooner later, mass testing alternative another lockdown, vaccine least. They're showing world done. love efforts Xinjiang tbh. Hope countries follow suit. hoax sense media Democrats blowing concern covid proportion real effects. know cases? It‚Äôs test much,‚Äù president told rally crowd. ‚ÄúIn lot ways it‚Äôs good, lot ways it‚Äôs foolish.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf tested half, cases would half,"" Mr Trump said. rally Mr Trump added: ""That's hear now. Turn television, ‚ÄòCovid, Covid, Covid, Covid, Covid, ""A plane goes down, 500 people dead, talk it. 'Covid Covid Covid Covid.' way, November 4th, hear anymore. 'Covid! Covid! Please go vote, Covid!'""

""By way, November 4th, hear anymore. "" 

Trump implies media attention hurts politically. little hospitals full 220,000 American deaths. HIM.... 'Pants' Brit-speak underwear. friend mates live Richmond Melbourne. bars fully booked next 2 weeks. can't get table spend money... tough. Hope ok. mutation less deadlier before. slight modification protein. Alright, fine, here's now? too! G146 strain may infectious. Same. got injured late December last year. despite hitting high deductible, follow appointments new year benefit hitting again. share fucking around half measures made inevitable lock longer been. Even lock strict enough initially. mean - actual point 'I like evidence used support claim like' spending awful lot time arguing rather providing proof back claim.

i genuinely know talking though. yeah people thought would lose, plenty positive would. what? who's denying that?

you hand making false claims intention supporting evidence, seem care truth. glad remember things though. patients need hospitalized require average 22 days hospitalization, 

I'm going need source got accurate all.

ICU patient LOS 10-13 LOS 5 hospital median LOS 6 take severe patients. anything less 2x rate wild ride, sure.

I suburb since August think üòÅ   though example Germany seeing surge cases too. Plus fires don‚Äôt let people outdoors problem El Paso it‚Äôs farrrrr away metroplexes. Houston Dallas issues, shuttle patients nearby towns suburbs also huge capacity governor can't anything without risking pissing president (and losing whatever federal response might able get now)

This fucking absurd.

I hope guys vote orange buffoon man-child days. sake. Don‚Äôt you‚Äôre talking false personality lol. Check post history report There's always next summer Tried summer, told metal enough. 
Started taking vitamins, try next month.  Oh don‚Äôt expect nationally owned ones close. ones small businesses sadly won‚Äôt receive support need. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article saw story yesterday El Paso [airlifting patients hospitals article says ""plan to"" ""if necessary."" happen know they've needed yet? nUmBeRs hiGHeR tEsTiNg, PeOpLe sIcK help called ""guy,"" turned woman South Dakota hospitals full weeks everyone pretending like hoax. I'm scared death. Christ website sometimes. Always assume absolute worst everyone hearing full story. reason people rebelling don‚Äôt trust government news.

Mandating mask wearing isn‚Äôt going help.

Masks don‚Äôt even account much protection virus. won‚Äôt solve problem. Thanksgiving thankful. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, or... Lepordhatemyface stay home order. recommendation. curfew however option. State Australia (New South Wales) managed live Covid. things open, social distancing rules place life impacted much. average 2 3 cases community transmission day. acted fast early got good system place testing contact tracing. cluster emerges pretty much halted. can't remember last time death.
However, state borders closed states community transmission states still trying get handle testing tracing. 
The Premiers talking opening state lines I'm scared see repeat happened Europe (with numbers increasing summer), summer holidays. 
No doubt saved lives prevented hospital system inundated know quickly Covid take off. 
The Trump administration really dropped ball Covid. There's really excuse. Hair dog may make bite go away, comes back bite worse before. Repeat hospitalized. Even without vaccine, pandemic‚Äôs going end. **It‚Äôs gonna run course**. It‚Äôs gonna end. They‚Äôll go crazy. said ‚Äòwithout vaccine‚Äô ‚Äî watch, it‚Äôll headline tomorrow. people crazy. No, it‚Äôs running course. wife got airlifted mine rural Nevada nearest hospital bill $50,000. Thankfully $800 per month insurance two us fully covered it. limit $50,000 got lucky mine farther hospital. ""many"" speak still pretty small minority, egged right-wing News Corp (Fox style) media.

So yeah... point still stands. US could easily done total lack political will. like 500k. Don‚Äôt forget lot cases people don‚Äôt symptoms Zhongnan Hospital found 2.4% employees 2% 3% recent patients visitors, including people tested returning work, developed antibodies, according senior doctors right here. Going pick kid school seeing bunch parents refuse wear mask 3 minute activity makes furious. know likely isnt going make difference scenario come man.

Its low class. ounce prevention quite expensive someone else paying cure. current politicians dead time shit really hits fan. Go back Fox News conspiracy theory threads please. work high-risk job (pediatric dental hygienist) one coworker test positive,

I tooth/gum aches started last week, I'm hoping go away really trust going dentist CV19, medical medical adjacent professions one hear stories coming of. 

Thank part. Yup beginning Universe created. 
This made lot people angry widely regarded bad move.  El Paso fucking tiny. Meanwhile, Colorado allows anyone come matter we‚Äôre get tourist dola dollar bills yo Politically, yes. Texas pleasures, trust me. Move mix up, have! Yet every time go see places packed people without masks.
I love south Texas.

Pumpkin patch. Packed!
Church pumpkin patch. Swamped!
Local mall. Insanely busy!

Those places I've thought go left conditions looked dangerous.

My local town enforcing masks anymore.
I work retail hand masks piss lot locals.
I wish people empathy. didn‚Äôt anything racism. black members doesn‚Äôt change something far right not. support boogalo bois domestic terrorists, don‚Äôt think terrorists? sheltering home since February. room mate keeps working, goes eat restaurants, goes grocery shopping multiple times week, flies state family gatherings, visits friends half state. partner Covid TWICE (in March July), we're forced live virus-denying, inconsiderate fuckwad. winter he's hot heat cranked up.
There's nowhere else go. Unemployment ran out. Food stamps ran out. jobs need us back... terrifying.

Edit: he's *got heat cranked point citation crap. either provide citation call BS, get pot, Donnie. Nah that‚Äôs impossible Please no. mercy. I‚Äôm truck driver üò≠ would probably win election right now, would close.

The opposition absolutely useless contribute criticism. Back March calling earlier lockdown (first wave) early end it. Lock whole world week 2  Many us did. think know much Texas think we're Trump loving conservatives care world considered liberal states. Many us Texans compassionate. wonder impact Trump base's strategy vote election day. Pathetic leadership. went winter unscathed zero cases winter hit, opposed Europe US floating around community. Mt grandparents Iowa too, grandpa acted same. going bars hang friends, wearing mask incorrectly, going restaurants. tested positive 10/5, went hospital 5 days 10/10, home really struggling. grandma also struggling. I'm absolutely livid take seriously. friend left NYC Taiwan March 7. Basically decision reverse. Well say don‚Äôt watch MrBeast‚Äôs latest video. Though agree people age mostly done good job wearing masks properly compared older adults. Ya happened real... Sadly s/ People like Joe Rogan trash CA Gavin Newsom handling COVID like Texas, well outcome. ‚Äúonly one person per family member‚Äù work? yeah seems like year's flu less contagious COVID. context number positive Coronavirus results

Why number deaths? There's distinct peak US (which talking about, world) March, things went dramatically July starting climb way again. would make first second wave.

Waves social construct. ? Non essential places like fast food, restaurants places like shut down. else good luck trying control virus, I'm gonna go tonight bet wont even get pulled nothing ha  unbelievably depressing. I'm outside San Antonio, daughter 1 20 kids that's still distance learning school. Twenty.

Just give idea things here, teacher basically eye rolled said coming back want Covid house. week later put one annoying fundraising campaigns. videos teachers couple feet apart, speaker never wearing mask. couple days later girlfriend wrote teacher seeing another teacher pop class (side-by-side) say ""hi"" Zoom wearing mask. dismissive ""Of course care we're safe"" reply, another week later get email there's Covid going around teaching staff, worry much since they're handling it.

Meanwhile, kids wear masks classrooms . . . mandated fucking RECESS. 

I gotta 9 year old that's gone nearly year without normal kid interaction now, according school community, I'm paranoid weirdo this.

. . . fuck yeah go Texas we're last bastion Freedoms!

Godspeed El Paso, rest state ain't far behind. yet, countries still infections within them. ""doing right"" means clearing virus entirely country? thought took ""leadership cared"" ""did right thing"" ? point? getting boring. sick COVID would exposed someone else COVID put risk getting sicker? viral load top inside already? fairness, there‚Äôs finite amount time remain case oil us good ground! World Series Dallas. 9-10 hour drive yes It‚Äôs hard anyone take claim seriously say ‚ÄúI believe saw article‚Äù don‚Äôt source it. Gotta careful too. China sketchy shit. Wish like Taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand instead haha big deal 85% Maybe get people pay attention.  Probably not. Guys it‚Äôs okay. heard Trump say ‚ÄúThere big spike Texas it‚Äôs now.‚Äù 

This clearly fake news, COVID flu.

What fuck country live in. Send Help. took avoid fucking arrogant rights reach point hospitals capacity PPE available. seem issues again. intent literally every country's actions prevent overloading hospitals. effectively others. Amen.

After 9/11 sent soldiers go kill die convenience national security. 

How many people died Afghanistan iraq could suck cheeseburgers frappuccinos suv's?

These priorities. ..What could go wrong?

It suprise willing pay ultimate price convenience.  instead sending soldiers kill die, voice whispering us go risk death infecting others ourselves. see stats many people normally die result lifestyle (heart diseae, diabetes, smoking related cancer, alcohol related deaths, traffic accidents, etc) see going take something unimaginable get people change. there's climate change. 

Im naieve think society would appreciate life without semblance capitalism lifting veil like watching apocalyptic death cult called action church conspicuous consumption.

It doesnt way go look dimwits cant bothered stay home. isnt psrtisan issue. people sides political spectrum trying pretend everything fine. Trump voters republicans easy blame. Evangelicals easy blame. youth easy blame. Different ethnic groups still parties easy blame. list goes shortage people blame - makes point moot. Everyone guilty degree.

The fact say - nobody tempered isolation deprivation anymore. Nobody ready sacrifice.  many people self gratification. 

Ive trying set good example living lockdown since March, seeing friends family. leaving house absolutely necessary cases. go wear 3 masks among precautions.  people know arent life. Im also vegan im used it. Americans simply 5th dumbest humans planet. others EXACT virus nowhere near problem.

Only 4 countries higher 
[deaths per 100,000 ashamed! Feel ashamed. believe hoax DIE.

Wait till see exponential growth dumb people can't figure avoid crowds/restaurants/etc... winter.

You'll see. see. Governor Abbot would reversed order done sooner. reason think won‚Äôt reverse now. he‚Äôs good little Trump fella even worth time anymore.

If silent taken agreement We've pretty harsh lockdown since July we're getting single digit daily cases now.

Essentially 4 months retail, bars, dining (take away still available), gyms shut.

I miss going out. miss going gym. miss lot things.

But understand done.

Hope soon. words I'm fine kind person paying attention redditors apparently remember things. Ignorance...  guess it‚Äôs different Canada, new homes aren‚Äôt selling, older home‚Äôs
Are red hot since they‚Äôre bit cheaper. Well that‚Äôll help lot... two weeks. Yep. cannot respond reactively virus hope succeeding.

It‚Äôs preventative get fucked. We‚Äôve apparently collectively chosen get fucked. anyone reads this, hope well, please contract trace anyone know Covid. Please stay safe go needed, please wear mask go out. last least, please vote hopefully better response covid.

Love neighbor Americans, please stay safe. that, wanted signature moment getting discharged hospital taking mask off. Curious see Fort Bliss responds issue. You‚Äôre right say, could probably use you. patients sicker anywhere else got problems buddy. hope get help. seriously thing?! blood good enough sexual orientation? 

Is HIV thing? think medical industry would better that.

Edit: need reply, late comments good info economy didn‚Äôt see significant bump too. Terrible ROI. Everything wrote proved point. agreed masks 100% effective. means preventable. helps. guarantee. 

Thanks proving point going kiddy tantrum. 

Welcome blocked list. Yeah, looked pretty fierce. particularly something aspire to.

However, they're pretty much open now. Extremely strict 2 week quarantine entry, wander Corona-free country. Fun fact:
I working Virtual Machine cannot remote work KEKW Spain almost everybody wears masks Sweden 10% population city New York, like 4th 5th largest European country landmass. Population density spreads diseases Sweden bottom 25% population densities Im following election closely. exchange year us really love people really feel them. Also election might one important also rest world.

Good luck stay safe!  gotta admire consistency petty downvotes, people stop bothering first comments. Ohhhh... unintended positive consequence terrible situation... \*head explodes\* unless vaccine already tell 3rd wave going I've planet awhile never heard til woke outside window. *Luhvul* worry, north Las Cruces also wrecked. beyond state borders suspect lot interstate movement (which normal, normal right now...)  Lol dude. Close boarder. Eliminate virus come beer beach covid free island. 

It's coming summer weather's ducking wicked. say people wear masks. Plenty people still get die.

Plenty people get flu die. Plenty people get cancer die. Plenty people get STDs suffer. Plenty people suffer general despite following precautions. almost like life factors yes 100% effective.

Ah yes, since condoms 100% effective never used. Life quite literally black white drinking kool-aid. Whatever helps sleep night.

I actually like kool-aid much. tends filled sugar denial. welcome portion, though appears indulging already. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø like mom. might best close borders Europe like first wave. Otherwise country able get though winter halfway acceptable numbers, get big numbers new infections thanks travel neighbour nations virus even control. paths southern border SEA quite pleasant actually. Border villages practically neighbors sometimes relatives. It‚Äôs easy cross bushes streams get side, unlike harshness north. replies frightening yous win nrl lol 2021 gunna worse time around Texas turns blue, stay home order contested disenfranchisement effort invalidate election. That's NYC (most it, anyways) takes seriously watching everyone else horror right now. April one ambulance another, day every day. barely stepped outside except essentials, I'd tend see 3-5 ambulances walked grocery store back, two blocks away. Even businesses allowed stay open, sometimes closed, could guess whether caution, maybe dead. chef favorite cafe hospital, heard again, think made it. One friend mine lost TEN personal friends.

Now we're extremely careful. ""relaxed"" probably parts country would call ""very cautious."" neighborhood holding 1% positive, think, months now.

Up day shutdowns mandated, couple days later ambulances really started wailing, many people cautious kept themselves, general things still rolling, people thinking big deal.

I agree, ""don't act big enough problem screaming face unable ignore it"" seems mentality many places, especially US. One can't help wonder national strategy would different COVID caught heart DC guard rather NYC. maths sciences sometimes use different terminology. Two points remembrance:

Influenza pandemic human race many years now. age 70, likely die Influenza instead COVID-19. diligence death statistics realize virus kills elderly, many located nursing homes. End transmission.  get third wave soon unless stay locked forever. I'm sure China continued SEAL people homes. would need provide way anecdotal evidence convince china reporting accurately Stuck right em! Where's 1st region? beak region see distinct. problem saying first wave implies never crested (which did) also anything it. certainly did, since Americans learn catastrophe places something ones already hit, areas enough. means compare year last year (or last twelve months twelve months that), hotel revenue increased. Half quickly = twice long. I'm Melbourne. 

It brutal. 

So long barely stirring home. I'm glad we've got control. I'm thinking little trip Melbourne Cup break (if take Monday off). 

Online catch ups snuggly cats gotten through. Whatever say Doc

Plenty people wear masks. Plenty people still get die.

Masks 100% effective.

Keep drinking kool-aid. Whatever helps sleep night. **Link cite evidence shut fuck up**. also knew would happen half year ago, relative calm September lulled us suddenly smacked us back face. Haha uhh last summer cricket boring NZ show up, one close game. region Germany numbers reasonable level summer. everybody do? Go vacation (to spain), celebrate over, hold private parties. cases rising everybody upset carnival year already planning private carnival parties. able look 6 feet front face? able imagine moments 5 minutes now?

Congratulations, able comprehend idea deaths could prevented people actually wearing masks following social distancing guidelines.

I know, know, hard comprehend. maybe utilize one brain cell 3 might form spark comprehension.

___

Also yes, apologize asshole. denying deaths preventable semantic terms obnoxious twat yourself. Also, viral particles fly cold, low-humidity air China contained despite knowing test spread 

America didnt contain despite two month early warning Yes, opinion anecdotal. live central Paris see around people crowded cafes, half people wearing mask properly streets, neighbors breaking curfew large house parties. Everyone making plans get around curfew instead thinking curfew first place.

It's important see public comments somewhat reflective society; France full intelligent law-abiding covid-conscious people like people think is. mean, know France one anti-vaccine countries entire world?? worst Europe. mind-blowing developed country high levels education France anti-science. Article?! giving reddit much credit. headlines here. Okay whatever say DickMcFartJuice No, could, would rather never happened. Thousands lives lost. worth it. What's death rate? Sweet jesus. **EVERY** country closed borders dude. think virus stops spreading closed abitrary nation lines? That's anything works. Closing borders foothold country nothing. Borders *ZERO* impact spread within country, affect spread *between* countries. However moment, every country dealing covid still, dealing people within borders (aka people fucking affected closed borders) spreading eachother. 

The virus fucking care borders closed. Lets use US example then. UK 100 million people within borders. plenty walking petri dishes virus flourish spread without foreign influence. 

I mean talking closing borders country already getting thousands new cases everyday. ignoring countries closed borders, seemingly beyond obtuse fact virus spread people country need foreign travel. 

For fucks sake man fucking stupid stop acting like are. Yeah haven‚Äôt. all. prevailing thought people actually vulnerable careful ‚Äòfitter‚Äô people, leading less hospitalisations Gee wonder there's anything could reduce spread /s said user responding something said. context. NY Times 7-day average change +32% cases, +12% deaths. Right now, isn‚Äôt sea ice forming Arctic. bad thing. Closing state borders, unpopular, probably key preventing spread throughout Australia. That's probably Europe lost again. applaud countries managing handle this, don‚Äôt think easy compare Europe Australia/NZ due differences population density, even cities. Plus, weather causing people stay indoor.  raised white flag, usual isn‚Äôt incivility. Abbott literally one worst people alive. He‚Äôs responsible deaths thousands. Central asian borders literally wired fence jump over. Similar goes southern borders Vietnam, Laos etc Yeah, guy little ago deluded promising everyone life would back normal Xmas badgering everyone get back office. Swedish people athletic. Americans not. Yeah, heard stories people living virus exist large parts Europe. sure reality stranger fiction. One month ago, [still first 2 waves last month ? trust Dr Fauci Yeah hementioned needed get baseline around 10k cases day avoid bad winter. baseline never even got close low... joke. I'm glad grandma finally let walk getting walmart deliver groceries. Lets real. probably written old straight, non-scientific person even understand things are. 

I'm saying makes better, pointing that's likely scenario. 7%* making numbers Ye pandemic, drinking water, food internet + video games WW1 WW2 war tbh. Lock life want dont give war. Dude even said it. closed boarders time introduced strict internal controls. 

America used bench mark anything. Ah, it‚Äôs correct aren‚Äôt living 2019 it‚Äôs pretty bloody close. least looks like might able Christmas family without fear infecting loved ones unlike many countries. It‚Äôs true still making sacrifices travel give day compared living exponential cases struggling health care systems. embarrassing. half remembered pre Covid experience facts Swedish policy compared rest Europe opinions actual health care workers pandemic reported reputable news source. Boris hospitalized though Muslims muslim, surprise there. Totally rather see tax dollars going instead someone‚Äôs golf property! Yeah, fuck freedom. exactly want scared. Compliance desires effected force. Exponential growth. Nah man, can't arsed reading sources that's riot. man, ignorance bliss all. Facebook really old toxic, really We're talking Texas here, no? correlation serious coronavirus cases (i.e. causing hospitalisation) long covid?

Why long covid sufferers middle aged women whilst worse cases coronavirus infection amongst 65+ men low socio-economic background?

I'm medical expert long covid 19 sounds lot like CFS. Also Oct 6. \_And\_ Washington Times. 


Be skeptical articles suggest, little detail mechanism would explain schools different places people congregate, kids different human beings, schools driving spread. Thats exactly point, stopping this. People aren‚Äôt gonna let virus dictate lives, especially young people. us done social distancing masking unless required. Rock Chalk jayhawk... Now, convince rest Kansas something it. One major party US acknowledge human-caused climate change. even average positive rate, may much higher now. Neither TX 

## Abstract

COVID-19 caused SARS-CoV-2 infection characterized diverse clinical symptoms. Type interferon (IFN-I) production impaired severe cases lead ARDS widespread coagulopathy. propose COVID-19 pathophysiology initiated SARS-CoV-2 gene products, NSP1 ORF6 proteins, leading catastrophic cascade failures. viral components induce signal transducer activator transcription 1 (STAT1) dysfunction compensatory hyperactivation STAT3. SARS-CoV-2-infected cells, positive feedback loop established STAT3 plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) may lead escalating cycle activation common interdependent signaling networks affected COVID-19. Specifically, PAI-1 upregulation leads coagulopathy characterized intravascular thrombi. Overproduced PAI-1 binds TLR4 macrophages, inducing secretion proinflammatory cytokines chemokines. recruitment subsequent activation innate immune cells within infected lung drives destruction lung architecture, leads infection regional endothelial cells produces hypoxic environment stimulates PAI-1 production. Acute lung injury also activates EGFR leads phosphorylation STAT3. COVID-19 patients‚Äô autopsies frequently exhibit diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) increased hyaluronan (HA) production also leads higher levels PAI-1. COVID-19 risk factors consistent scenario, PAI-1 levels increased hypertension, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, old age. discuss possibility using various approved drugs, drugs currently clinical development, treat COVID-19. perspective suggests enhance STAT1 activity and/or inhibit STAT3 functions COVID-19 treatment. might derail escalating STAT3/PAI-1 cycle central COVID-19. endangering child's psychological wellbeing virus practically zero chance harming her? Basically studies seen cloth masks used measure number large droplets make mask. Basically mask good capturing vast majority large particles. Clearly, mainly transmitted large moisture particles would make profound difference.

The ones address smaller aerosolized particles look distance traveled without mask many aerosolized particles make mask. may make make difference situations, address happens aerosolized particles go around mask accumulate given space. Depending type material cloth mask made of, vast majority air aerosolized particles go around mask. CDCs refusal accept fact aerosolized particles main mode transmission damaging ability sort control outbreak.

The studies bad, vastly overstate implications effective virus.

The biggest problem Bob Redfield IHME models claim literal silver bullet pandemic evidence support whatsoever. already police state like live. three days still 9000 cases average. steepest increase ever. Simpletons can't bring respond threat can't see. tangible exist. ignorant skeptical. problem wearing mask indoors can‚Äôt maintain social distancing. it‚Äôs often taken far kids can‚Äôt even play ice hockey it‚Äôs contact sport. woman gets arrested wearing mask outside football game. Hilary popular vote. That‚Äôs heartbreaking. God. Guess  Dentists hygienists probably PPE‚Äôd people planet right 99% dental procedures create droplets, they‚Äôre working right face. They‚Äôre highly aware risk serious incentive make sure droplets can‚Äôt get vice versa. emergency dentist come facility work suited like going walk moon. 

Definitely ask protocols, request first appointment slot day possible know office recently cleaned. anyone seems put answering questions, find another dentist. Honestly point would trust one one created US ""Operation Warp Speed"". Read article please Switzerland aiming herd immunity Imagine saying plague valid reason requesting mail-in ballot. That's part really scares depresses me: call force people vote person risk lives good reason all, one go jail lying it, half country thinks that's fair.  haven‚Äôt smelled anything 6 months asshole Tyrants!!

Yes, shambles, agree, people like make things worse. virus spreading government. spreading people careless, selfish stupid *that* current government's fault. Rules made many people unable, unwilling behave right way. everyone wore masks kept far away others possible, often possible, would quickly control. lack brains humility, carry on, spreading disease blaming government mess. math free people :-) Lol really think 40% Americans still aren‚Äôt going anywhere? Look outside. guys shorter supply think  Donnie's America 1. Fevers symptom covid, fever mean covid may covid fever rare. reason hospitals business still using EVERY person. 

2. ones going $35 doubt making much profit all. I‚Äôve seen models going $60-$100 websites. I‚Äôd assume good quality thermometers like cost good bit. tests 100% need one super spreader welcome disaster. fact, one super spreader NY started big chain events infections (I think Westchester).

Of course pandemic east going better. live Land Free ;)

TSM fan? Holy shit! suddenly love Oxford UK Wearing mask public, removed gathering friends families. even wearing it, many use chin straps cover noses. continue adjust mask touching front part mask (this includes Obama Biden!). mean least find different job risk. To, know, *lower risk* went back work went overnight stock position big box stores. customers, extremely limited contact co-workers, cases were\are going chances lower were. 


It's simple hubris think something mitigate risk. 

So that, know, die accidentally kill family, both. it?

Kansas here, letting counties (not countries!) decide whether mandate masks allows fairly isolated research effectiveness. Assuming measures closing bars, restaurants etc.. same.

But could also counties mandating masks inhabited people already abide covid rules. government supposed reflect people all.

This whole research says nothing Sweden. all. neither say masks way slow spread. wanted shutdown, well got shutdown. See wasn‚Äôt worth it, everyone? monday expect increase tomorrow around 18K cases never thought even possible. wasn¬¥t high Latin South America. maybe test symptomatic cases. 1. Wearing masks political issue. Asians actually demanding governments produce/acquire marks.
2. Individualism vs Collectivism
3. respect listen scientists. many conspiracies misinformation spreading around compare US. reddit told Americans stupid contain virus?? Yeah teens 20 yr olds done this. COVID stealing youth. Chinese? Math!

This world math. ""Look, 50 cases, nothing worry about"".

In China ""Look, one case, chance more, let's find finds us"". Fuck.... give vaccine already!

On serious note, think get start 2021?  Ils ont arr√™t√©s de se faire la bise etc mais ils retirent les masques d√®s qu'ils peuvent.

Yep, culture history France lead situation. 
People want listen orders, think law smarter medical specialists likely state students come areas social distancing mask wearing norm. City Cambridge wearing mask taboo Daddy... üëÄ goalposts keep moving. Shutdowns couple weeks allow medical system catch up; flatten curve.

Truth one really knows. areas continue open others locking again. view 2021 may improvement 2020, count full opening 2022 earliest. NY Times... problem, I've removed quip asking relevance. thought seeking downplay federal response.

As see OP's article, Polish hospital asking non-covid patients avoid going hospital, seems clear hospital ship offload patients would help: *""Therefore, case require immediate medical intervention, please think different solution, perhaps emergency department necessary""* Let's remind everyone case equal death either house cards fall we're enter age hyper-inflation banana republic style monetary policy globally.

Either way, outlook god awful I'd way rather precious metals either case massively over-valued stocks declining empire lose reserve currency status.

Anyway, I'm killjoy ruin fun control people. liable spread me, really care much do. Problem is, live little area dumb choices make dangerous me.

So, yeah, avoid indoor areas fall winter unless necessary. there, wear good-fitting mask, preferably something like N95 respirator KN95, plus keep time minimum. control, make sure good ventilation, install air purifiers, enforce masking. gatherings, keep socializing minimum can't outside virtually. get vaccine spring, do, go get return normal life again. Singapore also dictatorship people canned chewing gum. ""migrant workers"" (i prefer call semi slaves) live close subhuman conditions would, thank god, accepted Europe.

Ummm... I've think we've found Torrent's latest alt account.  mean, yes. That's technically correct, misses larger point. 

*it is* unsafe people packed bus get work, solution go ""well, safe essential travel get get work starve death, fine open non essential public gatherings like churches.""

If upset people exposing busses, fight give people enough aid need put danger get by.

As true populists, react. maximum, propose half-assed measures, wait public reaction change depending PR effect. Current number infected means collapse hospitals three weeks, wait public opinion shift hundreds body bags dead every family.

The economy hurt anyway. We‚Äôre 1st wave  anything like original Christmas ceasefire, they'll shooting anyone observing easter ceasefire.

Also people mostly work hard take care eachothers. Live two major cites getting job back home. People cities dont give shit eachother unless money. That's interesting thanks I'm confused, seems say beds never staffed first lack care (workers) actually main problem intensive care medicine, even Corona. conducted surveys it. also know **20 30 percent intensive care beds Germany cared for. Although physically equipped ventilators monitors, available even pandemic**. intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants Germany worldwide. That's good, too. helped us lot pandemic also set beds. **You see many free beds intensive care register, filled. main problem moment**. improve working conditions payment nursing staff, otherwise problems. Covid19's patient numbers hospitals increase now, must redistribution nurses intensive care unit. lead reduction performance areas. must clear us. would always pay attention it: must always refer free beds. **Those indeed free, thus DIVI, present personnel, order care them.**

It sounds like problem have, much smaller scale since would leave 30 000 beds staffed enough staff care 10 000 beds. since Germany never needed beds first wave wonder bothered training additionnal staff last months, seems like didn't. 

Apparently difficulty balance staffing covid patients others answer France try train people particular situation order avoid saturation. bet misguided optimism. Honestly? go hell. I'm sick mindset either PO PiS. PiS charged they've mishandled crisis. examples public lawmakers.

They'll straight deny virus exists something else causing people get making people sick, I'm pretty sure coronavirus, question asking is, 'What's making sick?'"" told medical professionals testified. Ah yes, rebrand lockdowns something else constantly get sick 2022.

The new name ""circuit breaker"". ""curfew"".

I‚Äôm also infuriated too. staying home, careful. seen mom dad year, outside park. Meanwhile assholes go ruin things everyone. Yeah, know one. close sport stuff, reduce number people funerals marriages (only official part, party home afterwards recommended still allowed) that's it. also part prayers canceled, mandated. 

I see school closures, closing non-essencial businesses, mandated homeoffice, allowed meet/have parties private property (only public spaces venues rent restrictions) anything else would justify term ""lockdown"".

Of course clear definition term. me, lockdown something similar spring, basically everything except grocery stores closed, allowed meet people (not even home; again, recommended big parties house still allowed!) everyone work/school/... remotely, all.

And know spring Germany still light version compared countries, still allowed outside long kept distance others. 

But again, see anything compares spring Baesweiler now, spring define lockdown Germany.

There's threshold needs met end community transmission typically quite high (70-90% so). would guess 5 year number would hit easy targets (kids school, working professionals, high-income families, etc.), last 20-30% people become exponentially harder reach (undocumented immigrants, homeless, anti-vaxxers, insulated religious communities, etc.) remainder valid reason taking it, like allergy medical treatment. throw pile hard know. whether believe matter. many questions mark regarding situation Taiwan. export cases low total testing since Jan. give confidence visit Taiwan stage.

the UK gets goods services rest world how? Yup. Sadly many cities want open everything gamble things fine. Flu peak activity starts December, really bad combined. Problem is, people contract disease family friends. house gatherings. IMO. people wear masks. underestimate people's ability regards drinking liquor. Idiots like apply rules like reason lot people decided enough enough protesting lockdown restrictions throughout Europe. It‚Äôs making matters worse.

A common sense strategy enforce mask usage store limit amount people leave that. correct im wrong, claiming virus released time election year. I'm sure math little complicated you, Hillary 95% chance means Trump 5% chance, meaning chance, way could have. Lol think it‚Äôs reasonable someone literally wear mask 24/7 even indoors fucking mind. 

Not going happen irresponsible suggest. 10000000% agree operated way years well this. really feel small businesses basically entirety entertainment travel industries continue hurt this. real test phase iii trials going now, inject half people placebo, half real vaccine, see people receive vaccine get sick less often people receive control.

Biology weird - see immune responses generated vaccine *guarantee* help fight disease. However, make seem much likely work purpose. That's run big trials, make really sure works dosing world. According already 9k cases weekly average. skeptical articles suggest, little detail mechanism would explain schools different places people congregate, kids different human beings, schools driving spread.


And ESPECIALLY skeptical unless variation ""we tested kids found virus""

Making claims non-spreading schools, without actually providing supporting testing numbers, extremely suspect cannot wait 100% capacity really hope full means 60 70%. lots people going die. 

Death covid hard avoid completely lockdowns mostly protecting hospitals. source? still don¬¥t stricter measures, passive. I‚Äôd support Lowe‚Äôs Home Depot day.

I'd lean towards explanation. look forward taking Jan 20. Right reverse engineered weak form virus triggers long term learned immune response one understand. antibody surge?

To clear, still good they're making headway. However, think common false assumption vaccine = permanent immunity. üòÇüòÇ troll. Oh stop playing victim card. Smug ass Europeans acted handled virus perfectly us Stupid Americans still dealing virus everyone Europe Locked down.

If anything Europe large case study lockdowns nothing kick road completely kill argument everyone locked 2 weeks everything would hospital close German border, area still relatively unaffected atm. government swallow pride ask help...

Whatever trump doing, working. government totally credibility issues, think China's numbers plausible contact tracing. China either lie numbers, aggressive contact tracing, possible both. Every time new domestic cluster, announce names, addresses movements new cases, effort identify, isolate test everyone came contact them, fails establish chain transmission, test entire cities. cannot hiding numbers trying type public contact tracing, process transparent definition. me, annoying see ""China lies"" comments made people idea China actually doing, believe skeptism healthy long basic research. Also, whistleblower mean Dr Li Wenliang, never arrested, threatened fired job shut up, went public instead officials backed eventually apologized. active social media died seems unlikely secretly arrested. Yes, know. upset graph. Show new one October. Someone tell stop testing. fix everything. Vietnam exactly said, China. ""what said"", epidemic suppression 101

What trying justify unjustifiable. first epidemic pandemic history world. know deal things. governments refused so, rich friends politicians live without increasing hoard gold several months. even begin get 1% number We‚Äôve blood shortages since April   people denied access care. 

Only ones would benefited hospital care, generally. isolated cases people hospital care get it, nothing new - doctors perfect always fuck hate disgustingly fake talking point. Deaths per capita way higher neighbouring comparable countries. Sweden done terribly deaths. counties way average deaths, point compare different strategies, absolute outcome.

No not, overall mortality far year infinitessimally higher last year, historically claim 2020 would even lower historical low without covid, would pulling stuff arse extremely improbable. Anyone basic understanding statistics see Sweden failure.

Since massive death, rest argument falls apart. stopped looking. Sars-1 eradicated. need vaccine. 

SARS-COV-2 same. people watch , glad don‚Äôt watch tv commercial radio. Life much nicer without.  said ""this country"". know talking about? course need replaced time, 2-3 wears little dramatic unless mean 16 hour stints high particulate environments. 

Even without electrostatic effect, N95 mask still much higher quality filter cloth mask. fact much air tight around edges (when properly worn) good start. 

Between US state governments, 3 trillion spent stimulus efforts (technically lot more, loans.. 3 trillion absolute floor). 3 trillion unbelievably massive amount money. $9,000 every man, woman, child United States. 

To put perspective major programs, Apollo program cost $200B today's dollars. Manhattan project done $30B today's dollars. World War II cost little 4 trillion dollars today's dollars. Let sink in: we've spent 7 months stimulus World War II production soldiers. stimulus good thing, get wrong, unfortunate little show practical effect. 

While throwing money problem solve everything - vaccines example still require time test - production high-efficacy masks **is** something solved throwing money it. raw materials plentiful, equipment used create (by modern standards) relatively simple produced quickly. 8 month lead time, 100-200 million masks week entirely feasible. 

Typical production costs N95 mask 50 cents. Even assuming rapid ramp (including accelerated depreciation equipment due short use time), worst case could scale 100 million cost $5 per - 10x price today. That's $50B make 200 million week year. would enough widespread distribution relatively frequent replacement cycles. test donated blood, dont see issue.

Even gay man comes directly clinic completely clean lab results, still denied. Even PreP can't get transmit HIV, denied. facts individual risk assessment determining factor blood donation, archaic broad-stroked standard. town. county. Workplaces always open spring. Bavarian state seems serious re-introduce spring lockdown rules (except hairdressers) every county 200cases/100k/week. autumn holidays schools week. State ministry education said holiday put whole state hybrid model.

Viral infections dangerous diseases human health worldwide, lead significant morbidity mortality year. importance lack effective therapeutic approaches, attempts made discover appropriate alternative complementary treatments. Melatonin, multifunctional neurohormone mainly synthesized secreted pineal gland, plays roles treatment viral infections. Regarding deadly outbreak COVID-19 across world, decided discuss melatonin functions various viral infections including COVID-19. Therefore, review, summarize current evidence melatonin therapy viral infections focus possible underlying mechanisms melatonin actions.

I'm angry Canadian withholding congratulations know everyone survives. important, way important these. Temperature measuring everywhere go. That's makes difference everyone seems forget that. intent pretty clear, thinks clearly trending downward late spring. clear.

""Normal"" comes much later downward trend. takes months according experts.

Regardless, makes sense use quote confirm claim order back claim. That's entire point. change ""it'll back normal"" ""we'll rapidly improving"" avoid looking like reading comprehension problem people making claim to. soon go watch football again? mean can't really argue comment merit though. state US political climate right now, distrust Trump administration, article closing vaccine safety office said administration desperately needed win GoP right now. definitely mind insignificant amount people.

Unfortunately, critical skills keen. like admit it, said, ""I'm dumb guy good memory"" think pretty accurate. that‚Äôs there‚Äôs covid spike right now, month opening schools? schools aren‚Äôt spreading disease? release already...what right dangerous releasing oxford vaccine prematurely Correct, five months time Victoria won‚Äôt see new surge cases like northern hemisphere reset back beginning pandemic levels.

Bonus, manufacturing local producers across world stop countries playing silly buggers shipments meant them. Well, Sant√© Publique France published updated list clusters cases. two common places contamination schools universities (35% clusters) workplace (20%). places wearing mask mandatory, even people followed perfectly, still take masks eat drink. example, high school work, wear masks day way us eat respecting social distances. 

A cluster 3 cases place, make 10% total cases, numbers put perspective. epidemiologists say majority contaminations happen friends family reunions home. law far keeps people seeing homes (except curfew 9pm country). guess we're good self regulating regarding that? 

I two coworkers caught covid. One wedding september, going bars without mask (because recently, could go bar take mask table, imagine, people get drunk talk etc). savings what? Money? vaccine ends anything greater 0.5% IFR inject billions ironically dangerous COVID-19. Testing thousand tell us might end giving serious complications hundreds millions billions given jab rushed, financially motivated vaccine. left governors attacked governors right thing. state republicans took away power whenever could governors health department officials even require masks. unfathomable witness someone history doctors medical professionals family. foreign enemy regime holding country hostage trying kill many people possible covid, would behave differently? ü§î People don‚Äôt seem get publicly drinking socializing put aside - six months - year - everyone participates. it‚Äôs nation heavily armed squeaky wheels complaining rights infringed going able quash virus without significant problems. would argue people China right free people United States.

If mean absence viral outbreaks, quite possibly even longer that.

If mean return ""normal"" behaviors re: mask wearing distancing, imagine determined population level nation nation, nations currently struggling virus overwhelmingly likely see dramatic drop measures post vaccination. They're hard time adhering now, mid-pandemic. say straight people can't get HIV? Also, aware MSM group banned due HIV risk? seen blood bank questionnaire before? ever talked Clinical Pathologist Blood Bank Doctor rules place? Based responses, I'm guessing no. appear base judgment solely faulty reasoning banning MSM donating automatically bigotry, without looking science evidence. reptiloids hired good actors create illusion flu killing us all. looks like really die! Yea hybrid lot vaccines days; see pairing flu. Cant wait hear call it. CoFlu, Fluvid. Im edge seat here. Want know I'm going gauge whether US-made vaccine approved political reasons?

Well, lots ways. big one whether bombshell vaccine-related announcement happens *before* November 3.

November 4 later? Probably good indication pay attention science. countries shopping malls, movie theaters, etc? think could ton people packed indoors, like countries. well hope happens next week. talking context next 6-12 weeks. Unfortunately enough political popular sort meaningful shutdown. course government decided pay feed people stay homes arrested left, could squash couple weeks. happen, hence Dr. Osterholm's realistic outlook. Wow that's probably got covid That's means, look EU they're exact thing. Operation Warp Speed couple things speed everything without sacrificing safety. main thing pay manufacturing make vaccine advance. contracts say ""If bust US gov still pay bill destroy useless vaccines."" right cuts year. thing tell every reviewer top priority. normally vaccine review hits desk someone FDA. working reviews dozen drugs vaccines puts queue gets month. calls meeting decide who's process begins. Warp Speed says ""When anytht COVID hits desk work first go back doing"" also cuts years. accurate, adds years treatment gets bumped. Maybe cure baldness better insulin delivery year later that's price fighting pandemic. 

What Trump tried do, got slapped, make CDC change actual safety guidelines evaluate against. Luckily companies CDC told pound sand. vaccine safe one sat desks CDC 4 years. find COVID-19 likely become leading cause death (surpassing unintentional overdoses) among young adults aged 25-44 areas United States substantial COVID-19 outbreaks. even close 2nd global warming.

We species can't see though.  Hmm... town like 90% hispanic, they're still early voting. thanks even though Paris public transit dirty compared cities, problem transit system whole urbanism couple big cities dragging millions people businesses wanting office centre. wanting worker coming 8:30 9:30 leaving 17:30 19:00 difference wait broken arm little longer die preventable death hypoxemia, happen first world countries peacetime. live alone stayed home since got sick beginning March. I'm done assholes.  obvious. meant well continue since comment London talking re-opening travel. ones laughing Wuhan scenes, reddit January/February, said fake, would never happen fault totalitarian regime... now? Yup, happened Wisconsin. passed bunch legislation lame duck session take power away governor, new Democratic governor less ability things without approval Republican legislature. Oh sorry. enough issues people even minimal steps US without worrying hygiene makes things worse! misunderstood you.

Thanks comments. argument keep posting? vaccine phase 3 testing phase 2 prove safeness vaccine. rushed compared historical vaccines? Hell yes science changed drastically well. trust doctors scientists...if Trump says safe say rush take it. say safe, Fauci says safe, FDC/CDC say safe first line (besides tens thousands people already taken it). Cloth masks recommended mask CDC every Asian country authoritarian. Hahaha Trucker Calzone. next thing we'll find they're eating baybuhs see numbers would drop (numbers, hospitalizations, deaths, etc.).  stop effectiveness argument. vaccine expected around 80% effective. ridiculous efficacy. pandemic everyone needs get vaccinated end, mainly primarily people at-risk essential workers. Nobody living like another year.

If want stay doors obviously guest. Yeah everyone bracing bad winter real projections late 2021 early 2022 peasants see anything real. optimistic Christmas. Northern IL order delivery winter. food guaranteed cold. uncommon us week long stretches -10f day.

Indoor dining bit tradition brutal winter months. respite get house. see many places surviving winter delivery takeout only. I‚Äôm doctor el paso. news reports correct. sensationalist. least using logic. people calling complete lockdowns likely know goes building business putting everything line.

Everyone wants save lives.. comes expense livelihood families. facts, completely understand would feel way. Operation Market Garden tremendous success! Indefinite deferral lifted 3 month deferral recent guidance. dry summer/fall HIV-negative, donate.

It's lagging standard sure, imagine someday deferral list allow monogamous relationships regardless orientation. Heterosexual folks slamming tinderellas town help blood supply either, kind sloppy standard. really - see people praising trainwreck article, keep repeating old mantras ""wear masks pepulh!!"" ""they beat New Zealand, great country, like Europe/the US/*insert random western country*"" even worse. vaccine comes out,it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôll stop wearing masks.It‚Äôs going take quite entire population vaccinated. 1) already taking PreP, means high-risk individual business donating blood. research shows people safe donors, banned, end story.

2) Monogamy asked cannot sure partner's monogamy. gay man may faithful, know partner faithful too.

3) Gay bisexual men comprise tiny minority general population. restrictions made, FDA took account impact amount available blood. Letting MSM donate restrictions likely improve blood supply, greatly increase risk HIV blood products. first thing shortages recruit eligible donors, loosen rules. reinfections mild/no symptoms, really matter? makes sense? sure whether used differently peacetime ""triage"" I'm aware ""deciding space patient"" rather term assessment assignment priority group patients.

Basically arrive ER broken arm someone comes heart attack, doctor triage says ""Heart attack first, broken arm later"". triage go home broken arm. triage even means wait hour longer broken arm.

So \*always\* triage emergency patients, least ER empty (which rarely experience). Obviously, type triage lets wait hour longer used hospital capacity decide whether need go another hospital, can't helped all. Perhaps last meaning people come associate ""triage"" pandemic, terrible use term always existed used every day. wrong. Click link, saying "" Total since start epidemic "".

There 823 hospitalizations last 14days ( scroll Daily report, pdfs german, french italian) giving democrats waaay much credit. Mission accomplished level cringe already sustained community transmission I'm sure would major impact. Biggest factor would lots people crammed airplanes, already have... Good people tired maybe they‚Äôll stay home take nap instead going out. may noticed, whatever restrictions put place, large numbers people flout them, inconvenienced. more, different things tried. Common sense? Hahaha. enough people we'd rid covid now. point clearly missed COVID widespread right now, going take least year people stop passing around rate puts us back ""normal"" zone.

The vaccines fully effective, assuring spread continues. get gloss that. limb? 


Either way results: get massive payout apology go holidays rest life. Yeah. 1/5000 chance go blind (or serious side effect) take something. need large sample group testing make sure it‚Äôs safe. so, spider man? really live near tall buildings. guess web-slinging trees would kinda cool bit. Would terrifying squirrels. not. get helicoptered burn center. super cool fast helicopter doped morphine, $50k cool. suppose ready September Oxford vaccine report uk tv doctor. 

The news today uk Oxford vaccine ready December  it‚Äôs even semantics people need google ‚Äúwave‚Äù and/or look chart I‚Äôm big believer herd immunity. seems like high case numbers extremely localized. here, look spain's data, graph cut 28 august
  
in data see number daily death eventually follow, close estimate IFR around 1%
 
at August 28, around 30 daily death, quadrupled since..
 
edit: second graph conveniently cut increase death.. going see Ozzy first time June got sick COVID happened Yeah, double blind, even researchers know without effort someone placebo  Yeah, I‚Äôm still laughing ‚Äú15 days slow spread‚Äù.  still see people calling whatever want. Using government demand constituents something inherently political.

My argument lack politicizing bothers you. don‚Äôt get it. Masks physical distancing absolutely essential right now. widespread inoculation public? That‚Äôs call dictatorship. thank you.

so essence, good possibility we'll able control virus enough make rarer, enough completely eradicate like smallpox? little concern vaccine itself. trust administration. beyond lack trust point. certainly believe murdering opposition would question, especially learning forced hysterectomies legal possibly criminal charges likely office. trusting literal death cult familiy's health. see r/coronavirus remember Europe ban U.S. travelers. longer case? hell would want live country? country put citizen first nightmare. really lot it? seeing it. believing Americans travel Europe, too. Perhaps bit both? Americans catching Europe bringing back home hometown + travellers Europe bringing in. Exactly. lot people assume everyone sit around house day work home. also think government sit print money keep ship afloat forever too.

People need get back work.. need smart way. PNW always ends best part USA. I'd much rather stuck anywhere PNW outside rest country practically hell-hole comparison. cannot expect people act immediate self-interest. **can** however hold accountable governments backstop *very real human instinct* safety net would allow public health addressed. that's definition Obama authoritarian Trump. know new law fetuses would died either way (and horribly), right? feel overblown media ""liberal bias""  tickets Rammstein got cancelled :( one reasons US trouble dealing COVID, lack consistent communication. different rules might work state borders closed, sadly case. there's change topic. Imagine thinking still can't get covid even avoid will; eventually people frightened sheer numbers deaths isolate voluntarily, kind herd immunity due sheer numbers already infected (herd immunity gradual, binary), weather improve five months so, people spend less time cooped indoors.

Most likely it'll combination three, there's reason pandemics come waves. 

Of course, getting point, exponential growth, extremely needlessly painful. People weak. ‚ÄúI know air raids, can‚Äôt sleep without lights on.‚Äù Boo freaking hoo. might much effort automated Well know blame that?

This exponential growth folks. small numbers need taken seriously. Thanks, China gift keeps giving giving. And? European countries significant cross-border movement every single day - tourism commuting well. SK doesn‚Äôt. 

This idea take one country‚Äôs approach expect work everywhere incredibly naive. young population massive advantage want low death-rate. Covid-19 numbers deflated? true deaths counted Corona caused diseases, like obesity? true survival rate overwhelmingly high? Im seriously asking, I'm fucking tired cognitive dissonance one side saying total scam others saying dangerous. course try research, honestly articles vague right official reports hardly answer questions. Corona scam bad perceived be? part yes. FHM can't make laws, government, rather riksdag can. government would also likely take questions public health account. think would possible, least theory government would go advice FHM, example economic reasons. I'm aware specif case happened regards corona Sweden.

But look countries certainly happens. believe example lockdown Denmark, rather parts due government initiative, grounded recommendation health ministry.  3d printed mask surgical mask filter (3-4 uses depending size surgical mask; skin contact. That's going whole U.S soon That's true, masks mandated wear them...

The myth US country that's fuck needs die already live community everyone wears masks. first time left house April now, I‚Äôve seen handful people public without mask, yes, bothered even spring. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre trying prove questioning behavior spring. What‚Äôs clear current stance based Trump‚Äôs blatant lies politicization crisis. 

You‚Äôve brainwashed, took Trump couple months settle brainwashing methodology masks = hoax. That‚Äôs sudden change mind. totally right, terminate fully develop unviable babies. Yep. Here's good example: Nigeria median age 18.6 3.3% population 65. France median age 41.7 20.5% population 65. Despite Nigeria 3 times overall population France, Nigeria less half number people 65 compared France. I'm Singapore. Yeah, enforce contact tracing too.

An infected person cooperate authorities contact tracing matters. solid evidence person knowingly gave false details whereabouts infectious period, fined ~US$7300 jailed 6 months.

People exposed infected person requested authorities quarantine. also enforced law.

The examples government using legal enforcement get people comply. 

In addition, agree Asians' attitudes towards pandemic also quite different Westerners. example, willing wear masks know prevent us getting sick. anti-maskers, fines imposed firmly dealt with. 

This willingness mask seen general population clamoring masks Jan/Feb 2020. Surgical masks scarce. Everyone trying buy surgical masks market. get any. Mask prices increased fivefold. criticized government 'well-prepared' enough provide enough masks general population. 

During time, benchmarking Taiwanese government. Taiwanese government back Feb 2020 already able allow every Taiwanese purchase 4 masks every week.

Now contrast anti-maskers US.... case much France close border Germany, likely would help Germany considering France much worse situation moment.

## Abstract

In first months deadly spread across world, Covid-19 mortality exhibited wide range variability across different nations. order explain phenomenon empirically, taken consideration publicly available data 106 countries parameters like demography, prevalence communicable non-communicable diseases, BCG vaccination status, sanitation parameters etc. ran multivariate linear regression models find incidence communicable diseases correlated negatively demography, improved hygiene higher incidence autoimmune disorders correlated positively Covid-19 mortality among plausible factors explain Covid-19 mortality compared GDP nations. Thanks belt road initiative enormous hidden spread China northern Italy January/February. spread continued around Europe since example Northern Italy dozens popular ski resorts season, lot congregation major airports around Milan, Genua etc. major European cities regular flights New York, many lands New Jersey Newark, flights stopped? need ask well known spread really China international flights left territory? important part vigil attempts certain nations rewrite sequence events.. Covid made painfully obvious world prepared handle global emergency, covid nothing compared pandemics, natural disasters conflicts could happen near future. El Paso issue, cities seeing surge TX? Bird watching? poor disproportionately affected I‚Äôm sure agree point. Likewise. love conversations based complete lack reading comprehension. read link provided. 0 mention 0 metrics covid increase blood demand. seem think link internet serve source. actually contain pertinent information. understand diffcult concept you. Next time, better judgement post dont want called shit post. Bye. Yeah, think ""blocked middle seats"" works super well regional jets without middle seat begin with. Autumn weather, schools reopen, people coming back holidays, partying celebration, less adherence mask rules. Take pick. Seed count matter, explodes anyway cold conditions now. countries like Belarus Greece almost cases spike too. maybe even could allowed summer without much risk. EvErYtHiNg OkAy SeNd KiDs BaCk ScHoOl, nEeD EdUcAtIoN    closing travel China stupid.  Realistically long compliance last? Christmas New Year real test. Nope, all...

Now, question you... hate much attack every opportunity? hurt someone personal experience government actually handled pandemic well dares offer criticism countries that? primary mode transmission, last two NZ cases surface transmission. yeah, understand there's way know. question ""what think?"" nice discuss see people's opinions/hopes align mine.

I'm optimistic regards vaccine. I'm UK can't wait able receive it. family abroad able since last year... day able feel guilty potential spread virus day finally them. now, mind overtly cautious part.

edit: words. Same. California re-opening, ""end pandemic number"" besides 0 cases maybe humans dumb  Also depends test. read article, 15 min test relatively high false negative rate compared PCR test takes days results. Yikes Indeed don‚Äôt think 4 week corrective actions help us much there. Yep.. tickets show March too.. feels like long ago. 

And Tenet.... ugh....... first winter covid northern hemisphere, March really winter anymore. virus spread out, everywhere, every area spreads simultaneously areas. think people starting get lazy public much agree new cases per capita higher US. Sorry make clear. point wanted make population size land mass shocking, handling lockdowns lot better. Ireland example went back full lockdown 6 weeks countries implementing measures countries. Meanwhile US white house chief staff said ""we're going control pandemic "" basically said going nothing vaccine arrives. imagine heading flu season terrible America! Breathtaking! course won't, saying can't ask, simply false. yeah, people done. Selfishness lack empathy species combination governments response continue kill people.

""It is"" depends death rate. It‚Äôs clear public prepared accept 1000 deaths day. jumps 5000 per day, think that‚Äôll change.  ruins portfolio

and that's know conservative happy marchtober 26th. 

the spring/summer blinked. maybe i've lost mind. watching travel videos Croatia really surprised little cases total disregard COVID measures. surprise exploded daily cases factor 10 now. Go Blazers really make sense based numbers though--even January Warp Speed supposedly like 200-300M doses across diff vaccines. (from remember). Even ""only"" 100M doses--I see squares like grandma doctors getting summer. mother law lives there. costs 700 zloties (like 200 USD) get covid test, pocket. ""The kids need real christmas."" Yeah thought social distancing intended buy us time vaccine actually beat Covid Conspiracy influenza might apt 500k attended contact tracing taking acknowledgment event could super spreader. meaning city state officials care contact tracing kept tab went 13,000 one year period. know reddit stupid sarcasm point maybe wear masks time flu season prevent deaths. mean like covid - know spread risk groups.

Yeah different states still listen someone else like US Government, EU something like that. Mask Mandates came quick governor's april publicly available mean people priority groups 3 4 (eg. general population), makes 70 - 80% US. try asking 365 million people that:) wait response. Fatigue sets geographical nature stuff, least US. Texas 1st wave July 2 months lockdown, NYC hand clear May still mostly shut down. cycle endlessly vaccine coordinated federal response, latter virtual impossible point. Ye  isolated island hundred cases come summer. 

Obviously western northern hemisphere countries see every variant lockdown tried across European countries. honestly idea, I'll damned we're getting visitors midwest states - Dakotas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Arkansas, Montana, Idaho, Nebraska, et al. I'd bank people coming Britain. know post talking about, aware ""excited awards"". shag gathering

first thing come mind circle-jerk

literally Personal knowledge guy a/c replaced couple months ago left every window house open fans appropriate locations better ventilation. uncle said this. 

He still travels country vacations ""isn't going let spoil retirement.""

He's also incredibly touch things due extreme wealth always funny / extremely depressing hear takes things. 

My favorite one far: ""they'll close churches virus, let people take bus 'work'. Either shut it, stop closing churches. people talk separation church state."" 

So wants everyone go work, he's also government providing aid people, people lazy whatever conservative talking point hes using week.

TLDR: [*internal ifs. 

The problem virus forces people think like that. look X. failing badly? fix it? 

Not every situation needs comparison another. kids across street taken CPS mean youre good parent kid line upstairs sells shit. Trump? Borat? Wawaweewa! Inb4 coMoRBiDiTiES dOuUUuu new meaning 'danse macabre' COVID-19 disease. SARS-CoV-2 virus. sure importance distinction though. tragic regardless, really wish they'd make groups tighter age specific. 

If age large factor, there's massive difference 25 year old 44 year old. 

Seeing there's deaths 16-24 age range, I'd imagine deaths skew heavily 40-44 crowd. 

Again, makes difference, seems like misleading group could get better idea split middle. can't ask people that? Rather give year life potentially dying causing others death, resulting losing rest lives.

One year small price pay comparison latter. Canada. Eastern Canada bad, Ontario QC shutting Seems like governments encountering everywhere. either 1) eliminate like Australia/New Zealand via strategic lockdown 2) eliminate via massive, unprecedented test/trace isolate system. 

Insanity repeating something hoping different results...maybe US/EU/Iran need change strategies? Honestly real challenge begins winter comes. it‚Äôs Leiden regional news ages. I'm right bro. 

We lot people virtual school, number virtual learning drop second 9 weeks point consolidate two virtual classrooms one grade level. occurring parallel getting new covid case emails campus average one per week.

Smh.  suppose I'm taking issue wording ""publicly available"". given first responders, publicly available--I agree. However, give elderly say Jan-Feb, moderately ""publicly available"" public getting it. Starting say Mar-Apr teachers lots 2nd tier folks get it, would consider publicly available. agree take 21' get full vaccination every last person--but pandemic going face MAJOR headwinds vaccination rate goes Tbf, think west moved mask debate, non wearers wear regardless arguments.

Yeah like, wear masks, big fines wear it, done deal week.

And yes TTI, stupid get around that.

The debate also really people pushing various measures - idiots attacking masks lockdown, state others defend them. become like defensive debate, think maybe factor govts go beyond mask-and-lockdown combo. understandable, gets information mainstream news outlets. GOP Governor, bumbling response, DEM Governor, poor soul chance inevitable act god. it? link source you‚Äôre referencing? Good thing Airlines require masks. What's point? flu know it, wear mask. Seems pretty straightforward. So? many people travel NY states, verus UK NY.... article notes ones UK tested. Here's piece genuine advice, half population stupid. educated stupid; trained something equal stupid. Look population stupid believe me. sit watch listen stupid people, quite entertaining recognize it, stupidity bit misleading. Netherlands temporarily 1700 ICU beds (before corona crisis, 1150 beds). today 506 patients ICU. increase seems slowing bit, it‚Äôs (hopefully) unlikely increase peak April 1400+ patients.

However time around, hospitals want continue regular health care much possible that‚Äôs patients spread out. Belgian patients could allowed occasionally, structurally. They're already trying signal boost speculation vaccine ""ready"" christmas countries completely immunized then. ridiculous, see many comments comparing U.S. response European response I'm thinking, ""hello, Asia?"" People fighting two mounds dung smell worse. pandemic? supporters blinded ignorance can't see ludicrous holding rallies pandemic is? baffles enrages me. Missed cancer screenings unlikely produce spike deaths relatively short period. would expect drawn effect. thought Moderna cold freezer storage Pfizer needs super cold storage.

But refrigeration-only makes distribution 100 times easier compared freezer Units produced... distributed. good times, people want give freedom.

In bad times, regret it. easy us hindsight. Thank fucking god watched like six times realized loop. Fully expect Wednesday numbers 30k. case positivity rate insane. TBF one I'm worried Juan Williams. He's democrat Fox's ""The Five"" talk show (and probably whole network?) one moron. Fairly moderate since bring ""balance"" Fox single voice reason.

He okay 4v1 debate Greg sarcastic pricks every damn show. Fair balanced ass. Hope stays healthy. ‚Äúmask casket‚Äù

I'm ready bury parents hemp sacks catch seeing 9K weekly average? see 5301.1 I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm stupidity. prepared hear lot ""But **tHankSgIvIng** / **CHriStMas**!! love us? fAmILY! Meemaw miss you!"" I‚Äôve seen younger children, least, unlikely vectors transmission, young people may quite ‚Äúplague rats‚Äù may imagine.

You've clearly never worked school. educational level bad is, imagine special need kids cannot otherwise receive education, remote worthless gets. one kids IEP (not special need related) struggle month back person already see difference. cannot imagine severe needs children suffering much longer time recover ends. spreading gap disabled children peers promote okay ""greater good"" 

Id personally give restaurants, salons etc... anytime schools remaining closed, priority futile stuff like non essential businesses. Maybe lockdowns work

We lockdowns 4+ months kinda non-sequitor dismiss them. Clearly 90% normality open bars colleges work. 


The lockdowns never intended eradicate COVID-19 *forever*. Lockdowns intended stop gap measure give us time adopt nuanced approach. 


This like Alpha Teams book World War Z (a fiction book whose realistic approach pandemics becomes clearer everyday). lockdowns intended tamp hysteria &amp; flatten curve, aka give hospitals factories breathing space improve treatments equipment supply. lockdowns tamped death rate. NY hospital garages longer covered dead bodies. awhile, lockdowns succeeded remarkably. 


Europe America alike fumbled next step. Amazingly badly. Lockdowns buy time. lockdowns cannot defeat human nature. takes hard leaderpship. West governed incredibly irresponsible pol1tical caste want quick easy path. rush reopen bars allow profitable large-scale 250+ gatherings understandable. also clearly incredibly deadly. stumbled trying reopen back 100% normal. aimed 75%.


Europe fumbling badly USA capitalist reasons. suspect USA's case numbers worse counted, would make high death totals understandable, agree. EU surprisingly badly again.  Based historical use wave, think first wave anymore. first wave last winter (spring here) went summer. second wave winter (fall here).

Obviously use word wave poor we're trying mitigate keeping cases within predefined range. They'll constantly jump range somewhere other. No, waggle eyebrows point aggressively mouthing ""look here!"" needs suck stay home, least get test results. Period. test negative, go back (but still supposed self-quarantine full 14 days.) seemed like pick side stick it, discourse allowed. 

This really thing really stinks. specific problem Colorado rule (the 2 household rule lifted live alone) can't protest without lumped whackos. study one thus far demonstrating in-flight transmission SARS-CoV-2 extensive onwards transmission. In-flight propagation patterns merit study. Health advisories personal responsibility, augmented state airline checks, preclude travel symptoms. Stringent on-board infection prevention control measures vital reduce risk symptomatic asymptomatic in-flight transmission. Restriction movement arrival robust contact tracing essential limit propagation post-flight.  Ahhh, there's suddenly bunch people saying ""THE VACCINE READY CHRISTMAS!""

The stock market dropped, cases time high worldwide going Holidays means consumer spending, consumer holiday travel tanking hard. I'm referring new daily cases, deaths. FREEDOM...and HERD IMMUNITY...and ECONOMY!!! Masks social distancing mandated Poland. Yet, happened. think shutdown would help much. sure why, mask mandates seem make impact. Look plotted graph end linked study, steadily going even mask mandate. invalidate masks, suggests mask mandates may crucial. find study says anything want. others showing opposite, especiallyy among middle high schoolers. reality numbers show transmission happening levels adult faculty staff would danger. literally coronavirus levels 3 4 times higher first shut schools.
it would like waiting worst winds hurricane go pretend over. think important place here: neatly encapsulates early intervention key, late interventions harbinger worse things come.

Unchecked exponential growth scary thing. yes, Coronavirus necessarily ""unchecked"", even muted exponential growth good. And, video mentions, virus spread actually logarithmic, start plateau, distinction meaningless. Asian countries don‚Äôt know western nations developed herd immunity, either deaths vaccinations, start traveling over. Sheesh! clusterfuck! Either way, think public accepting many flu illnesses result hospitalization death. almost certainly room improvement. guess Stock Market talking ‚ÄúCOVID, COVID, COVID‚Äù! afraid covid stay inside. ‚úåÔ∏è well actually forgot Poland Nope. I‚Äôve already seen bunch posts rise cases deaths definitive proof masks don‚Äôt work. ELI5: People richer countries tend older sicker, got hygiene healthcare. susceptible Covid. link autoimmunity correlation w/o causation bcg status. lived like slum-dwellers died 50 COVID wouldnt problem.

Useless study telling commonplaces. Main thesis (autoimmunity) supported guesswork w/o proof causation.

Also author makes effort balance under-diagnosis under-counting poor-country settings, quite astonishing me. Even Italy? proposed priority groups US. Gen pop 


""‚ÄúFor three, six, nine months, people wanting vaccine vaccines,‚Äù said Stephane Bancel, chief executive officer Moderna Inc., biotechnology company developing one furthest-along inoculations.""  They're going announce new measures Wednesday.  ""blood shortage"" biggest scam ever. Nobody ever died get blood transfusion. definitely huge stockpile blood somewhere government saving reason talk full normalcy, would assume included examples. Huh, must blue city, right? Police officer  secret Perfect OK, fact, provide numbers support it. true, super easy prove. prove it. blind faith? 


Fauci February"" Masks effective"" that's hospitals full lmao. Enjoy permanent lung damage, bro. Fuck pricks like you. think works hospitals grocery stores? Privileged asshole. 538 gave trump 1/3 chance winning model election night That's odd, NYC got notification would blood drive neighborhood looked signing (since I'm anything better middle day) slots already filled. Well yes, politicians ones power slow down. It‚Äôll probably like early videos coming China showing bodies street hospitals. better, stupe idiots levels.  point restrictions listed removed eased quite time ago, including 1 hour rule (shifted back 2 hours last month dropped altogether last week) ""All schools closed"" rule (dropped stages starting early month) ""1 person"" rules (eased stages 10 people). Many rules scheduled eased dropped starting next Sunday; although press conference coming 20 minutes could wind day back soon tomorrow Wednesday.


EDIT: End tomorrow night! retail opens midnight restaurants cafes opening, ""4 reasons"" rules dropped! 25km rule go Nov 8! Waiting...for people demand healthcare gun point. gonna get nasty  Socially malicious? prepare socially resented. isn‚Äôt unfair. makes sense - thought referring things like going bar etc. Probably youth trust science Facebook posts muH RiGhtS expecting they'll options previously terms things do? Events, theater, concerts, etc? Must admit also grew there, EL Paso love wrought iron! Haha. def bad parts town break-ins overall it‚Äôs one safest US cities. Fauci &amp; many others say expect vaccine within first half 2021. Again, believe him.

Let's reply clearly see eye eye won't. Dfw also big uptick hospitalizations covid positives also. matter time dfw looks like el paso  snooping involved, name comes w/ big red the_donald tag next it....wow almost 500 posts, part problem That's weird know Texas democrat state /s serious? Australia south equator. I'm informed that. adding experience comparison stay-at-home (Covid) vs total lockdown (like boston bombers). 
Obviously lockdown lasted several hours, board get dingus, complied. Covid going work even days unless there's concrete plan assistance place make sure people apt comply.  get regular flu covid time? ‚ÄúCome on, man!‚Äù Joe actually asking. Last checked wasn‚Äôt political subreddit. Putting negative google reviews now. Sure, clear. 

My take lockdown = Australia done recently Victoria essential services open, limited cross-household gatherings, generally keeping people homes regardless time day. Local variances specifics course.

Near = within limited (call usually 10-20%) icu like bed capacity range vagueness account even wider local variations. country / state smaller capacity may feel critical point higher percent bigger one course:

I doubt many places throttle restrictions advance. It‚Äôs willingness really stop social interaction, non essential person commerce mobility don‚Äôt see places getting early I‚Äôm sure health experts say should.  people america would riot over

only white people cages tho :/ businesses already dead men walking. global economic shifting event, they're chopping block. Now, would rather save lives, try extend life already terminal businesses? PHONE?! would, two times I've done it, passed out. 

Although passed low blood pressure took blood. I'm older high blood pressure....so maybe would work. Hmm. Check state Victoria Australia.
Zero cases last 24 hours (from 750 day 2 months ago).. weeks opening relatively normal Christmas controlled virus. People still relaxed summer loosening restrictions. Even Calgary (Canada) know people weddings parties realizing virus way infectious typical flu. violating capacity limits like crazy here. least one wedding got 80% infection evening people went visit relatives hospitals creating outbreaks there.

&amp;#x200B;

Summer might introduced much drop vigilance. even admit - although wear mask - I'm even close paranoid March/April. Thanks guys posting this. It‚Äôs easy forget people right thing don‚Äôt make news reason. 

Stay safe. It‚Äôs possible careful. say this? Thanks advance. government strict rules company must fire employees tested positive, give additional compensation lost job pandemic (due business) aren't. They've fix fuck ups woods yet. that's virus, shattered economy. hele free, free ambulance cities wanna cut idiots calling small cuts common cold. Read article... essential worker. Yeah, one first thoughts is, we're headed another shut-down, we? Which, really stupid part is, we'd shut correctly first place, problem! hand, shutting already box much. Yeah, mean, cut eyebrow open spring probably needed stitches. Didn‚Äôt go COVID-19 fear much would cost. healed okay hide scar makeup, whatever. keep touch much frequently beginning slowed bit. I'm one lives alone, siblings parents pretty busy full lives still right talk though time (or need) connect daily. I'm making excuses feeling sorry myself, is. perfectly honest, much love person, find phone, facetime, discord, etc. provide fulfillment. Like said though, I'm fine, venting bit. predicting would summer 2021 think even that's optimistic people get covid, 1% die regardless treatment, 4% die hospitalized (rough numbers partially guesswork accurate ratio).

So hospitals overwhelmed, multiply death rate 5 subtract number beds new death count.

That Italian death rate got high. Haha wishes. thinking moving wants win lottery afford move. get coming from, fine there's real rush. head. Yeah usually set local cities reduce non required calls. Usually like $20 call common cold (yes know might legit reason always) felt like shit like $200. mean, given half nation practicing absolute worst behavior right now, can't say assumed same. entirely fault assume worst see worst daily. That‚Äôs El Paso ya. Thank kindly!!!  gave blood first time years 2 months ago, part offered include free antibody test. However waiting 5 weeks (they said takes 2) called finally figured they'd messed sample day getting blood (they said clotted), never contacted it. really like treated that. Even called spoke someone charge, told wanted another antibody test I'd full blood donation again. bad give blood people need since I'm type O, feel like used ignored. groups work way, something standard? mind giving blood again, really want deal people anymore know hierarchy works blood donation. Yes live city 5 million mandated masks boom, 700 cases day 0 cases 2 months, done country dumb people listen.   need income, take risk. feel need keep working use safety measures can. Washing hands often touching face greatly reduce risk. Wearing masks social distancing helps well. 

This crazy year. Best luck family. Yep.  Sometimes permitted ‚Äústrongly urge‚Äù. trust Fauci

OK, find Fauci provided evidence claim vaccines proven efficacy.

I trust science numbers. Show numbers. believe everything told without actual numbers? Damn would easy pull scam do. Yep family got last week throughout family friend network testing positive. It‚Äôs month reckoning Ohio. am. cold. Let's forget, going go away, like magic. Eventually. least gotta give credit one, *eventually* disappear, probably *sometime* heat death universe. hope people anti-masks refuse occupy hospital bed ""man up"" home, expecting consistent views instead giant hypocrites much. Vaccine development doesn‚Äôt start cases surge saw version number 2 different thread sub. said cloth masks without change behavior nothing. Agreed social distancing. country pretty compact largest city Seoul slightly populous NYC London. Asian countries implemented 1 1.5 distancing compared 6 ft (2 m) guideline here. Yes, Fuck no. People need fight back yeah gonna like wuhan leaving bodies lying around hallways/vans people dead street one wanting risk getting near comments, I'm sure understand spread works. wearing mask protect others. purpose mask protect others, case know showing symptoms.

On flip side, mask way silver bullet preserve health. Hand-to-face contact biggest threat. Wearing mask without proper hand-sanitizing technique pretty-much guaranteeing infect take mask off.

Spread word. matching infection count curve? Bernie hates private insurance Why?  figure places follow suit soon enough. I‚Äôm willing bet we‚Äôre going nationwide shelter place order come November/December. border crossings open normal? thought closed. Geez one thing we've going us (not island away rest world) politicians took seriously start. Also: it‚Äôs tech I‚Äôm embarrassed city, right now. nope, sorry gonna happen

no coming back $8M per well $200k 56 wells? you‚Äôre making shit least consistent. also exiting respatory season Northern Hemphasphere heading back it.

Northern Hemphasphere easy time summer moderate restrictions (outside US states decided nothing). 

But heading back cases exploding going lockdown again. Yes. wide range symptoms. impact every system body - skin circulatory nervous urinary even reproductive. Jeeze, that‚Äôs terrible. Moderna Pfizer certainly seem raise larger immune response adverse reactions. Pfizer's non-human primate data also completely pantsed Oxford vaccine. accurate. negative test within less seven days exposure ""is very, poor indicator whether virus board,"" said Dr. Alan Wells University Pittsburgh Medical Center: Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.

I search flair every day see latest updates, especially vaccine front. Like general sentiment, hopefully get one end year full rollout early 2021.

I hate fact bean counters workplace paint apocalyptic scenario every time talk company's future - always harping saying it'll never go away citing fact SARS never vaccine even 16 years.

I'm like mate... SARS pretty much controlled we've never seen much resources put collectively Covid-19 vaccine. matter rather if. Agreed. I'm glad stopped working intensivist. telemedicine note. Still getting calls emails CC jobs across country. Definitely consider working hot spots places taking Covid seriously. lose license pension, eligible social security. Texas basically fuck teachers either way. realize Texas almost 1,000 miles wide, right? Houston average humidity 60 90%. El Paso‚Äôs average humidity 10 35%. 

State averages stupid using disparate numbers. Texas too, high entire upcoming week 67 low 39(f). Ask anyone state that‚Äôs cold say yes. Yeah, Newsom said 3 households, 2 hours less, outdoors. thanksgiving! California mild everything outdoors weird tradition wise.  honestly want skip everything. It‚Äôs good time. :( [A squall line PCP meth holding vaccine publicly available. sure large portion population refuse take wait..and know what...the world won‚Äôt wait them.  prolife. Wow. Ah yeah, that's shy Tokyo Delhi. I'm NYC metro we're around 20m (with LA metro coming second 13m).

I'm constantly impressed South Korea's contact tracing ability, willingness virtually citizens compassion others, government's targeted efforts curb spread. Obviously exclusive South Korea China, Vietnam, Taiwan, Hong Kong, etc done (albeit targeted lockdowns). western world, none that. Although say city got hit hard, learned, seen spike since initial one April (same much Northeast US).

I good friend Singapore also impressed precise quickly MOH able determine origin cases names contact info. Besides huge oversight migrant dormitories, virtually community spread months. They've successful NZ Asian countries I've mentioned. Fellow ohioan, crazy masks policies implemented. new job public allowed building staff front dont wear masks distance.

Lol I‚Äôll let one tell them. went grand forks once. college town, (well college town it) still nothing really apart bars.

Then went Minneapolis, great time there. Cool city.

North Dakota like stepping onto alien planet come New England.

I'm even like cities, much country me. advises masks social distancing 2022 earliest estimation

Well, fuck. Republicans gone fucking nuts 

 still semi-respectable doubt Texas would purple-ish blue scenario describe

 Bush/Palin/Rick Perry/Trump done lot damage dumb. Republicans really embraced anti-science, anti-all science, roll.

 Republicans used anti certain science science general. Universities Scientists working Exxon spreading false information publicly feuding health officials.

So similar, they're shutting businesses. person appears time traveler April 2020 would stunned there's increase really clue many be. Depends many factors. Yeah, there‚Äôs lot getting vaccine, giving it, done. Even vaccine relatively effective (say 70% so), there‚Äôs still enough circulating lots vaccinated people get it. get numbers cases down, take 1) vaccine that‚Äôs effective, 2) widespread acceptance vaccine, 3) many months continued mask wearing/social distancing. Late 2021 / early 2022 likely bet something like ‚Äúnormal‚Äù return. None us want hear that, we‚Äôve got calibrate expectations. We‚Äôre closer halfway point finish line. I'll believe see it. 22 days sounds really really long. sure that‚Äôs people vents Ooof bad yeah went saturday vote. live El Paso voted early... told friends same. Thankfully listened Actually technically vaccine approved timeline decided virus. decided fast production distribution ramps up. wish could deny medical aid broken advice/rules. Would make people think twice spouting bullshit stupid shit. Yeah people affordable, family survive going El Seguro bc that's covered jobs there's way could afford going El Paso hospitals. ""only one person per family member allowed""
That means whole family allowed right? numbers probably exact. However, given lack harsh lockdowns quarantines fairly certain mainland china lot better Europe US. point think Chinese numbers closer many cases actually numbers US. COVID bad China US would impossible hide it. able shunt cases regionalities help adjust hospital load? Vaccines slated like January end?

NSW 53 deaths Victoria 817 deaths. big fuck ups aftermath pressing. NSW contained quickly well. Victorian contact tracing hand made Hotel Quarantine spiral fuck control. Hotel Quarantine even big issue, simply catalyst. Contact Tracing sucked hardcore led mass community transmission 10 times seen elsewhere country.  


So yeah media mean DA, Vic Govt fucked hardcore crucial months May/June. üò¢ piece scientific literature came last year looking extreme events affect climate change them. forget specifics, one takeaway different events different timescales see majors effects.

I remember though heat waves early effect right hurricanes late effect. is, uptick extreme heat waves expect see 20s 30s much result climate change.

Hurricanes, hand, take quite decades say ""Yup, that's result climate change"".

I think saying hurricanes affected all. rather next year there's deadly heat wave deadly hurricane, science say caused heat wave. would incorrect say evidence caused hurricane. Contact tracing means fuck now. can't contact trace 80,000 people every single day. Yup. winter four-five months out. article's photo Spain. Why? Salt Lake Tribune photo dated June 9, 2020.  Yeah, horse left barn August. measures taken October mostly token. It‚Äôs becoming clear two ways countries successful 1) locking hard eliminating (nz AU) 2) creating massive contact test trace system (most Asian countries) 

The EU US strategy compliance, social distancing, marks, restrictions clearly failure, honestly maybe never sustainable (for western country 365 million people). Sorry, don‚Äôt think was. 

And far gone implement strategy. Americans care want chance take things granted again. correct pick besides. impending catastrope combination government incompetence, decades neglect healtcare system societal failure act rationally. No, not.

I'd total agreement \~72 hours later start thinking going back normal. someone currently cash gang would pretty awesome. I've hospitalised covid hospital Poland pretty empty, like 2 months ago. Wanna see photos empty covid hospital room? :D AFAIK bigger problem staff beds. enough trained health care workers. can't really show photos, ask people treating patients patients themselves. people freaking social media - freaking myself, still regularly see hardcore fearful posts FB. Media milking fearful articles like usual, people going crazy ruling could make abortion illegal. went point today saw protesters blocking roundabout, medical ambulances trying use, gross behaviour. whole thing glorified media. Also, friends ofc virtue signalling social media right now. Changed words allowed use certain phrases lol Still waiting reddit something r/nonewnormal

How many deaths sub responsible for, wonder? hockey curve :( sounds much like US March April... I'm sorry. think problem lot current scientific information. Many things science complicated clauses, can't always break laymens terms. think world needs better job ensuring rhat evrry citizen fundamental knowledge basic biology chemistry least, since fields literally govern physical existence

PS. Physics isnimportnt everyday like bio chem Remain vigilant, sincerely wish best. Dying hallways comparing Norway Finland, point beginning? insist making bad faith arguments? 12th worst outcome world. you‚Äôre trying make point cases, well CFR also terrible. Make sure chalk guest's tires. I'm bee. need get back hive. Don‚Äôt shut up, demand rights. don‚Äôt knock others same.    even traveling ? forget pandemic use amazing resource next time need help new excuse see people ""pandemic fatigue."" telling wear mask,‚Äù Paul said rally Nick Freitas, Republican candidate Congress central Virginia, streamed Freitas‚Äô Facebook page. ‚ÄúThe cloth masks‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm telling truth, don‚Äôt work. Ninety-seven percent viruses go cloth unclear Paul gotten figure. public health researchers consistently found cloth masks, less effective surgical masks N95 masks, critical way stop spread coronavirus, drastically reduce range droplets expelled person‚Äôs mouth nose. Recent research University Washington, example, found 95 percent people wear cloth masks within six feet others, would reduce COVID-19 spread 30 percent.

These people absolutely crazy. Vote out! Hold up, what? released data yet? understanding Oxford vaccine didn‚Äôt prevent infection early animal studies, decreased severity. someone w/ POTS, I‚Äôm excited science may pay attention devastating health issue think people annoyed simple rules aren‚Äôt followed gets conflated saying nobody anything ever. consider extrovert personally haven‚Äôt huge problems isolating. doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt feel do, however think people still following rules restrictions. means wearing masks, meeting friends outdoors can, trying minimize risk everyone. Unfortunately often see people wanting wear mask follow basic distancing rules think they‚Äôre immune don‚Äôt care. adhere basic simple rules, like wearing mask, things would much safer open much faster everyone. don‚Äôt problem people wanting socialize, problem people shirking rules using excuse people overreacting crazy. speak myself, I‚Äôm asking people conscientious follow easy rule one wear mask try keep distance. federal government sent military hospital ships stockpiled ventilators ready sent state overwhelmed, neither things even really needed yet. one specifically made pandemic type scenarios mean. normal extra rooms. literally told month go would 50,000 cases day mid October  Whether you‚Äôre outside not, risk *definitely not* microscopic considering eating ONE thing cannot mask on. seems like you‚Äôre moron able grasp basic concept. don‚Äôt pretend want support local businesses.

Covid 19 trying steal election!

Can‚Äôt wait hear Fox tries spin one. told stop arguing her, waste time causing anger. Thank you, better afternoon, every night fever horrible chills, still worried. percentages false positives vs false negatives? read test positive, 98% likely it. test negative, 70% likely it. missing. arguing 2% here? that's possible vases invasive track-and-trace system. Eh, pretty wide, west need help get  shit, keeps holding events thousands people. 3 days.

Data seems horrible ""bad"".

It represents increase 37% last weekend data (which way European countries growth).

It also includes ""a ray hope"". Average 17K per day, 20K Spain Thursday Friday. Finger crossed 20k last week anomaly.

(Note: Spain significant decrease cases reported weekends compared week Average. use report less deaths week average tough :S).

(Note 2: happened past regions failed report Monday. Hope happened today... checked)

Edit: 56%, 37.

Edit 2: no... Lol... 37%. I'm tired. Sorry. Everyone comments saying it‚Äôs stupid 4D level chess. Vaccine costs money citizens demand free. cure may never come costs nothing.

When vaccine hits, rich Brazil first line get shots. People sub weekend saying America third wave like America get first One scariest things government's god-awful response pandemic continuing put unnecessary stress healthcare workers (plus taking granted acting they're obligated come day), run risk mass exodus workers say ""fuck this"" move find less dangerous job.

I'm sure lot health professionals willing make sorts sacrifices ""greater good,"" definitely lot wouldn't.

poshhhhhhhhh-pffffffffffffffffft Holy shit, 40% month! That‚Äôs really bad news. Good questions. They'll probably blame Obama. born raised Rio Grande Valley, people would come cross border Mexico could get affordable procedures prescriptions. I‚Äôm wondering it‚Äôs actual increase asymptomatic cases, suggesting mutation. mutations cause virus less severe equally contagious. type mutation reproductively successful. Would bev nice know serve constant reminder U.S. healthcare system absolute joke. definitely bat coronaviruses always oozing human population, bounce human population without really spreading.

Merchants Doubt great read btw looking something do. i'Ve nEvEr sEeN fULl eMeRgEnCy rOoMs Dark winter coming.. got this!!! Midnight tomorrow. beating door kmart morning. Yes correlation there. However definitive link established. Areas without lockdowns saw similar decreases. could find correlation rising temperatures higher grocery store stocks toilet paper, mean things (necessarily) effect Welcome February Lol mark name like jews ww2 something jesus guys sick. President's plan working perfectly. trial prioritize giving vaccine placebo people likely contact virus, like medical professionals essential workers hotspots. One popular [English speaking French recently traveled Turkey plane, walked around everywhere hugging people kissing cheek without mask went back France. think people France give shit anymore since dude hiding apartment April Like miracle Hit 100k go milli.

GOP thought tried discouraging voting mail members. forget people would go normally emergency treatment. seemed like basically saying wasn‚Äôt happening anymore. agree, said, feel like don‚Äôt crazy people constant moan ‚Äú freedom‚Äù questions effectiveness masks. Yeah good luck getting anyone buy point view. know Reddit likes take think distancing masks brainer lot need peek outside basement window sometimes. world barely stopped vaccine becomes widespread, distancing going window.

Americans can't even distance mask mid pandemic, jab floodgates opened. remember back like May think saw banner plane fly overhead times (south OC area) said something like ‚ÄúImpeach Newsom‚Äù next portrait him. Haven‚Äôt seen one tho.  
 
Also apparently Trump Newport Beach last week fundraising probably kicking super spreader event contagious entourage. Yeah, I‚Äôll continue wear mask social distance (admittedly slightly less strictly first 4-5 months) foreseeable future. made political issue baffles seemed likely back January February watching pandemic China... space.

Life pro tip: see impact virus space, going global pandemic. also ""reopening economy"" flawed. big chunk economy staying we're failing get situation control there. Wow, wonder Penn State football dodge scandal big? Well looks like corona got new friend. Viruses, bacteria, prions going start specialize humans since killing organisms living us abundant prey must passage Oxygen 3:16 what's normalize for? everyone population participates science technology.

Lmao yeah people literally always say like that. Like masks ears. I'm pretty sure need moment care. care that.

Joplin, MO That's nothing Joe Biden Democratic Congress fix... Free market pretty much wartime government make things happen without much push back public. Capacity freedom.... first thought. Especially since state leaning towards democrat. virus definitely real definitely deadly smell somethin a‚Äôcookin guess, several weeks month. need look Israel lockdown, absolute number ill people, death rate, positivity rate goes down, lockdown stay. North Korea lockdown since pandemic. So... voting gonna factor that? Congratulations Victoria. Restrictions easing midnight tomorrow. job well done. Except rich* Hopefully judging sea Trump signs rural counties I'm crossing fingers people talking immigrants

Yes, I'm aware. Glad we're page.

best luck  already fair amount adult population, given NJ lack old, well obese, diabetic ages. Fauci must gotten tired ""third wave"" bullshit we've hearing, never got past first one. dad uses barometer proof Trump going win mocks small Biden rallies. dad engineer smart guy. don‚Äôt understand dumb this. thinks way Trump loses election fraud. ‚Äúeveryone knows‚Äù voting Trump. crap. lives Alabama works engineers associates people church people agree everything. sure, 100 people know Alabama determine election already netherlands would glad help Others  guess population density kinda helps. US pretty individualistic society. Lots cars individual travel, lots separation people (of course cities) It‚Äôs going 2022 beyond. respected scientist actually said that

[Fauci literally said masks distancing around 2022 last boomer Governor -""Can make simpler? numbers long sentences confusing."" wild handled. city mild lockdown (midwest USA) way back. well less 100 cases total that. 100+ day, increasing, officials calling ""recovery phase"" still. Wonder match ranking new cases per capita. thought North Dakota worst. China good job virus. Sure shady af, always top it. usa? intel months ago act it.

China give fk world, care themselves. damn well job it. atrocities China did? Well, good job handling virus time complete monster. yet American coworkers convince part global hoax designed undermine Trump. can‚Äôt make conspiracy stuff up.

I wish best suffering Poland. heard em boys, thread commandeared.

This Trump thread now. person responding literally never said CCP great. They're saying matter China did, coronavirus knowingly around way got really bad fact countries done anything proper countries fault. Seems immunity long lasting rare get reinfected far Look, I'm staying inside unless necessary, people follow ideology since there's rule it, people forced go time want go out. thing happened months ago enforced time-frames sports, taking kids park on. meant people activities concentrated hours. 

Best scenario would be, people common sense go necessary, case would able go walk every (it's healthy 24/7 home), even night there's one around, since they're trying avoid people parties, that's one easiest ways limiting them, however, already see people really able follow rules parties friends house sleep they're street 6am. 

Obviously complicated issue, understand they're trying come solutions, really one-fit-it-all, even though also understand impossible control whole nation million different rules depending thousand different factors, think I'm allowed complain even live city can't go even could find top 5 people 30 min walk, sometimes even 1. Lifestyles vary lot one area other. thing is, responsable cautious enough follow rules, care party meet friends family even risk paying 6000‚Ç¨ it. sure people look graph three big humps it, define hump wave. definition ""wave"" change COVID? Also that, yes.  It‚Äôs rules edit titles. I‚Äôve posts removed added name ‚ÄúJohn Campbell‚Äù title videos title short post. always short titles like ‚Äúupdate.‚Äù Titles need 25 characters post. adding name wasn‚Äôt allowed. 

That‚Äôs way rules enforced here.

Actual title ‚ÄúRt COVID-19‚Äù may long enough either. Good question, clear post. think mask wearing become normalized US required. could see individuals wearing masks travel, flu season, feel weather, even large indoor events. would think would much common cities rural areas, now. Special education IEPs forgotten pandemic. one talking them. 

Children like 1st grade daughter IEPs gened basically screwed included exclusion special ed self contained. went back week 2 prior others closed may exception made schools know daughter benefit it. 
At least help since husband WFH, may notify boss close shitty employee bit (he understanding totally cool everything joke it, fortunate)

Tempting fate? Hopefully sense trend become inevitable, one districts closes follows domino effect town one last dominos standing long? matter school case 1 2 month successfully contained.

Parents whose kids stayed remote loud district choice getting nerves. stfu kids stayed remote post work way wanted to? dose Common Sense aswell go amiss... Thank explaining me! someone please make animation this? start map America, little X marking Trump travels nation, juxtaposed county heatmap case counts deaths 3 weeks future ? could visual representation much super spreader really is.

No one else bullshit mass maskless gatherings scale is. He‚Äôs gotten away he‚Äôs president he‚Äôs petulant child. expect see pattern. schools rarely ever mentioned. Kids effective spreading viruses, world leaders scratching heads wondering cases began spiking September. Heaven forbid organize society way parents work full time, drop kids hope shitty education system actually teaches something. i'm sorry heard virus, sure virus reason hospitals full actually people care virus. started america lot stuff already known virus president people care think concerned data right now. 

On [state state we're seeing seeing 7 day rolling average trending nearly every state. past, seeing pockets places trending others down, first time I've noticed everywhere trending once.

[Nearly everywhere R0 different story summer.

Basically everywhere United States virus spreading exponentially right now. 

The kids school, people bars restaurants, people playing laser tag, ice hockey roller skating. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Years - next ten weeks. federal leadership. We're setting disaster. 

Get ready lose people care winter. Let know love now. Thank you, surprised still....all relatives too, even real? makes sense, thank explaining it. thinking like vaccine automatically meant couldn‚Äôt get sick. Panic fatigue definitely settled back. However, wife stay safe. still clean everything get grocery store. see friends posting pics going weekends. sucks, aren‚Äôt going waver. Walking dog, riding bikes watching lot TV. Literally exact thing happened country - excellent response March April, cases actually declining.

Then went ""eh, good enough,"" reopened everything prematurely, we're seeing ten times daily infections months ago. know western media news this. would least give ""hope"" shows evidence virus beat least contained society/economies go back normal.

I know many USA cope incompetence saying ""China lying numbers"" ignore fact society literally back normal better evidence statistics graphs. Wuhan literally tourist spot now. IQ 1 4 people Texas flat health insurance can't see doctor. 

The 75% would guess 1 3 shitty health plans can't afford deductible practically real access healthcare. 

Ballpark figures means 7.5 million people Texas can't see doctor need to.

Good luck Texas- going need it. that's reasonable, common lot countries even wear masks high traffic places like airports I'd say hospitalizations deaths would paint much complete picture. Honestly, think years. Never. people don‚Äôt wear masks ones lining get vaccines.  still eat there's ample space glass walls tables, waiters wear masks, I'm sitting table alone. think there's higher chance transmission packed crowds people wear masks noses sticking out. Swedes, really surprise country going shit. I‚Äôve sent tons articles detailing exactly bad things done. defense ‚ÄúWell many people died‚Äù even though it‚Äôs literally worst outcomes world, country usually praises one best. You‚Äôre fucking disgrace. absolutely right.

Edit: no... Lol. 38x1.37=52 (roughly).

It's 37% increase. think they're still aiming get important people vaccinated year end, regular people without extra risk maybe spring much him, holding rally week got hospital.  afraid, stay fuck home come precious media says ok. That's good point, know honest. feel (anecdotally) NYC's pop (myself included) really family Midwest states, could wrong. never met anyone Arkansas, South Dakota, Wisconsin (well, remember one). feels like people know northeast Cali, Florida Texas. hard break bible belt. told months ahead happen nothing done slow spread, still end here? feel? feel anger disappointment. cute Snoo, agree throwing awards posts going fix problems. agree you. would doubt already understand know new virus. Hope Poland starts get better. terrible. That‚Äôs ‚Äúd‚Äù COVID means. Together stands coronavirus disease (2019). said 4 years. Interesting response attack instead posted.

My point, sure knew, know susceptible types viruses given interconnected world become, least individuals paying attention people like Gates Obama hopefully learned something last year.

Did learn Spanish Flue? assume so, medical advances probably made us forget lot lessons learned consider irrelevant.

In initial post, done better job qualifying timeline speaking to, truly believe see lasting changes result COVID. think buildings work spaces designed differently, think mask wearing become normalized especially travel flu season, think contact tracing become widespread well prepared industry. sure examples, top head. I've seen people reddit go absurd lengths try discredit effectiveness masks. culture different. faced spread deadly virus multiple times. know wearing masks good, might annoying good you. protests redistribute virus. matter good society not, plain wrong now. Even wear masks, 100% safe.
The government also prepared apps tracks spread listening doctors professional opinions. 

You clearly see difference Asian countries compare west. Seriously matter label put graph? First wave? Seventh? 2.5? look graph. tell what‚Äôs happening. eleven? read peer-reviewed article said people reinfected every time use phrase ""two weeks"". countries then. things going well we're potentially looking Johnson &amp; Johnson Oxford/Astrazeneca January. Poland's odd though, looks like super cautious, suddenly threw wind? look Poland's graph compared pretty much anywhere else.  \^This ‚ÄúWe‚Äù? It‚Äôs ‚Äúwe‚Äù unless live third world. Yeah, worried land borders US pretty close island compared many countries, given two land borders Canada (probably Mexico well) mostly avoiding travel US now.

Air travel mostly brought countries, island impact that. Well, first wave pandemic, situation Poland much better Western European countries. Comparing numer cases deaths March-May sufficient regard guess. Thank goodness today announced closure indoor dining drinking Chicagoland suburbs. feel awful owners bars restaurants support hard times, need keep spread bay. That's Pfizer. load shit serious answers? Big reason manufacturing outsourced first place countries much lower labour ane environmental standards keeps costs down. massively hypocritical put policies adress issues outsourcing lowest bidder blind eye. Damn son, I'm already dead. stop eviscerating come backs. Wow! Wow! stats derive population locked down. would different story let run. Exactly. I‚Äôm actually eleventh time reinfected - hopefully make   thing that's happening everywhere else - people fucking idiots gave brother chicken pox intentionally, spiteful child desert sick (I think crunchy throat raw anyway).

All remember outside hospital room hearing screaming. Got somewhat close killing remember. course still scars it.

It's easy sit comfortably home forget suffering others. 2-3 years? People forgetting second 2021 drops honestly feel like saying spring we‚Äôll back normal might little sometimes

And user replied wasn‚Äôt serious I'm /s guy. remember too. Hope see around again, perish imminently, likely virus. Thanks this. due mid June hopefully LOTS new data pregnancy Covid then. Another zinger! roll. hope get hallway spot myself(USA) save thousand night. misleading put context. height pandemic, especially area person tested positive virus, people neighborhood ordered stay home go necessities like buying food. leaving tested first. high rise apartment building, easier control, closed front door exiting entrance, leaving backdoor one entrance leading testing ground. want go buy food, go way, obviously tested first going out. western media swayed like China imprison people house make like pol pot turned schools prisons. course say like ""loosened"" prison context matter less visitors environment, people family elsewhere. Apparently ~15% NYC population born US outside NY state... many go home thanksgiving Xmas? many NYC'ers moved states come hope includes foreign residents :) States cannot close borders. HHS overrule governors even governors make executive order, Supreme Court overrule it.  
This already happened NY Cuomo tried shut airports federal govt said no. Then, went onto mandatory 14-day quarentine traveling high risk areas federal govt said ""No cannot that"" switched voluntarily. essence, governors much states interstate traveling can't anything involves traveling private/public transportation air-travel. Poland cold winter
 
The winter comes early
 
‚Ç¨ insert Latvian potato joke ‚Ç¨ objectively true Sweden's strategy resulted dramatically higher death toll Scandinavian county,

This complete assumption objectively true. completely ignores fact strategy worked well strategies Nordic neighbors many Swedish regions. might lead believe selected strategy affects outcome likely many factors well. elementary school no. wear mask leave desk. Sitting take open windows periodically said they‚Äôll continue ventilate even gets cold. ""It baffles enrages me."" precisely payoff everything concerning Trump. surrealistic. Ever hear prison?  Haha ü§£ there‚Äôs first time everything reddit We're endgame hope day gets better, internet stranger! Yep. God knows they‚Äôll know sure they‚Äôve lost Election Day. 100% going anything everything hand Biden worst possible situation. thought careless destructive now, that‚Äôs they‚Äôre ignorant prideful. Wait they‚Äôre actively *trying* cause problems. fixed numbers. Shouldn‚Äôt math head one instance everything bigger Texas. Yeah, week late least response sadly. think depends define 'normal'. Getting nice humble dose karma. cases coming China. love food highly recommend taking chance visit rest Asia there. already ended country competent enough big individual rights definitely observed early days current plague. That's question loaded assumptions entire state, pal.  meant ‚Äúhis age.‚Äù Like flu - 100 years flu pandemic we're roughly 3-5 million cases severe illness 250,000 500,000 deaths. So, sure, much worry general population. Come 2120. point restrictions USA **always** overloading local hospitals. hospitals remaining capacity additional restrictions. 

El Paso running hospital, imposing restrictions. bit late that's reason. Remember coronavirus task force pence, Kushner etc. said biggest best contact tracing program ever? Yeah right Stick good parts city ok, imo dangerous troublesome place would border, pass Maicao Maracaibo high chance ""matraqueado"" basically police / guards ask money goods let out, sadly extremely common every single place Venezuela. live near Maracaibo go often, would visit El paseo del lago Sambil idk handling everything quarantine going on. visit go Franco, fast food restaurant makes one best burgers hot dogs ever tried. 

Ohh almost forgot, driving careful gasoline consumption, there's huge, huuge shortage going on, gas stations working PACKED, really lucky fill tank less 6 hours gas station, alternative buying gas, sell 20 lts 20-40$ pretty easy find sellers. Schools colleges probably mandate well, since usually mandate immunizations, nice. implying make habit downvoting critical perfectly polite comments? realize behavior qualifies incivility? Meanwhile New Zelanand, 4 cases yesterday, total 2000. know places, hospital Spain, tests flu causes pneumonia even test positive covid. no, people flu Every day I‚Äôm convinced emotional capacity empathy one important things world (and one quite lacking half it). researchers noticed fewer nearsighted patients hospital ward China, speculated wearing glasses might offer protection Covid-19. least US contact tracing been... great: think super-spreader events somewhat successfully flying radar. Frat parties, weddings, church services (especially involving singing) etc. notable cases like Maine wedding able contact trace, think lot states absolutely idea. see big enough event coupled enough highly social, rule-breaking people attended could cause huge regional spike. Allow insurance companies sort stuff they'll 'extra charge' people death look like liability asset. It‚Äôs really hard - co-workers lost parents COVID couldn‚Äôt even see died. It‚Äôs really depressing, feel bad everyone get sick this. Meanwhile hoping grandparents parents safe watching friends can‚Äôt find jobs working ‚Äòessential‚Äô positions higher risk, knowing long term effects catch live... really kind around you, kind yourself, forget making ‚Äòprogress‚Äô year. Success making year. normal times. (I find helps check friends make sure they‚Äôre okay - it‚Äôs feeling like this. really hard.) Exactly. People die time relatively easily avoidable reasons. pandemic, cannot hope eradicate within borders unless we're really willing rock boat, approach establish new normal instead on/off schedule European peers doing. mean hit hard early I'm convinced winter merciful, fuck I'm literally saying wait pandemic start gloating tarnished reputation.

If first response ""wait facts"" ""that attitude problem"" got issues ain't qualified resolve. Yeah ArcGIS dashboards get pretty bloated unusable mobile older devices.

Texas defines ""[trauma service counties around metropolitan areas managing medical resources across state Houston TSA (TSA-Q) includes Austin, Colorado, Fort Bend, Harris (home Houston), Matagorda, Montgomery, Walker, Waller, Wharton County. Trust me, live US (and US citizen) I'm massively upset here. GF finishes PhD, going China bit. take year two less political freedom means live world virus control. El Paso gritty, love area.

Last year planned trip North postpone friend going stay got sick. figured ""Hey, let's roll saved amount next winter's vacation, it'll great!""

Not able go vacation see snow two years row big bummer Northerner living Florida. estimated France 100,000 new cases daily peak infections March. twice bad today compare numbers, however virus also much localized now.

Translation:

From National Health Commission China, yesterday 25/10/2020 00:00 - 24:00 , 31 provinces (including autonomous regions direct-administered municipalities) Xinjiang Production Construction Corps report 20 new confirmed cases COVID-19, imported (Shanghai 11, Inner Mongolia 2, Shaanxi 2, Hebei 1, Shanxi 1, Fujian 1, Guangdong 1, Sichuan 1). new deaths, 1 new imported suspected case (Shanghai).

For yesterday, 20 COVID-19 patients recovered, 944 close contacts longer medical observation, number cases serious critical condition increased 1.

Currently 255 imported cases (3 serious condition), 6 current imported suspected cases. Accumulative imported cases 3,248, accumulative recovered imported cases 2,993, accumulative deaths imported cases 0.

Plenty countries China use forms contact tracing violate forth amendment. Maybe adopt first rather far harsh penalties, believe would major backlash Americans. agree disagree one.

Even late Aug, polls show majority Americans support lockdowns. idea think majority fine implementing harsher penalties breaching rules preventing states staying reopened. work home (my office closed indefinitely) time I'm home, things like go running, meet friends park, pick take food, every awhile, outdoor dining shopping. Masks required indoors (NYC) people wear outside too. I'll take mine run run street far away anyone.

Not sure what's going happen winter hits... together now! Fuck governor Michigan. causes many deaths nursing home policies. Butbyea auck tit she‚Äôs democrat. Lol you‚Äôre fucking looney toon buddy. Keep living fantasy land anyone next name automatically compassionate matter many people fuck over. You‚Äôre delusional it‚Äôs actually scary. Well lucky think screwed pooch lockdowns, unless major bailout federal government, won‚Äôt see widespread lockdowns. Maybe rollbacks places like NY CA that‚Äôs That‚Äôs issue. There‚Äôs small possibility Texas turns blue year really hinges urban areas. guys never finished first disagree. I'm mandatory mask country covid cases actually increased soon adopted mask policy. shit?? Yeah lol, gf wearing medical grade masks. 50 masks 3 euro packages sold local shop definitely medical grade stuff. saying cars bulletproof cause someone know survived getting shot tank.

That comments many upvotes worrying, shows lot people even know basic stuff PPE. There‚Äôs still distribution application vaccine, isn‚Äôt going happen instantly. Vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective many opt get it. isn‚Äôt really going away unless luck less lethal mutation (which basically happening throughout history). Well, it‚Äôs slowing spread; stopping it. Also, new research showing N95s don‚Äôt stop virus still get sick wearing one. thread refer full 3mo old accounts nothing else shit Melbourne lockdowns general (on two subs). Many even live Australia, many likely even live (ie GPT-3 may good, call sentient yet). tax referring to? Income tax, sales tax, property tax, estate tax, capitol gain tax....?

Gasoline tax? Meals tax?

Which tax pays exactly? **WhAt SaYiNg? cAn't HeAr mAsK!** think r/wisconsin method somebody sumed perfect ""swiss cheese"" diagram. compare stats Europe US. 50% population less deaths Messages deleted embarrassment It‚Äôs sad reddit good medium US propaganda.

If country nobody cared happened non-pro-US position, bet there‚Äôd million Westerners sudden believing every story US government started putting out. there‚Äôd calls regime change brutal dictator order help moderately Islamist head chopping freedom fighters. Winter South Florida maybe 2 weeks 56F day maybe 48F night, like February March weekend high 60's might happen there's cold front north. It'll stick 75-82 rest season. US Canada empty. That's good comparison all. shit. Get VR headset play VrChat, $300 Oculus Quest. fun fuck, free version Among Us. make friends super easy stay safe winter. Good question! lmao hell

ignoring obvious absurdity country trying this... like half Europe worse US right now, start there? follow masks social distancing long they're temporary end date; one thing absolutely CANNOT approve second lockdown, regardless duration intense is. Anglo? Europe looking lessons East Asia either. 

Ha yeah showing biases too. Perhaps broadening 'white exceptionalism' 'western exceptionalism' would better. Though certainly seems though US UK going severely damaged countries developed world said done.

Definitely lot learn SK efforts relative success commendable, though grand inescapable pissing contest, perform level three. Canadian here. city averaging 10-20 cases Day everyone wears masks. people distance. 

I know anyone personally committed best prevent spread.

Being American must truly terrifying. cAuSe tHeYrE tEsTiNg MoRe, TeStInG EqUaLs CaSeS sometimes people want face truth. People need realise be: 
\- Supportive restrictions place 
\- happy cases decreasing 
\- Angry government faults (which numerous) 


All time.... 


Yet seen people (albeit few) praise DA saint whilst trying demonfy Gladys devil despite really really exceptional job containing covid (up worlds best imo) POST Ruby Princess shitshow. getting embarrassing. Well, so, guess. find great Sweden always mind sustainability tried work middle ground work several months, untill vaccine.

Instead ""lockdown first, ask questions latter"" countries seep keen pursuing. folks shout loudest ""sheeple"" likely are. live island separate airlift insurance. helps anyone El Paso...  ""Greater good"" millions losing jobs, mental depression, economic collapse, stalled education system? Honestly bother. 

Soon reopen virus return they'll forced close down. constant closing reopening taking tool population. made claim. provide evidence.  going blame Trump also!?  find answer let know put put options SPY ü§£ They'll take hundreds millions people worldwide taken fine. think vaccine hesitancy stems fact right things mystery  Blame Nancy Pelosi. Trump said would sign another stimulus bill solely focused stimulus. Democrats give two fucks American people care stickin' Trump. haven‚Äôt seen son person since March I‚Äôm slowly dying inside put there. feel them, guess. feel statement live IL. shelter place early on, general restrictions cases - like indoor dining, large gathering, etc.

And cases going up, mostly rural counties Chicago. Illinois Health Official even started break cry announced record high case number Illinois...

But sad thing one listening them. Everyone crowding bars, parties. Even county sheriff says enforce mask mandate Covid response restrictions. also soooo much HATE governor. There's Pritzker SUCKS signs everywhere, signs calling dictator lard ass. 

It's crazy saddening. really feel like Texas going rough winter. Huh. might part Dutch friend insists masks nothing. Typical Texas liberals, making big deal nothing undermine great president. [The swiss cheese model - multiple layers hole one, others hopefully stop bad outcome. 

Masks + distance + minimising trips/number contacts + sanitising ...  anecdotally confirm happening. April severe abdominal pain. almost called ambulance middle night didnt want go ER covid fears, among reasons. turns appendicitis time went hospital 4 days later ruptured. 
It really sad people worse illnesses life threatening situations afraid get care need. Even Cousin Eddie knew go sledding hill nothing ground brain thin piece government plastic. executive order says cannot jailed violating mask mandate nearly every sheriff‚Äôs office Texas declared **unenforceable since lack capacity track many times someone violated medical condition may allow exempt it.**

**The first violation required warning.** $250 max repeat violations. can‚Äôt jailed, there‚Äôs penalty paying it.

Also here‚Äôs exceptions notably indoor church exempt mask mandates: Persons medical condition disability prevents wearing face person consuming food drink, seated restaurant eat person (a) exercising outdoors engaging physical activity outdoors, (b) maintaining safe distance people person driving alone passengers part household obtaining service requires temporary removal face covering security surveillance, screening, need specific access face, visiting bank obtaining personal care service involving face, extent necessary temporary person swimming pool, lake, similar body voting, assisting voter, serving poll watcher, actively administering election (but wearing face covering strongly actively providing obtaining access religious worship (but wearing face covering strongly person giving speech broadcast outdoor space cannot maintain 6 feet distance persons within residence. get things like scare population believing even slightest cough flu symptoms make rush hospital recover home.

I've known people fear covid runny nose. MSM deferral US countries group highest risk HIV places. reason deferrals injecting drug users, recipients blood transfusion, sexual contact HIV+ partner, etc. species wired seeking precise understanding world actually is,‚Äù 

This bigger shocker me. Asking questions, researching, finding truth --- ... normal? Would rather stay dumb find world works? begins permanent restrictions, restrictions look awful lot like lock though. like ""yadda yadda free market""

Everyone's capitalist comes getting own, tune changes pretty quick need rely others Bummer. sound crass, certain point. becomes stats... so. Bummer. First time went El Paso, drove city mountains, [the city pool lights. Coming Phoenix, pretty remarkable. Imagine audacity tell someone allowed make money feed families keep roof heads.

Make money feed family keep roof head come expense someone else dying. Good thing vast majority people everywhere survive. leadership? Could fooled Feel free prove wrong then. I'm genuinely curious. see holding courts. mention earlier, mask private business 100% enforceable. curfew grown ass adults not, ain't Marshall law smh  No, self swab nostril known enough Americans come conclusion world power 1 status good thing. bad people's mentality. certainly wish China become world power 1 either. honest think yet. virus keeps spread US another year would hard say...
I living western countries quite years moved back China. coming back, already knew virus going contained easily west. difficult make judgement lived China west. beginning pandemic, grandma told stories epidemic old days villages got wiped completely. think early memories poverty disasters really help situations like this. partly Chinese cooperative. Many families elderly members wars epidemics pass memories fear. 
But west, however, comfortable long.  repeated ad nauseum cult members, too. mind boggles. I'd give negative blood long term monotonous relationship another man, take it. Melbourne, Australia. even curfew still restrictions 4 reasons leave house. like couple months. got 0 new cases today worked far. Stop selfish dick shut up. Everyone's boat special, snowflake. Mask mandates definitely place El Paso. new order specifically outlines peace officer allowed enforce violation $250. Abbot established state-wide face covering requirement back July flu season Texas identical rest country. comparing 2 small islands, population 5 million (literally less New York), country 325 million people, FORTY TIMES land mass, bordering countries less. realize absolutely fucking stupid sounds, right? USA stopped activity like nz did, entire world economy would crash.  


Despite insane disparity, privileged position nz, still cannot completely wipe virus. People like still trying point fingers people ""doing wrong"" exposing really are. u Harambe u speak Harambe?

Edit: oh shit. Cake day mean totally goes social distancing mask on. guess evidence state premier announced lockdown lifted 11:59 tuesday wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs masks deck I‚Äôd least say people masks. 

They don‚Äôt test come though? Oh shit, that‚Äôs Sewage southern western suburbs whose water treated Deer Island Treatment Plant levels coronavirus seen since last April, virus still near peak, according latest data. northern suburbs' sewage showing less virus far, far behind, lines trending up.

Boston needs take indicator community transmission already spiking, action needed there‚Äôs still opportunity get ahead it. Meaningful change mitigate climate change require enormous action everyone, WAY inconvenient little mask.

This slightly different - climate change fixed top policy.

Gonna hard people make decision buy fewer plastic products plastic products **stop getting manufactured**.

If want fix macro problems leave hands micro decisionmakers. take decision hands entirely. Meanwhile El Paso school district still full steam ahead high school sports. I'm horrified willfull ignorance. course not. language used word right. course right go &amp; that. Pretend I'm forehead tapping meme here.

""Can't climate change atmosphere catches fire."" first American colonists crazy. fled Britain religious fundamentalists tolerated. US see much less spread summer. winter vs summer thing BS. love every thread like ""it come back come back"" let anyone positive outlook it. Cynical annoying...   interpret calls phone calls calls public health departments around U.S. cities organized good job follow contact tracing.

Some downright terrible. one call handled, time contacted one people, person already become ill recovered. call six weeks late. Social cohesion.... Wow. Two words miss. New Zealand Government-made app, QR codes entry every public shop / bar / school / office etc. scan every time visit. 

If anyone visits places tests positive, notified place day. 

We pretty much eliminated community - current cases isolation, small flareup around month ago thanks contact tracing contained.

Life pretty much back normal, though. Restaurants bars operating, sports back on, schools open. amazing happen government listens scientists...! also seen post sub girl found molecule recently rewarded 25k based research.it twitter stuff like that.what venezuela's new discovery exact molecule single person found??if so,this could huge thing world whether solution not. Came say this. tracer rural IL even swamped. It‚Äôs insane right now. Icu rn here. It‚Äôs also hard want go make lot travel nursing state. feel bad hospital staffs, also recruiters. declining calls, deleting emails, texts months. would could can‚Äôt full home distance learning kids, particularly autistic one. hands tied money great, can‚Äôt leave kids right now. Consider internet privileges revoked act like adult. Damn maskholes, stay nh lolol (just kidding, come nh cheep booze I'll go mass legal bud) Almost bad - something actually said:  good thing went it,"" US President told tightly packed audience Orlando Sanford International Airport Sanford, Florida Monday. feel powerful.

Oh shit. Congratulations Victoria. saw news restrictions lifted midnight tomorrow 0 new cases today. Regardless think gonna Spring 2021, hide 2022 choose never stopped picking speed, might coasted minute, never slowed down. fair called medicine neutralizes covid19 100%. doesn‚Äôt make moral thing do. ‚ÄúThere one ballot drop box entire state must welded top flagpole state capital building‚Äù spreads France moment, looking 400,000 cases/day USA three weeks time Yeah that‚Äôs incredibly frustrating. bit general post above, know majority guys smart want right thing, portion morons lot higher, it‚Äôs horrible *want* right thing leaders idiots actively hamstrung you. 

As Trump blaming Biden, absolutely already has. He‚Äôs dumbass thing lately ‚Äúman America really bad state unknown reason, vote I‚Äôll fix it!‚Äù. He‚Äôs stupid hurts.  I'm sure long quarantine get fine. shown months need seconds catch virus. 15 minutes way long. point think matters much anymore. contact tracing seems failed anyway western countries given rising numbers. concerned friends Europe honest. worries seem way concerned themselves. impossible convince quite going meeting friends etc...I concluded different mentality: average, Chinese people afraid death. cliff technically corner. Cuz transmission happens predominantly night. /s Whenever hear stories think boredom worth it

Of course kind bored pandemic one dumbest things he's ever said. insult duct tape comparing republican COVID plans. *human population


There reason every pandemic hits us kills second round. shit show closing. go home. Fantastic. imagine government working together create semblance relief post 7/31/20. Yeah would leave state family 12+ weeks go help? local hospital super busy? knowing you‚Äôll adequate ppe. knowing staffing unsafe may lose life license you‚Äôre going placed situation set fail? may take oath harm sure hell don‚Äôt take one become martyrs. Nah, add-on. Google it. right Japan owning US debt China, though reasonably recent development following Chinese using sell-off bonds since 2018 retaliation Trump's dumb tariff war.

Not sure getting 4% though - either 15% 21% depending whether include China's satellite states. Source: ""China holds treasury bonds"" hyperbole, that's plenty enough destabilise currency rosiest environments, never mind now. People must really short memories, there‚Äôs always lag increasing case rates, increasing hospitalisation death rates. see huge spike coming weeks. Sad think could avoided. Seems tested in-vitro, hasnt peer reviewed. hope works, really irresponsible call COVID cure hasnt actually tested anything approaching real settings. anecdotal evidence ""Yeah read *so many reddit posts* hillary gonna win*""* equate actual polling data Cali florida texas surging several months far, new states surging could def pin pointed recent relaxations testing Stop pedantic hope you‚Äôre right becomes trend places (unfortunately) surge near capacity. 

It‚Äôs take things generally go, certainly argument done. understand sympathize scale travel friend mine Amarrilo, something could flown/airlifted necessary?

I actually agree heavy handed lock downs case hospital overrun. nah we're going make worse. ""science ain't real"" Mr. Atlas charge. God really fucking clue you‚Äôre talking üòÇ stop. You‚Äôre digging deeper little echo chamber ignorance. disagree you, don‚Äôt fully understand talking about. part ways exhausting, frankly quite pointless, discussion valuable reminder myself: impossible defeat ignorant man argument. Adieu! Cthucku, cousin Cthulu know think. businesses Chicago, expected do? everyone sit outside Chicago winter freeze? delivery only? 


I get disdain action... people need realize businesses lifeline lot people. Imagine audacity tell someone allowed make money feed families keep roof heads. Trump exactly kind man try sabotage replacement top that,

But districts actually happen? Nearly nowhere! broad brush what's needed PANDEMIC. Waiting tables hard enough without police assholes deal unconscious sociopaths don‚Äôt care behaviors impact others mosques per capita China USA.

Wuhan officials got fired mishandling virus. US governors got fired \- history lesson.

&amp;#x200B;

Not saying China clean, living USA free think. able pick leader every 4 years I'd call ""free"". fucking matter. disagreement semantics middle global crisis. even understand anyone gives shit wave we're in, even give shit, impossible question answer definitively multiple valid ways look it. 

Arguing whether we're wave 1 wave 3 like standing beach arguing whether 10 story wave wipe town tsunami tidal wave. US worst new cases numbers there. France UK overtaking them. set new records Friday largest seven-day increases new coronavirus cases, hospitalizations deaths top public health official called ‚Äúa generalized spread‚Äù COVID-19 virus.

The state averaged 700 new cases day month, figure record 768 seven days ending Friday, beating previous high mark 757 seven days ending Wednesday. state Department Health Environment reported 1,774 new confirmed probable coronavirus cases since Wednesday, increase 2.4% brought total pandemic 76,230. ...

... rural counties seeing largest numbers new cases per 1,000 residents, 20 counties biggest per capita spikes past two weeks, two, Nemaha Reno counties, 10,000 residents.

Some Kansas elected officials argued decline COVID-19 death rate since start pandemic represents real progress production widely available vaccine grows nearer. Kansas, deaths represent 1.3% reported cases, figure slowly inched month.

The state health department reported additional 23 COVID-19-related deaths since Wednesday, bringing pandemic total 975. state saw record average 16.57 new deaths day seven days ending Friday, though high mark attributed earlier deaths included death certificates reviewed local state health officials. that's dumb comparison

2000 euro good salary many european countries, 2000zl main polish cities means room shared flat, food gas Hopefully actually going ready. ""ready"" certain politicians pushing ready November 3. going argue kids share germs whatnot. But, since know virus largely effect them...then w/ proper plans, maybe bit rearranging, proper protocols place, figure balance get back classroom, even less time spent normal. That‚Äôs downplay all

I laugh, several people saying words immediately downplay virus talk bad. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Who's gonna tell him...? confident France, especially weather gets colder, getting worse quickly think they're going reign in. China Japan constituted large amount tourism even pandemic. understimate stupidiy Argentinian government. mind-blowing think China still fewer cases US even lie revealed 1% cases. [We‚Äôre approaching November there‚Äôs still refreeze Siberian ([Blue Ocean come! matter people's opinion though. get it, probably allright. Maybe go bald. Maybe lungs look like cheese. Maybe hole missing tissue pressure ulcer appeared bed-ridden weeks. maybe give someone they'll play health roulette.

Yeah, socializing masks avoiding parties harder wearing seatbelt. think ""fuck immunocompromised, elderly small percentage healthy, young individuals"" mindset want myself.

And I'm past blaming anyone. think act however see fit. deal people know they've exposed even know imfected adhering basic healh isolation gidelines daily, people consider vacation worth coughing face nurse's face. ran fucks give around July.

I know place. I'm cannon fodder. one gives shit I'm exposed daily basis, seen mother face face without mask since May want kill her. 

I blame anyone else, really. Enjoy life, socialize, fun parties. Masks get way enjoying life? Fuck them.

This opinion decide deal potentially deadly crippling disease. got nasal swab instead older nasopharyngeal swab. slightly less accurate preferred less invasive less exposure staff. Ah yes, ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy. like call it, ""no real lockdown"" fallacy. quite, France yesterday 260,000 US Equivalent, Belgium last 3 days US equivalent 491,000 495,000 437,000--and Czech Republic(headline today 'We need Miracle')was 550,000 US equivalent days ago(today 170,000) NYP straight tabloid.

It must confusing rely normal news channels. Lubbock Midland smaller El Paso. compelling evidence growing mountain studies showing masks work. Yet many places still resist issuing mask mandates.  Update since time immemorial.

Everything I've getting big name vaccine producers phase 3 implies get something EUA around early December. fact already hearing beginning mass production vaccines starting implies phase 3 trials going smoothly last thing pharmaceutical company would rollout faulty vaccine. medicine drugs get away fucking vaccines anti vaxxers there? Forget it. seen Sweden dropped yet another place Worldometers deaths/1M pop list. ""cults"" ""tiny ass fraction""

But are. know using quotations, supposed invalidate fact they're 300,000 members, .006% population?

Lets make clear. Shincheonji Church Jesus main group opposing COVID measures ones responsible multiple outbreaks. make .006% population.

Don't try spin 20% baseless assumption Koreans masks. Found curtain twitcher! Thankfully, I'm Australia allowed say suck. New Zealand still better us, though. Wizard's First Rule. hope so, take least months released. I'm **not** antivaxxer means, I'm sure trust something pushed fast. false reporting, also death rate focus it‚Äôs 1% really stop blowing proportion happened long enough first first released Current economic data suggest successful pandemic response better economy, regardless lockdowns. Sweden, lockdown, reported shrinkage GDP Nordic neighbors did, around - 8%. (More updated data reported Nordic nations including Sweden showed 3%-4% shrinkage ) Sweden little better job loss, dramatically different peers. Graphs: record, think Sweden approach merit sustainability, far translated economics benefit.

On hand, countries managed pandemic well seeing rapid, V-shaped recoveries. China reported 4.9% gain, Vietnam reported 2.6% gain, Taiwan 1%. New Zealand suffered 12% loss, projected remarkable 11.5% recovery last quarter.

You know, things take time. can't give laptops everyone expect everything fixed within week. Like, no. Opening schools much faster economical solution.

There! answered question. Happy now? please answer mine. Would say New York got cases ‚Äúunder control‚Äù first wave? 

The answer yes. areas not, have. second wave, haven‚Äôt able get top it. little value painting broad brush think know whether vaccine safe effective end November, beginning December,"" said. family too! makes 9 us! Bad sign worse result considering incubation time number people low symptoms. Lot easier spread people can‚Äôt actually know. idiots say ""The virus fake going go away soon"". Yep, reddit seeing since first rumours wild virus emerging Wuhan momunental fall wave Europe (never thought would much) empathize protesting Lockdowns hurt businesses childcare, protesting masks disappointing.

It's like minimum help people. know, saw comment watched video. want see questions asked well rest conversation. anybody quandary this? least U.S., case missed it, midst uncontrolled spread highly transmissible virus far killed 220,000 Americans sickened many, many more. 

It probable 500,000 die February. everything goes right, enough population might vaccinated end third quarter 2021 bring pandemic control. then, Mark Lipstich's early estimate one million people America dying COVID may well prove correct.

People unable bedside dying parents, children, etc COVID ICU's. become much, much common. Next that, missing Thanksgiving Christmas grandma grandad evinces shrug, unless delusional antisocial. fair, two countries known cleanliness. Right. People love superficially classify feel smart? Remember cleared economic downturn new buzz was, ""Will double-dip recession?"" No, article clearly stated asymptomatic asked come work. 
Didn't read article? favourite analogy far. ever go fully back ""normal.""

You insane think this. second people getting vaccinated time go back normal end open air prison. true. work hospital lab. There‚Äôs way colleagues work home. shut down, health care 2,3 mil city would collapse. don‚Äôt car use public transportation get work.

Fox News White House amongst them. hostage. telling experts educate youth exchange producing vaccine us. Experts recommended school closures reduce overall harm much possible, you, lay person, misrepresenting it. Senior citizens ones taking overwhelming majority hospital beds, vaccinate first probably help control hospitals overrun. seniors care homes either, fact 4.5% elders care homes doesn‚Äôt really solve issue lol.

Young people work public populations (unless underlying conditions) really shouldn‚Äôt prioritized (over elders) imo. young person works public populations, majority coworkers including already got covid none us critically ill point. totally fine, people issues concerns ones lived older relative . Oh also one long.

It's crazy much sub changes, following development pandemic. First identified Asia. Brits many governments predicted - thing Spanish flu, people got fed protested mask mandates.

I totally get it. Since look like war, many people muster rigor discipline acknowledge collectively traumatic event keep us busy 2+ years. discussion seen corona sub while. Last time tried, got million mask responses. protecting masks too, restrictions?  plastic face shields pretty much worthless leave children behind suffering countries? can't care both? one thing. Yeah, rush I'm staying self-isolated months, zombie killers door. Western arrogance denial. People love bringing island argument despite several Asian countries crushed virus island (Vietnam, Thailand, Singapore, China). western countries (excluding Australia NZ consider ‚Äúwestern‚Äù) even TRIED go lengths countries gone control border, impose strict quarantine, contact trace expense privacy

It's simple policy. Keep people's spit holes. going ignore question?

I saw that. address answered question. ending social ending whatever phrase covid becomes endemic societies accept certain death toll annually, like seasonal flu. literally talk every day get downvoted subs! one seems care 3rd world kids! people matter!

Its really either, Healthcare system collapse economy follow, vis versa. one many, many I'll effects society virus casting. good solutions, except curbing spread diligently earning reopening brownie points.

Unfortunately, many countries even deserve crumbs right now. B-but... Gen-Z coping specific challenges, opposed Millennials... people midwestern values? opinion, statistical analysis extensive review; experts various fields, others who‚Äôve chimed levels private public enterprise joe exactly?

Not mention horrible planning effective response level. mate, asked go necessary told can't go late. That's fucking logic.

People dying hit lifelong side effects. use logic crawl back hole? Oh please. We‚Äôve endured three terrible months incompetent government tracing system folded first serious virus spike.

But appears tons people amnesia forgot second lockdown. happened beat countries closing twice. Sorry boring relationship. I'm sure - group mentality. restrictions political. wish belong certain tribe, can't disagree position even little, (the tribe). middle ground. Using reason irrelevant. polite irrelevant.

This polarized way thinking is, think, biggest contemporary issue (and mean US, I'm Polish BTW). get anywhere nice society pulling extremes vilifying other. shall jailed guess.

There's similar.

Madrid 10K+ deaths, 6.6M Autonomous community. Lombardy 17K+ deaths 10M region. Lima 15K+ deaths (excess deaths 3x) 10M.

I think Lima, Peru worst hit city. numbers similar NYC excess deaths Peru (overall) 3x COVID-19 deaths. ""One youtuber perfect representation entire French population.""

Generalizing spread misinformation really well regarded Reddit. Naw Except every country control boarder controls. reduce import another country Europe already happened. Hundreds generous maybe hundred 150 protest. Embarrassing turnout really. even read happened people china control it? Yeah no...not example want america follow.

USAs 32% estimate entire year see months US numbers look like Biomnis h24 remember could stop replying, like I'm one hounding anything specific. wanna think I'm brainwashed I'm entirely board it, tells lot tells me.

I also want point one making claim, ain't prove anything. order true character playing realize that, one making claim salient difference Norway Sweden COVID-19 crisis individual supposedly different strategies. factually untrue, study _YOU LINKED_ early conversation stated clearly without ambiguity COVID-19 showing signs trending Norway _BEFORE_ lockdown effect.

You indeed given evidence ain't evidence supports argument, perhaps read sources instead getting angry do. Easier virus less 1% death rate overall affect young barely moves life expectancy needle even kill?

No. Influenza way scarier me. 1918 makes Covid look like joke. We‚Äôre passively ignoring too. time everyone‚Äôs attention, people actually see words local leaders ww directly watching correlation health risks, done much anything even try suggest improving baseline health behaviors. 

Wait shot arm please stay inside much possible then. even closed parking lot park keep people away (or maybe that‚Äôs California).

Such wasted opportunity. Thanks info/update.

At least half holds, first half still worked on.

Note, opening sentence Wiki (above) even mention healthcare measures, even nation war. eg, WW2 saw massive restrictions way life UK, yet still make Bars start offer peanuts suddenly classified restaurants, therefore bypassing current restrictions Wut  draw something cause others pain? don‚Äôt really see ‚Äúfreedom rights‚Äù hurt others. ok draw people disabilities make fun them? also ‚Äúfreedom rights‚Äù woman arrested macronvirus poster her‚Äùfreedom right?‚Äù probably happen Spain well, announced curfew yesterday. mean like it‚Äôs conspiracy media?

Convenient Interesting. happened July August? know things opened back up, root cause, wouldn‚Äôt numbers stayed high instead peaking? Exactly. happened like this: september schools reopened summer break, one positive case class meant students tested class quarantined. many instances like minister decided change rules, need three confirmed cases class anything happen. Hence 50k+ daily new cases we're seeing now. french don‚Äôt learn guess Honestly point we‚Äôre arguing semantics. agree parts country still tail end first wave states like California NY completed first wave second every state waves starting time don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever quite get first peak trough graphs definitive end wave. I‚Äôll meet middle say we‚Äôre wave 1.5 Think replied wrong comment? Natural Selection ...coming spring. Premature celebration. Remember happened got 0 cases last time. Stay vigilant.  Oh talking total, I'm talking daily new cases trend past two weeks. know, relevant numbers. lack [...] consistent messaging leadership

This part often really understated. anyone remember early US government (I think CDC) told people masks _were not_ good idea? masks unknown factor, instead actively seek wear masks.

The sheer damage one public release insane. many fewer anti-mask assholes would message day 1 consistent pro-mask message? It‚Äôs hard. Wear mask.
Nobody claim ignorance anymore. NZ Aussie first dealing went autumn winter. would get worse already know manage conditions especially management plans able need do.

Super tired seeing routine US comparisons every thread whole world outside Asia burning. Especially disappointed seeing coming non-American like you. Even that, labs still can‚Äôt keep demand. least Paris. high priority prescription, couldn‚Äôt get appointment tested sooner 5 days out. misunderstand.

Nah man, show evidence. Link quote whatever believe supports claim. Show much difference due strategy. I‚Äôve given overwhelming evidence all/the vast majority difference dud strategy. 

**GIVE EVIDENCE OPINION SHUT PLEASE** Yeah, scenario mind, shit that's ridiculously high, disease hammering countries. never make everyone happy, try fools game. wondering day sudden demographic changes affect voting trends, public policy trends, etc.

For instance - Italy. Filled charismatic right-wing politicians. large traditional elderly population. Lots older people sadly died, soon die, due coronavirus.

That's get post post thousands college kids Penn State gathering parties front page time. Unfortunately, highly infectious virus care taking seriously, actions irresponsible minority continue impact people taking seriously curb spread.

In addition, article necessarily super helpful number reasons. 1) talks willingness young people wear masks says masks effective curb spread--but going needlessly even effective, ""wearing mask every time go out"" whole lot going bars restaurants lower take off. Similarly 2) pointing 2/3 people avoiding gatherings, still makes 1 3 people problem--a *very* sizable minority.

In town 100,000 never seen active contact tracing reported. Nope. one Europe wears masks. idea Americans think this. Yeah. know nothing el paso area lol say I‚Äôm glad PPE seems working me, far. 

I work high-risk job (pediatric dental hygienist) one coworker test positive, I‚Äôve clear far. extremely vigilant careful day day life, meaning go work home, occasional grocery trips non-work days. coworker got constantly goes week nights weekends; bars, restaurants, vacations state, etc. doesn‚Äôt wear mask she‚Äôs out, either. one surprised got it, surprised sick got. she‚Äôs healthy, active, young, etc. got SUPER sick. spread kids, parents (who 70s), grandmother 90s, spouse child, list literally goes on.

I live happy healthy life, living panic mode due whole misinformation ingested, you. admitted it. 

Don't sheep. 

Its future kids future generations. 

Good luck.  Well work healthcare job I‚Äôm getting first matter feel believe read accurate, yes. that's lot medicial workers, lot contact coronavirus patients get sicker others. Sweden also negative excess mortality year, third least deadly year ever far :) Ofc rest scandinavia living covid.  thought term ""influencer"" get worse. JFK think absolutely correct. sad still people think totally made up. yesterday argued 70 yr old dad it. USA! USA! USA! ""pro-individualism"" Aka entitled fucking assholes. tested positive twice?

Because may possible, catching twice statistically unlikely.

Sorry horrible room mate But, Muh freedum...  ability stop actually remarkable. wouldn‚Äôt disparage it. How? Pretty soon we‚Äôre back living almost normal lives without covid. can‚Äôt open borders dumpster fire rest world gets sorted Theres point arguing people like - wilfully ignoring facts though perfectly willing spout lies.

Point truth move on, frustrating though.  TL;DR -- location afford infrared thermometers either. looked like could also use better equipment/processes general, that's probably going happen. cookies though. 

I used app schedule appointment June, \~5 minutes prior donation, got message changed locations. drove new location, told ready another hour so, would taking appointments they're ready. given option reschedule via app wait around person another hour chance get squeezed point. wait around.

I used App schedule again, eventually got another appointment July towns over. got oral thermometer there. Twice. reason check waiting area nurse took information station. second check took extra long thermometer working right laptop slow. 

Another interesting thing spaced donor chairs initial waiting area, student volunteers greeted sitting right next behind table. think anyone really considered them.

During actual donation part, could hear Red Cross folks talking can't get tested many folks know ""probably"" already got COVID-19. mention PPE? Even though you‚Äôre rejecting offer (sensibly imo) I‚Äôm curious adequate PPE actually something scan promise. Even better could get ‚Äúadequate‚Äù defined written contract! bloody tough, baby barely knows family, means go back normal sooner, worth it. exaggerating.

It lot worse hospitals full. lot, like describe. :)  shows officials actually care *people's lives*, care managing resources. I've read one strangest things I've ever heard Canada live far it. joking. Lackluster containment policies GBD na√Øvety could spell even bigger disaster. 1) We're delaying inevitable.

This factual part. Masks stop virus completely. wear mask everywhere, still get virus point (hopefully lower viral load). get vaccine, inevitably get COVID. School holiday... Greetings boat, Georgia! misinformation, hits denier-memes. people shame, lot work British tabloids. doesn‚Äôt convey well meant say. point Big Pharma shit time absolutely unpunished, single individual made scapegoat crimes. Shkreli jail pharmaceutical execs even indicted hypocritical irony beyond belief. facing similar consequences. Let‚Äôs insult good people Paleolithic. almost loads people even allowed donate blood. know I'm not... irrelevant. flu distinct seasons Melbourne, there's saying Covid well. diminishing effort all, stating good news. Going summer 0 cases means outbreaks less likely happen going winter. 

Also, weather seem main factor behind seasons infectious disease. fact, know little seasons. Interesting LOL america ambulance like $200/mile, $1000 minimum. 

No, actually charge way, approximation. tizzy poor quality mortality data informing policy settled excess deaths, show UK guilty significant undercount.

Their tizzy effectiveness restrictions activity solved data China, Thailand, Vietnam, New Zealand Australia show effective followed effective test-trace-isolate protocols.

The effects hospitals demonstrated tragedies Bergamo, New York Quito.

The effects lifting restrictive measures early (and supported effective contact tracing) evidenced by, well, UK's current spike cases increase daily death count.

But course Jefferson Heneghan access information. Problem hacks. article junk. taken second read rest Australia? states basically covid free 6 months. others low transmission, usually people coming back Victoria. Australia proved free country. Actually thankful corona exposing shitholes. Look countries like Norway Finland want examples actual free countries virus control ate 10 marijuana edibles I'm still feeling it

edit: oh shit

edit edit: [time going really really wait they're putting dead bodies freezer trailer behind hospital.like NY take virus seriously first 

remember ? highest infection rate first.

yep mmhmm Driving sidewalk traffic density problem. much people, bad infrastructure gotta get moving.

It's that. People even traffic relatively light want wait 30 seconds light change want get front queue. everyone obviously lot people point local transmission Taiwan myth. need full blown stay-at-home order. hospitals capacity extremely bad situation Impossible That's Covid 'armless. /s end. Hold on.

Vaccines coming. might 100% solution, make cases drop. means hospitals less full, life overall become easier.

Eventually virus fade. next six months difficult.

Hold tight, get this. Australian one annualised. Nope. still pretty strict restrictions. Max 20 inside dining, 50 outside (max 10 per table), outdoor gatherings 10, weddings 10, funerals 20, 1 person per 4sqm shops etc etc. Lol I‚Äôm bored you. Continue personal vendetta Taiwan. simply can‚Äôt care less. Wrong. Wrong. wrong. mean, least try make sarcastic remark could learn difference annualised non-annualised GDP beforehand. Unemployment rather high What‚Äôs point posting successive arbitrary death milestone? EU side world... much problem beds ventilators now, qualified personnel keep alive using beds lacking. though? terrible heart cholesterol issues. yes. HK tested positive taiwan. know, reported HK contact tracing. 
this discussion board, shouldnt discuss? thread China, Taiwan Vietnam right place discuss.
so u dont like raise try shut up? confirm. don‚Äôt trust anybody. know someone ‚Äúso safe‚Äù wears masks, yet still goes eat get massages. Oh, wear masks requested even though they‚Äôre close proximity touching body. someone forget tell national projection day? 


Does peer review studied Nature work? one Oxford? cost every last shred freedom 2 kinds project manager, one optimistic keep late one pessimistic keep announcing huge delay end-up delivering early. 

Let's hope guy second kind Lets us talk much else get jinxed lol. take long Victoria become covid free lockdowns work? personally say twice since March rolled dice cardiac symptoms metrics normally would gone ER (normal 3-4 times year heart failure chronic chest pain.)

The time go (July) types symptoms also concerned I‚Äôd exposed... gone HMO shit-show lab routine labs better judgement‚Äîand drove versus take EMT.

I spent 3 days P100 soldering respirator that. 5k = 3.1 miles give Americans perspective that, lockdown ~15 weeks get 0 new cases 700‚Äôs. Y‚Äôall easy road ahead unfortunately. obsessed Taiwan‚Äôs COVID situation? It‚Äôs none business.

And travellers HK tested positive Taiwan. Victoria specific context - part island country low spread elsewhere. make sense contexts spread large broad effectively elimimate easily leak back borders. Multiple long lockdowns probably really possible non-rich-world countries unless they're hyper-authoritarian - i.e. North Korea. old chin diaper Lol. one sick person per family allowed single time???  
So decide sicker needs care first? problem curve flattened, large group people U.S. thought locked (some unrealistic point, indefinitely). made large group people country say ""fuck it"" drop many measures important protect spread. Hence meaninglessness statement... could 80% could lower higher. better puke pass choke yourself. blogspot.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

It‚Äôs mostly Reddit crowd hears nothing America bad America bad America bad every day reason we've taken steps U.S. since March, overwhelm healthcare system.

Don‚Äôt google article post like proves point. article reputable source, peer reviewed, methodology, conclusion make sense. statement innate immunity ‚Äúnovel‚Äù virus immediately contradictory. faux intellectualism speaks volumes understanding. grok it? someone 40k comment karma, figure grunt work

France Pop: 66mil

US: 94

382/66=5.78

5.78*52k=300,560*2=601,004 that's shit ton 250k. 

Now, consider number tests US daily basis, surpasses France aspects. 

So, 600k easily becomes 1m US... article doesn‚Äôt mention effectivity rate Remind 3 months. Hopefully Europe turn tide fast. Back March learned go credo: ""If everyone thinks crazy, right""

It helped numerous times. prepared first lockdowns caught everyone surprise.

My wife works nursing home, one wearing mask. One-third colleagues got infected, remained safe.

You right thing! Perhaps simply many large family friendly gatherings? Considering small family units Japan generations already? @canada could us instead you‚Äôve put us voluntary nosedive Yes, market rebounded. So... what, then? might missed edit mentioning county hospital, nearest county 97% capacity.

Anyway, sound weak selfish. statement ""closing borders already widespread community transmission work"". live country widespread community transmission Spring. closed borders. daily infection rate plummeted. opened borders, allowing people bring covid abroad, resulting current situation worse Spring. Closing borders *did* work. This, combined internal measures limit spread covid essential. Without sealed border never would gotten things control neighbor decided herd immunity way go. infection rate astronomically higher ours, allowing citizens free access would negated work get daily infection rate single digits. International travel since blown transmission rate. So, make simple: border controls worked. Period.

It's completely absurd many times need repeat comically simple concept you, seem sinking in.

America's problems due mitigating virus; border controls one tool, I've said aren't. would **WHEN EVERY FUCKING COUNTRY CLOSED BORDERS**.

This *would* every country closed borders *and* got spread covid within country control. community transmission suppressed people renege suppression measures, way jumps back brought outside. PERIOD. simple fact resonate you? keep bringing America reason. **THEY NEVER GOT CONTROL. EVEN CLOSE.**

And like guy, essentially admit border controls effective last paragraph. They're available online.

The little lockdowns earlier year nearly collapsed economies richest countries earth came within whisker shutting global economy.

If try another 2-3 months results absolutely catastrophic. exactly fear happen across entire Western world. Every medical expert every fact-believing member government know coming. Yet, things get bad enough, body bags see, loudest voices crying ""don't touch FREEDOM"" stop anything done, whole society pays. clear Asian countries well: competent governments take strong pre-emptive action, complying publics trust experts would follow public orders. era Covid, overwhelming advantage West have.

Yeah, lot people know enough pandemics understand... need prepare better, pandemic teaching late September, Jaap van Dissel, head Netherland institute health, still thought masks unnecessary. criminal. News anchors quarantining coronavirus exposure debate flight

Getting coronavirus probably list things do. And, I'm sure they'll get best care...they might even classified ""essential workers.""

But, coronavirus want? like social security. coronavirus lower number elderly people Social Security. coronavirus higher fatality rate lower income people minorities, two groups Fox generally disparage unwelcome welfare. 

If Affordable Care Act overturned, rich well-insured able afford coronavirus treatment. coronavirus proves long-term effects, away treatment pre-existing medical conditions also please them.

Seems like coronavirus would viewed benefit people. Hopefully, get sick happily pass along viewers well. Like said, ever believed ordinary people would suspend social lives depend get life months, naive. make assholes, makes normal human beings. literally biologically programmed crave social contact, incredibly unhealthy go long periods isolation without human contact, touch, meaning socialising gives life. sounds like might realising first hand. point, take responsibility health needs. That's human nature.

As comment scarred lung tissue lasting many years, evidence lung tissue scarring individuals get severely ill virus cause serious health complications, lungs heal exactly like minor damage caused time catch respiratory infection. might interested know common cold also cause lung tissue scarring lungs healthy people, go completely unnoticed person, cause health complications, quietly heal months lasting effects. Every indication far serious complications covid strongly linked serious initial illness individual. young person, very, unlikely get severely ill, unlikely get noticeable serious health effects last weeks.

If want isolate, go it, basis irrational fear long term complications. restrictions qualify ""hard lockdown"" mind? implemented? Right feels One defining features crisis intense pointless debate scientific terminology. part public confused. need simple guidelines central source think doesn‚Äôt dishonour anything. It‚Äôs like 1,95 making NBA, training hard years. It‚Äôs definitely something merits praise, honestly one 1,70 would made amount effort.

People Italy, Spain, Greece, Argentina went things, still could go funerals ecc. didn‚Äôt amount success. words psychological operation worked despair people consent anything get life back even means becoming guinea pig slave less rights before. Singapore great example operate post-lockdown society.

Singapore dictatorship. want live dictatorship? Winners go home fuck prom queen. big waves surged along coast, data poinys high boats lifted, terrible way see many waves would look total elevation boats along coast specific time, versus looking one location. worry guys.... liberal hoax! That's Trump said..... stupid motherfucker. Well good Victoria. wonder happen Hungary take probably actions brothers Poland. kids still going school government saying wont close them. Mask rules followed government facilities. People refusing wear masks properly. literal shitshow. got one thing going us. dont test (enough) much less covid cases. (Cuz know, dont test covid cases covid cases.) Republican talking heads looking send stimulus businesses employ poor. Nothing directly right. ask people work home effects Covid. They're representative anyone spends 40+ hours week sick people. know, along told us ""winter coming"" let us know things gonna get pretty shitty. delivered promise. noticed spiking like damn near everywhere Western Civilization. need mobile vaccine units moving around well. Set street corners, etc..... Closing borders merit course, trying contain spread within them. need epidemiologist know closing borders prevent spread *within* border, spread *across* it. 

Also im american, im Canadian. We've borders closed since march stopped us entering second wave. closing borders effectively combat main issue facing right now, community spread. main issue like NZ foriegn spread, yes border closures necessary. that's issue country facing, issue countries facing. Living Tokyo.

Fortunately appears serious minority rarely mentioned news one incident. paradox pandemic one ends freedom one voluntarily imposes restrictions oneself. example, reject use masks attack freedom end less freedom.

This sentence spot on. Good article. mean Foo Fighters guitarist? cooperation though, respirators sent Italy us Denmark example. 


However issues, one country one situation, others completely other. aid accepted standards met.  
Quick response also necessary. multiple EU countries agree response, might late. complaint opposition here, government shoving normal democratic process side. understandable point, open abuse. Oh, they've made attempts. Attempts convince people there, attempts convince people spread more. mean, technically second part attempting control guess. get masks wash day? Heck could change part way day even felt comfortable Link guidelines put department health?  live US, no, follow US FDA guidelines. country, Department Health issues guidelines donor eligibility That's follow. Blood Banking laboratory practices, follow AABB Technical Manual Clinical Pathology textbooks.

But US Pathologist, yes, following FDA guidelines donor eligibility, along AABB Technical Manual Blood Banking laboratory practices Blood Bank. harsh lockdown, invasive contact tracing. lot cities, everyone ""health apps"" phones, health department knows exactly everyone contact them. regions cellphone based tracking rare, announce names, addresses movements new domestic cases, effort identify, isolate test everyone came contact them, fails establish chain transmission, test entire cities. latest region Xinjiang tested 5 million people 3 days. IFR roughly 1%, anywhere 0-3 deaths likely Nonsense. Well still though, can‚Äôt get stage 2 unless go stage 3 step right direction Trumps fault too? still WAY little WAY late. Worldometers say Czechia recorded 130 deaths today, 13 per million people. extraordinary rate increase higher even Argentina. half-hearted ""curfew"" covering hours night people normally anyway anything curb outbreak? I'm predicting Western Europe US return death levels seen March/April, lock again. Despite scenario predicted months, entire Western world simply slept walked another disaster absolutely leadership social cohesion. understanding seriously ill patients, much harder treat. studies earlier progression virus may still work. finally understand Nirvana's third guitarist's name. found Colorado gym showers open.

I'm leaving Oregon tonight.

I shower since lost place live back lockdown.

I literally wondering I'd ever able take shower 2022.

Fuck job,I'll get another. Hope get better. imagine American military co-ran hospitals? Lmao Time move Austruliai. leaders Europe start damn job lead us that? still two months left, enough time get stuff control act now, right? know talking call anti science...Stop spreading misinformation Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack beheading related recently referencing. feel effects French people 2015 attack spoke experience.

I believe freedom expression mean freedom consequences. also believe bring gun pen fight, consequences, extreme over-reaction.

I think teachers beheaded. think teams artists shot death. think innocent women stabbed Eiffel tower. 

There nothing religious that. god feels happy people murdered drawing. God surely would weep.

I think lots people increasingly frightened unstable, violent, angry sick world. am, Australian. sounds like too. ignorance thinking Australia whole struggled virus winter, fact majority Australia managed well. Ignorance also thinking island advantage, it‚Äôs really irrelevant virus country it‚Äôs deal virus, deal borders. Also thinking smaller population advantage, comes utilitise resources, bigger populations places generally resources; thus use additional resources isolate hotspots deal pandemic develops big problem hence place like US ranked best deal pandemic COVID-19. Ignorance would thinking there‚Äôs huge spike going part world thing occur different part world seasons change despite place virus back levels similar start pandemic better prepared occurrences. really reason seen huge increases northern hemisphere never managed pandemic well first place. Get cases manageable levels it‚Äôs easier deal small future surges occur.  Italy, United States seem looking worse well. Oh yeah meant pursuing herd immunity *before* vaccine available, even current vaccine trials promising company whose name can't remember (it discussed episode TWIV), developing vaccine, passes trials, distributed lyophilized. definitely useful 3rd world countries since even require refrigeration. literally asking specifics you‚Äôre already talking about, don‚Äôt see troll.

What measures disagree with? see difference makes wave whatever is. looking ways categorizing fun now? keep talking this, media constantly ask stuff doctors? Perhaps wearing mask works? one thing everyone help situation, yet people still refuse wear them.  Source? What‚Äôs reasoning behind claim?

Except Redditors, course. can‚Äôt.... 

One requires restrictions business. forces 7 billion humans something threat. Lol couple months ago sub fawned Italy, Spain France model mask wearing social distancing effective. COVID success stories are:
- relatively affluent island limited ports entry 
- surrounded neighbor currently living stone age
- Weld people homes

Masks social distancing keep spread ballooning control. stop it. Nah happen thing happens every cycle.

The economy propped printing money, runs giant recession.

By Biden president dumb people blame democrats boom back republican president.

Monetary political policies take years show effect. could argued almost economic success Trump saw due Obama era policies. like much turmoil Obama saw caused Bush.

People really learn otherwise end making mistakes again. problem vaccine may ready still need able mass produce it. distribute might end happening months vaccine approved. Ireland seems. PPP loans forgiven (if use money appropriately) Epidemiologists technical definition virus waves, think usually year long.  AFAIK world still officially experiencing first wave. 7 months people still learned deaths come weeks. practically certain 400+ deaths per day coming Poland example based number detected cases current ratio detected cases deaths. :( Vaccine comes. 3 month gap election Inauguration going make worse. France get 52k cases day? 97k 2 days? everyone wearing masks, spreading like wildfire?  Yea, doctors nurses busy sitting thumbs. like whole country needing them. I'm sure military combat zones 100% time. sure, talk shit guys front lines moving front lines. Glad helping. saw mask! one though....

Do remember early on, clip woman coming prayer service, said ""Covered Jesus' blood,""? understand people ready die. look forward rapture. like say, read psalms. Specifically, David. 

Psalm 10¬†[1]1Why, LORD, stand far off? hide times trouble?

3 boasts cravings heart; blesses greedy reviles LORD.

4 pride wicked seek him; thoughts room God.

5 ways always prosperous; haughty laws far him; sneers enemies.

Quite honestly...Who remind of? *too woke brain handle üòÇ Yes strict lockdown. reopened slowly - different levels lockdown. People got whatever anyway. cases went - decline recently. Slowly starting go president threatening another hard lockdown. Honestly, dont think case ""not trying"", people dont give fuck anymore. Two relatives decided hoax dead people flu dont personally know one who's died. distortion fact Sweden restrictions milder many countries, high compliance recommendations, overwhelm hospital capacity, high average death rate compared (but all) western nations relatively lower levels societal disruption. 

The misinformation happens people bad nuance exaggerate everything, simplify generalise approaches various agendas play. Ruby Princess happened whole country state high alert go lockdown, quarantine leaks Victoria happened restrictions coming entire country thought time party.
The quarantine leaks involved 6 people took virus home, Ruby Princess involved 600 people took virus Australia. 
Totally different situations, equally bad fuck ups. lockdowns started EU guess we'll wait till april end them... Australia indicator seasonal influence. Eh agree paid donating blood (it donating all, selling), organizations take make good profit fuckary involved. Yes. hope shunning boycotts stick spread around. Remember also last summer bushfires. nasal-swab enthusiasts there. ""You're pulling out? Already??"" 

&amp;#x200B;

Not more, buddy. say put others off, I'm always surprised read this. know individual, give blood every three months feel absolutely different - go jog evening, go gym, go right back work etc. 

I mention want someone reading post thinking ""fuck that, I'm it"". chances someone passing really rare, especially eating drinking beforehand. 

Most healthy folk feel absolutely different, make massive change someone's life - potentially save some. able comprehend idea deaths could prevented people actually wearing masks following social distancing guidelines.

The officer contracted virus duty. article mention whether people house investigating wearing masks. also mention whether social distancing possible course doing.

Masks social distancing mitigation tools slow spread. misinformation claim death preventable. tragic, can't say preventable due people wearing masks friend lives E.P. said voting booths like 2ft apart, CLOSER years past 1/2 stations. used location long remember Vitamin D! heard aging 2 years deep frying make cheese safe eat. skip American Cheese safe. gonna people think put oven 60/70F slightly room temp lol never donated blood slim eligible (well except pregnant can't donate situation)  know why, I'm asking info released yet.

Seems misleading best. 5 28, one even looked significant. cases going across almost states right now. 5000+ active cases hundred new ones everyday isn‚Äôt controlling virus. enough clothes last months even years without needing shop, perhaps ready parent? Sweden best elderlycare world according UN. also fifth best world keeping people alive (5th highest average life-expectancy). Yikes... kid transferred another hospital born neonatal transfer team. team flew via fixed wing aircraft. transferred nicu land ambulance 45 minutes away. spent three weeks hospital. ever saw bill agree scale barely even trying here. guys serious mitigation even lockdown areas, still struggled winter. Also island nation smaller population helps, even though land mass huge, neighbors drive you.

I'm US federal government left mitigation states. could work except can't regulate international travel travel states, basically say ""do whatever mitigations want completely open borders."" 

With available borders Illinois Wisconsin, barriers international travel plane, feel like strict mitigation efforts would mostly wasted continue seeded virus. think mitigation really works control borders quarantine entering. Romans would rolling graves could see France Latin, adding random extra vowels every word impress women. 

There plenty Americans bilingual: approximately 20%.  Brainless. article says vaccine would provide protection 1 year. Assuming everyone world could get quickly enough (impossible know) mean virus would effectively go extinct? Nah, like ""any country that's actually trying"". Considering masks working time, global consensus, doubt lied. any, made mistake, big one. like scientists, acts according knowledge time, give suggestions based said knowledge. there's definitive ways know right wrong.

Vietnam decided take kind risk. Fortunately enough, Vietnamese people really question challenge authority. went well.

Now imagine Fauci said masks work, rest world, colleagues inside CDC yelling don't. u really think would make big difference? Even entire scientist communities saying works, still people saying opposite. 

Heck even say yeah works fk u I'm wearing one. Depending health insurance, could 5k got Covid. mention, people would feel terrible friends family contracted deadly virus wedding. 

It's worth it. friends cancelled weddings eloped. wedding worth risking loved ones' health. party really. I'd eat losses care friends' family's wellbeing. matter time cities Texas same. Yeah, no, risk health help bunch losers wear mask social distance protect themselves. Fuck em precisely testing hundreds thousands people world various versions strains vaccines. 

To learn possible side effects among various ethnicities. literally breathing in, utterly moronic c*** it‚Äôs airborne cloth mask won‚Äôt stop it. 
The tiny little covid particles smaller mask. 
But know what, link study saying masks prevent getting airborne virus. 

Do it, ‚Äúprevent spreading droplets‚Äù prevent catching airborne viral infection. 80% vodka bottle (going alc content) like drinking 0.7 50% bottle vodka 3 beers(5%)

It's healthy, course, also /r/cripplingalcoholism level literally contorting brain knots defending obvious typo. 

Yes mile larger. France 310 people per square mile, 47 (2.59 times amount average people would area 2.59 times smaller - 120 per km). Indeed, total population country even larger population average square mile.  Honestly, universal testing conducted institutions education new school year academic years started, pupils educators personnel. failure result lack preparations summer stave resurgence virus fall.  know damn well nothing done late. susceptible died already ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Early 2021 bit late! Canada policy place since fucking March. Good. Stay US keep virus there. scale Belgium US, would nearly 400,000 positive cases per day. Poor kid. article talks Vietnamese successful wore masks start. Fauci told us need masks beginning. lied us hospitals would enough. Even waited longer, borders never plan shut inevitable cases would reimported, kicking fresh cycle. preventable. Plenty people everything right still get it.

Only way prevent every single person planet stay inside leave house goes away. would never happen. remember growing reading books future would look like generally speaking 2020 we'd flying cars sub orbital commercial flights etc. Well, future nonetheless arrived. Thats thing. could going slower pace instead actual thin. State Victoria, Australia. Two months ago 750 cases per day. Lockdown, mask mandate...today zero (0) cases. fking rocket science. Thanks service. military know life line. didn‚Äôt sign became nurse. Shit hitting fan everywhere right now. thing training am, even big money travel nurse contracts locally. nurses, doctors, RTs going right horrible. It‚Äôs depressing we‚Äôre used wearing month old ppe don‚Äôt even think much anymore. work hope we‚Äôre okay. colleagues positive asymptotic, hospital 100 days ecmo, permanently disabled it. We‚Äôre put risk jobs. People gave fuck healthcare workers 4-6 weeks beginning. it‚Äôs business usual, new mental health issues risk. Like said, didn‚Äôt sign martyrs yet still lacking basic equipment keep us safe. Hospitalizations increasing, deaths plateaued moment rise starting relatively soon. follow logic, elaborate please. First wave tests. Impossible make comparison pure number trending. countries need plan post-lockdown. many countries, South Korea, plans carried quite effectively.

Use lockdown suppress cases ensuring hospitals able handle new infections afterward. lockdown, come plan control emergence new cases reopening, whether involves social distancing guidelines, contact tracing, etc.

Lockdowns sometimes necessary evil achieving goals. yet everyone talk thinks over.... I'm sure KN performance n95 severely reduced comes contact alcohol. may something want look into. seems really odd manafacturer recommending that. yes tax money, guess country would problem funding vaccination drive tax money except maybe freedom loving united states doubt Victoria want undo hard work get cases down. also look many Australian states see cases kept control. They're following example Lord Savior, Trump. Cases alone really tell us seriousness. Give evidence all. You‚Äôre rambling effects trends blah blah blah. Give source says significant part higher deaths per capita. **Give evidence shut fuck up**. Also UBI prop economy people stay home without fear going bankrupt. that's horrible strategy. Assholes. american still worst hit country despite closed borders lmao. 

And no, every country got control strict guidelines people *within* country, top closing borders. Almost every fucking country closed borders right now, maybe handful covid control. closing borders needed stop spread shit lasted fucking June. 

I mean come fuck dude. thousands positive cases *within&amp; country, people coming abroad really going impact? No, aren't. US hit 200k deaths closed fucking borders. stop now.  help lot U.S.' local law enforcement leaders anti-mask, often flouting they're going enforce mask mandates, even put place. Shit's fucked. Ridiculous, stupid, evil people. believe god punishes poor people, gay people, democrats. Ministry Health (MOH) preliminarily confirmed three new cases Covid-19 Oct. 26, new cases include one case locally transmitted Covid-19 infection, resided dormitory. Problem is, next. hardcore lockdown, push numbers temporarily down, moment reopen happen next? missing strategy next steps since day one ... 

Well, goverment fail explain main strategy way fight covid: wearing facemasks, social distancing increased washing hands - maintain numbers low enough time antivirotics vaccination become available. that, can't fight better, restrictions. That's way. steps followed required level see now, additional measures much bigger effect (because followed required).

If spring, came person goverment mathematical models scared PM level announce lockdown, health ministry failed miserably able create models. know, statisticaly monitoring statistics different R numbers, that's prediction model - reacting current numbers, need act ahead time.

From reason, afraid, worse possibly longest repeating lockdown(s) strategy ever, make example many books. playing throne games

when monsters broke wall guess hes right isolates people. measures cost remote work seems cost less gives. workplaces also work ways reducing costs, i.e isolation lonelyness. partners job really good that, virtual works, virtual house tour meetings etc. whole new position working limiting isolation effect distance work. 

Everyone job working remotely since like february. brothers friends. one is. Oh yeah many people don‚Äôt give fuck lmao

I everywhere France ive see yeah many people since lowered number 

But course true lol

If virus could kill 1 person family maybe people would understand see doesn‚Äôt affect Please excuse attempt pull eyebrows ceiling. happened El Paso ? Jesus. eat croissants America three distinct waves.

The first wave mostly centered around Northeast. second wave centered around sunbelt. third wave centered midwest.

What common? time year occurred weather outside conducive outdoor dining (with course first spike also part idea happening already well underway).

Now look Europe, first second wave. pattern. Winter upon us. wish Europeans luck, think lulled thinking American problem inept handling it. yeah, America poorly this, simply American problem, never went away Europe hiding, waiting weather turn people would go inside more. majority Australia. course it‚Äôs important keep testing keeping distance possible cases drive back again. I‚Äôve literally worn mask - get tested - haven‚Äôt community cases month (longer many places Australia). Don‚Äôt get wrong, I‚Äôm masks community spread I‚Äôd wear one, right risk there. encouraged get tested symptoms sewage tested look unknown cases. one get advised every place person gone infected. catch early enough contact tracing really work wonders. got names news article? Gonna really easy state liquor authority go checkup, like lot places NY. hearing new angle- going get anyway. Nothing stop . still flu though would love however overseas child considered risk mad cow disease. however willing give, ineligible life. Alright well annualized Australia way 2% vs US 9.5%... Look -Sweden terrible first wave even though infections rising hardly anyone dying. 

Compared neighbouring countries they're still much worse. It'd better countries regular short intense lockdowns year long restrictions. gas station work mask required signs allowed enforce it, neither police. Less one third people wear fear people's lives. Circle K give fuck American lives would rather see us die That's No, since March. Lol. I'm American fuck tard. clearly work. Cause worked every country it. Like every country control closed boarder beat it. way round. think? Sweden (or do) caused higher death rate?  must least 10,000 'possible causes reduced male fertility'. One would think people sub worry anyway. Glad hear migrant worker dormitories control. Singapore seen virtually community spread months. I'll agree stateside, states done great job reducing it, commend states. can't agree ever control whole states starting infections different times, that's still considered part first wave.

I honestly stress winter coming, USA numbers (as well northern hemisphere countries get cold) going skyrocket again.

Keep safe everyone make sure wear mask. Hopefully new restrictions immediately go effect help avoid lockdown later road. Oh see saying. bad. 

Still, I've heard MANY experts say vaccinating country staggering ordeal can't ignore (although fingers crossed things go smooth!) Lousy beatniks Would make difference. Besides, Germany reach point weeks needs line drawn caution fearmongering.

This virus serious enough warrant months long lockdowns, definitely serious enough warrant cancelling massive Thanksgiving dinner gatherings. one hand, save lives, other, continue funnel billions dollars ultra-rich order fund baby blood fueled GoKarts. hard make right choice. Trump plan?! true. mandated work &amp; college (and possibly K-12?), people get vaccine. one locally seem still taking seriously. 

oh, understand. maddening. know handle handle anymore. quarantine, masks, 'social' distancing, keeping things clean, touching stuff. that's bad.

what's bad almost everyone around choses deny it, even cases abound. i'm hard time respecting them. go out, forced, put thin veneer civility. 

the reason put anything right give anyone courtesy resignation. chiseled leader magical afternoon explains difference eastern western countries. France's numbers higher US citizens give less fuck US Canada. 


Spain less same, mask use +90% fucking months we're still seeing exponential growth. There's myriad things countries fuck outside using mask (lack testing, enough contact tracing, small homes, high public transport use, etc...) Lies misinformation.... hmm ü§î Oh ye! knew wearing masks useful? American Karen's though! It‚Äôs free someone paying somewhere whole US mess half people refusing take precautions cause fearless leader 'only' 85k reported. reiterate: South Korea, 100 cases considered emergency. thinking correct. also Sweden plan? Ya, ok. it‚Äôs magical rule then. workplaces require likely not. employer taking liability. According city, exercise consider essential. Sure are. every person ignores basic safety protocol risk getting sick. 

Most people don‚Äôt show symptoms run risk long term respiratory issues possibly dying. death rate went doctors learnt better ways manage disease. Buying time saves lives.  read comment, mathematically correct. understand hung say ""orange"" apple, magically make apple totally unrelated since case I'm saying ""orange"" orange.

Besides, way density position dependent? point dimensionless, would calculate density that? poorly communicated point trying get across. ""Have done worse"" nothing suggest really mean ""are currently worse."" 

The snark really warranted, point making perfectly valid. There's lot places bad trajectories right now. OK feel bit geographically dumb now, feel like Urumqi somewhere would know even less location-wise Xinjiang. like China. go there, upon arrival sent directly quarantine hotel literally locked room two weeks. come hazmat suits bring food, put sanitizer tablets toilet flush poo, report temperature daily.

After two weeks, less free roam country. Pretty much everything wide open.

Dunno there's special conditions qualify entry, even conditions. Friend mine business.  aren‚Äôt locked there‚Äôs pandemic anymore done it, expect? China isn‚Äôt full freedumb murican trash.

They took hardsteps early drag feet. rest world busy appeasing conspiracy theorists population. timeframe actually quite definite everyone literally suffer together. mean discipline strict abidance code conduct?

Fat chance heard puffins masking well Yeah, big increase cases NB recently, things back iffy. like rest canada scary, still worrisome Thats works all. comes point spread enough within country outside influence irrelevant. US perfect example. #1 cases deaths despite closed borders, cases spreading *within* country. 

The time closing borders important low cases/ cases country. many cases though, spread fine without foreign influence. Again, *as seen worst hit country*. 

I mean seriously people exhausting. Trump constantly goes closed border china recommendations yet *evidently* fucking effect. actually clue virus spreads contrarian sake it? Well guess you‚Äôll take care expenses livelihood essential works wants quit. Yeah real..That‚Äôs much Lol holy shit AZ. Weird neither states anything meaningful covid immediately saw significant upticks case numbers. Must coincidence. Freaking Murdoch media driving agenda others trail along. look Wuhan saying November bring lockdowns. Agreed. kept saying lucky live state taking action (at one point) model do.

Oh times changed Great Lakes states grip synchronized spiraling pandemic. Seven states border lakes, including Wisconsin, near all-time-worst daily case totals. along 16 states, Wisconsin added cases last seven days weeklong 41,000 people currently hospitalized coronavirus United States, 40 percent rise past month. Daily death tolls risen sharply, inching upward: country averaging 800 deaths day first time since mid-September.  Yeah, definitely healthy mentally think that's social distancing entails. Sure sounds like liberal hoax me. doubt doctors killing people make Trump look bad. already gave one. countries leaders lead example never discredited scientists.  said *global* hope friggin allow mail in! Nope. Even get vaccine, anti-vaxxers claim it‚Äôs poison. Trump retweet support anti-vaxxers like he‚Äôs done past minority country fuck everyone else again. I'm skeptical. frequent donator bad back injury, feel blood bank irresponsible personal data asked much personal information. covid test asked insurance information get results even though contract signed said hand over, nurse. since america they're selling blood profit. comes,  


here comes lockdown.  


It's virus wheels Turning corner..... Agreed. post wildly inaccurate Meanwhile Iowa it‚Äôs even worse governor doesn‚Äôt give fuq. Almost one wearing masks enforced stores. many signs masks social distancing... asinine! Yup. Even cases weren‚Äôt rapidly increasing, restaurants starting shut windows roll back outdoor dining weather - I‚Äôm rolling back public. remember people told us stay home earlier year. Dan Brown's Inferno. don‚Äôt see nearly many young people flaunting rules 30, 40 50 year olds it. Lots parties get togethers hanging bars/restaurants. problem beds, problem enough staff. really wanted to, could end whole thing 3 weeks. one willing make sacrifice everyone except medical professionals actual essential employees staying house 3 weeks. so, could COVID19 longer limited respiratory illness? trigger different symptoms different people? We've warned months thing going get worse fall/winter. 

So infuriating. places manage. number deaths allow ""burn out""  astronomical. . burn either. first one specified headline bullshit, other, read it, said damn thing.

Calling names wont make case better. get comment removed mods. shirin david broke quarantine make video. Although banger really Imperial College London‚Äôs initial analysis COVID response pat. would several different waves lockdowns every time lift sanctions, people going get exposed again. But, predicted lockdown measures followed governments. Many states mask mandate, never TRULY shut down. country never mitigate COVID people can‚Äôt think people second means something even slightly inconvenient (like mask). federal mask mandate, federal weekly/monthly stimulus relief, federal shutdown order, plan reopen phases shut back necessary. leadership believe economy valuable human life, keeps personal coffers filled. 

I honestly think COVID-19 going adapt evolve becomes annual illness ‚Äúseason‚Äù requires vaccination, like happened 1918 Flu current influenza strains. Go ISS send email. free market‚Ñ¢ ensure last beds used willing pay them. that's works here. Literally fuck people get deserve. didn‚Äôt give others would care. I'm regular donor bit rush bc Red Cross COVID antibody testing locations Sept, extended Oct areas. mean, still win popular vote. end, EC went Trump, we're talking 70,000 votes swinging towards him? 95% poll pretty skewed something like saying Hillary 100% chance winning. People like Joe Rogan trash CA Gavin Newsom handling COVID like Texas, well outcome idiots. That's lockdown curfew. 10pm-5am. business usual. city absolutely incompetent enforcement, band-aid stab wound. trust Covid-19 divine retribution. world verge war January world burning, verge mass extinction flora fauna. deserve flirting destruction. Let happen say definitely aren‚Äôt learning better it. think countries need aim (or close to) elimination. Anything cases per million seems get control quickly. 

Most states Australia open business many months new covid normal. strong internal external border controls appears keep virus down. example, number days since last known locally acquired case states good example this:

* QLD 32 days
* SA 81 days
* ACT 109 days
* TAS 164 days
* WA 169 days (closed state borders)
* NT 205 days

All eggs vaccine basket, looking like safer bet time goes by. would like see public reaction it....checkout fitfamelpaso Instagram see comments.  ripping entire metro. Las Cruces Juarez. convention center converted hospital. many people area think invincible wont happen them. story we've heard over. Deny, deny, deny till infected hundreds. know main concern here, sure hope stop people voting. Obviously choice life able go vote, stay home, Texas seems pretty vital moment (and voting response amazing far) hopefully momentum continue. remember California went hiring people contact tracing instead making app decentralized API. summer bunch us got COVID tested positive none us contacted referred contact tracers want rain parade, winter coming. Unless Australia steel grip bound air travel, outbreaks. eastern Canada, numbers relatively low onset March, dropped summer months. Restrictions eased, things held steady. colder temperatures, seeing spike transmissions. I'm going speculate Xmas write . saw something saying April 2020 changed rules gay blood donation? COVID need? sure changes blood drive area gay teacher saying finally able give new rule change. US medical tourism pretty big dustry Australia. lot procedures, cheaper fly Australia, family, first class, put hotel, entire duration treatment, fly back first class, get treatment US. Live best, blood-clotted, limited long capacity life. words, fine type person makes claims can''t support. least know though. **How help: American Red Cross asking people feeling healthy well eligible give blood platelets make appointment donate Red Cross Blood Donor App, visiting RedCrossBlood.org calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767). find local blood collection site schedule appointment donate visiting www.aabb.org/giveblood‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã calling America's Blood Centers 1-202-393-5725.** Assuming adhered to, think quite long. 2 weeks seems upper limit, tail end curve random case two, surge. average time seems 4-7 days, hopefully surge peaking 1-2 weeks instead 2-4.  looked like Trump wanted go bad.  


fyi lose credibility previous arguments state something pants head retarded. Doc here. Surgery subspec. icu/EM. hospitals fucked. That's Step 1. 

Step 2 politicians stand around pointing fingers asking nobody told problem. live El paso go work tomorrow, office, refuse let us work home. work call center hate feeling like I'm going bring covid home family every day. order shit wonder freedom non mask wearing mean much family members die. said ‚Äúwe learning live it.‚Äù dutch store nearby town, Ontario, got trouble authorities complying mandated protocols (masks, sanitizers, arrows, customer limits etx). Threatened huge fines, owner complied, I'll buying beemster licorice elsewhere now.  given two pieces mutually supporting evidence logical mechanism support claim. 

Not sure exactly trying achieve sound little like toddler learned say ""but why?"" repeatedly every answer. Lots places did, comment focused think (or not) coming months. Thank you. Pretty much sums hide numbers. 15,000 dead claim 1,500. cases.  Yes. course different levels. people never even symptoms, sick couple days goes along continuum people incubated ICU. wearing safety glasses China nowadays something?
I've worn glasses life, stop rain getting eyes. can't possibly expect believe stop cloud microscopic virus going around eyes stop dust. C'mon! That's fucking nonsense. literally evidence main cause, majority France this, subreddit's desperation find reason cases rising. wish could get even half country give fuck enough wear masks distance. Even lockdown phase, people barely changed habits Yep. wife sees 94 year old grandma weekly. wears N95 go groceries, taking grandma doctor, flu shot, etc. grandma issues stuff like laundry, plugging many things tripping breakers...

There's naturally chance might get sick wife there's lot else do. wife's brother, hand, goes hours end two young kids wife needs 'me time' never offers help. try compassionate lot people exceptionally careless pandemic.

Sorry rant, lol. Sure, let's start them!  take full responsibility, it‚Äôs fault gave private citizen's information government?

Fist  rarely go anywhere see people masks do. IMO bars opened ""restaurants"" people partying and/or partying homes. told places close 9 everyone proudly said ""its time day drink."" Hating city right now. El Paso Strong ass.  wish like China handling virus. Everyone living life partying long time already lot families can‚Äôt distance learning don‚Äôt work home. Wow, never thought I'd see another lockdown. Stay safe, Texas! made tough, unpopular necessary calls.

I lucky governor state, Illinois, done *relatively* well regard despite federal govt taking seriously enough. Thank using accurate terminology describing would targeting. I'm sad first thought whether really due corona virus, tactic suppress vote, would made policy week election. Good points. Either way, we're locked locked down. year felt like we're longer Australians, Victorians. Thank you, honestly I‚Äôm embarrassed town parents grew El Paso mom especially thinks it‚Äôs overblown shouldn‚Äôt require shutdown. hope wake call them. Experts saying would eventually happen 6 months ago. experts right. Again. experts. care search up, worth time Yeah watch press conferences see Dan put with.

Not sure exact number he's done 100 back back daily press conferences. crazy amount work, time sacrifice state. remember getting really emotional said seen Mum since December Misusing word ""debunked"" make right.

Quite contrary.

The data us publicly available public statements lag time statements CDC scientists studies regarding accurate calculations total deaths.

 inability absorb information outside Fox bubble use calculator matched ability dig old threads, check dates, get facts wrong. I'm never, ever, ever going take social interaction &amp; living freely granted ever again.

I talk students zoom frequently. kid ever going complain going school again! Maybe Trump guy world thinks case deaths graphs top view side view. 50% good news no? opening cases hit zero. Learning live instead eliminating like Australia New Zealand means economic damage long term lockdown couple weeks longer could do. local news reporting lock down? literally couldn‚Äôt find anything google supporting claim going lockdown again. I‚Äôm another lockdown, couldn‚Äôt confirm this.

Do link something could read BNO? New Zealand strong, competent, compassionate leader. that's true US, there's way things going get better. vaccines reportedly effectiveness 50% 70%. no, getting vaccine enough. need wait infection numbers down. Southern hemisphere? thought one week Holland... Today we've got cases Holland, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain Russia. 

To say three days: really not, like two days. practically tests collected sunday, saturday half testing hospitals also make tests.

Great sunday shopping Tivoli Perry Markt though! Clearly haven‚Äôt.. won‚Äôt situation. infuriating. I'm frustrated point. house since March kids...but deserve we're ""living fear."" ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Eh fuck dude, let's go bowling makes think mandated? Wroc≈Çaw represent! Hope gonna alright, rest poles Unfortunately early one Europe USA took seriously - chance stop it. People worrying covid early February treated crazy media hardly talked it, explaining much big deal chance affect us.

Lots people today super pro-lockdowns laughing expressed worry tried wear masks. Well mean reason Southeast Asia, Oceania Sub-Saharan Africa way better rest world. 
I mean culture , politic system , climate , geography stupidity selfishness western populations. play part less , many countries, example South Korea pretty bad (for standards) past pandemics. 
The elefant room experiences. regions lot experiences fighting epedimics or/and infectious diseases high death rates countries Europe , West Asia, North South America have. 
Experience dealing challenge/problem makes better so. THIRD WAVE STILL FIRST THIRD SPIKE FIRST WAVE SMALL IMPORTANT THING thats would 20% positivity rate.... want 5% less. France COVID update: Daily hospital deaths, new admissions (2,314) highest level since April

- New cases: 26,771
- Positivity rate: 17.8% (+0.8)
- hospital: 17,784 (+1,330)
- ICU: 2,770 (+195)
- New deaths: 258 simultaneously hate love comment? forcing anyone anything. That's happens gut worker protections. get it, ""right"" work somewhere else take you. ""choose"" work, that's ""right"" to. one forcing you. said ""deaths hospital"". France including deaths outside hospital statistics? would certainly consider ""a cases there"" great success fight covid. Straw man argument stop posting stuff that's misinformation? ...if achieve immunity. vaccine 60-70% effective there's decent chance immunity. Sigh I'm going around circles. Look posts. Western Canadians saying thing 6 months ago. look. 

This virus insidious comes back vengeance. needs one person slips cracks spreads quickly.

In winter potential much higher. summer much lower. 

Look Edmonton Kelwona.

Alberta (province Edmonton in) leading North America response:

1. contact tracing app
2. Manditory mask orders
3. Mass asymptomatic testing 
4. Bans large gatherings 
5. army contact tracers 
6. Social distancing work home 
7. Isolation international travellers (inc Canadian citizens) hard border closure 

All summer fine. last week 1 person slipped cracks. shutting way contain virus. 

By contrast Kelowna ( BC) outbreak Canada Day (July 1) one person reintroduced virus community. app manditory mask order BC Kelowna. 

That outbreak blew overnight. simple contact tracing isolation contained virus September brought cases back zero. 

The difference Kelowna happened summer. Edmonton happened fall (although fall basically winter, snow cold).

I'm Vancouver. I'll honest second lockdown prepared second lockdown. expecting Thanksgiving seems like chugging through, still expect one Christmas. 

Enjoy summer vigilant. Positivity rate: 21.6%

Looks like testing improved much since March. Ah, touche fine summer, long warm. like 7.5k cases day, 20% positivity. Must missed statement, though find surprising. I'm aware *any* vaccines 100% effective. measles like 99.7%, that's still 3/1000 chance getting exposed. Corona vaccines probably like 50-70%. Still good enough get job done. agree. first started hearing it, thought would effect much SARS MERS. I‚Äôm covid denier I‚Äôve living life locked since March. Previous lockdown though heard little covid Reddit never ever thought would turn today. I'm sure quite understand. ""lower cases"", cases. things say do, we, see things commenter said - hug elderly immunocompromised without possibility dying drowning bodily fluids weeks - too.

Apart overseas interstate travel, life within Australia day day basis time last year- added hand sanitiser addiction dots floors far stand lines. And, covid.

That quote cowards true. Americans looking like cowards put little bit effort stay home bit protect others. Maybe safe way still work, like house calls garden balcony, masks on? Also, perhaps offer choices. could work schools. Teachers students alike allowed choose virtual, hybrid, special needs certain sub-groups, maybe full in-person. 

Allow workers work home, remain desired. 

I know businesses districts allowed things. important! Community spread still high lockdown areas, simply humans gonna human. need something, make happen. 

And people need babysitters school closed, share duty amongst many households. People need education, form cohorts. need nature, whelm rural areas. need human contact, sneak parties. 

Finally, need eat, turn crime. know first hand, attacked recently 2 guys wanted money. drove studio alone dark, surrounding businesses closed permanently. 

My point is, plan clearly working. Violation rule four. Reported. Enjoy ban. also says arguing semantics really matter want call it.

Ha. Welp, sure agree there. virus certainly knows night, hence curfews, know christmas? flu, boys, nothing see here. /s busy banning abortion campaigning LGBTQ people... get money back member states contribute more. 

Why would conclude Poland received funds hasnt funds left? Currently really clear dealing funds (I assume prioritize supporting economy) fact Poland prioritized together Spain Italy EU plan. Idaho, listening? can't really call first wave, like wave. 0% chance one person USA COVID19. never completely disappear, least anytime soon. Never said president authority read governor Stitt refuses mask mandate. atheist would agree all. indoctrination. Yes beware today's numbers 28 hours instead 24 hours due delay state serum institute number overestimates daily increase per 24 hours level two previous days 8-900. think zero correlation nonsense. good though, I'm out. got source you. Interestingly May still highly relevant like gamble pay off. Make giant payment fund development get doses early never done before

It's done Italy. Jesus christ I've seen nothing positive news last day. state finally hit fat donut we're reopening tough 3 month lockdown. needed survey this??? family Kamyshin (a small town southern Russia) telling theres similar story there. baseline ""acceptable"" new cases per week 10,000 according Fauci. That's number say virus control. never got back level passed it, that's Fauci says we're still first wave.

But also says arguing semantics really matter want call it. that‚Äôs don‚Äôt believe everyone qualified vote lol Hard say need act. 

No, hard say need act. 

* Wear mask. 
* Keep 6-feet distance. 
* Wash hands. 
* Avoid indoor activities. 

More details here:  ""420th wave weed""

I see there. thought that‚Äôll rustle jimmies

That‚Äôs it‚Äôs really goddamn stupid Europe says otherwise. Government saw slightest downtick infection rates basically given restrictions. guess care thousands poor kids dropping school. guess care minorities falling behind educationally economically. 

Obviously, know without conversation, quote simple mantra safety without thinking them.

Conversations good. serious discussion, perhaps could change mind. perhaps could come way help vulnerable community. society, refusing talk seriously side leads simplistic answers.  things taken care of? everywhere I've heard of, private schools afford remote learning space distance public schools simply don't. expect teachers come back social distance maintained, actually can't be, bargaining good faith. people sub still stuck March, back thought COVID could spread like measles reason. single major outbreak stemmed beach, one.

Should let people beaches zoos (with crowd control!) national parks keep bars restaurants closed. Roll vaccine asap give em. need much Oh man, would drag infected partner see mom, maybe give big sloppy kiss, hang around long possible. needs find god's plan her. Oh, get term life insurance go over, too. Dang believe? Dr Anthony Fauci, shizzmynizz? 
This tough one US like France also govern Poland something. job interviews office jobs asked mask policy. told one required wear mask (which means one does) unless can't keep distance 6 feet (which much prevent airborne virus spreading). even bother wearing mask interview. Others put mask soon saw walk (which means one office wearing mask got there). offices windows closed AC ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è. 

I'm starting wonder safer work retail. least everyone required wear mask times. dark days ahead us. Please keep safe. get money back member states contribute more. 

Why would conclude Poland received funds hasnt funds left? Currently really clear dealing funds (I assume prioritize supporting economy) fact Poland prioritized together Spain Italy EU plan. hope better now. Even Fauci said vaccine widely available 3rd quarter 2021. 

Uh no, said April 2021 could start widely available. Got invited Halloween party coming weekend.

Think I'll attach CDC guidelines ""WTF?"" response I'm sending checking one state anything near said? two major items one else we‚Äôre huge factors success?

That‚Äôs point. lock everyone get spread control keep everyone citizens province live relatively risk free. 

No one else willing seem dismissing non factor. Creating bubble smart keeping closed smarter. It‚Äôs certainly inconvenient it‚Äôs keeping virus bay accomplishment considering whole world going hell right now. parent comment also violate rule?

This blatant point. Either economy collapses healthcare system does

Why both? asked going call Berlin help immediately said going deal themselves... think eradication ever option 99% places got it. was, preventable entirely. Much easier prevent eradicate. yeah, completely agree you.

Summer spent largely open, encouraging people take Vit D, exercise, etc. wasn't. we've got COVID plus cold weather. Fun. older populations vaccinated, death rate fall (HOPEFULLY) flu. 

&amp;#x200B;

We need everyone vaccinated get point. 95% hospitalizations deaths people 50 Kids school excellent spreaders flu. whatever reason, they're good spreaders COVID. Study study country country confirms children **not** serious vector COVID spread. Yep, actually likeliest scenario Fast forward last week, forbid abortion cases lethal fetal conditions, caused widespread, massive riots middle epidemic. USA # 1 living life instead cowering fear. Sounds like responsible masking required. Maybe values mental health fear? saying dick, completely legitimate way operate. conservativism looks like. husband working Covid unit nursing home. tested regularly isolation hotel week working, came isolate another week home. isolation ends Wednesday returning work non Covid home.

He feeling crappy past week work/home, thought allergies testing negative symptoms severe.

Here's issue- test last Tuesday, workplace told would call it. got call thought negative. got text co-worker two nights ago saying rumor work Covid-19, tell told her.

 went last test today heading back work Wednesday. tested positive told also tested positive Tuesday!!! one bothered tell him, everyone work knew positive test except him!!

Here question- told bosses/the nurses work since likely contracted first day work almost two weeks ago fever currently, good go back work Wednesday. correct? want refuse go back yet get fired, definitely want spread around nursing home, whole incident somewhat lost trust here. France right infuriating. like y'all could stop kissing family friends' cheeks five fucking minutes goddamn pandemic every country, though. US. government media control internet fabricating fake videos news reports us see. keeping us inside telling us can't leave country feed us lies! immune compromised people get vaccinated though? That's difficult situation in. something could say her? also near spread, comparable, try again.  necessarily, strong possibility. EU still reformed deeply, reforms would necessarily bring integration might sabotaged eurosceptics. Time tell. anything first nail coffin Brexit, Eurozone crisis. [And whole lot sure, less ignorant stupid people see wearing mask threat freedom. Okay? still authoritarian lol shame everyone entertains idea resume normal life spite COVID, make inevitable start ignore resume normal life spite COVID.

Find sustainable plan, fatigue keep getting worse people stop giving shit. like *every* school district. mine, sadly :( Rudolf super-spreader.. *taps forehead* That‚Äôs wondering. there‚Äôs good chance even get vaccine, antibodies encourages body make aren‚Äôt 100% stopgap catching even spreading virus, sounds like. Yep, Florida opened faster states, never mask mandate death rate nowhere near New Jersey's, call police people working gym. üòû Norway people complaining restrictions. Why? really cases, one death every third day something. So, perhaps restrictions works, then. politicians panicking, see looks nothing. people get smarter panic happens. hospitals turning ambulances away.

I saw doctor today commented doctor friend El Paso (Texas) told they're sending people home die. hospitals full intensive care units critically ill patients full. 

So people unlikely recover sent home die, make room people might able pull treatment. 

It's horrible expect get lot worse couple weeks Thanksgiving. 

## Abstract

Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) regarded infective-inflammatory disease, affects mainly lungs. recently, multi-organ involvement highlighted, different pathways injury. hemoglobinopathy, hypoxia cell iron overload might possible additional role. Scientific literature pointed two potential pathophysiological mechanisms: i) severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV- 2) interaction hemoglobin molecule, CD147, CD26 receptors located erythrocyte and/or blood cell precursors; ii) hepcidin-mimetic action viral spike protein, inducing ferroportin blockage. translational medicinebased narrative review, following pathologic metabolic pathways, deriving hemoglobin denaturation iron metabolism dysregulation, highlighted: i) decrease functioning hemoglobin quote; ii) iron overload cell/tissue (hyperferritinemia); iii) release free toxic circulating heme; iv) hypoxemia systemic hypoxia; v) reduction nitric oxide; vi) coagulation activation; vii) ferroptosis oxidative stress lipoperoxidation; viii) mitochondrial degeneration apoptosis. clinical syndromes may follow, pulmonary edema based arterial vasoconstriction altered alveolo-capillary barrier, sideroblastic-like anemia, endotheliitis, vasospastic acrosyndrome, arterio- venous thromboembolism. speculated COVID-19, beyond classical pulmonary immune-inflammation view, occurrence oxygen-deprived blood disease, iron metabolism dysregulation, taken consideration. comprehensive diagnostic/therapeutic approach COVID-19 proposed, including potential adjuvant interventions aimed improving hemoglobin dysfunction, iron over-deposit generalized hypoxic state.

**Key words:** COVID-19, hemoglobin, iron, hypoxia Specifically COVID, two factors made weird: there's difference cloth vs medical masks, aerosol transmission.

Medical masks used effective PPE never actually question effectiveness was, scientific consensus whether civilians wearing *cloth* masks, whose primary function limit aerosol spread wearer. Governments endorsing civilians buying medical masks/PPE stock anyway, effectiveness specifically cloth masks contention. March/April scientific consensus whether aerosols major source COVID transmission. thought transmitted primarily touching infected surfaces followed eyes/nose/mouth, etc. knew could live aerosols, confirmed later big part spread. work CO? article mentions location tracked, could anyone use it? love books. Also, clearly fucked season 8 really bad heard read even one person say ""I think I'll rewatch GoT shelter place order!"" even one time. Well, likely aware pro's con's hospital ships, been, therefor happy read. thought might one, I've shared it. indicated statement would wrong get, denying relevance additional information, enjoy day, anyhow, ... [Citation Needed] Crime China extremely low Yeah, limiting shop hours make much sense... supermarkets packed saturdays.. another Dutchie seems like most, part country least, finally got message. went supermarket last Friday 90% younger people finally seemed wearing masks keeping distance properly. 

And older people, know vulnerable ones restrictions supposed protect, happily walking around store without mask, traditional gossiping get-togethers middle aisles, squeezing tight space could without caring distancing. 

Fucking infuriating Disagree. Personally, think fully imagine getting elected. Furthermore, believe he's worried future ""elections."" 2020 may last democratic election moved scorched earth construct. Nothing matters get elected. gets elected, can't 3rd term, one matter afterwards.

He's already introduced rule make policy-making positions Federal government subject presidential ""rule"" making president's government rather people's. rule, Individuals holding positions fired without cause.

Question: Supreme Court Justices Federal employees? make policy?

If President Trump wins, since Pence proven perfect ""yes"" man fully capable taking orders, wonder would shortly replace Trump. first line... uh... pre-fab prison modules Yeah, creating vaccine one thing. 
Mass producing another. 
Administering whole world yet another Herculean task. Spain going refuse give weekend updates matter bad gets? It‚Äôs strange every country world figures give daily updates guess care thousands poor kids dropping school. guess care minorities falling behind educationally economically.

Only time right wing lunatics ever shed tears poors minorities opening schools makes daddy trump look bad fact even elderly, fragile demographics survival rate still like 85% without treatment. Maybe talking two different things. I'm talking trials data prove/disprove effectiveness gain approval begin shipping.  

You might able access vaccine then. RI live think was/is case RO governor. condescending talks people like children, really coming like she‚Äôs telling people deal it. 

But doesn‚Äôt get - gets police escorts classy restaurants whenever feels like it. touch fuck. many locales U.S., social distancing already subsiding increased openings occupancy limits. Many using rationale everyone wears mask, distancing restrictions overly necessary. saying correct, many going with.

Thus, view, required mask use continue 2022 possibly beyond. Likely time vaccinated. see happening 2021 even best case scenario. Hope I'm wrong post ages badly. Production vaccine issue - companies making top candidates given funding pre-produce vaccines deemed safe, already stockpile start moving.

The issue, obviously, logistics, whether production keep demand stockpile distributed. Redditors think smarter senior banking leaders. surprise me, hubris tend propagate well here. Damn bad enough discount entire amazing show cast. book series matter. Everyone making sacrifices though. war right status quo disrupted us. feel bad kids here, people really think kids educational needs worth risking long term physical health? Look sandy hook batman France sailing away sunset crown sadly Denmark reach +25 hours first time single day. Uyghurs might like word you. guess care teachers dying covid. Vote.

And vote, learn voting for. 

And nationally - give local elections gravitas national one - more. governments

You mean everyone except US, UK, Australia... office California 150 200 people office. remote capable entirely since mid 2019 covid. permitted work home March June. point brought everyone didn‚Äôt kids health problems back office made us stay after
CA tightened restrictions several counties (including ours) deemed us essential. demanded people come back kids health issues damned. I‚Äôve back since June. office covid cases concerned met exasperation. genuinely concerned mind set continue things get bad again. would wager everything trading halted again. truly unprecedented panic happen He's wrong, though. safe sardine wheels full statistically vulnerable people church issues following protocols. good thing women getting abortions right? 

This little sympathy countries find situations. elect governments spoon feed bigotry crave much (i.e. voting anti-gay anti-abortion government), cry fail important. 

Good luck. New York outbreak 7x young stroke patients normally. Sometimes stroke symptom. IIRC I've seen anecdotes strokes happening also post-covid-19. bought aspirin case things start escalating actually literally say this. article links another article two weeks ago, direct quote is: ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going profound degree herd immunity considerable period time, maybe toward end 2021, 2022. feel strongly we‚Äôre going need degree public-health measures continue. Maybe stringent right now.‚Äù actually say going need masks social distancing 2021‚Äì ‚Äúsome degree public health measures‚Äù, mean MANY DIFFERENT THINGS. really need read lines verify sources. many examples, included, media twisting fauci‚Äôs words around sound alarmist actually Right. trials indian started month later.  realize trials started different times different parts world right? Aaaah god. True. [The Chinese, Koreans Japanese partying waaaaaaaay Americans I'm imagining famous SUPER NINTENDOOOOOO video, except kid unwraps syringe stabs excitedly.  see France know Italy next. numbers days behind yours. 
Be strong stay safe. Funny us people want consider essential ones making shit pay. extend hours concentrate people less? Reddit phds told deaths down, could happened?  Come on. Special needs students students school *first*.

It's almost like we've completely forgotten special needs people course pandemic. lot incapable learning outside school building, lacking access IEP accommodations. See constantly brought like guarantee; wasn‚Äôt. possibility trials problems- ended problem low transmission rates Yup, live college town, every time there‚Äôs picture local subreddit college party, people make comments kids ‚Äúgoing die‚Äù.

Like get kids shouldn‚Äôt party protect vulnerable community members, college kids got flu-like symptoms.

When exaggerate like that, nobody going take seriously. college town, city spiking cases. might read headlines Iowa State Univ. students partied wildly August. bars restaurants fully open. Hospitals clinics open since June. believe county must done good job protecting vulnerable ones, since numbers deaths increased little past several months. One thing want point though people wear masks stores. Australia mate. 700 daily weeks ago zero yesterday population 1.3 Billion, *zero* realistic scenario China 91k cases - number I'm finding. delusional believe that. world reason believe anything say? Go ahead, try tell great Chinese government is. like West foundering. 

We're pretty well Canada, actually, thanks. who's 1st generation? 4 western ones operation warp speed + russia china? current phase 1/2 trial vaccines promising? AMEN would wealthy Americans purposely tank stock holdings?

There's evidence GOP wants economy suffer Democratic administration, come on. many part MLM, Q Anon, got lower C high school science? international travellers forced hotel quarantine? always risk course doubt Australia ever end position Canada in.

PS live state hasn‚Äôt second lockdown. Victoria. Oh, Merkel could also ask Putin send help well! show European solidarity times crisis, regardless political orientation. iconic gesture goodwill Germany Russia coming together decide helping part Poland! There's things would go long way people struggling play safe understand doing. 

**One** - Get information real, direct sources. Listen podcasts people like Dr. Osterholm actual epidemiologists working ground experts pandemics. messaging point since January never felt like confused.


**Two** - information hand, relatively easy make decisions without comparing CNN Fox, Yahoo MSNBC, etc. Masks important partial protection. Distancing important. Flattening curve great continual process reach point vaccines help slow spread. yes, held virus back bit March April experts warning us since beginning going require vigilance 2021.


**Three** - Compassion Accountability - yes, means degree compassion people confused frustrated. one hand, right, messaging very, poor, especially US especially White House CDC. time, people need begin holding higher standard personal responsibility. CDC flub new information changed recommendation mean say ""screw it, I'm confused!"" throw caution wind. personally probably that, know lot people life used poor messaging get jail free card. 

Sorry, thoughts pack work... beggining?

Politicians still explicitly admit imposing certain measures solely symbolism ""sending message"". nobody sees wrong Hence said every single day. Also, 401k plan enrolled mutual funds/ETFs invested in? What??

I would absolutely love go 100 person keg ripper right now. sure miss that, huge partier. would LOVE go concert too. 

I eat shit missing normal life??? Gtfo. think we‚Äôre going mid January Holidays gathering take place Educate address concerns directly. 

You can't shame things away. 

Most conspiracies loosely based facts. problem arises tell completly wrong... know aren't.  

Instead show right.. explain much reach draw large assumptions around it. Rational people get it, irrational people never get it... nothing lose everything gain. going back school now, country. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs worse. 

COVID-19 worse age 60 older.

If age 60 identical infection mortality rate flu used find weird saw asians wearing masks time. (before COVID). find weird see someone wearing mask.. agree someone owns couple stocks Market still year. honestly healthy pullback overpriced stocks moreso market downturn. agree point let's really, really drop borderline racist ""Asians morally superior"" thing.

That almost countries extremely authoritarian societies, some, Singapore China, full blown dictatorships. racism sexism rampant point even notice issue. suicides common. young people hide basements shamed family. people countries simply give finding partner. 

It cute complaining ""lack solidarity west"" know societies K-pop video. western kids glorifying hellhole societies last minute extremely competitive unforgiving places. Lubbock closer Ah yes, counter pandemic limiting hours people number people going across fewer hours. Making stores packed totally help totally waste time. government learned nothing. stockpiled PPE threw right COVID hit expired. T

lol Poland mate :D masks sold bought covid hit even though jack shit probably feel like whole world point diarrhea/vomiting start saying ""if ends soon literally go church, donate charity, clothe homeless never curse again"" 100%. Gone matter takes over. think population gets larger (well may change soon) seeing large increase (or vocal -thanks social media) really really really stupid people. scared. Either way, stupid panicked people going death rest us. feel like car witnessing bunch idiots back seat trying ""take wheel"" none fuckers actually drive - willfully ignorant driving. are. car accident part something real problem poland Still first wave shows existing policies, actions, attitudes, etc. ineffective handling virus. 

Yes, powerful American empire unstoppable thought. time act licking wounds. difficulty probably getting people take it.

Vaccination clinics extremely high throughput (4000 doses per day per site, 8 station site 18,000 Walgreens CVS US, well 6,000 hospitals. comes to, average, 360 pharmacies 120 hospitals per state. 480 locations state set 8 station clinics, could vaccinate almost two million people *every day*. average state, population 7 million people, could vaccinate everyone 4 days. (They would also need 4 days next month 2 dose vaccine).

Now, sure want quibble numbers: feel free! come almost factor 10 get average state could give single dose everyone even one month!

Covid already cost US trillions dollars, correctly pouring almost limitless resources making vaccine available widely rapidly possible, doubt numbers end factor 5. terrible advice.

You even give expiration, ticker, strike buying puts? ""hurrr buy risky derivative think market go unspecified amount time."" Thank bringing up. Pediatric approval take longer. 

Additionally, people realize Pfizer vaccine, one frontrunners, stored -94 F? going vaccine run local Walgreens get. 

Per Fauci, frontrunner vaccines provide immunization. reduce symptoms.

The virus endemic. ""go away"" never ""over"", read sub endlessly. what's plan? They‚Äôve discouraging testing lately asymptomatic people (even you‚Äôve contact someone tested positive) probably plays role. Also gotten almost impossible get tested don‚Äôt prescription. 
My guess govt decided starting get costly decided symptomatic cases tested. Yeah better percentage teachers die.  tragedy taxpayer foot bill intensive care  915! Represent! simple rule thumb 1‚Ç¨ equals 1z≈Ç value. would say 1‚Ç¨ roughly 1,3 US$ (since lot stuff cheaper US)  *hugs Poland* Australia right thing. either crush virus early cheaply (New Zealand, Vietnam, South Korea), starve expensively (China, Australia) total quarantine, crushes exponential growth costliest far. sadly takes 10% minority fuck image health situation america.

we cna give thots prayers.  100 years now, last remaining museum, exhibit 'modern' fashion 2020.

They'll also honoring 'Karen' 'Kevin', celebrities rage time, given often mentioned historic archives. made previous record? /s true leader. kiss bats, we're it

&amp;#x200B;

(Just gonna include /s here, cover potential upset) actually rather liberal. Miami one country's hotspots, take possible measures. Avoid going crowded areas try use masks whenever possible. bars restaurants open social distancing measures. Fuck off. Reply articles sent stop delusional ramblings. watched Emily Paris?! biggest concern many medical insurance prioritized without? That‚Äôs question haven‚Äôt seen answered across board US. üçä man 200% spot  caveat probably testing little population first months france anything like Uk period struggling test 10-20k day. we‚Äôre 350k+ daily.  case numbers much higher April death numbers much lower? Man china 10 years ago cameras absolutely everywhere. park, big natural reserves etc. walked path ment tourists camped guards come find five minutes in. Hard believe ain't watching borders vast amount resources. +1 correlation =/= causation, time series comparison constitute causation.

One thing note US look areas majority person versus remote, see different per capita rates confirmed covid infections. Keep mind things statement:

1. Areas likely send kids back person may likely lax requirements covid overall. also various mitigating efforts place schools would decrease likelihood transmission general, data surprisingly difficult find. 

2. students going back school person, freedom movement parents students school hours, like return working person. 

3. kids school, tests done. likely increase per capita case rate lower testing positivity rate. Looking hospitalization rates (assuming they're capacity local hospitals) would possibly cleaner proxy absolute increase community spread. 

What would interesting would convergant cross mapping analysis percent students returning school person map hospitalization rates determine causal relationship exist so, degree. 

So say, agree children school necessarily cause increase cases (at least casual relationship that's proven now). However, potentially insightful data regarding broader response areas covid impacts case rates, hospitalization, death rates. Went Fred Meyer Boise today busy busiest holiday weekends I've ever seen. 6 feet, one way aisle traffic, people wearing masks wrong. Noped tf outta even got anything. gonna tough winter lot families here. Lol, username plus comment gave giggle. Thank you.  Avengers? Ten times many deaths could alright definition. kind lock need USA.


Here infuriating see govt. nothing it. Ok blame conservative administrations? know, reason surges presidents governments I'm curious gene duplication anesthetic resistance? quarantine start day arrive country?  American working tech startup Paris here. What's really funny watching European American techies poor social skills trying establish boundaries personal space. Europeans keep walking towards Americans, keep walking backwards get away. hilarious little dance. Fuck facial surgery coming up. 42k. lot done. craino plasty, rhino, genoplasty, neck lipo, cheek implants, hair trans plant. trying get lips too. Whoa! That's *impressive*. competent govt put citizens lockdown induced depression, follows dictatorial program preventing people leave previously done North Korea 30s Germany locked down. Funny works.

It's almost like CCP used sophisticated information warfare weaponize virtue signaling West create endless cycle lockdowns. it‚Äôs gonna long ass winter What‚Äôs point questioning evidence knows ace cognitive skills test already? Thing college students already corona virus time get back home wont corona virus positive. get tested get sent home. Etc. . .its black white Well sucks Northern Hemisphere, what's got us?  might replying bot. account seems regurgitating words logical relation posts replies to. 12103 cases mean? seen embrasse since March, Neuilly (a suburb Paris).

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* much would love vaccine. Im worried there‚Äôs many manufacturers world maybe different vials knows best worse one made. 
Or recall certain manufacturers time military going distribute it. U.S. military greatest organization world comes logistics. maybe also worth noting plenty countries done worse America terms cases per capita?

Or talking US reason cousin's helicopter bill $20,000. could conceivably buy new car drive hospital. Depending work may still working positive asymptomstic. major hospital system entire time made staff positive continue work asymptomatic. I've heard case elsewhere well. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è old man turned 98, got COVID-19 died next day Yes, generally must wear even keep distance people. example park city there's people entire park, must still wear it, even keep distance.

There exceptions like outdoor sport wilderness (outside city).

(It's bit weird law national county level, counties similar laws small differences details. example one Madrid: page 15, section 2.c.) must missed part totally competent mentally sound leaders got us first wave.  Waste comment. That‚Äôs upvote button moms mad found watching re-runs TV summer. still thinks it‚Äôs hoax hasn‚Äôt gotten yet. Even though getting likely mean also gave grandmother too. *cries American * I'm sorry hear feel pain. seen mom since last January hurts. sisters brother. Granted get together *that* much pre-covid would see could going long really makes realize much need life, even reconnect every month so. Yeah weird people draw line supporting people. Like, Corona misinformation line, he's already white nationalists show? He's Ben Shapiro show three times spew shit people surprised this? Wild me. think largely depends person evaluates infected potentially infecting someone else.

If person sees risk anxious (reasonably not), reproducible consistent process make feel better constant nagging uncertainty ""enough"" one-connection removed believe enough (or can't trusted enough), person next infected. consistent reproducible process makes decisions easier, especially relative incidental risk unknown/unknowable.

If already done major things, made work adjustments, set family expectations, bought delivery service membership... also minor things may seem silly ignore, especially high risk group.

A lot people stuck around people enough, take significant steps supported family, community, employer mutual risk-avoidance behavior.

If want stay not-infected group, likely going take effort time. ready January. Others giving exact moment needed most. slipped small things slippage creeping major things.

A lot people going infected that, point view, take ""reasonable precautions."" Another observer may agree them, quickly point errors, inconsistencies, lapses judgement challenge self-assessment--and risks introduced people. dumb idiots think comment worth award. daily, stayed answered every question (or noted answered next day)... often televised, same. Well, probably day probably went away parents separated kids, kids sent camps isolated, people got bolted homes...

&amp;#x200B;

I mean hotel isolating people literally collapsed people scared speak out. yet. 800 million people live southern hemisphere. population world 8 billion. means 10 percent globe gone winter, unless talking much surface area globe gone winter, see would apply pandemic.  Please explain denied nutrition Interesting, number (known) active cases Boston area still trending JFC. Willing bet high-risk population herself, too. Yea c diff almost killed me. 23. Im young, healthy, workout, would considered optimal category yet literally hospitalized 4 days almost went shock. Im actually project medical sciences class.mortality c.diff cases rise. get see death rate without treatment, yay herd immunity stupidity approach! /s certain point, even lockdowns work except temporary crutch

In theory, literally everyone stays home 14 days, virus would gone.  Ant Man trying find way go inside anus covid cell expand explode it. He's really got one idea ever ... He'll talk best best go there. No, ""decades behind science."" US FDA AABB regularly review deferrals make sure date. Furthermore, matter tests detect diseases earlier, basis long deferral be. That's goal blood bank produce clean blood products, diagnose diseases donors.

They want much possible collect blood transmissible disease. that? tainted donations increase blood banking costs correctly test positive, endanger patients falsely test negative. best way avoid situations block high-risk donors donating. God funny seeing snowflakes like get triggered. Perhaps 1 5 responsible 80 percent cases say.

It's already known ""superspreaders"" responsible majority cases. saying go? Something like ""fuck around find out"" ICU bed usage seems normal. Anyone 2019 data comparison? cytochrome (P450 2D6). Strictly speaking, pharmacogenomic testing it, diagnosis made based suspicion anesthesiologist.

From young age, realized can't go numb dentist. (I upper wisdom teeth nothing.) Opiates also really reduced efficacy me. Dilaudid one worked. Propofol put wake 1/3 expected time.

I collagen type defect and, reasons unknown, anesthetic resistance associated specific defect. I'm also little bit redheaded (my hair kind red/ blonde son's totally red red genes there); I've read redheadedness sometimes also associated reduced utility anesthetics. Remember: Australia coming Spring heading Summer. opposite countries northern hemisphere (USA/UK/Etc) heading Winter. virus supposed much worse winter. see waves US better looking states - huge country terms population area. hit hard NY/NJ beginning, weren‚Äôt many cases south; opposite true summer. cases starting rise NY/NJ despite low whole summer. Well fair, needed ambulance USD CAD par (better part decade ago). might bit expensive now. France mask mandate? that's happening would anyone see that. Hospitals predicted overflow two weeks, never actually do

The field hospitals built never got used despite overflow predictions. Similarly concerns overflows FL/AZ, actually never happened.

The time happened maybe back April NY good treatment.  See that's cases numbers high France. government thinks like do, individual problem, respect rules fine, spreading virus, must punish ones do.

But work like real life. Pandemic control collective problem individual one. follow rules still get infected, there's little point going harshly people. long restaurants, schools workplaces open, spread. Mask wearing reduces eliminate it. point shooting leg poorly wear masks. Let try spin necessary, inevitable, outside control. remember always preventable. fear something similar Germany masks Mars? Amen, everyone thinks we‚Äôre fucking retarded yet country‚Äôs like Italy identical percentage rates infection death  It‚Äôs like nascar race. Constantly rounding next turn, forever going circles getting nowhere. Nope. enough customers.  Basically Meadows said. there's nothing need do. anything becomes plan. Couldn‚Äôt said basically every single young healthy person whose significant Covid? They‚Äôd basically exposed high viral loads. doesn‚Äôt really make sense entire families get zero mild symptoms. 

I think doctor thing maybe extremely overworked exhausted couldn‚Äôt fight well Even Cap said that? MAYBE people wore glasses smart get virus. social distance, introvert, wearing mask, etc. Lockdown fun, absolutely loathe I'm really looking forward seeing people seen months...

...but like something recognize done right call make.

Some people seem understand duality loathing something completely yet fully supporting there's question least worst option available. lot France pretty bloody cold winter. 112:40 light-hearted response Halloween

It interesting seeing disconnect world different approaches taken leaders. Dan detractors, even Murdoch media attacking him, held strong stayed course.

Consistent clear messaging definitely helps too.

I remember seeing Trump say disappear April. response criminal lot culture gets exported world. think frustrating thing weighed world down. Virus evolution make finding vaccine difficult. 

If can, watch press conferences. know, man. Czech Republic masks mandatory everywhere still spreads way faster US! Maybe people chose ignore mask mandate lockdown? know. March like ‚Äúima buy plane ticket Paris birthday end year since they‚Äôre cheap I‚Äôm sure then.‚Äù

I got way ‚Äúconfirm purchase‚Äù screen backed out. Lucky me, foresight 20/20 really understand anti-mask crowd.

The reason climate change denial thing. Right-wing think tanks invest immense amounts money disinformation campaigns. buy journalists, college professors, wannabe experts, YouTubers, etc.

It's marketing. Marketing works. Anecdotal UT hospitalization astronomically worse time. Nurses news crying hospitals full sign slowing. Shit got real.   Trump Campaign Nevada GOP sued Clark County (the largest one) stop counting votes early: fact time! 2016, people voted Clark County every County Nevada combined Clinton barely carried state primarily due Clark County; Counties Nevada something like average ~75% votes cast Trump.

He first Republican win election *without* Nevada since Taft 1908, first time since 1976 state ended voting loser presidential race.

(I curious GOP would keen ratfuck particular county, look notable it) ugh everyone else feel like overfed selfish piece shit reading that? good god fucking mess. first case noted 2019? already year? 

In US. 1st case February. 1st case China definite. Depends data source. think December maybe earliest that's discussed. even year assuming Dec 1st. start counting mail-in ballots midnight start Election Day, must wait till polls officially close end day? Yeah. Nah. numbers definitely result smart leaders dealing well. 

How figure that? Serious question. exactly would national mask mandate accomplish already accomplished every corporation, store, restaurant, city town already mask mandate?

Please specific right mask mandate already exists almost anywhere indoors, think compliance increase want federal agents start using mandate fine people color poor communities disproportionately wearing masks what? nope app made normal people dont waste time speaking w/ disingenuous people like yourself...its waste time everyone involved... Funny, aware second wave ended...

How about: COVID-19 March still going away. end. wish able give blood :( Hello downvotes!!!! 

I actually awe people think ""Victoria way"" stoping covid way.

Imagine every single country that, virus would least problems. Oh no, won‚Äôt able drink night... lockdown... please stop calling useless curfews lockdowns... people trigger word. reality measures aren‚Äôt strict many places enjoy title. time thought San Antonio part Texas... Macron fired, president power many cases. /s Australian influence? Obviously France, turn phrase seems Australian.... Video appears show team losing game


How write headlines sir, saying number deaths cannot controlled government, spreading virus be. Whether like not, large population Americans obese, old likely die. cant really hold government responsible that. means nordics comparable countries world understand impact different coronavirus strategies. know haven‚Äôt even read sentence properly, let alone opened article ahead read it. Even shouldn‚Äôt hard understand. wonder correlates type work often done age group? Victoria fear disappointment; definitely estimated still unknown cases assumed cases, outbreaks, big, way perhaps forever. think government wanted eliminate ideally, knew long enough happen, hence explicit goal zero community transmission, ie contact tracing maintain control outbreaks. Jesus christ, someone UK lot sympathy you. Cannot believe Macron even supporting remote work. Even Boris reverted back that. tell man. year nowI‚Äôm going back college mountains.I want hike get shitty degree smoke weed wirh friends. don‚Äôt care take loanscause it‚Äôs expensive. I‚Äômg king back skhcool. research says. says people low self-control and/or high faith trump likely say they'll disregard social distancing. mean trump making people act way. likely people already selfish idiots likely also like trump. study also cover people actually acted claimed *would* act meaning possible people blowhards like act ""tough"" likely support trump thing. cases trump cause problem, favorite people problem. Wait! USA still ob 1st wave? Surprisingly really almost major countries. Sorted cases per million population would 12th behind:

Tuesday often highest Netherlands. take 2 - 3 days information available. France reported cases India today felt much safer San Francisco stopping gas Winnemucca NV. We‚Äôre talking lot here, trust me. Yeah fourth wave Spanish flu deadly, look forward to. 

Eventually everyone would lost someone close takes beat virus. switched anything. estimated still couple dozen unknown cases based transmission dynamics, inevitably spread disease. government clearly stated today ""we eliminated it, fact life least vaccine comes"" spinning slogans, reality. import cases daily failed states like USA - developed mechanism seems working. getting hopeful maintain low level spread u til vaccines protect us better. I‚Äôm American living Canada (and still care happens US), there‚Äôs election coming. Looks like you‚Äôre ignoring several deaths likely caused COVID weren‚Äôt counted coronavirus one reason another. top head remember estimated 40,000-50,000 top what‚Äôs currently reported don‚Äôt remember exactly Ah yes, ‚Äúgo ahead get chicken pox get way‚Äù strategy. questionnaire decades behind science.

Faded fast true. high proportion Sweden‚Äôs deaths care homes, ‚Äòmost‚Äô. It‚Äôs somewhere around 40%. 

Even then, Sweden‚Äôs death rate per capita nearly 5x Denmark - second worst hit Scandinavian country. Even Sweden nobody die care home, death rate would still way double nearby countries. Ok somebody restart simulation donated couple weeks ago. American Red Cross testing covid antibodies. also notify results via app. minister Justice part Public Health Authority (FHM) making strategy. Almost everyone Canada lives near border.  Northern IL people carry on, even road's covered layer snowpack months. said, lots elderly hunker much winter. avoid ice like plague fall hazards. older also makes harder keep warm, they're less likely venture general. 


On foot, outside one remaining respite COVID restrictions. Cub Scout pack meeting outdoors, example. Restaurants utilizing outdoor dining reduce major risks indoor dining would pose. 


We Scout meeting outside 35F, dark 6PM... Another month it'll high 10-20F dark 4PM. Everyone's going whatever hell usual activities indoors rather out... bode well all. That's $35 Maple money. even less USD. Ex-SO nearly hypothermic race event. spent one hour inside ambulance go anywhere get warm. got billed $850. Honestly I'm point wanna hit somebody wearing mask.

(I might little angry country.) TrUmP sAiD GuYs RuInInG EcOnOmY‚Ñ¢ Oh god dammit fucking forgot one died Obama's term. GOP power-grabby? Like know I'm biased, feel like Democrats never done kind thing. Right, pushed via ""Operation Warp Speed"". fact pass multiple countries landing world's leading scientific nation even damning indictment America's apathetic bungling. 

A wise man learns mistakes. wiser man learns mistakes others. there's Fat Donnie Dullard, says mistakes Fake News nasty suggest otherwise. article quantify effective vaccine saying ‚Äòrobust‚Äô pedantic, Xinjiang labeled ethnic autonomous region, rather province. Interesting headline incorrect yet text article correctly calls 'region'. unfortunately, I‚Äôm sharing hate seeing websites charge $60+ thing. lot people thank posting it, also I‚Äôve posted twice time different community. found month old article city 100 miles away. sure proved point. layman's terms, means works, right? fight Covid? So, we're waiting see safe point? Yes. FDA said publicly going rush approval. vaccine already well tested proven safe, question here. might kidding. actually happen every flu season.

However, tends January/February... already University students general care, take masks minute aren‚Äôt required wear them. aren‚Äôt it‚Äôs also social annoying youth this. might even 50/50 kids careful invisible they‚Äôre home. why? let get bad? guys see real tragedy , horror COVID is.. please safe smart I'm paying extra $360/year low deductible plan work. Europeans made pretended like perfectly handled virus defeated compiled directions shitting America ones people disobeying mandates

Don‚Äôt try pull victim card Europe called shit sad 10 months Wuhan scenes, repeated. waste. also, people central valley forced work. never stopped working ever since pandemic began. they're still working cases rising. 

they need raise. anyone wonders, SOR = [Szpitalny oddzia≈Ç = ""Hospital Emergency Department"". First time wrote out, correctly translated, used abbreviation, translator unable translate. proof anywhere? Besides assume? Every year see scenes like flu season, big deal all. Even you‚Äôre rich need pretty book smart get Harvard yeah, kids dumb fuck. Lots scenes like Peru Bolivia summer (their winter) too. 

I wonder could predicted could ever possibly happen Poland gets cold schools everything else reopened... noticed home depot. I've work house prepare sell spent least $1k past month supplies. switched Lowe's home depot trip employees better wearing masks properly. perfect course, way better home depot. (Philadelphia suburbs) Yup. They're showing us exactly useless really are. Locking minorities teens smoking weed they're good for.

But solving actual crimes protecting people bad actors? They're cut kind work.  Yeah like unemployment rates still sky rocketing, homelessness time high 50% children getting education. Pretty small town. closed schools say anything workplaces. cannot see happening bigger cities like Munich/Cologne etc. think going close schools workplaces matter happens. lockdown March happen again, even locally. I‚Äôm sick articles Eh, say 1st world country. kind subterfuge (including U.S. right leadership).  Weaponizing pandemic product despotic leadership. Right?? fucking kills daughter sees kids outside playing end street (all kids coming houses multiple Trump signs front) begs go play say no.

Fuck people. Fuck caring anything else themselves. sucks hard people like them. wondering also. Sounds like you‚Äôll need booster.

Why think that? I'm suggesting we'll decades immunity, Covid gone within months first vaccine (in case definitely need booster) - vaccinations need annual, less frequent, see major concern. 

Yes, antibodies tend decline, particularly minor infections - part immune response vaccines designed trigger strong response, often stronger actual pathogen. yet still trying find 1, 17 years later, luck. It'll strain Sars. Might case company billing airlift charging knows insurance companies pay Destroy pangolins? /s Disagree, Victoria implementing controls tougher Europe continuing surge. Took drastic lockdown contain.

Had Victoria done Europe did, they'd look like France right now. Europe done Victoria did, they'd zero cases too. Im sure mean Climate change climate, weather. Hospitalizations higher across country ‚Äúfirst wave,‚Äù largely largest city centers. retarded Sorry types posts allowed  Agreed that's said may, also positive studies use self selected data. measuring Tcell Bcell vaccines. better others, recall Pfiser better AZ estimates long term protection. CIA planted agents posing vaccination workers search Osama bin 2-3 weeks expectation General public? Mid-2021 Africa also young population. I'm saying Trump pushes one ready cutting red tape I'm going nervous getting it.

Is crazy? Yes. Utah released plans rationing care. Total horror show 100% avoidable. Looking 2018 Bolton Trump fires pandemic response team scientists departure point, January lied downplayed severity contagiousness Americans. Press conferences 100 consecutive days. conservatives/""Liberal"" party ex-speaker ridiculed it, saying show, one many clips amazingly. balls stand strong front much right wing vitriolic nondemocratic press position.

To put 100+ days press conference context - Fauci says US taskforce convenes [once per Trump attended months. Figures. here's Dan taking questions... oxford start use europe? might ask Lol germany calculated take 5 years vaccinate every citizen country Gov Cuomo saying along, NYC getting Europe. Europe got subject EU needs investigate. estimated timeline long company submits EUA (FDA, NHS) approve? I‚Äôm curious FDA publicly discussed Oct 22nd meeting. really. I'm sure dumb rich kids majority talented smart people. think problem may state students come places either wearing mask normal, corona virus cases low. Cases Cambridge low right maybe that's think okay. even though cases low, everyone still required wear mask wearing mask taboo Greater Boston area wearing mask taboo. really get city area see anti-maskers. lived US much? hellhole anyway. made public don‚Äôt exist. learn formulate long elaborate arguments Harvard?  stock company something? keep trying post everywhere keeps disappearing... Well reality 6% 13,380 true COVID deaths. 94% average 2.6 comorbidites. puts rate death say .15% US .13% globally. 

Only slightly higher seasonal flu. Damn... Dude fuck? That's one every 500 person tested positive week end, rythm might need vaccine... China's government kind power enforce quarantines. 

A lot governments don't, citizens willfully give power. Differing schools thought limited data. vaccine ideally would prevent future infection. However, I‚Äôd immunity short lived hope would make symptoms less severe training immune system fight virus. Strict lockdowns work get control. people right thing keep control. Europe got almost control borders nations closed. opened borders bam! spread went positive again. national guard construction workers. know first thing competently building structural building.  ""Can't true. worse flu, statistically."" said Biden wins go away November 4th so... Whoever vote go away sure. offering explanation seems lot people pandemic denial (or we, all?) grocery shopping person. we're back work We‚Äôve reopened since April-May, hoss. ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù didn‚Äôt create blood shortages. **pandemic** contributed them. thing knowing long things last is.... wait see long last.

However:

1. Vaccines designed elicit strong lasting immune response ‚Äî effectively vaccine looks threatening actually harmless ""frightens"" immune system super-primed;
2. Antibodies mechanism body - immune (memory) cells tell body something threat produce antibodies quickly, response also triggered vaccine. general, body produce antibodies permanently - body identify threat react accordingly, need order inhibit infection transmission (even people re-infected still transmit disease, sooner recover, less chance actually happening).

It's possible annual vaccinations necessary, even are, that's much less impactful measures take achieve effect. No, you.  honestly believe never, ever end? Things get better. Don‚Äôt let pessimism blind you. guys seen crowds pushing together wearing masks? That‚Äôs spreads.
Remember China beat still testing? See they‚Äôre using faulty tests sent rest world? Party priorities damned. accept ever, especially now. Remember, public servants. 2020 nicest, best weather may ever see again. cool Summer Eastern US. Probably last. Yes taking risk (backed govt money) producing doses spec approved way cut lot time approval distribution. Valid concern. However, take BGSU example. mandatory random testing students past two weeks, one positive case 301 random tests.

Everyone screaming schools would opening 2-3 weeks, colleges would shut down, etc. happened. pretty obvious point schools driving surge. wait people get back town vacations they‚Äôre right Yeah. park sits 40 thousand, that‚Äôs basically empty Ok that‚Äôs huge relief. assumed partisanship he‚Äôs hole money wise ads. market last Friday least 5 employees noses hanging believe half second number China reporting COVID cases, bridge sell you. bridge ain't nothing compared one I've got believing China anything help climate change. plant trees want, newly grown trees go far. comparison massive, *massive* emissions put daily basis, glass ceiling we've broken climate change, new trees ain't gonna shit.

(The emissions China puts out, whole world responsible virtually manufacturing there, that's beside point.)

And global leader anyway currently (unless meant terms combating climate change) comforting thought least. It‚Äôs extremely regional. mask order state virtually everyone wears them. However across border next state order hardly anyone wears them. goes hometown. city-wide order they‚Äôre everywhere. drive 10 minutes sister city, isn‚Äôt one sight. It‚Äôs regional culturally (urban vs. rural), also based government orders. French schools 2 week vacation right now. Many town. seriously think cases jump even higher this. work 2 primary school France- children wear masks teachers don‚Äôt force area It‚Äôs perfectly reasonable optimistic realistic. Yes, covid serious airborne illness face difficult time ahead. No, going live like 2025. 

Downplaying threat covid, doomsday ‚Äúwe never get back normal‚Äù extremes damaging. Oh shut fuck already, think like fucking reason kid can't go play friends, can't get together wear masks couple fucking months fucking done this. didn‚Äôt know could go jail paying private insurance. Rather take chances virus vaccine rushed lile this. Anti vaxxers gonna fucking love vaccine like blows faces. Every article COVID-19 evidence it‚Äôs spread surfaces that‚Äôs disease I‚Äôm talking about. course 100% true diseases prevented clean water. I‚Äôm currently research developing antibiotics typhoid bacteria, believe know disease transmitted. I‚Äôm definitely arguing clean water isn‚Äôt necessary. 

It‚Äôs needing clean counter credit card machine stores every customer bothers worry little bit impact immune systems need exposure pathogens develop.

You‚Äôre really interpreting comments different way intended I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm clear. meant total average daily cases reported, 17 440 cases. Sept , ... Oct .... Nov... Dec.... Jan ..... 

Feb... 

What makes think average people get vaccines first. 

If anything doctors nurses would get first , older population whoever. 

Don't expect vaccine June 2021. ( part opinion ). think wearing mask worse 250k+ dead Americans due negligence **not** wearing masks social distancing? stupid delusional. eyes, another 250k+ big deal, wearing mask bigger. fucking joke. Grow up. They're talking places like Walmart Target sell groceries clothing (and lots stuff). already still duties citizen

Hmm First people receive it? Everyone who‚Äôs wearing masks public front line! isn‚Äôt effective way it, ironically. Female Trump I've already showed evidence. Mortality higher usual. That's end it.
I give damn coronalympics. Tried we? People literally fighting ""right"" wear one. complex sub really seem getting it.

People fully aware things complex. act like straight people can't get hiv pass blood bank number 2 there. Oh well. wont fight wanting blood. Enjoy shortage! can‚Äôt wait sit inside local coffee shop fancy latte read book fireplace again. Also can‚Äôt wait live music. Currently Wisconsin, Dane County basically given contact tracing time being, simply resources complete work many positive cases lately.

It's going back expecting exposed public.  Nobody earth thinks need plan eradicate covid. really reasonably sound argument (except true time) Netherlands today reported 10,343 cases, equivalent 200,000 US cases, second day row 100% throwing away vote. snow ground avalanche. Last heard, said September, became October, saying December. course is. making point. probably seriously blame supermarket either. wanted say ""clothes essential"" get media pick up. Wait thought rounded corner Idk entertainment companies pretty well right now. see reason they‚Äôd want end Polio took years get rid US mass vaccinations started. really reasonably sound argument here. Irrelevant. goal blood bank create safe blood products patients, diagnose diseases donors. Using blood donations means get free HIV screening 1) greatly increase operational costs blood bank due high number donations throw away test positive, 2) endanger patients because, inevitably, infected blood falsely test negative. missing point. highly doubt man access underpants day. He's attention / protest. It‚Äôs nuts putting much effort trolling. also factor seem considered -- efficient transmission due cold weather cause lot spread, also severe cases average. title daily new coronavirus cases U.S. hit all-time high, expert warns ‚Äòexponential spread‚Äô Unfortunately IL's outrageous tax rates people choice this. coming back anything state. become poor that's stay forever, IL crushing. 

It's shitty situation stuck mismanagement decades led this. places followed guidelines start genuinely can't. 

This situation people even nationwide plan policy. Look excess deaths 2020 instead. 225k bullshit undercount. Goddamn it, America.  opposite lockdown nothing virus, people keep pretending like options? Thank service. brave 6 straight weeks feel like could go longer. Even shops essential still opened. Dunnes Stores still selling clothes all. OP's article clear even cases discussed China Europe study revealed genetic codes virus New York closely matched strains Europe U.S. states rather China, virus originated. I‚Äôm sorry wrong, women cross border deliver babies citizenship, sorry burst bubble best hospitals Mexico (√Ångeles, Star Medica, CME) equal hospitals USA. Source: doctor Mexico There‚Äôs much people able sacrifice. solution cannot worst problem itself. ‚ÄúSMASH like button!‚Äù Lol said going give champ. already covid still duties citizen pandemic got authority say something like admins trumpsters, keep removing legitimate articles might hurt Trump's image.... yet see tons posts unverified sources propaganda alt-right blogs. CNBC low-quality, seems like something demographic would assume. üòÇ Yep. Even Tennessee. numbers won‚Äôt drop without intervention. Whoa, someone high project said early year would likely know September viable vaccine candidate. little off, still impressive.
Hell , even half year would impressive vaccine development.  lol. almost entire year see companies grudgingly remote work small percentage. 

It back office, jab not. zero faith people wasn‚Äôt aware trmp charge response Europe honestly very, difficult sole voice sanity. Humans social creatures, mention, shyer, agreeable, introverted, amount flak take speaking unbearable.

And necessarily help proven right, either.

All say keep keepin' on, make right decisions family. We're kind suffering lack normal life right now, alone, that's consolation. saying care anyone yourself. see lot lately.

Edit: Nice downvote even 10 seconds later. Wow. CNBC related nations response. political. admin trumpster? willing give suggest speak society. willing give up, now. wait? population isn‚Äôt large, country tiny densely populated. whole country 16.000 mi2 17 million people it. comparison, half South Carolina, people South Carolina Georgia combined. Almost 92% live urban areas. Population density one highest world. Combined culture civil disobedience it‚Äôs recipe disaster. fully expect go back lockdown eventually. 3-6 months. We've really delayed run first wave, whole planet goes second far worse one. 
It seems like naturally happen long enough time line, unless get lucky. 


The past weeks essentially fighting couple tiny outbreaks - took *weeks*.  


Ha, government tried launch app died almost immediately actually work apparently. shame cause mind idea theory. banned moved alternate accounts. banned again. kinda fun watch Maybe, that‚Äôs are. Humans far perfect - expecting people keep year always idealistic. ‚ÄòFollowing science‚Äô doesn‚Äôt account humans behave. liar. ""If happy negative test results sure like subscribe."" Right one staying home, voting going vote. voted first day early voting lot people city - broke early voting records. would hope majority people going already, shut city I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd still voting places open. Voting socially distanced provided alcohol wipes qtip press screen with.  summer guys dont worry swear Yeah, here's link: ' easily manufactured vaccine? scalable? ' 


Reasonably, likely capacity vaccine whole world 1-2 billion doses next 6-9 months acheivable, work tandem vaccines.

 
' Tangentially, available US vaccine using same/similar technology developed US?' 


It probably later europe elsewhere FDA seems slow (took 7 weeks restart US trial compared week elsewhere) requirements europe ect. 


' Last question - instances ADE vaccine? ' 


No, vaccines decent amount research obviously want this. necessarily, keep letting guard virus return vengeance. 

Canada looked lot like Australia respatory season hit. 

All need one case go undetected outbreak, saw Kelowna summer. one person asymptomatic spread hundreds people. summer contact tracing worked contained outbreak September cases fell lockdown needed.

But Edmonton one outbreak. Caused unknown source. respatory season virus spread far wide. contact tracing collapsing they're shutting things cancelling surgeries.

Edmonton better prepared Kelowna contain outbreak. Manditory mask order, contact tracing app, free universial testing, everything people say works Alberta impelemted it. actual difference, Edmonton's outbreak happened respatory season. 

So enjoy summer mate vigilant. Soon let guard virus return. shit. I'll believe see it. That's exponential spread means: things getting much, much worse future.

Where R rate significantly 1, exponential growth already there; question many get infected numbers peak R drops 1 again. all. Get flu shot every year. Well came guy far undergrad degree easiest major get. Look case curves Utah, nd, sd, idaho. exponential curves. See Brazil, president said thing article saying (most Brazil lives dirty, strong immune system naturally). second country corona deaths world, lot excessive deaths. 

That's article bullshit real explanation is: much younger population Brazil, Brazil younger population rest Europe. That's could explain difference mortality rate Brazil India, India Europe. wondering thing, considering making world news high rapidly increasing case number. 1 ago skipped comment , sure sarcasm not. 

Am back upvote :D People keep pouring vodka gaping mouth. 

Or get vodka enema. trump took us WHOs vaccine sharing program coronavirus. Unless develop US, we're getting rest world trump wins believe pandemic fatigue; we're observing seasonality element kicking dramatically, especially Europe. Sure would be, hard believe though plan covid. Burn population fast possible. Gotta get herd mentality. ""slight"" difference.

NZ locked immediately another cluster formed, eliminated quite quickly again

Meanwhile Czech Republic hundreds deaths day now. already taking PreP going give false negative HIV. pill literally prevents getting transmitting it.That's point. I'd reccomend talking doctor LGBTQ+ health clinic information PreP.

I know many monogamous gay couples take PreP. makes chance contracting HIV statistically impossible, allowed donate blood supply dangerously low. Casual racism reddit really go hand hand Yeah I'm definitely ruling out. Considering rescheduling Christmas. Thank you. know see something study? People get aborted, fetuses get aborted.

Fetuses people yet. mean say, hope best prepare worst XD   ICU *nurse* position? ‚Äúsociologists define non-material aspects culture values beliefs, language, communication, practices shared common group people.

Craziest show I‚Äôve to. Life Agony opening Korn second act. Ozzy came mosh pit whole arena floor wimpy people like stands watching sheer chaos. broke fire hose üòÜ bit hard prove purpose alternative lockdown let virus spread like crazy

No, that's letting virus spread like crazy. alternative mitigation measure locking seen places like South Korea, Taiwan, Japan. South Korea still dealing outbreaks handles way they've last months works. Hong Kong dealing outbreaks similar fashion methods also work. course, places back ""normal"" they're immediate threat COVID West. Plus, places kept borders closed instead encouraging local tourism. China's dealing outbreak right now, rushing lockdown deal it? No. Western countries obsessed ""normalcy"", care suppressing COVID long term long-term mitigation efforts affront goal. Instead, pick short-term inefficient measures, like rolling lockdowns, endgame getting normal soon possible. Oh yeah, baby! Let rip!! summon ambulance yesterday Wroc≈Çaw since experiencing probably stroke, confirm: got admitted hospital (on bigger), spending 5 hours ambulance. spent following 12 hours triage area, occupying one two non-covid beds, covid patients rolling one another whole night. PPE missing, equipment missing, urgent care conducted. guy arrived crash leg morning trauma docs louldy considering operating hallway, right eyes (didn't come this).

That‚Äôs means. Google search ‚Äúasymptomatic spread‚Äù shows nothing articles confirming occur. 

Current death rate US 2.6%, states high 6%.

So highly contagious disease spread without even knowing 1 30 chance killing you.

Additionally, death isn‚Äôt problem. virus causes much higher hospitalization rates flu, hospitalizations longer duration. cities approaching full capacity ICU‚Äôs, increase death rate. 

I don‚Äôt care opinion is. make judgements based facts. Based facts above, still can‚Äôt bothered wear mask public, you‚Äôre shitty person deserve harsh judgement.

In end matter much though. Originally threat overwhelming hospitals. seems like hospitalizations deaths fraction cases dropped we‚Äôve gotten better testing better treating illness also reallocated resources shift hospital capacity. problematic case rate April becomes manageable case rate October. people 80 vaccinated manageable case rate change again. I‚Äôm sure nobody wants commit number criticized later number actually becomes manageable. They'll blame liberalism, homosexuality Jews. What's worse? There's thing covid. /s ‚Äúmost risk people‚Äù risk precisely weak immune systems. means vaccine isn‚Äôt going effective (if get all). There‚Äôs still going plenty danger enough population gets vaccine bring prevalence virus down. looking numbers? /s really needed?

Absolutely. people think like difficult differentiate sometimes ‚ÄúVery surprising?‚Äù Really? yep type deferred reasons. wish could help. would donated plasma President ‚Äúfake news‚Äù could easily explain REALLY happening set apart? consider countries apart knowledge mankind?

The question mask physically works. question recommending increases health population. population skilled use masks likelier benefit mask wearing population unskilled that. always considered introvert, really hate situation often treated moral fortitude test rather public health crisis Sleeping lights isn‚Äôt socially isolating months Social introverts financially privileged people controlling entire narrative exhausting People's hesitancy refusal vaccine reasons typical antivaxxor logic. 

Most people I've asked want get vaccine want wait see others respond. fault seeing potential financial political gain extraordinary, perhaps enough trump safety concerns. 

Also, millions people working throughout entire pandemic fallen ill. Asking take warp speed vaccine something affected another risk incur. someone dies home get tested affect stats either direction. would assume positive cases, still likely severe cases though, hence ones likely die. That's per capita basis would 250k US. That's mental Spring combination social ending meeting vaccines. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll lead spikes, hopefully won‚Äôt big ones expecting Yes, technically correct. Wow Italy, thought guys would success story ages. even 4 months. See comment. think true. modi government promised free vaccine citizens one state elections. free vaccine election strategy. heard Japan allowing theaters play movies full capacities...with extremely little cases. really wish masks become political symbol here, winter going awful. that's ~~the point~~ one reasons measures, nobody sure it. Despite say President minimal role ‚Äúdistributing‚Äù vaccine. Finland daily cases single digits summer. Relaxed border controls led travel led cases people brought virus home them. Maybe people would listen causes unwarrantedly smug everything Well pandemic caught up. lucked spring summer keep lockdown forever. Hopefully doctors know bit covid 6 months ago. People nowadays really warped view bad illness looks like. people ill means bed fever days, maybe throwing week. people know anyone who's died permanently disfigured made infertile polio, measles smallpox.

Even flu looked tame central heating exists really bad cases go hospital.  Exactly. weren‚Äôt *caused* lockdowns. Demand also risen. 

Just RTFA already. think really depends hotel. needed stay one months back, denied housekeeping skipped free breakfast lobby. stuck room took elevator alone.

But think room relatively safe. much different apartment, shown increased risk apartment dwellers. That‚Äôs really phase II phase III trial. That‚Äôs going Texas soon so... one world ever gets sick again...? Spring optimistic imo, think it'll closer summer/early-autumn  would nice Christmas present. serology study done Japan shows antibody rates going 5% 46% months, one highest rates world, almost deaths. story Japan much complex believing simply didn‚Äôt get Covid No, won‚Äôt clue effective Covid phase III completed. won‚Äôt really know much years we‚Äôve done *real* phase III form distributing vaccine broadly.

If anyone else could get 0, NZ would allow quarantine-free travel. waiting happen...  Context matters. **Government data showed growth 4.9% July September, slightly lower economists expected, still astonishing achievement.**

Believing anything else political theatre hyperbole. Doubtful. Community spread extremely high El Paso democratic stronghold, considerably direction than, say, New York.

 would agreed week ago, numbers europe tell different story.

We thought contained numbers spiking hard.

All examples based initial shutdown, one permeation. detailed data analysis switzerland compared european countries recommened: think kids grow perhaps ready parent. like rest young college kids eager go wild. work retail police patrol mall say nothing maskless people.

We tell every customer wear mask, someone claims ‚Äúmedical exception‚Äù don‚Äôt kick out. Corporate doesn‚Äôt want us getting shot beat crazy anti maskers.

Honestly retail workers ones enforcing it? We‚Äôre unarmed people trying sell stuff, we‚Äôre expected public health nannies, cops guns bullet proof vests say nothing. know, talking about? passive-aggressive top-level comment reply person people saw this? don‚Äôt believe order good citizens. Purely political we‚Äôre tragedy. Whatta fucking straw man, support family ""have"" work.

I made sacrifices, again, took loan 401k, *I want DIE, accidentally kill family avoidable disease*

The audicity say ""some people work"" crazy. dude *had* keep going work inevitably die? saying? Yes, average 9000 cases per day. Oncologists? think school shutdowns giving kids... cancer? Europe lost mind? care about? saying hate gross generalisation people want wear masks blame virus spreading. I've happen. trick eat meal drink glass water like hour donating. caffeine.  It‚Äôs three days still Maybe don‚Äôt give shit like rest free world Americas, btw, pants exclusively outerwear. Easy George Bush. Dont go buying mission accomplished banner yet Yes, experts say would seeing surges right didn‚Äôt take right precautions. Glad paid attention! right way go. China‚Äôs third quarter gdp growth 5.9% comparing last year. would guess cost massive testing tiny fraction growth. countries -10% growth. Maybe took 4 days report it... vaccine companies really helping cloak dagger behavior comes reporting. get shareholders they're scrutiny ever, REALLY need take whatever transparency level thought needed double it. Especially considering current hospitalization rate cases 2-4 weeks ago. Everything covid delayed
 test results today infections 2 weeks ago, people currently infected spreading unknowingly. Shit gonna get real Texas. get control government took right actions. NZ took actions US they'd likely screwed. phase 3. They're quoting Sun, would take massive pinch salt.

I'd imagine, anything, told prepare receive vaccines November mad last minute scramble actually get shipment. Bavaria. Try double sided tape! use wig tape, stick nose bridge gently press mask it. fogging ever, even refrigerated aisle grocery store. pure Murdoch bullshit though. Dictator Dan 52% approval rate, today.

Ireland went back 6 week lock hospitals aren‚Äôt nearing capacity. guess Harvard kids don‚Äôt believe science? Yes course except deniers know it‚Äôs true. know, morons. schools re-open? One thing I've noticed surges happen later expect (Florida example this). EU fire department: ""Well building little bit fire basement?. that's right, go put fire spreads several floors. Heck, maybe dies itself!""

Chinese fire department ""We better put fire immediately, grow bigger quite fast - that's fires work."" Yes people still work back April may cautious , since April/May things gotten lot better. point lock also prevent hospital surges like seeing Texas, whole point thread. literally making shit first paragraph. Please show statement vaccine manufacturer says trying reduce severity illness (which also makes sense, since would treatment definition, vaccine). Ah China released virus handle afterall. AstraZeneca supposedly charging something 10 dollars seems. Closer 5. You‚Äôre one blathering managed three months shitting family instead shutting mouth acknowledging people *have* work support families. self centered tone deaf be. 

Since managed three months, I‚Äôm sure donate income next three family stay home, right? :) all, make sound easy simple. October 6th. really date Show me. Ah response comment someone else - said ""Great! long keep up? long rest world like this, it‚Äôs always one incoming plane boat trip away. ""

I challenging idea 'the rest world like this', not. I'm gonna say warned things start popping closer election time are. timing impecable. wish!! company sign saying ""no masks permitted store,"" even though Colorado mask mandate. boss lunatic.

The El Pso County Health Department done shit. I've reported 5 times, nothing happened. owner uses humiliation tactics berates employees wearing ""diapers"" face. thing refuse go office. Golf property least American's concerns tax money. Better golf property shelling middle eastern hospital. reason polio still around geopolitics regions still resides in, there's anything wrong vaccine. curiosity, think study Nature reporting? think negates effectively lockdowns (which original point think)? Jesus, I'm I'm lucky make salary 4 months work... understand concern, however Xinjiang poor province far far away developed regions. 

I believe outbreaks developed regions, would contained much quickly. ""Corona crisis team"" Rottal-Inn district decided Monday morning actual lockdown district would come. District Office press officer Thomas Hofbauer gave information Bayerischer Rundfunk request. Starting tomorrow, district citizens allowed leave house valid reasons.

In addition, schools, kindergartens day-care centers well catering trade closing. still pick food, Hofbauer told BR. general decree de facto lockdown still drawn up; according district office, apply ten days Tuesday, midnight. Wow article zero information it, quote. talking about? 

Im one showing empathy, one saying, ""yes go back put life risk.""

Money *not worth human life* Home Depot magnet anti mask people. Plus, store wont enforce people wear masks. reduced transmission public places. happening elsewhere? virus fall sky.
Unfortunately, data mostly hidden collected German TTI (apart lacklustre stats RKI). weekly vague guess, cause mumbled without meaningful numbers assessment data quality. messed probably similar country instead decided make positive changes resolve issue rather hide heads sand hope goes away itself. Masks 100% effective yeah, still makes sense limit number people amount time spend inside allowing sales non-essential items. Prove racist. Sweden? Glad wore mask washed hands, lessened viral load contamination others. Hope long-term effects bankrupt family. add social distancing thei arsenol prevention, understand hoax. haha Third. many time. virus city, simply test whole city, isolate positivs 2-3 weeks, boom done, virus gone.

That's China almost virus free live like normal.

So scary, virus! see, huge problem. Rules made governments desperate halt spread deadly disease. one thinks clothes essential, essential anyone buys *right now*. sort stupid, snarky ""protest"" serves useful purpose and, many gullible, actually harm. wish people like could fined. tell   Trump‚Äôs fault?

lol  countries aren‚Äôt locking beating virus handling completely different US includes mask wearing. thats US-centric view world. dont matter much think Unsurprisingly, supportive shutting things also typically vote favor welfare programs higher taxes. also likely live cities states pay welfare.

So people accurately pointing shutting os necessary already willing pay help others make that. Experts agreement way. people disagreeing unwilling listen experts. Great advice need people side. 

If people look dislike need help going get it. sars mers? even scary. positive rate high. think switzerland may pass them. available general public enough data phase 3 gathered, healthcare workers access it, teachers next group access. even limited groups there's question scaling production. really need somebody explain racist president says racist things supports racist things might contributing racial disparities?

A system ethnic domination going back beginnings Atlantic Slave Trade certainly one person's ""fault"", enforce carry legacy individual people. Med-surg nurse El Paso here. made charge newly reopened unit house 24 covid patients several state nurses last week. terrifying bad getting. small side units hospital opened same. never seen many patients filling hospital, many deaths level care 10 years. want go work. ready short even state nurses travelers helping us. done reviewing? God says idiots thought Finland second wave? I‚Äôm guessing means patients requiring ventilator. Still misinformed acting like knows everything - typical Reddit. I‚Äôve seen benefits outweigh costs. country let virus go seen deaths bigger negative impact economy. get right first time go back normal. Nice seeing sport big crowds unlike US can‚Äôt risk free. own, tell whatever make feel better situation. even really weeks either. idiot county leaders declared businesses essential businesses, even counties blatantly lock down, employers reclassifying employees essential one enforcing lockdowns anyways.  


My job example, actual essential parts could handled supervisor lead clerk lockdown(only 2 salaried employees), rest classified nonessential everyone else home sheltering place. Basically something person scheduled hold fort weekend, holiday, time closed would normally do, counted essential. one small iota normal jobs essential 30 us come work lockdown. people generating work home, even normal essential work do. let us go home then? Nope, found make busy work everyone instead(reorganizing files, etc).  


When asked possibly rotating days weeks half staff 15 people would office time instead 30, told stop complaining. end what?? pandemic?
oh sweet summer child... don‚Äôt think study says conclusively socio-economic issues, could genetic link indirect genetic issue people darker skin less vitamin d. buy angle thought. Cases started rising across US schools opened. state began september sub 1% positivity... 3% rising fast. (This CT, spent summer around 1% positivity.) sources news information warped far towards right wing extremism believe ""the left"" making exaggerated claims covid19.  watch Faux News? Masks public spaces one line defence.

They course nothing people private wedding 100 people masks. people go bars illegal parties masks.

Or take eat food restaurant drink bar.

The problem European corona strategy built weak defense full holes. 

That masks big problem like building medieval castle takes lot effort make gate - never got around build walls well hard make people accept castle even needs gate.

We kinds stuck mask debate implementing first line defense hassle. everyone else NY knows Staten Island count. Things back normal least another year, pandemic way equate normal contrast ""castle doctrine"" U.S. states shoot anyone breaks house. police show up, take statement, establish person indeed potential burglar/kidnapper/rapist house commission crime, even go court. getting downvoted hell means saying truth Also acts defiance all, even could. 1) rapid test takes five days result, 2) someone came contact positive person day testing, test would still come negative, person may turn Covid positive even know it. COVID-19 spring surge, nurse Jennifer Williams started taking blood pressure medication seeing therapist. stress level dropped summer, now, COVID-19 unit Sturdy Memorial Hospital fills again, Williams says feels panic rising. days, work, sits car didn‚Äôt realize impact spring busy, new,‚Äù says. ‚Äúemotionally, brace myself.‚Äù America -9.5% drop. Lmao guys much hatred America shows... make pandemic longer, drag everybody down. mask wearing even political first place? time luxury hypotheticals. nothing political parties everything believing *science* compassion fellow Americans vs selfish conspiracy theorists want cry complain inconvenienced. still get media keeps saying 2nd/3rd wave many people, especially scientists acknowledge first one... argument. think Florida/Arizona getting Canadian snowbirds year. strangest thing human mind adapts easily keep remind normal, future takeaways masks everywhere, permanent. Florida resident here. donated blood May. nurse person donating room wearing masks nose. Sorry, I'm again. Yeah, covid rates UK dropped low summer, move operations abroad iirc. slowed bit. know country pre-ordered millions doses AstraZeneca Vaccine without guarantee getting useful vaccination. NSW &lt;10 cases daily past weeks testing till around 10K mark daily! Even us coming around Spring/Summer people still diligently testing signing locations! take much think reach insane. perspective, worked Pittsburgh city hospital blizzard years back. took us less forty-eight hours fill capacity start setting patients makeshift hallway rooms three days send patients home. Then, ICU beds full up, keep unstable, critical patients ER ICU-comparable area, turn backs ER capacity.

It absolutely reach levels much shorter period time think, especially flu starts really get circulating. don‚Äôt know dude. Seems like kids cure worse disease. think kids pioneers psychologically stunted saw families living wilderness? Pretty sure traumatic kid give relatives virus kills them. There's one Canada. App alerts spent 15 minutes within 2 meters around someone tested positive.

The instructions ask contact people contact with, positive diagnosis. see flaws - belligerent enough bother, smartphones - contact tracers already full workload. UK island nation. Australia. Vietnam island nation.

And BTW, many people welded apartments China, many people died Covid US? Reddit loves hate America. posts like there‚Äôs ton ‚Äúdont worry US get soon!‚Äù posts. threads US marks new record day there‚Äôs mention Europe. 

So short, every thread ‚Äòbut America bad!!‚Äô Google evil get welded apartment, government takes freendom? no? Leper colony, come everyone reading this, blood type thing make donation useful. blood CMV negative, meaning I‚Äôm missing antibody harm babies get blood containing it. look Red Cross app, blood always ends going children‚Äôs hospitals. 6 months community transmission free + lockdown free Western Australia, winter. So, incorrect. 

Test, trace, quarantine. Social distance + masks + proactive teired response there's active spread. pretty simple. [Johns Hopkins covid-19 web data reported Sunday 7:24AM 84,007 new US covid-19 cases 908 new deaths.

This Monday morning 7:24AM data posting time, 58,934 new US cases 333 new deaths. reason, ever since mid April, every Monday Tuesday sharp drop reported deaths least 50% (today 63% drop Sunday). also drop reported cases (-29% today) dramatic drop deaths. US daily deaths chart (select/expand bottom right panel desktop site) ends looking sawtoothed. probably something data gathering schedules.  [""Bloody Mary full Vodka, blessed art thou among Yea, lucky - none appliances broke. heard stories people handwashing laundry stove kettle lockdown. Go fun, get natural vitamin D. borders closed.

It's well-known fact impossible land borders island countries much easier illegal crossings boats LOT harder pull (though still happens). still first wave  That‚Äôs pretty big technicality though. goal able hang friends family indoors without masks pack crowded sports stadiums like nothing ever happened, right?

Who cares get COVID every years severity reduced flu levels? get booster shot pharmacy every fall get life. biggest know of... officially reported  ""The best moment plant tree 20 years ago. second best NOW!"" - Chinese proverb sub (and reddit general) would believe Europe peak humanity, definition peace earth nothing bad every happens. Again, belief everything run better state level. Republicans independents want govt lives. willing pay price, case asking others same.

I share philosophy, whether health care, immigration, women's rights pandemic, pretty clear choices; stand? Please vote Isn‚Äôt crazy?

I finished BS + MS December 2019, started work January 2020.

Then, everyone able work home (which included myself), sent home. Around mid-March so.

I‚Äôve working company home, longer I‚Äôve working company onsite. me, specifically, get LOT value onsite home, employees there, I‚Äôll stick home time being. It‚Äôs WFH REALLY tough professional development, ESPECIALLY young employee, brand new workforce. Roughly 200k. 

Same thing every country large numbers cases. People general, governments, stopped caring much didn‚Äôt much.

Exactly. Say, example, drive bus people coughing you. work hospital. Maybe 60 year old mother work grocery. financial need, live together share childcare. opened kids' school. matter time somebody gets sick. contrary, gives measure cultural differences still there. society still highly discriminative. furthest ahead gonna take well 6 months get everyone vaccinated, dropping precautions day one vaccine availability fuck shit up. think be. Deaths drop drastically at-risk people essential workers vaccinated. point threat pandemic severely reduced. Plus, treatments. TN. age even. safe. think mainly result (and article touches on) cultural differences, biological differences. 

I‚Äôm pregnant Hispanic woman, I‚Äôm lucky enough luxury working home, since March. access great healthcare, family educated following guidelines, social distance. I‚Äôve quarantined since March, I‚Äôve seen friends extended family entire time. Husband extremely careful work teacher. 

But vastly different many families. Husband teaches mostly low income, Hispanic area. students often live multigenerational homes. adults front line essential workers, whether healthcare, retail/fast food, construction... many lack access adequate healthcare. may may aware guidelines precautions skew conservative many students expressing viewpoints covid hoax (though husband guilt trips comply covid guidelines kicked immediately)

I think mostly result economic social disadvantage. 

I think whole vitamin argument much smaller factor above. interesting review article positive feedback loop STAT3 PAI-1 pathways severe COVID. Thanks sharing! far western region, 5 million like 1/4 total population there. get bad there? population large... would equivalent USA? always get downvoted point lot studies correlation vs causation pieces. There‚Äôs denying BIPOCs getting infected killed disproportionately, there‚Äôs lot contributing factors race lethality virus. virus isn‚Äôt racist, doesn‚Äôt mean housing, job markets, health care availability aren‚Äôt. 

Studies previously show high obesity rates among black Hispanic populations. Obesity immediately increases risk factor almost preexisting conditions put risk covid complications. imagine frozen turkey tv dinners fly supermarket shelves year thanksgiving. Cant post EU without saying ‚ÄòAmerica bad!‚Äô research read find kids 10 may less likely spread Coronavirus, case older kids. One study found high schools least 2x spread elementary schools did. Harvard students mostly dumb rich kids whose parents paid get in?

I noticed Trump people Harvard, sure seem like big science bright :) Yes, takeout &amp; delivery only. We‚Äôre gunnnnna make itttt Gotta love ‚Äúyou won‚Äôt die...your grandma will...so go business‚Äù takes. Oof Everyone acts should. maybe bank robbers convicted murdering cashier let go now?  even take long rebuild. China's economy back almost normal growth again.

once cases mass testing, fraction cost shutting things contain it. Well I‚Äôm Dallas (3rd worst driving city America) majority people high blood pressure meds too.

I'm pretty sure keep elementary schools open honest ""childcare"" can't left home alone. I'm getting impression kids less contagious adults. ""volontary lockdown"" worked much slower bring cases Norways ""traditional lockdown"".

Even dont think Sweden would low deaths norway exactly thing. collagen type defect EDS?

I'm sorry hear pain relief work well you. EDS similar problems though severity. feel wisdom teeth pain relief? sounds terrifying! Oxford vaccine already production. months. Read back. mean pretty reflective latest opinion polling matter. Without watching video yet, let guess, Facebook belgium close 80k tests per day 11 million people.

So lot, unfortunatly also need them, since testing 16k positive days (13k average past week). covid patients die 2 weeks, death declared 3 weeks infection. think one point people longer care constitution. deathrate increases 5 % hospital overloaded, things simply happen. constitution country playbook choose play things orderly way. game stops full body bags street burn corpses bags. paid attention history US supreme court, even know legitimacy tied popularity. That's candidates extreme past chose moderate court. US, fully educated history, read court's history, last time popularity vastly favor another institution, court simply bullied submission (FDR threatening pack it). 

As said. constitution matter one bit, want something done. several US presidents stopped started ""conflicts"", circumventing congress? worry, find semi-legitimate way courts agree it. Worst case, apply article one suspend Habeas Corpus, ""public safety"" danger. 

And people behave responsible granted freedom state. Every day people prove worthy freedom. That's representatives URGE population behave, social distance, wear masks, meet bigger groups. want go full authoriarian. can't behave, well, state act protect us ourselves. Opinion polling better reflects Melbourne's subreddit pro lockdown views do. Yeah, really know read product description, probably error translation I'm confused responses written someone understand trans people.

It aligned gender identity restrictions, right?

Now, argument blood deferral due HIV status, makes sense due communities various cattegories sexual relations with.

Straight trans women sex men sex either straight bisexual men. likely outside msm risk pool. trans men sex men sex gay bisexual men, thus within msm risk pool.

So one accepts HIV risk pool argument, see problems stances listed? (I saying necessarily agree risk pool argument. noting consistency)  pandemic might get free WWIII throw end virus killed 0.1% population worst hit countries average age death older life expectancy countries. Locking everyone homes 6 months worth it. France never heard case before.

There questions related sexual contact questionnaire fill start process France, including homosexual interactions. know consequences answer ""yes"" though.  many times China need this, rest world figures mass testing + enforced quarantine positives everyone needs do?

I‚Äôm anti vax, reservations first line. Vote fuck put trial. pointed truly horrible things many us can't understand thing fallacy relative privation. lost ex cancer April Milwaukee hospitals overflowed COVID prioritizations.

Fuck virus. Yeah, start this, looked situation said ""you're gonna need rent freeze UBI even think getting this, maybe even jubilee end.""

I even fathom government response could ""meh, guess everyone's gonna go broke.""

We kinda slapdash UBI via couple months expanded unemployment one $1200 check. do, sort of, rent freeze form eviction moratoriums. Without eviction moratoriums, whole country would probably burnt ground right now. think government would allow things get bad remember still ICU beds per capita quite margin. contractor diagnostic check furnace basement, entering leaving basement door.

What addition requiring mask avoid anything spreading house via duct work?  Europe equally hit. Poland low numbers Spring. effectively first wave Overall US accepted pandemic moving lives. Unless gets 5,000-10,000 dying day I'm sure people change.

My grandparents asking us come holidays they're sure long gonna last anymore, they're willing take risk rather potentially spend rest lives without seeing us. unfortunate that's older folks thinking now.

(in case y'all worried planning seeing outdoors‚Äîwe live place winter warm enough outside bad) also aided constitution, intelligence, wisdom. Maybe helped charisma; dexterity useless. relabeling...it's fact. First trimester pregnancy baby. fertilized egg baby. clump undifferentiated cells baby. Trying pretend make true. Yup. wishful thinking guess. think China lock 11 million people fun?

There 12 million Uyghurs China, so...yes? Active surveillance = testing random people without symptoms find clusters early possible.

You know thing Western countries cannot afford. must something summertime, calculated R chart less February nobody yet realized disease spreading. Greetings Netherlands. restrictions needed we're rational adults making right decis... Ah. Bars closed government pleads Germany reserving ICU beds again. 2 friends London, sister Brussels laws flew Mexico yesterday. Travel closed US lmao. Turn CNN try book flight. You‚Äôll see you‚Äôre able travel. numbers include probably 500 delays, tests day low friend. It‚Äôs going long winter. I'm pissed bc people, Frickin' PHARMACIST told last time went pick meds, wear one bc medical condition. ..I'M GD OXYGEN LOVE GOD, NEED ONE BC SHIT KILL ME. lungs shot enough is, gall tell to... GENTLY told go fuck behind mask (another plus) loudly stated I'd prefer exposed. wish could report someone, small privately owned operation. might add...the whole family works uber religious. Jesus stuff over. close, convenient otherwise helpful I'd change. still might, tell why. ""blood christ"" gonna protect atheist ass, though mask surely will. Ffs. lag time youre infected enough virus load trigger positive test. Plus false negatives happen. know long takes vaccine effective ? single injection ? traveled Japan. live China. pretty meaningless front line essential workers. allows tool manage anxiety provide essential services communities. thing U.K.. go shops everyone complies masks zero social distancing going on. It‚Äôs like people actively go way try get close physically possible. wanted fucking eggs loaf bread, walk shops diseased. countries open American travelers? open NZ?

NZ no-quarantine travel Australia. US doesn't.

You wrong.

You given facts prove wrong.

You still trolling.

The US can't travel, NZ can. Apparently one (if main) main people responsible abortion ban also anti masker - find easily Facebook. Imagine surprise learned that. accuse people selfish different priorities. Again, would news *didn‚Äôt* show response injected foreign body, entire release purposefully misleading doesn‚Äôt provide new, meaningful information. mean taking virus seriously result cases. guarantee rest world tested 5 million people first sign case, I'm sure rest world would also number cases China. nah. America gets 80k still carries like nothing wrong. wonder case counts high. seem fifteen Thanks leftist really uninformed. think Belgian government? Spain? Italy? Peru? Argentina? would need transfusion covid? curious. arguing. field hospitals several European countries spring never got used. Anyway, shocking Poland failing ensure capacity nine months later. surge expected low amount cases spring. consider fact China apparently willing literally weld people apartments, probably know every citizen group citizens given time, makes kind sense.

We managed restrictions longer Wuhan even strict, even already felt like point continued existence lol. 

If willing make great sacrifices, eventually rewarded - question price high pay? Yeah, think I'm sort new age poet something ü§£ Explain US Covid spread like wildfire.

Gee, wonder is? lol Stock market reacted accordingly today. 3% drop Dow currently. send CV? director CDC [said yet another bump never-ending roller coaster counter productive exaggerations people simply afraid say ""we know sure, think might help, least costly mitigation measure available us"". Yea, ostensibly science-driven agency ever politically co-opted Trump admin? never lived Japan then. basically anywhere East Asia. power you, matter. Pandemic control incredibly hard one things 1/3 compliance gets 1/3 way there. gets nowhere. nature beast. People praising guys spring fast, strict non bullshit response. saying countries like Sweden Netherlands much pussies bothering things like constitutional rights. decided populism cool? demonstration Warsaw Saturday. huge gathering, odd see many polish 'patriots' coming together. going here. weather force many inside. blowing places masks required. Unfortunately states rules masks closures able prevent spread places taking seriously. bad situation. easiest way prove ask first second ""wave"" worse. 

Any sane person would say first, lot people dying, look graph deaths. higher *case* counts second, much less testing beginning majority people first wave official case numbers.

Cases-wise, currently second wave. highest death rate following wave around half first wave. 

So testing comparable July, passed ""half bad"" April, ""worse"". testing improved since July (not mention treatment), may even ""half bad"" yet.

That said, going still could end worse anyways, yet. agree headline infuriatingly wrong. Yeah agree. I'm downplaying virus all, deadly. I'm positive number infected way higher excuses violate masks crowd control getting quite interesting store.

I‚Äôm one managers popular store mall customer cut line 20 people waiting get in. Scared living lights employee.
- ‚Äú tell take care rest ‚Äú

When ladies showed register ready make purchase ready RIGHTS REFUSE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

It gotten bad mall security get police stop temper tantrum.

1: ‚Äú denying service indian discrimination rights refuse service blah blah blah‚Äù

Us: CCTV shows footage entrance woman blatantly arguing employee, sticking middle finger him, violating crowd control guidelines maintain safe shopping environment according cdc guidelines.

1: spying now! Im gonna sue something.

Police: Ma‚Äôm gonna need calm down-

1: Shut up! rights make purchase!

Let say started throwing bigger fit knocking product destroying store property got arrested.

Fun fact: Average wait time end line 10-15 minutes.
- pull together, work 8hour shift sure wait chat play phone 10-15 minutes

PS: dont get cuffs dont want wait. Covid-19 cause inconvenience, 10-15 minutes sure hell better hours days police department   Define ""bad"". suspect people greatly differ means. virus mutate become infectious something people really changed behaviour drastically cause sudden spike? responsible writing generate clicks. 

Choose one. boy roof going fry No, reason kids can't play friends. damaging child's mental health. completely deluded think couple months mask usage completely suppress virus. Literally public health official says that. guess know needs start wearing lol can't legally require people get tested. feel fine I'm going waste time it. differing degrees transparency testing reporting regimes course.

Yes, necessarily trust country's numbers.

Did think saying distrust country's numbers equally? would think that? sadly past point contain Virus like Taiwan, SK, Japan Vietnam did. Contacttracing wont work infection numbers like this. Let alone west cant seem follow appropriate social rules avoid virus like there. rules known, now, yet numbers look grim. Cultural differences guess, makes SEA people compliant rules experience SARS. cant get people even wear masks hope somehow adhere rules? China rush harsh lockdowns soon virus pops again. Funny bring up. one harshest lockdowns running relatively normal again. West nearly harsh enough lockdowns.

So saying is, dont really idea do, you? Lets talk 3 weeks again... mind think Spring 2021.

It takes roughly 4-8 weeks outbreaks peak. outbreaks we're experiencing mostly first 1-3 weeks school (we're around week 9 10 schools USA). El Paso issued stay-at-home order, Utah starting ratio care. Even locked they've got month continued rising cases.

Just make math 4-8 weeks easy, let's say 6 weeks begin see events peaking. 

6 weeks Halloween December 14.

6 weeks Thanksgiving January 7.

6 weeks Christmas February 5.

6 weeks New Years Eve February 11.

If change 8 weeks, dates become: December 28, January 21, February 19 February 25.

This timeframe late-January late-February may peak infections entire pandemic means there's exactly 0 chance March next year Spring begins things back normal.

It's October another 4 MONTHS rising infections point care rationed new stay-at-home orders already issued. think uneducated people lie, never insinuated all. I'm curious think someone, who's career line work absolutely nothing stock market, lying improving it. guys Europe didn‚Äôt? explain away American spikes we‚Äôre stubborn idiots get played like puppets political media, seeing Europe come back extremely concerning. Yet don‚Äôt see similar spike Aus NZ? health minister said interview, obviously crude estimate. one really knows. official number right 1.5 % (again, that's people right now), honestly % positivity rate past month find pretty believable.

But point ask random person Czechia, going personally know least one, probably even people tested positive others sick get tested. job, department head send email ordering everyone work home, 5 people (of 40 department) tested positive 5 others quarantine symptoms... center actually give shit making lumber cuts good possible use actual table saw. don‚Äôt know word ‚Äúlucky‚Äù. government people needed took seriously. Unlike others unfortunately:/ What? Exactly. countries like Italy Spain reaching new record highs spite heavily masked populace strict mask mandates mean masks work, means wear double masks. Duh! 

My mask protects mask :) Fire Fauci Biden hire back in. someone takes dump house, fault. bother cleaning track poop house, fault. China control Poland. Poland does. depends. vaccine expected provide sterilizing immunity, meaning get sick all. expected lessen severity infection. do? Probably continue use ppe social distance get sterilizing vaccine distribution. realistically happen? Social distancing adequate safety measures probably end continue ignored still likely outbreaks sterilizing vaccine distributed. (Probably one that's nasal spray inhalation provide sterilizing immunity). Ok. Let's say they're people.

Are OK forcing people give bodily autonomy others situations?

For example, someone desperately needs blood donation, woman nearby match. want give blood. think government force to? 

Or organ donation. many places, opt death organs used. Poland seems opt out, family members object behalf, dead organs cannot used. think corpses compelled donate organs even objection? living people?

A fetus uses entire body's system *nine months*, extremely strenuous. far dangerous inconvenient giving blood. far greater time commitment kidney donation. 

Why fetus get rights use someone else's body without permission born human would? COVID disproportionally affects elderly leaves kids bad (there obvious cases deadly like everything). So, bunch kids get bad long visit grandparents elderly homes. mind assuming I'm denier I'm living total fear. know going good, opinion fear anxiety help, sensationalist headlines matter. different ways look it. Stay Safe ‚úåÔ∏è often actually see compared first group? USA follow European wave. delay several weeks, rise already happening several states. Arizona ... New York ... New Jersey ... Massachusetts. Even Florida sorta did. confidence vastly misplaced. Europeans tired resistant strict policies Americans are, therefore none gonna happen. We'll ride out. There's much wood burn human forest fire. terrible. exactly happens government refuses take action, shut down, mandate masks social distancing people go lives killer pandemic going on. smaller seed means less extensive outbreak peak. US cases surpass per capita many seeds. covid toes still thing? exposed living 1 person tested positive, another classic symptoms. I‚Äôve swollen painful toes last three days came, seemingly, nowhere. average two per state. That‚Äôs much. would? Lockdowns suck. point sort seem necessary? interpretation writer. Wether interpretation matches reality unclear. Remember writer medical expert perhaps able grasp meant triage guideline intended doctors. week document became known another national [document better language specifically made clear first step increase resources implementing triage guidelines. assume added benefit readers medical experts drew wrong conclusions. interpretation. intensive care extraordinary conditions
 first step - expand resources
 caregivers apply principles prioritizing intensive care resources given document, exhaust possibilities increase intensive care resources question. NZ quarantine return home international travel, like US quarantine travel anywhere. Lol   case?

Plasma donations indeed screened HIV hepatitis.

If they‚Äôve tested positive, ‚ÄúThe individual donate blood, plasma, body organs, tissue, add It‚Äôs common misconception Food Drug Administration paying blood. fact, says blood paid donors labeled way. **But hospitals won‚Äôt use it.** practice, nobody really pays blood, said Mario Macis, economist Johns Hopkins Carey Business School studied incentives blood donation. ‚ÄúEven though it‚Äôs legal, it‚Äôs still considered totally moral ethical pay cash blood donors.‚Äù

And blood plasma isn‚Äôt used ways full blood. reason plasma collected way never goes straight another person. It‚Äôs broken many different protein products become pharmaceuticals. Along way, components processed remove kill virus stowaways. wrong feel better US response countries responses fall apart? Maybe lockdowns work. hard empathize / people knowingly put situation. said, sad. would fact Europe reduced case loads three months ago mean anything now? effect, would bad one, many people infected yet U.S. does. sure yet. Maybe $50 report in, sometime January? one 65 give shits desents?

If not, bother even raising them? dropped orphanage.  Shagging... Shagging boardwalk

Edit : Google oldies song Didn‚Äôt chairperson FDA say something effect they‚Äôre effective vaccine? It's...not baby point abortions completed. N

If difference baby fetus fetus one location, baby another location... distinction meaningless.

Relabeling human non-human make true. 60,000 doses per day hard limit?  none fan base recognize irony channel praises Trump Pence, refuse quarantine, implementing quarantine themselves. soooooo sad. Removed rule 4 rule 5. Please make topic political comments spread misinformation.  bubble going collapse point.

Just remember billionaires made like gangbusters pandemic. UK 11% people specifically told isolate test trace system so. 89% people people specifically told may come contact someone COVID stay home 14 days. 

But really good data support conclusion. People getting COVID/exposed COVID symptoms exactly people ignoring social isolation measures first place. surprise people still adhere guidelines get sick someone know get sick. people I'm talking staying home avoiding non-essential trips going captured stats they're going exposed people COVID get (most can't find similar studies USA, odds good 30% estimate people stayed mostly home 7 months WAY off. fallen trap assuming people know personally representative broader population.

I think Google stopped publishing it, used show reduction mobility different areas based location data. remember seeing stats NYC reductions 50-60% recreational activities, workplaces, etc. can't find anymore, think figure far off. 6500 back probably 100k reality sit eat one place days that's independent sub shop makes great food travel well. 

Nobody's ever me, that's kinda make point go week beers meal buy packaged meats (they smoke/cure/whatever meat). really hope hangs on, already kinda niche begin subs expensive compared chains. Don‚Äôt thank me, job. People thanking you, yet you‚Äôll still underpaid appreciated. point doctors nurses extreme amount training receive paid services pandemic. would like fighter pilots units. Us enlisted subpar equipment, safety backbone, albeit expendable. pilots said quit surface air missiles shot me, failed duty fellow man. exorbitant amount time, training, experience wasted it‚Äôs needed time. 
In perfect world, would realize important nurses, essential jobs, etc. pay accordingly capitalism all. Replace ""feared"" ""expected"". arc moral universe long, bends towards justice. -MLK kidding. We're highest active infections ever US. schools still largely open across country held RATM tickets. McConnell thinks Biden win, he's going help Biden's presidency passing stimulus. Yeah agree dumb. one things Us slightly better think, least areas Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine pretty far along also. I‚Äôm trial everyone follow appointments seem really excited results coming in. I‚Äôm sure healthier, also older. Covid deaths much correlated age conditions like obesity common west. Holy shitballs. Positive rate still relatively low, wonder second wave bad European countries first wave worse? Specifically, Trump undermined civility even rationality amongst base reaping he's sown. What? How? great job expressing personal freedoms! made response one aspect might wanna careful about. Every single source named and/or hyperlinked article additional links provided. 

If want additional information whatever reason, you‚Äôre invited find yourself. 

Like said, might even discuss you. üëç No, idiot really. Maybe lot unknowns x variables could timeline thrown around simply given recent updates Covid hospitalizations, plateauing deaths, realistic vaccine timeline; seems logistical reason happen. I‚Äôm even starting social economic implications that. tables didn‚Äôt even arrive Yeah, counterintuitively opening indoor dining limited capacity might actually slow spread virus. restaurants mandate safety protocols (small groups; masks you‚Äôre eating, drinking, table; physical distancing groups). Locking restaurants (or worse, large outdoor public spaces) push gatherings indoors private households, can‚Äôt enforce anything.

It reminds college town anyone 19+ could enter bar law enforcement bar staff looked way anyone 21 drinking unless things got really hand. Better let kids drink ‚Äúsupervision‚Äù alcohol poison dorms frats. Mass gatherings part normal socialization. entirely reasonable miss things. Especially people many friends can't socialize private. rule 3 get equivalent US cases (#casesInCountry/#casesInUSA = #countryPopulation/#USAPopulation, find #casesInUSA).


However, assumes positivity rate populations, might represent real number. Haha, same. always thought raging introvert went social events to.

Oh wrong was. miss meeting people much. ""therapeutics"". guys get crazier day.

I mean, get enthusiasm going back normal, understand it. please tamper caution know logistics vaccination process. Personally there's way many terrifying effects virus dare risk it, I'll sit parties well way (no jab intended, contrarian opinion). goal still keep hospitals overrun, know think otherwise.

Even Canada - nowhere near bad US right now, still can't open things. paranoia, student history. safe, effective vaccine ever produced less 5 years. takes time check long-term side effects vaccines, pregnant women.

No effective vaccine ever produced type coronavirus history. Rushing something looking inject BILLIONS people asking disaster. Rushing vaccine RNA virus type never successfully create vaccine particular asking disaster.

A rushed polio vaccine 1955 paralyzed killed children. (Cutter incident). Like COVID-19, intense political pressure get something asap. deemed ""safe"" 1951, Jonas Salk University Pittsburgh‚Äôs medical school received grant National Foundation Infantile Paralysis find vaccine. intense months research, took live polio virus killed formaldehyde infectious still provided virus-fighting antibodies.  tests showed vaccine safe, Salk told wife, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got it,‚Äù Offit wrote.  success soon leaked out.

46%? Sounds like Japanese simply physically healthier westerners. Australia's idea ""doing well covid"" get cases zero draconian lockdowns. wrong approach rest world emulating. 

As alternative, look South Korea, country twice population Australia. Koreans currently 100+ cases every day, without draconian measures Australians practiced. Korea better model Australia? 

And get idea draconian Australians were, imprisoning people entire apartment blocks (poor quality) food delivered them. Well 2020 technology good enough online lessons.
Then instead investing technology spent millions buying tables wheels... that's different story. Could opportunity reduce digital divide improve schools. Something would lasted covid.

But well.. seems much better buy millions tables wheels. DeVos‚Äô husband ‚Äòs company Amway

We coming asked carried shoulders vulnerable, sense health occupation track 5 day 14 day trends. responding post noting Monday/Tuesday anomaly.

14 day daily cases deaths, 62410 747 Hospitals filled doctors studied SCIENCE way. failed plan difference second wave one March March lot cases concentrated Northern regions. second wave hitting every region severely. Potentially, become much worse compared first wave, especially considering regions hit March richest best hospitals. Crikey, wonder good news looks like land.  May mid-week, it‚Äôs definitely sign things come next 10 days since haven‚Äôt seen serious mitigation actions come recently. Hold butts. 30-40% staying home time? 

Maybe totally different USA everyone bunkered down, UK 11% people specifically told isolate test trace system so. 89% people people specifically told may come contact someone COVID stay home 14 days. 18% actual COVID symptoms isolate (this 10 days).

I can't find similar studies USA, odds good 30% estimate people stayed mostly home 7 months WAY off. fallen trap assuming people know personally representative broader population. also comical think would fire guy who's working vaccine ready day said would. anybody looked daily new case graphs Italy France? Holy sh*t looks like going bad. want walk house go somewhere without thinking it. first

First wave always poor. Second wave rich. 

Nothing hurts rich giving containment. largely spared far. 

If herd immunity, poor neighborhoods reach first. rich get outbreaks slip thru get outbreaks 50%. 

The rich never naturally reach herd unless there's vaccine. They'll hide. plus threw anybody symptoms camps first scan QR code every single time go anywhere way someone infected let know exposed change health code yellow instead green. people still going businesses working others closes.

EU police: surprised pikachu face Soon city near you! Get tickets now! ride wonderful! far know, research pregnant women. reason think vaccine harmful baby, may prevented access due liability issues. quite likely least one vaccine would approved year, reserved healthcare workers elderly, take months get them. Widespread vaccine general public would likely begin next spring, time turn, might knowledge this. Even pregnancy, risks still much lower someone advanced age. SuperSpreader-In-Chief see people saying REDDIT

So people mind think average population follow sure buddy take vaccine first cause know 3 CLINICAL TRIALS many pre-clinical trials assure safety, like ones going FREEDOM LOVING USA UK every freaking country sure keep crying living bubble that's ur right source uses data official sites, correct think. Indeed Sweden plan may ideal prevent death (higher death per population ratio neighbors) may realistically adapted plan westerners mind (harsh measures associated totalitarian regimes often rejected straight ignored. honesty without debating whether lying numbers, China stuff shocking anyone living democratic ish country even takes overwhelming response would it) inconvenience would seen terrible carried long term could honest duration way. 

Even still think portion Americans would still complete jerks it, least hear ""ruinning lives save people life expectancy anyway"" often month 2 time. Even avoiding death end goal avoiding long term effects bodies somewhat keep economy complete collapse

What effectively changing topic. addressed comment.

To answer question, think governments failing needs done support businesses taxes used it.  dont even know what's happening china, information come go china without review government.

I think stupid accept everything coming China, also think equally stupid deny everything comes China. part, virus handled. also 3rd party economists, banks, etc confirm economic activity data coming China. 

China one harshest lockdowns world, including ones often violated individual liberty. that's precisely made effective getting rid virus. two go hand hand. know people hard time believing China virus control. ""We're rounding corner. virus almost over. vaccine weeks away. disappear.""

Etc. Yikes... Making America great. never late change culture positive way. real leadership about.

Biden wear mask time White House, withhold funding States lead anti-maskers (""Hey, want us help pay sick people mandate masks!? Good luck that!""), go clean house CDC re-professionalize it. lot President right people right message.

Broken government fixed. third time US gone this. It‚Äôs acceptable look situation rose colored glasses say ‚Äúwell this‚Äôll different!!!‚Äù know happens hospitalizations increase, there‚Äôs lag. going there? geez... numbers  cure virus... guy idiot. Brazil big HCQ. United States, example, big HCQ well, going far threaten India thinking stopping exports HCQ.
 Doubt I'd suggest find spending 7 months holed house, genuinely struggle see others same, become convinced people likely losing touch reality. listen health officials starting made shit 1000x times worse. get cite public health officials supports ""roll give up"" strategy. 

No, fuck delete comment fucking puss filled asshole. get Vaccinated see zero reason follow restrictions actual end October 2021, follow timeline H1N1 pandemic, COVID part. next 3 months worst part this, start fading rather quickly vaccines herd immunity spring.

The social end? April 2021. Christians aren‚Äôt giving two Easters kids aren‚Äôt giving two graduation seasons. Thankfully, cases decline anyway. Permanently every flu season?

The thing masks view downsides wearing one. course medical professional Schools live FL reopened August 11. That's 10 weeks ago. suggesting possible increase seeing schools? I‚Äôm Dallas live Denton now. avoid Dallas much can. stroke. Luckily mom‚Äôs house, ambulance called &amp; ambulance basically met helicopter nearest ‚Äúhospital‚Äù flown regional stroke center. 
She‚Äôs still back Prestroke she‚Äôs able live work home. El Pasoan here. husband extremely careful followed guidelines. We‚Äôre people people call paranoid. wearing masks well mask mandate. Hand sanitizer car used faithfully go store. make trips fast. don‚Äôt go anything. spray phones, wallets, keys, glasses alcohol walk door. spray shoes keep bucket door. Lysol door handles surfaces touch we‚Äôre able wash hands-and wash hands soon come house. Mostly, though, don‚Äôt go much. store vote. walk dogs neighborhood park isn‚Äôt crowded. 

My husband started symptoms last week brushed bad air quality allergies. issues also rheumatoid arthritis figured also arthritis flare. Friday husband woke couldn‚Äôt smell anything got tested. test came back positive yesterday morning, waited three hours line get tested yesterday I‚Äôm awaiting results. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm experiencing COVID allergies/air quality/arthritis don‚Äôt feel great. temperature 99.5 (not really fever) last couple days, husband‚Äôs first. We‚Äôre keeping 100 101 tylenol. It‚Äôs bad fever isn‚Äôt comfortable either. feels pretty awful. We‚Äôre hoping doesn‚Äôt get worse, we‚Äôre keeping log everything case need go hospital. feel fortunate far aren‚Äôt bad manage home. I‚Äôm still working home. don‚Äôt know sure yet maybe ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù aggravated sleep deprivation. 

I‚Äôm teacher local group pushing hard schools reopen face face. leader group attending fundraising dinners local political candidate recently last week. masks. distancing. person also participates group called ‚Äúunmuzzle Texas children‚Äù, opposes mask wearing, especially children. Many El Paso‚Äôs teachers terrified exhausted. There‚Äôs long saga TEA Commissioner Mike Morath boils to: waiver continue online learning still receive funding expires 12 weeks, carries us part way November. little hope situation drastically improve then. hospitalization rates stay 32% higher schools choose remain virtual. It‚Äôs great plan. you‚Äôre Texan, please: call TEA. Call Mike Morath. Call governor. Help us out. districts, credit, trying. really are. funding held head there‚Äôs much do. area already lost teacher (in Gadsden ISD, right across New Mexico border) assistant principal (in Socorro ISD, Far East side town). seems like everyone knows someone lost family member, friend, colleague. 

Anyway, long probably coherent, situation people around me. you‚Äôre Texan, please vote safely get better leaders office. Make phone calls make voice heard. I‚Äôm ashamed sad I‚Äôm angry people continuing allow spread unchecked. El Paso always kind ‚Äúit can‚Äôt happen here‚Äù mentality really thought August 3rd 2019 woke us that. guess not. Like said, don‚Äôt understand mind works, tried arguing kept saying that‚Äôs believes right change stance. Football stadiums full, restaraunts full, schools packed (with masks let‚Äôs real compliance...) reality demand shock setting in. matter much reopening plan people spending. basically give possible reason avoid worrying it, they're in, matter implausible illogical. liberal / progressive part Europe Scandinavia, haven‚Äôt exactly best.

The best performing countries share border epicenter, except NZ. 

While India shares border, isn‚Äôt much cross cultural contact mountains. Also India democracy 1.3 billion people. I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs hard manage much lower death rate. Lol Hyderabad Bangalore population really different. said one generalized one wearing masks true. true people see wearing masks all. go grocery store. travel small towns Telangana Andhra quite lot yes said stands true. masks though nobody following measures all. masks vouch it. many conspiracies misinformation. otherwise, agree 500K dead New Year's

That's double current total occurring two months. absurd statement multiple levels. incorrect helping.  South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Singapore, China.

Some countries never full lockdown. might curfews shut bars/clubs full shelter-in-place order never done places like Japan South Korea. Last time, ruling party working getting re-elected. they've secured power, give damn, instead focusing dismantling education system women's rights. They're interested dealing pandemic. Yeah that's partly legal issue. limited amount beds per worker allowed I'm sure care point. yeah, workers might run beds... True. hopefully ski resorts put precautions place regarding dining bars. I‚Äôm type guy shows up, goes hard open close, goes inside use restroom. Resort food drink expensive regardless. Yep, read too, sounds like ship sailed. I'm saying I'll know sure Nov. 3. set see John Fogerty March. Credence guy. Dude old hills still OK, knows he'll able go next year 2022. May another shot. Actually might rounding corner. testing backlog last couple days tests done backlog disappeared. seems explain least part rise numbers. There's hope flatten week. 

To compare USA, multiply 20 close enough. 

The rise number cases due several factors. opinion mostly combination change weather people following rules strictly going back work school.

The government tried implement set rules took middle ground controlling Covid keeping society economy functional. rules working intended. 
I think underestimated speed rise second wave thought would time implement additional measures.

The summer used effectively possible prepare second wave. preparations suffered due opposition legal concerns.

Going back lockdown May, would sustained several months, option. struggle find right balance. People done complying. on? talking flu af bad Corona. That's asking links on. hope so. depends mutates, think. hopefully less dangerous virus. Normally rule edited titles, actually appreciate addition ‚ÄúAstraZeneca says‚Äù. Thanks. :) Yeah amaze one time Europe absolutely coordinate work together, haven't. Every European Union state dealt way think that's mistake.  Yeah, i'm CEO sub... not. ""arguments"" opinions, facts ""Fox News anchors"" ""exposing themselves"".

Name iconic duo. unfortunately going possible kid virtual learning wife working home. Maybe idiots wrong word. told everywhere wear mask. least ignorant cover mouth nose. worry, never get 200k per day. testing able keep up. percentage positive test go hit plateau. Illinois supporting bars restaurants can't serve? property tax relief? support paying back loans taken open? increased unemployment benefits? license, liquor, fees waived? No. Despite forcibly closing businesses, state provided support people impacted. Flu-rona worse spread richer government.... I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs goal people trying achieve. report delayed results separately. example, every day city government reports X new cases delayed results. numbers new cases. too! supposed go DC show :( everywhere sure work bar/restaurant/hostel we're twenties , xoxo Summer/Fall 2021 public health experts would end masks distancing, way. public going end vaccine Spring, I‚Äôm honestly going point. 

If I‚Äôve isolated year shot arm, expect me? I‚Äôm moving point, suspect 95% people too. communication experts politicians place.

Because novel virus there's still much know anticipate. Science hence public health policy changes data/evidence changes. That's messaging consistent. public health experts broadly incompetent (although definitely are). consider centralist right leaning 2016 today proudly say hate left right politicians scum. I'm snowflake needs app block different perspectives that's pathetic sad. like join read everyone else thinks polar opposite thinks differently mark block him. watch CNN FOX news MSNBC whatever Hopefully! Nothing want stay live fear even getting vaccine shot solutions widely available, that‚Äôs prerogative. don‚Äôt push demand blanket restrictions government everyone else want live life again. I‚Äôm optimistic I‚Äôm really hoping that‚Äôs typo misunderstanding reporter‚Äôs side. seems sooner number Fauci stated past, Imagine China disclosed 1% cases, still fewer cases US. read interesting blog back March western (I think) woman went brief bike tour China, Wuhan locked down, wanted get (different) city days case happened there. perhaps Japanese journalist...!

She met mobile (on bicycle) testing teams rural/remote countryside, temperature checking passer-bys warning dangerous (politely might add, never felt harassed unsafe). 

I also led believe time welding apartment block doors close multiple entrances, one exit/entrance maintain tracking etc (though able give source unfortunately, makes sense). 

China's facial recognition tech developed, believe they've created 'gait' recognition system, harder disguise walk face (especially now, lol). scary obvious surveillance development! agree hope legislation created west prevent technologies used (not mis-used, used all). Unfortunately, think that's battle we're even aware we're fighting yet.

I think well China, generally compliant population. might agree handled pandemic, fascinating insight populace control. said every country handled C19. Sociology academics lot study next decade! Anything differs world view conspiracy kind.

My favorite Dems made up.  US, somehow they'll done globally.  That's pretty impressive. App NC things. set like one poster Canada mentioned, pitfalls. 

Hopefully good. live since October 1st. diagnostic check, would worry much it, since directly breathing ducts. Ask contractor would please wear mask.  Yeah, shame 7 moths Poland almost equally unprepared I'm assuming party old folks home. look children? means closing companies/sectors require personal physically present.  Need bookmarked every time someone posts achingly terrible airline-funded puff pieces tell us completely safe get airplane. it‚Äôs called filial piety respect elders. civility general. Also, collectivism. ....it proven found sewer samples march 2019.... Utah situation, one party religious state Utah truth covered poltical imp-o-piety. got lucky spring (mainly due rather harsh lockdown) people started believe COVID big deal. Add government everything preparing autumn's wave recipe disaster. IFR also varies lot depending population makeup positive cases, pandemic Europe stage SARS-COV-2 starts getting transferred younger people older people, increasing IFR. flu asymptomatic first couple days.

And research shows 75% people asymptomatic flu. Good work, nearly states listed middle-of-nowhere states super small. Combined, states make **8.25%** US population Illinois makes nearly half (3.89%). put perspective, California alone nearly 1.5x population states together.

The states 1% US population Illinois, Tennessee, Wisconsin, Oklahoma. Even happen Democrats take Senate. happened yet (PA).  

But allegedly per one FB site I'm on, disappear like magic November 4th. Agree I'll still probs wear mask let guard otherwise 1 week best Smart - waste time effort trying make reopening work, never going work.  Right, case answer legislative again? Oil companies drill oil love it, demand it. Want reduce drilling? Reduce demand. want oil companies act different way, government legislate (and understand lobbying issue, answer legislative societal. can't say ""it's corporations fault, act differently"".) FFS want hyperinflation shift global currencies? 

Does anybody Washington DC understand happened imperial Spain? We're following sustainable track. rights trampled daily people meant paid prevent exactly they're doing. I'll shut get rights too. things improving call opposition pessimists want lockdown forever. things getting worse, imply people whose opinions validated celebrating. old dance different season. 700 million! Nice They're putting warnings Batman movies anymore? still thing  hard. since March city first case community spread. masks available everywhere. Freaking Manly Man culture problem. mean I‚Äôm trying respond giant wall text basically sums stating everything I‚Äôm typing invalid Thanks solid information. even Oxford vaccine available December barely help January/February. also Utah, many Utahns aren‚Äôt taking seriously. That‚Äôs probably hospitals hitting limit. Plague caravan sounds like conspiracy theory.

Also ‚Äúalmost 100%‚Äù chance originating somewhere else bold statement make without citing source Can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost November, feels like forever since I‚Äôve around group people without worried/anxious. winter going tough, top cold it‚Äôs gonna get lonely repetitive, sleep wake up, study, workout rinse repeat. can‚Äôt wait life get back normal! know much easier most, got apt cat man days gets gotta vent Buddy think voted second ballot came, got another thing coming. family comes long line defeating fascists. even get started. Where's EU coordinated help ?

It doesnt sound much like 'union' like 'every country itself' Good points around ya, perhaps really needed though thoughts:

1) trials wait enough people placebo group get infected organically correlate success real thing one.

2) confidence overall effectiveness certainly beneficial (more) risk populations overall study diversity, including convincing sign participate, harder.

3) confidence general good thing here, especially given contentious nature vaccine. knows, people might even rally around bit.

While it‚Äôs super fast already said, could make even weeks faster / little trusted, that‚Äôs material. ya, perhaps that‚Äôs big if. calls every day say that. think forgetful.

""Thanks mom, know!""

""OK dear, wanted make sure. Tell grandkids children can't get it, hope they'll visit soon. Love all!"" really paying attention convo, you...?

What makes believe specific definiton correct question. 

You asserting definition correct ignoring defined mathematically. lack population cooperation root problems entire planet...

Gatorfan Fair enough. apply dining. However still doesnt state anything presumption os one reason.

Its interesting much ignore comments respond to. address correct points trued pretend write? even true, virus well known west January. Sept. 25, 2020 -- Anthony Fauci, MD, says talk second wave coronavirus premature United States still dealing first one.

The idea second wave based 1918 flu pandemic, many cases seen spring, says. spring cases ""literally disappeared"" followed spike flu cases fall, told CNN‚Äôs Sanjay Gupta, MD, Thursday online conversation organized Emory University.

‚ÄúRather say, ‚ÄòA second wave,‚Äô don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄòAre prepared challenge fall winter?‚Äô‚Äù said Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases member White House coronavirus task force.

Flu shots important measure help U.S. get winter, said.

He health care professionals observed Southern Hemisphere light flu season, probably measures curb coronavirus, social distancing mask-wearing, limited spread flu.

""If listen public health measures, would diminish effect COVID-19, might get away very, light flu season combine getting flu vaccine,"" Fauci said.

In separate interview, said arrival coronavirus vaccine stop need tried-and-true measures mask-wearing, hand-washing, social distancing.

In Facebook Live conversation New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Fauci said coronavirus vaccine 100% effective won‚Äôt taken entire population. means virus could still spread.

""So vaccine comes, look important tool supplement public health measures do,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt allow us quickly less stringency get back degree normal. going eliminate need prudent careful public health measures.‚Äù

Fauci said vaccinating 75% 80% population ‚Äúwould really good accomplishment.‚Äù expects 700 million doses produced end year early 2021. doubt will. lot polish family US thinking hoax imagine think Poland. Big red line go wheeeee flu supposed pretty bad last winter reason got flu shot (hadn't one least 15-20 years). I'm getting year's shot later today. control virus plans, shutdowns, bring economy down.

This! Ah yes, 2020, get pass literally evil. Ffs bar humanity used good human, 'well evil people'. go back saving respect actually good humans? really hard work Fox news, I've done successfully every single day entire life. No? would care? better yet, earth care? Unfortunately EU never given power deal kinds things centrally, great mistake. world

I'm actually wondering big bullet humanity dodged original SARS hit Asia instead west. shit 10% mortality rate. Every country involved SARS scare happens fine right now. Covid-19 hit, fell back SARS protocols, took shit really seriously. We've similar contact tracing app use Canada months now. personal information entered shared. done bluetooth signal. app generates random code exchanges codes phones people nearby also app. checks intensity/strength exchanged signal help determine proximity close signal long. app connects database checks random codes near reported Covid positive. are, alerts potentially exposed gives instructions next steps.

Two things people seem complaining about. One, government saying people may downloading app running, small percentage people update app special covid positive code would alert others. second complaint notification exposed bit vague. Sometimes says ""exposed last 14 days"" necessarily give date know were.

Still, one helpful tools. People use though work. Hospitals extra emergency wing use pandemics they‚Äôre capacity whatever reason. work essential job, provide material support hospitals. Ive 3 hours sleep night last 6 months tired heart hurts. 

I fight mind, whether feeling bitter normal emotion. friends make twice three times make, work home. listen podcasts drive work people Los Angeles making 55k month Patreon complaining hard quarantine them. talking stress eating catered barbeque next sentence.

Im angsty teen, first time feel pure anger. feel anger everyone complains upper middle class bubble, feel anger kids living home lecturing me, feel anger stupid hero praise empty meant nothing. Doctors heros, vast health care logistical apparatus cannon fodder.

I got covid working spent month agony, got government support lost wages, went back work immediately.

I dont fault people security financially have, ability work home. feel angry, know stupid feel way. 

I saw comic pandemic started, mocking people saying ""we together"" ""learn new hobby"". People balconies condos singing supporting dead bodies street symbolically tossed vans. put perspective me. trying find point want put fridge like sort cynicism totem.

We privileged wealthy controlling narrative, one cares stressed Dollar Tree employee trying feed kids. infuriating. always hear hard someone famous, everyone cries favorite millionaire gets sick. people like Joe Rogan making ass downplaying everything turning machismo thing gets go mansion night knowing safe.

Sorry rant,but post struck chord accurate was. Many podcasters people entertainment used enjoy lost good will.

Right nothing want sit bar eat pizza drink 4 beers. sick this, hope get sometime next 2 years. laughing, honest say believe real. think possible something like could happen lifetime, want real, scary. info got released, realized real, March arrived country went lockdown people got sick, died.

Mon, October 26, 2020, 12:01 PM GMT-4¬∑3 mins read

The U.S. well third peak coronavirus, marking new record daily cases 83,000 weekend.

The total case count surpassed 8.6 million death toll rose 225,000. Globally, 43 million affected 1.1 million dead.

In recent days, experts reports referred third wave, others refer either elongated first wave second wave.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, nation‚Äôs top infectious disease expert, settled debate Monday annual Markets Summit.

‚ÄúI look elongated ‚Äî exacerbation ‚Äî original first wave,‚Äù Fauci said.

He explained Northeast able reduce outbreak, national baseline never fell manageable number like 10,000 cases per day. Instead it‚Äôs stayed high 20,000 cases per day.

In addition, areas chose open initial brief national lockdown, states follow strict guidelines.

‚ÄúWe started see peak brought us around 70,000 per day,‚Äù Fauci said, adding that, ‚ÄúNow we're getting cold weather, came back worst we've ever had, 80,000 per day.‚Äù

We‚Äôve never really waves sense good baseline. It‚Äôs wavering down. now, we‚Äôre highest baseline. ... [It‚Äôs] kind semantics. want call third wave extended first wave. matter look it, it‚Äôs good news,‚Äù added.

A similar debate ensued summer, many pointing surge hitting parts country yet unaffected, thereby making first wave. experts say used interchangeably, others say differentiation actually local national levels.

Fauci also said boils semantics.

‚ÄúYou want call third wave extended first wave, matter look it, good news,‚Äù said.

Dr. Shira Doron, infectious disease physician Tufts Medical Center echoed Fauci's declaration elongated first wave.

‚ÄúOnly looking back shape curve truly call something peak wave. It‚Äôs also important mention overall U.S. graph looks different individual state graphs,‚Äù Doron said.

‚ÄúThe U.S. whole, however, never declined low levels first peak, people say still ‚Äòfirst wave,‚Äô‚Äù said.

‚ÄúOverall, think it‚Äôs matter semantics something scientific.‚Äù ""people getting virus"" news? know February spread inevitable restrictions space spread along time ease hospitals? problem hospitals, problem doctors nurses. health system limping along decades staff overworked nearing retirement one replace them. using quick example. referring placing impetuous individual rather enacting meaningful global change transferring cleaner energy developing implementing sustainable practices cut Co2.

Instead blame put individuals ‚Äúrecycle!‚Äù which, yeah , should, much larger meaningful change could happen legislative industrial level saying article horseshit, immediately make point does. value individual privacy* saving lives compatriots. apparently don't.

They do. Reason Japan's tracing system quite poor. That's point article making. rather pointing towards better specified definition would news cartographers.

The North-South Korea border effectively impenetrable, coastline. basically impossible reach Korea land. means purposes context, South Korea island Taiwan. can't afford can. difference priorities, afforded.

We who? definitely afford than, say, Germany, France Netherlands, metropolitan areas commuter belts spanning across international borders, shutting borders would mean factories may physically able keep running would end missing components so. That's rushed reopen borders soon could spring. live, people outdoors following mask mandates somewhat.

Indoors, wear masks chins noses say something say, ""I *am* wearing mask."" try avoid businesses minute two. business small enclosed space lot less air, leave immediately. business owners want lose business make effort keep customers safe enforcing masking actually _is_ making, pretend masking.

This America, vote money well ballot box.

I'm going engage risky behavior even President United States tells it. has, irresponsibly. lot medical staff risk population world, start get vaccinated, already starting help society. also stocked February case - find likely would needed, better safe sorry. hospital carpark ?  Hi all, sore throat, congestion, fatigue shortness breath. got tested morning won‚Äôt receive results 2-10 days wife want quarantine long. worked home today really needs office. What‚Äôs best way protect others building? office bathroom imagine help situation. mask careful touching surfaces? Thanks!  read comment spoke employees together. understand exists people owners consumers you? get workers also breathe air right? Possibly taking public transportation, dealing children/siblings school/daycare, things could cause employee contagious.

Also, enough people consuming keep business. Thats zero customers. serve people (who individually larger risks since they're kind thing), spread covid, still business fail.

Neither commenter said there'd customers. adequate keep business open. RATM one best concert I've ever to. 2010 palladium. People think vaccines mean need social distance wear masks misinformed. Coincidence equal causation. virus nightmare everyone mate. I'm unsympathetic people's situation here, everyone lives disrupted. I'm making way less money due mess make lot.of cut backs. Declaration accepted, rejected Absolutely. Losing job business awful. losing life family's, I'm sorry there's comparison. Removed rule 1. post content incites violence. different things, neither ever recommended public health. Sorry can't stop eating out.
Could please go working sick?
Truly great soceity. govt ignored science medical advice...no one saw coming. Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Dude two months ago. There's definite correlation. sole reason, schools universities started back up, sure hell plays part.  concept simple, even old boomer Governor understand, yet keep issue.

You get virus, virus takes 1-2 weeks. Anything takes 1-2 weeks show results. Wait hospital full, cases 1-2 weeks. hard? take makes absolutely sense, least USA. many people think fall groups? couple instances Transverse Myelitis.... ""insufficient evidence say certain"" caused vaccine. Truth told first vaccine I'm probably waiting Moderna Pfizer one thr first round complete. Even health care workers know saying might hold taking it.

Edit. I'm talking AstraZeneca Ireland back since last week August person. rates shooting government insists schools hotbeds it. feasible reasonable. Trump last January ""Vaccine soon""... foreigner racism

Xenophobia?   ""near"" isnt specific, adding lockdown measures early exactly comparable nations done. Australia shutdown hit 300/cases per day Victoria. Germany reinstated curfews, followed suit far capacity. Well, viewing humans potential health threat basically concept behind this. definitely good mentally.

I saying necessary, easy costly. never spike here. Back April could walk ERs ghost towns. nothing short hell now. yet people still ignore virus keep partying... judge giving order nothing suggestion? wow Hope too.

Hope though it‚Äôs wildly different spot here.  El Paso joke. Avarice plentiful Hospitals Providence El Paso mention El Paso mayor re-election. dire effort trying acquiesce whatever he‚Äôs told sad accentuates desperate votes. economic development plan debacle, unfortunately population apathetic towards public affairs don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre getting screwed over. want rain parade, winter coming.

Not Australia. Summer coming. started mention that, realized without reading lot more. matter time till hits waco that. heard climate change? China non-Western countries continue necessary. 

It‚Äôs West problem. people unhappy response wanted continue life normal. sure Paso curfew (9pm 6am)

Right forgot virus virulent night compared daytime. easy keep rounding corners ever go circles. infected Republicans.

Can't say that's surprising... gotta work

Also employers either COVID hoaxers simply supply means keep employees customers safe.

Virus care that. bodies replicate inside lungs shred pieces.

But that's mention evil fuckers keep bringing kids Walmart, like wtf. got several adults family still take germy kids jump aisles supermarkets?  Fuck, sit car ffs. Person staten island celebrating Jersey... really lol that's seems like disconnect ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand actions affects others :C‚Äù weeks ago, New York Times medical correspondent Donald McNeil Jr. Daily talking doctors getting experience treating covid thus chances survival getting (marginally) better, seemed skip part people can't get treated can't get hospital. Ireland jumped Level 5 5 restrictions Wednesday last week daily infections reached 1200, lower total US rate per capita right now. poor idiots, vote me""   still message....and pretty typical GOP. shackles fit..... That‚Äôs I‚Äôm getting worried about. live airlift people Albuquerque, Lubbock, El Paso anything major. nearing capacity. terrifying it‚Äôs ramping back up. rest winter store?  would like give credit government people California (not OC, riverside, LA counties), constantly demonized right wing US, acting long reached point stood data gathering acted real time. rain coming down. someone's coughing face, virus moving horizontally. That's difference. Thanksgiving rolls turkey leg around corner... happens places airlifting people run beds themselves? mean. whole country capacity... Exactly. Thanks backup. :) live Texas watch blue birds take Mexico medical trips. Hell bet least half Mexican DRs train US, Canada, EU. also 300 million people world can't afford every city like new york beginning pandemic. that's heading. beginning flu season. can't afford run ppe now. thought things get insane...

they need go lockdown. vaccine sadly. way contain short shutting entire world down. always someone even vaccine least case El Paso, don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. live it‚Äôs very, democratic city. one listening since beginning, summer curve started go people started caring even less. People don‚Äôt care it. Never underestimate rights stupidity complete lack care fellow American Keeping distance (compared pre-COVID) others avoid transmitting/contracting disease =/= scared people. places social distancing enforcement also allow groups 5-50 meet up. That's certainly example avoiding people.

All people go beyond congregate overly crowded places. That's hard. glad Anastasiya keeping borders locked anticipation NSW meltdown... This.

* knuckle head redditors.
* knuckle head conservatives.
* knuckle head liberals.

that said another lockdown would happen......

There recurring Local, State, Federal lockdowns long crazy folk follow simple _________ rules.

When American mentions ""it affects freedom"". really mean ""I can't go buy Starbucks, McDonald's, go bull___."" examples ""fun"".

You wanna stop thing, kill ""fun"" place severe limit activities people do. Keep get it.

If people can't handle ""bored"", problem.

People need understand important. Everyone important. Everyone must thier part. need WORK TOGETHER, WHETHER LIKE NOT. time adults. politicized it.

Republicans politicized it. Trump politicized it. everything right months deserve blame. lying. There‚Äôs absolutely way. Haven‚Äôt seen grandparents months. grandpa surgery can‚Äôt even visit him. Fuck disease man. civilized world acted months happened. first I‚Äôm hearing this. reliable sources? [Trump‚Äôs campaign made stops nationwide. Coronavirus cases surged wake least five LOL  site church friends read doesn‚Äôt even corona menu even searching coronavirus us, doesn‚Äôt stories USA. Red Cross really hasn‚Äôt made difference throughput. Before, they‚Äôd take appointment wait hour people would get fed leave. they‚Äôre tune reality. Either way 4 donation stations whole blood that‚Äôs bottleneck. people either hoping avoid (denying they‚Äôll need it) can‚Äôt get backing make happen things reach breaking point. Remember 15 days stop spread? Pepperidge Farm remembers. sounds lot like Califiornia. ok considering population density every time go buy groceries unmasked buffoon wants sign petition recall Newsome. Imagine federal response complete utter failure, could hire millions people sit home (if even one point) work needed things desperately need. think could avoided people would wear mask instead fuckwits Hang El Paso, 10 days! Trump said yesterday fake lockdowns suddenly end election day! People even inconvenience *slightest* little bit wearing mask minutes indoors. Meaningful change mitigate climate change require enormous action everyone, WAY inconvenient little mask. 

The east coast could literally go water 30% country would call liberal hoax. pretty screwed. matter. point matter government have, nobody stopping wuhan virus rn. Click buttons yourself, everybody currently recently sucking wind 

Nah man. country 26 million people little 200 active cases nation wide. second wave, one state got bad 700 new cases per day, thanks strong, compassionate, competent left wing government making tough unpopular decisions, managed get 0 new cases day.

Also, pretty telling actually find democratic left-leaning government whose country handling worse. petition moment headed former prime minister royal commission ensure media diversity. Currently less 400k signatories, honestly doubt lead anything Murdoch much power Australia. 

If australian, please sign petition worth shot. Actually he's quite popular lot hispanics ironically enough. live think people would hate hispanics tend conservative (am hispanic), lot people actually die hard cult members GOP. Adapt die. generally survival works mate. Proven true millions years evolution. I‚Äôm high risk coworkers either high risk caretakers elderly/high risk parents. normally lot fun work it‚Äôs scary lately. thought couldn‚Äôt get worse hit 400 new cases one day, last week one day 1,000 cases day.

It's definitely messed many people choice, even terrifying COVID simply care virtue morals. gets bodies reproduce in. [http://www.epcounty.com/documents/Order-No-12.pdf](http://www.epcounty.com/documents/Order-No-12.pdf) I‚Äôm thanking lucky stars Labor government power Victoria, god help us fucking Libs/Nats charge dealing COVID. They‚Äôd spent time auctioning hospitals highest bidder bulldozing rainforests pRoTeCt jObS. 

If NSW spike watch quickly Gladys corrupt cronies spin control, little scrutiny ‚Äúmedia‚Äù subject if, god forbid, hundreds even thousands die watch. Yet Trump's chief staff literally said today ""we're going control pandemic. going control fact we're going get vaccines, therapeutics, medications.""

If Trump voted coming week, think there's repairing faith country right thing. opinion general electorate never recover. *have* believe fellow Americans right thing. Old people vote republican even crawl nails ballot box advocate lying regard. Sorry FDA ass backwards. OMG. time Trump's Coronavirus Federal plan? Yes ok, quite common theme (and common anywhere btw, America). seemed stronger that. 328 ICU beds total first place. Please let happen. I've worked hard get job finally finished school year. Please... want move parents house Oh yeah driving gym workout 11pm theres like 2 3 people wearing mask, social distancing using sanitizer crusing around el Paso car gonna spread covid... Really app something automated. Even they're even trying, feasible call many cases. father still thinks covid gonna disappear November 3rd matter tell him, says everyone lies people dying covid hospitals get money, honestly wonder he's gonna react election day. want talk smack packers, feel bad them.

What year. Hoping best Wisconsin.

Election 2 weeks away it‚Äôll forgotten matter outcome. People aren‚Äôt long term issues... people can‚Äôt get reinfected. seems it‚Äôs right flu far CFR. That's happened China, Vietnam, South Korea New Zealand. fatigue problem government problem, thinking Summer virus would controled, naive prepare winter. end day people frustrated throwing parties, wearing masks pretending thing doesn‚Äôt exist.

I'd argue also frustrated power lack material internal health efforts never emulating aggressive precautions adopted almost entire East back February/March‚Äîand *still* failing so. think now, Americas Europe would carefully observe consistent low daily case increases countries SK, China, Singapore, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam, etc. figure ways mirror methods save hundreds thousands deaths, millions hospitalisations, tens millions infections. 

Now large portion people willingly confined homes since March protect others another large portion partying, dining out, never wearing masks, pretending exist, etc. mentioned. Also requires refrigeration leaders like pzifer moderna need negate 80 deep freezers pandemic type epidemic spread across large number countries. France referring themselves, albeit noting much Europe also lost control. trump Ok doctor lol. idea talking about. Please troll elsewhere makes perfect sense vaccinate people first; *is* enough, understand would stop.

You argue herd immunity healthy 50s relatively harmless them, might right ‚Äî about:

1. proportion vulnerable people refuse vaccination, can't vaccinated, vaccine effective?
2. effective vaccine response, faded time (however long might be);
3. small number younger people experience unexpected complications?
4. International travellers might denied entry destination unless vaccinated?

&amp;#x200B;

If, Easter, 25% population (of ages) infected half vaccine, 50% remainder vaccine 80% effective (a good result) ‚Äî end 55% population immunity, meaning could effective transmission rate 2.2 therefore still condemned social distancing rampant pandemic 20% population infected.

If antibodies vaccination last long enough herd immunity take root wider population, absolutely screwed. point, though, still going cause lot economic health suffering could avoided vaccination. I'm glad I've always homebody. Makes lot easier me. response confronted evidence. vote. surprise. put cloth mask exaust change regularly better nothing. Like blue cured metric plague inc LOL, many stupid observations. Culture, intellectuals, protests, obedience. know nothing, you?

&amp;#x200B;

Europe worse many countries there's contact tracing anymore. Italy stopped ten days ago enough tracers state mandated software work; even active popolous regions. bars restaurants take measures seriously; couple days ago I've seen small restaurants packed people, distancing.

&amp;#x200B;

In England able process al tests, on. country many solvable problems. culture. Wow, source 5% claim? 

At point everyone must feeling personally bad. Right wing politicians unfortunately mastered art ""It me!"" followers go along that. 6-12 months roll out. Let‚Äôs hope get start January. Okay, confectionary alcohol aisles open? 2021 get far worse 2020, matter vaccine available not.

The moment there's vaccine available, huge spike cases people actually understand vaccines work. People think prioritizing public health profit ""Tory policy"" bane left wing. guy protest Tory policy, he's even worse idiot thought. moment India mentioned thread goes racist comments. want find racist jerks thread, drop India name ;) US shit like got roasted world (rightfully so) yet Europe seems getting away much criticisim. sums experience American lived Japan.

I‚Äôm doctor means, don‚Äôt see social distancing much issue vaccine couple months. masks whole different issue. definitely agree probably effect end 2021 like said. Lol nah lot people saying stuff like much worse without sarcastic. 

But good know were:p rOuNdING cORoNer Im sure accusing forgetting? Ive two lockdowns neither promised two weeks. presume countries would advised same, need longer time reduce infections (For infection theres incubation period, period virus present testing till virus cleared)

As economic social destruction, yes happening - anyone wants to, believed less harmful, know - people dying.

NB Theres talk two week lockdown UK thats expectation stop virus, havent read much it. can't even prescribed PreP viral load all, I'm confused point making. test HIV initially even get prescribed, get tested every three months. even rare case got infected initial blood test registered viral load, would still register subsequent tests. 

The fact is, taking PreP years tested regularly HIV can't transmit it. almost, if, U.S. quarantined beforehand. 


Who could've thought. Unrealistic? I'm sure back 2015 said it'd unrealistic Trump elected good American heart would come together time crisis.

Sorry nhilism won. Same, want visit theme park without screens, masks etc. Next that, festivals missed those. year...m That's illegal NSL super impressive got false negative rate 7%. Top quality lab work! dont even know what's happening china, information come go china without review government.

And NZ, Australia Island nations, much easier seclude people island shutting airplanes boats literally instantly stops travel country. facetious goddam, poor kid. facetious complained things first months lockdown people made fun ganged me. quite interesting sudden people start complain others wearing masks keeping distance. months? busy watching Netflix believing everything alright despite fact majority population care all? guess so.

It's always thing, people realize something wrong damage already done - best. 2021 get *far* worse 2020, matter vaccine available not. majority population bunch stupid selfish assholes. UK need goods services apart food lockdown. import food, mean import people. 

Again, something new. Quarantine invented middle ages. stop international trade either. trump said surge done Texas Florida. said presidential debate must true They‚Äôre not. spikes cases attributed COVID fatigue private gatherings schools. People grown tired told can‚Äôt governments(this isn‚Äôt exclusive US btw), they‚Äôre whatever want regardless perceived risk. 

I can‚Äôt find article moment, read one overwhelming majority people tested positive confirmed private gathering home somebody else‚Äôs home prior getting virus. 

People aren‚Äôt taking precautions people living mentality ‚Äúwell haven‚Äôt gotten x months this, probably won‚Äôt‚Äù careless. You‚Äôre probably right haven‚Äôt studies done it. Yup - Manhattan pretty dense, people forget four boroughs NYC! way catch early transmission without testing

China basically beat virus blind.

The virus genome sequenced mid-January, China able begin develop testing facility. time enough testing capacity February, infection Wuhan already mostly gone. part problem, dude. anyone suspects reinfected? once? makes think so? better subreddit ask question? Health Organization says covid IFR 0.5% 1%. working memory older estimates (a 0.8-1.55% sticks head reason). Whether IFR actually going earlier estimates saw flawed can't say. memory might glitched.

Don't confuse IFR CFR. Case fatality rate (CFR) deaths per confirmed case. IFR death per infection, obviously estimating total infected given asymptomatic cases people report getting sick. CFR much higher, accurate (we know many people reported infected) less useful predicting total deaths. guess it‚Äôs really nothing special, see picture countries, no? What‚Äôs that? Sweden issues. Hmm, odd. 

No, countries people dying delayed cancer treatments 12th highest per capita deaths world. 

Not terms overall mortality, matters unless complete tunnel vision. Leopards hungry right now. [See guys later, I'm That‚Äôs open attack US rightly so. Well yea, lock people several months time, that's happens. Yeah that‚Äôs problem. Better long term modest measures. Maybe dial quickly. Unless like China test 5mm days getting 100% rid seems unlikely. Fair enough. totally agree best way stop initial outbreak keep good contact tracing etc. slow spread. It‚Äôs I‚Äôve seen people Reddit claiming need regular lockdowns ‚Äúcircuit breakers‚Äù every time cases get high. think lockdowns good method reducing cases keep using long term solution okay provide temporary fix Well ready available everywhere two different things.

Turns though it‚Äôs bit difficult European countries completely isolate outside world. long triage begins? genuinely happy far fewer ports entry points lock fewer inter-city movements. Thus fewer cases contain first place. gives fuck, says White House. I'd wager already that. France we're 50k day confirmed, doctors saying real figure closer 100k contaminations per day. I'd say US worse judging hear hospitals lack testing there. France tests 1.2million per 5 day week. one yet, many articles website (associated TV channel) found mean, makes sense. Big cities (NYC, LA, Chicago) early spikes international travel. spiked rural areas middle country. we‚Äôre spiking across board first spike clearly travel-related‚Äîbig cities dense hubs travel. 

That‚Äôs probably part China failed contain first place. Wuhan what, 11 million people? COVID-19 hit rural area China may able suppress it.

I'm glad vestiges EU regards regulatory bodies still place UK Conservatives enough time dilute/fuck up. Gives hope Oxford virus.

I'd still happy enough American Pfizer Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, Trump's push hydrochloroquine ultimate inefficacy, I'd doubts Moderna vaccine believe investments there, hopefully I'm mistaken though. last night one klan rallies, trump saying saved 'mill-yuns mill-yuns lives Yep daily cases already started drop week hospitalisations hopefully follow suit pretty least, check patients' social media deciding gets bill covered govt pay pocket aiding abetting ridiculous mess. people scream ""socialism"" also going demand bills get covered government, guarantee it. oh surprise Could elaborate that? agree, although think bigger problem people wear masks running errands wear around friends extended family. widely reported spread coming small, maskless gatherings. Imo, governments everywhere must better job encouraging people find middle ground giving locking down.

I think real difference US want talk ""policies controlled 100% strong central government work. Patchwork policies handled states failed."" also good job health insurance. 

When people say this, realize insurance subsidizes healthcare premiums people pay well. ""fuck you, got mine got yours."" Yes, have. What‚Äôs hard believe this? Man, there‚Äôs hope sub lmao? Obviously society isn‚Äôt going immediately return normal vaccine released, 2021 reasonable timeframe things start return normal, already development vaccine coronavirus particular strain started spread. I‚Äôm going trust companies know they‚Äôre wouldn‚Äôt release vaccine didn‚Äôt think effective truly cared friends family would willing sacrifice seeing person however long takes keep dying completely preventable death. know someone dies covid hospital aren‚Äôt allowed family around comfort go? That‚Äôs want loved ones? people careful ‚Äúliving fear.‚Äù No, I‚Äôm cautious not. I'll try you. I'm glad asked! quite simple, really. see, main objective blood bank create safe effective blood products patients. Therefore, potential donors people think nothing medically wrong them. Otherwise, person thinks there's chance might infectious disease, self-defer, seek medical treatment. person chooses donate get free test, donated blood risk falsely testing negative, since test 100% perfect. infected blood given patient. blood bank work, allow donors come get free test. BS. Still working troll farm, imagine Hmm, lived Japan, friends bars Osaka. Japanese would certainly wear masks nearly universally requested, don‚Äôt eating drinking. Bars restaurants never closed, weeks limited hours.
Additionally, masks help complete barrier would allow hyper dense elderly country like Japan barely close anything almost deaths. 
Seems pretty likely story E Asia much complex merely using ethno-stereotypes like ‚Äòcompliance‚Äô explain. talking 100% death baby, mother. get COVID rate, divided global deaths 1.5m total cases 43m ( according google presented, realize it‚Äôs much nuanced generalizing). Thank comment US gave like 1.2 billion dollars Oxford help develop vaccine operation warp speed.

Moderna working mRNA vaccine technology like decade used develop COVID vaccine using funding operation warp speed.

Pfizer, J&amp;J, AstraZeneca using vaccine methods use studied decades.

If regulators don‚Äôt rush approval (which FDA said do), OK. 

I hope Trump loses, operation warp speed isn‚Äôt ‚Äúoperation vaccinate everyone election Trump get elected.‚Äù It‚Äôs giving funding multiple vaccine candidates ramping manufacturing capacity well approval head start vaccine approved. Every developed country capacity make vaccine something similar. 

This pretty boneheaded comment. pure 100% undiluted copium. Here's justifying inaction SK ""culturally makes laugh people trot South Korea example somewhere could emulate. Culturally completely different, contact tracing system they've built 20 years, massive invasions privacy would simply unacceptable Western electorate (hence western country anything remotely like it).

Keep huffing cope, admit people given embrace coronavirus. March, Fauci CDC telling US residents wear masks 

In early March that's true. end March changed tune. would helpful know many ICU beds normally are. usually 15? so, 13 bad. usually 90, yeah, 13 bad. complicated explain import. like said, ""too hard know"" pile me. prefer stay safe sorry. 

there real political angle keeping zero transmission message low testing reinforce. certainly possible local transmission exports cases fake? china, japan, Philippines, france others places. 

does taiwan test everyone admitted hospital? (it standard protocol HK got cases went un related procedures.) upvoted think heartwarming story, people need see shit still killing people, regardless restaurants bars open not, regardless individual #1's claim we're rounding corner, regardless soon vaccines might available. plenty people still think it‚Äôs fake. 


Hence repeat Wuhan.  worse since DonnyT plan manage Rona main problem course non-COVID patients stop needing go hospital lockdown. whole point lockdowns avoid situation someone dying due disease-state injury otherwise would've treatable going untreated beds hospital taken up. misspelled ""rich people"" bad adenovirus circulating flu season. muh freedom tho. pretend Asian countries live actual dictatorship (which makes easier force people distance, wear masks get tested) would quite naive. 
 
And Asian countries democracies? Authoritarianism prerequisite public distancing, testing mask wearing. think many people spent 7 months holed house? think that‚Äôs many East Asian countries haven‚Äôt hit quite hard, even little social distancing minimal lockdowns - people started wearing masks early pandemic I‚Äôm assuming helped keep baseline infection numbers low enough situation didn‚Äôt spiral control. That, fact China, Hong Kong, Singapore, S. Korea adopted invasive tracking forced quarantine infected individuals wouldn‚Äôt fly Europe North America. Lmao that‚Äôs perfect Satire died. intentional. negligent intention. imagine somebody going around telling people take pants off? Humans selfish nature. Protecting society often increase odds survival, someone elses. 


I see wanting vaccines often. calculated risk - first foremost - people take (protected ""herd immunity"") based chances contract disease severe could be. 


For Covid-19 easily see young people taking vaccine incredibly low risk them. believe flu vaccination numbers somewhere 10-20%. 
Given IFR C19 based latest data 0.23% heavy flu seasons estimated around 0.1-0.2%, easily make case proportional vaccination rates let's say 25-40% C19. saw pretty harrowing images make shift hospitals texas border towns. people short memories. late. We‚Äôve trying communicate people years. Advanced willful ignorance malice. people choose every single day lives educate themselves. room sympathy. believe everyone reform try hard enough. they‚Äôre fucking killing us. They‚Äôre literally killing us. can‚Äôt afford try change anymore. stopped. What? What's problem? ‚ÄúNobody forcing work‚Äù

London around 15m metropolitan region, think. comment social distance, though, continuation life without lockdown. officially 2-metre distancing policy, people tend ignore within groups. Restaurants coffee shops mostly remained open restrictions central Seoul. Generally things hummed along quietly. course, 90+% people wear masks public, another major difference. 

It shows important isolate cases trace contacts. local provinces done amazing job disseminating information cases emerging locally. gives locals confidence threat levels hotspots. know UK nothing even comes close. 

It makes laugh people seem think government abusing human rights make system work. Meanwhile UK government forces closure businesses, makes illegal congregate public meet groups, etc., enforces lockdown. far far worse human rights perspective intrusion we've seen contact tracing quarantine. led far higher levels well being. heard garbage Arizona, Texas, Florida. happen.

At point people going accept handle virus? incorrectly assuming population density evenly distributed across continent, vast majority Australia uninhabitable desert, population lies eastern coastline.

We're densely populated means correct saying we're different, comparison highly disingenuous.

Good luck stay safe!! Nope It‚Äôs shame responses Covid reactive proactive

I'd argue even really response much warning. response would involve taking serious measures towards actually enforcing order making sure law enforcement follows that. Besides stimulus program really excuse corporate handouts bunch talking politicians failing see places US, especially somewhere like Texas, could actually considered covid 'response'. 

Sorry I'm trying pedantic agree completely shameful Id say shame response complete lack thereof. kind movies? Pornos? taking Covid seriously. Come on. Fauci: ""Masks effective""

This man putting blind faith in, yet providing single citation back it. spoke volumes inability so. ""For accessing essential services, *only one person per family member* allowed""

One person per family member?  I'm trying find way sentence works.. surely meant one person per family wear 3M respirator eyepro go big stores. many maskless. So, Everyone wears masks live feel like big misunderstanding constitution kids risking going get it. (parents) gotten also ones go (once week groceries). wfh go socially feel pretty safe. exposed others regular basis, masked not, think probably get flu shot.

But really go all, might better taking chance.

Copying paid one comments somewhere thing consider too, herd immunity, never, **never** occurred naturally infectious disease humans without vaccines. one taken seriously suggests letting ‚Äúburn through‚Äù anyone best ignorant worst stunningly callous, selfish, cold hearted. Based infection rate covid (which still don‚Äôt know) something like 75% - 90% people would develop immunity effectively stop virus. Like said, one hardest hit places world 4%, we‚Äôre likely even less. Millions would entire concept developing herd immunity population factor many people vaccinate, effective vaccine is, effectiveness vaccine campaign. full stop. nowhere crazy actually relatively cheap popular area housing limited far away. situation feels like needs able pay cash upfront chance getting since houses go market quickly. matter wins loses. US screwed politically.

If loses Biden wins, Americans act like go back complacent anything. 2022 roll around Republicans win Senate House make Biden's life hell. 2024, Trump's appointee win. Rinse repeat. hear ya.

I hope things get better you. Sicker, selfish, non compliant, belligerent anywhere else. OP deal them. Inflation occur instantly soon new money created there's usually lag year think everybody wears masks open indoor gathering large gathering businesses need restrictive lockdowns can't partial compliance masks social distancing top also indoor gatherings large gatherings.

So calling lockdown really restrictive effective even restrictive vast majority workforce still employed going work either essential workers working home. Even restrictive parts lockdown essential workers massive part workforce everything grocery store people medical workers lawn garden guys construction workers. essential tons tons kept working pandemic. place shut really pretty small segment economy. Things like bars clubs sporting events may popular public, they're necessary probably amazingly profitable cases managing large venues probably keeps profit margins lower side. Seems like public transit present bit different problem, that's mitigatable well. reasonable mass compliance state really kind problems seem kind second third way. need get math squaring social distancing make people ask politely though try first. Months ago like government approved masks sent everybody something. people wearing bandanas s*** pandemic 2020. masks really work, social distancing really works, ventilate indoor areas that's going help. people taking basic steps even require high science understand, there's bad stuff air y'all, cover mouth, open windows, get near people. hard understand really work.

Even calling restrictive lockdown might still 80% workforce working, really work home plus essential workers vast majority economy.

You situation segment industries impacted especially badly trickle overall economy fact countries still get 80% workforce working without facing extreme deflation. 

On hand overwhelming hospitals point everyone coronavirus can't go hospital creates level panic lower standard living probably worse economy losing 15% workforce need public gatherings business models work. 

**In short worth freaking 80 85% people employed productive filling hospitals attempt employ 15 20%.**

That's situation like means majority people work even pandemic represent vast majority workforce probably going continue favor social distancing mask mandates mitigation efforts still allow economy function.

At time businesses made least changes business model work new reality cases may find changes beneficial long-term even without pandemic. It‚Äôs definitely 2 week range. many times Trump said something going happen ‚ÄúIn next two weeks‚Äù never came fruition, never called it?  Yeah. weird hell. say wish area too. 2-3 month quarantine back spring/early summer best times. get judged staying home became good citizen. talked people instead boring parties drinking bars. country president like trump deserves called stupid. Plus Americans revel barely speaking one language correctly. Sorry that‚Äôs triggering Yes difference island mostly sparsely populated maintain shutting borders like New Zealand parts Canada. countries (or states) reduced numbers following lockdown well, soon restrictions relax they're fucked again. hoax sense believed Democrats exaggerating threat hurt politically. course know ruse based conversation Woodward explained serious threat COVID time going saying concern hoax.

/s funny spouse cut drinking 75% staying home. Unfortunately, eating increased 50% year constantly gets worse feel grateful small benefit. I'm serious? How? mask mandate private business 100% enforceable. doesnt seems like it. So, instead prickk prove enforceable actual legal sources Paso way #69

Nice released preprint studies showed ""robust"" immune response stage 2 test subjects(they produced antibodies people recovered naturally). That's literally data shows vaccine effective enough go forward stage 3. Moderns Pfzier currently doing.

Stage 3 test vaccine works much test vaccine produces bad side effects. needs 50% effective considered good enough.

Moderns vaccinated 20,000 people Pfzier without bad side effects yet.

I know rough year buddy. hang on. got shit. 2020 make stronger. warm weather They've basically chugged bottle vodka.

Ah. Tuesday nights! 230,000 people ""handle virus"" suffered early death people thinking everything okay. Thinking 230,000 early deaths okay called psychopath.

And saying dumb? dirty little secret meat packing industry. overwhelmingly employ individuals commonly live multi generational households many cases riding working together. country question good job mitigating spread COVID, border controls probably make much difference.

So completely contradicted first paragraph. Border controls effective stopping outside travel coming in. already covid running rampant *within* borders, effect that. need much closed borders beat covid. past weekend really hit got down. Cases control state. Combine cold front snow moment I'm pretty down, honest. going long winter...and even started. Unfortunately entirely possible. seems like places planned economies strong social safety systems well, free market shit pants. precisely, free market exactly always does, optimizing profit people's lives. Bolivia order magnitude worst Peru, get many deaths streets like shortage hospital beds months. 

Now new infections deaths decreased lot, average positivity tests around 11% daily deaths around 48. 

Hopefully gets better weeks, although neighboring countries like Argentina rapidly increasing new infections daily, 10 times Peru 7 times daily deaths :/ Seems like we're wave wave wave. much 3rd wave wave^3. Exactly! Things start improve on.

That's equally naive direction.

The vaccine needs approved, needs distributed, needs actually injected require 2 shots roughly month total build immunity. able book 30 million appointments right away. It'll roughly Feb/Mar vaccination starts effect pandemic. next 3-4 months absolutely continue get worse. look headlines overflowing hospitals Texas Idaho.  create, must destroy... Well infected cannot get it. makes sense -.- Back Feb, even though assumed Covid-19 asymptomatic spread, everyone Asia still masked up. made big difference. No, helped other. Things March happened fast, better now. know, e.g., Germany patients Netherlands, France, Italy think Belgium sure winter. also giving lots grants LISC small businesses. people ""done complying"" gambling lives okay it. Hope they're okay consequences actions, too. Folks neighborhood literally planning trick treating year. Like, imagine okay risking illness fukcing candy. people selfish deluded thinking shit like safe. reduce amount spread, eliminate altogether, work everyone follows rules time, happen extended period time.

You can't catch rona video link. people really need *probably* take it. old immune compromised. serious disability *should* access early, I‚Äôll damn well take it. 

Others like (high risk) don‚Äôt take vaccine? choice, consequences. wouldn‚Äôt discuss either. Show going make environment safe numbers need see community order entertain idea bringing kids onto campus. comparison private schools dumb facilities lot control situation terms class sizes,bussing, etc. crazy part point view logical thing would allow schools reopen starting younger kids.
See thing goes case extend reopenings. 200 days school one year, 3 months summer holidays couple weeks winter holidays.
So terrible wait couple weeks?
Could schedule different entry times people would outside time?

They went full one week another sending 7 million students closed spaces masks.. using public transportation exactly people going work would. Everybody time way control ""80% capacity"". cautionary principle. believed tables wheels would stop virus? How? husband it. It‚Äôs waaaaay runny nose us. Unbelievable, fatigue body aches, fevers, chills, complete loss sense taste smell.

Last night chest began feeling tight. 02 sat fell 89%. Headed ER per plan. Chest CT confirmed bilateral infiltrates. got nebulized albuterol oxygen. Sent home same. O2 93-95%. 

Today day five symptoms. doctor told us next five days could real fun games. 298 23rd, no? source this? doubting interested.  I‚Äôve read, apparently yes, literally stuck houses Stupid things mind people constantly. 

That‚Äôs call demand change. Usually lag action (lockdown, curfews, quarantine, masks, etc) reaction numbers bit gestation period covid since unfortunately tests done sick rather pre emptive testing contact tracing. Saw time time Victoria, Australia stringent stages lockdown introduced eased.

This means youll still see ~5 days rising hospitalisation rates ICU beds cover it. Trying run anything active pandemic tough, want anyone's death conscious that's sure. many ways run safely, honest. reason speak stupid - know one thing sure many people lingering symptoms know long-term damaging disease be. Personally, continue courses definitive answers long term issue post infected. dealing something go dormant wake cause chaos - know enough covid-19? would take stance charge protect others power.authoriy. would ensure continue virtual engaging training remotely safely return person. Well, Germany took care Italian, French, currently Dutch patients least. I'm sure countries capacity available. Yeah that's true. really bring doctors outbreak going across entire country. open schools vaccine

Not realistic hold children's education hostage year. think helps explain this, Poland pretty mild first wave. Many neighbours, except Germany, experienced mild 1st wave getting hit harder (in terms active cases deaths). lot people Twitter saying itll disappear election day worldwide scam!! I'm curious, condoms available? Cases going almost every single state US. could say every Biden event well. would argue frail anyway would overdosed died cancer weeks later.

But won't. say horrid. also stoppages trials reviewed 2 people getting health issues could attributed vaccinations. Wonderful, guess I'll stuck basement least one year. weeks? doubt anything besides grocery stores pharmacies open next monday know. know... Guvmint still figured they're seeing infections two weeks prior continue close barn doors horse gone done left. never heard Germany, sadly would surprised much... 

i living close polish border know hospitals atm still take patients abroad. hope start soon!  flu terrible, absolutely right. get vaccination every year preexisting condition could easily kill me, I'm aware that. Covid would eat breakfast sorry gone much physically mentally pandemic. random redditor appreciates do! Doom doom doom dooooom! 
Doom-E Doom-E Doom. look like this: I've never thought minute matter get COVID. Without vaccine, matter taking soon offered me. vaccines absolutely zero risk. even think that. know I'd start now.

Thank perspective. reframing helpful me. mean Mother Nature truly tryna kill us total dumbasses.... case yeah, population control. I‚Äôm glad okay! must relief.

I know someone overweight, 60s, diabetic, tested positive never knew it. downplay things, messaging really must change. important people vaccinated first, people we‚Äôre concerned (grandma, immune compromised, etc).

If you‚Äôre worried yourself, still isolate take precautions. Rlf-100 3rd phase test results coming days. covid killer weve waiting for. vaccine would nice though.

Edit: Im start work 5 min check google, think results coming thursday. vaccines take 10 years fully study, 2 years. spreading love üòî know.

However, everyone's physically psychologically suffering many months end now, looking forward day schools finally open. Overwhelmed parents waiting it, struggling children waiting it. understand virus situation novel all, end date moved far, many times, people looking forward much, compliance pandemic restrictions would decrease. Oof. Conspiracy theories. didn‚Äôt think they‚Äôd science sub. severe 3 month lockdown got control. Every country closed borders. handful contained spread within communities. They‚Äôre still calling fake laughing. I‚Äôm related people. nursing clinicals COVID floor ... family members mine think I‚Äôm lying I‚Äôm part conspiracy.

I‚Äôm state US whose numbers crazy I‚Äôm still surrounded anti-maskers. still think it‚Äôll never happen even though it‚Äôs happening around them. 

It‚Äôs INSANE. [Gamers rise China bioengineered virus. 7 weeks restart US trial compared week elsewhere

Can use data collected internationally pass trials countries? thought phase III trials Brazil enough outbreak prove efficacy. Unless misunderstand separate process took 7 weeks restart. central European government certainly mistake. Sure may beneficial fighting coronavirus, would whole host problems. Testing woeful back March. moment, England/UK around 20,000 reported infections day hospitalisations around 1,000 day. Back March, day shut 700 hospitalisations days later 2,500 3,000 daily basis. around 6,500 testing positive daily basis around time imagine many people actually infected. I'd imagine European countries trying get grip it. Except Greece happens, far I'm aware one European country took seriously back January, predicted pandemic planned accordingly acted early: result taken root Greece anywhere near extent. dont know blocks infection, stunts symptoms contract vacinated. Either work stop pandemic, one better other. 

Even 60% effective, far better allows additonal vaccines treatments come market. We're absolutely fucked won‚Äôt go back forth trying convince you. make mind.  Thank service.

Furthermore, later goes suggest early 2021 even spring 2021 it'll roll out. Additionally, look articles story, goals optimist ones scientists. 

I'm trying negative, want vaccine ASAP, I'm pointing misleading articles vaccine articles have, ironically later clarify elaborate text.  specific ""communist"" country referring to? would probably label communist socialist politically conservative way resemble leftist/progressive ideals.

It boils effective R0 - ~5.7 early days pandemic social distancing, meaning need ~80% immunity go back kind lifestyle without cases going up. masks distancing change drastically, immunity creeps start see ""normal"" without corresponding increase. blame ‚Äúleadership‚Äù shitty behavior fellow unintelligent citizens. Stay strong responsible! virus literally originated Asia.... think root danger understood result planning took place countries acted accordingly early. Greece comparative European country Greeks predicted pandemic acted January February putting necessary restrictions place. comparison, European countries think pandemic likely. So, Greeks cancelled carnivals 1 reported case; England everything going normal 700 people hospitalised daily basis. Greeks sorts place early good reason leave home, restricted access care homes various quarantines place incoming foreign travelers; whereas untold numbers planes coming Milan every day serious problem virus walked planes checks whatsoever.

It sounds bit draconian, is, 'problem Greece allow take root whereas European countries did, clearly pops here, everywhere right old job hands get control.

Including quite Chinese foreign doctors, say confidence wrong.

Once officials Hubei realized couldn‚Äôt suppress word virus National government figures too, country responded kind determination autrocracies can. Affected areas cut completely- trains, plans boats. Highways barricaded police military. didn‚Äôt manpower block smaller roads, tore up.

In Wuhan lockdown complete - movement home. Neighborhood committed delivered food medicine conducted temperate checks etc.

On one occasion, China tested entire population cities 5 million people week.

I blame one questioning China‚Äôs count 4,800 fatalities. believe it‚Äôs likely true.

You mention attention turning China things heated Europe, etc. Every major health organization school public health planet people ground China. 

The country able strangle virus ways democracies cannot also former home: Vietnam.

Liberal democracy may least bad system government. proven mediocre - best - comes managing pandemic. early lockdowns never supposed solve problem, buy everyone time shit got nasty. reads like ""Strangers Candy"" take show exist pandemic. I'm laughing hard Jerri Blank's voice saying mind.

Skills learned, imagine people would learn? false advertising? found sad disturbing quickly media ruling elites across world constructed almost unanimous consensus. Whether one agrees  disagrees lockdown, world least sought  debates balance trade-offs safety freedom, quality  life extension life, discussions efficacy  long-term consequences prospects solutions implemented, least caution mistrust government unprecendented encroachment civil liberties ease decrete restrictions failing miserably non-coercive  approaches (including communication), side would lost find scary now. find scary every voice dissent silenced, nuance economic psychological impact increase inequality stemming constant lockdowns skepticism sustainability discussions trade-offs involving quality life handwaved ignorance, conspiracy thinking, necessarily pro-trump avid consumer conspiracy theories (i'm even american, despise Trump, i'm leftist time pass despise liberal left )

But suddenly, rulers elite always accused maintaining unjust economical structures, caution police state surveillance capitalism legitimacy credibility corporate media owned billionaires , suddenly thrown dustbin. suddenly government competent corporate medias owned billionaire virtuous looking interest people best interest mind long go dominant narrative decrete lockdowns, let's lockdown ask questions latter.

As introvert, I'm even bothered much lockdowns themselves, scares zombie-like quality see parts general populace quickly consensus constructed dissenting voices silenced. deafening echochamber find scary chilling prospect civil liberties, pluralistic values democracy.

Now i'm beginning notice certain amelioration dissenting voices emerging. Ireland issued new lockdown week ago keep new cases overwhelming hospitals. Wales same, calling ""firebreak"" give hospitals NIH chance recover flu season coincides covid season. know states, know mine (Florida, unfortunately) governor's dumb ass stripped away ability mask mandate enforced, lifted state restrictions businesses couple weeks ago. counties still able restrictions businesses, falling line.

Most people know experiencing pandemic fatigue, though we're cautious bunch starting wear us. also ended dental issue get taken care of, leading possible exposure - might lot people sort situation, medical issues put progressing must-be-treated-now situation.

Totally anecdotal, course, tl;dr think combination things leading it, result huge push return back ""normal"". Public health system Poland problems that's going years. government never cared fix disaster happened fucked. teachers refuse engage discussion educating students, perhaps teachers. tend doubt listen well classrooms.

It's tough decision requires difficult conversations. could expected virus family viruses literally referred ""seasonal colds"" strong seasonal pattern would also seasonal? china punished dont listen authority plain simple that? Good luck that. even Biden proposing that. cannot close schools, impossible. Damn, that‚Äôs terrible. many uncertainties still.

Feb 10th technically first day back extended Chinese New Year many regions China. Many measures government used contain virus created incredible fear throughout society. People scared shitless (including me), China place want visit moment. current moment public places (which open, places still closed), ie supermarkets, malls require temperature checks enter. residential buildings allowing people live enter require written registration temperature checks registered government enter leave building. Also apartment complexes lockdown depending proximity confirmed cases virus. **I Belgium friend allowed leave apartment 2 times week buy food. quarantine actually getting restrictive rather less restrictive**. Currently new requirements industrial facilities start work Chinese New Year (we warehouse Shenzhen classified rules). must register employees government, address work. must also follow new strict safety procedures required government commence operation. include purchasing proper disease prevention equipment include masks, disinfectant sprays, body temperature devices check employees fever. required carry daily disinfection facility temperature checks recorded daily record keeping form. required law report employee high temperature government. Safety inspectors visit facility check make sure items followed shut factories haven‚Äôt chance get labor back country side, start many registration documents required. Also we've seen safety inspectors totally overwhelmed inspection applications. small district Shenzhen 2,500 applications current inspectors 50 inspections day. means many facilities waiting long time get approved government commence operations. seen manufacturing budge way. total view China region in, factories supply chain communicate regularly (which small).

That's situation Italy right good therapeutic severe patients would amazing, solve issue hospital overcrowding. However several good vaccines effective therapeutics effectively ends pandemic. Lower spread means hospitals less risk, treatments save still end hospitalized. Obviously 4 absurd. mean trying kill entire neighborhood. 2 hand safe.....perhaps safe. Best go 3, that's Fauci would say asked comment it. Literally siding known con-man son matter life-and-death sure did. .blame trump... surging already NOTHING stop trump surge week  99% wont die.. sub goes crazy fake numbers means lot, hope staying safe. Gotta start using truck/containers like Murica probably have. Germans taken patients quite neighbouring countries, including own. he's sort right. works active cases drop, reduces total population virus. beyond negligent, they're fucking encouraging it. Aside everyone said gaslighting, also pretty much causality work. People pretending over, new cases going up. keep doing, there's penalty cautious safe all. tattoos, make sure got licensed professional, dude garage. bunch would use proof locking work... again..  begins like swatting flies. One city shutdown, things ease up, shutdown lifted, things rise again, city next shutdown, lift it, round round goes. forget non-covid deaths hospital capacity. plenty issues need ICU, people screwed too. us trying! Thank you! agree said, who's say trump run again?

He'll 78. sure, he's fat shape makes far, megalomania might propel run still don‚Äôt really understand how. numbers drop 0 people travel another outbreak? agree minimize numbers people act like lockdowns solution. They‚Äôre buy time what? Herd immunity? Vaccine? lockdowns permanent solution. Super jealous. wonder americans considered refugees would love people caught type stuff required take vaccine first whenever comes out. would help limit spread drastically. Doctor Mexican side. Things really bad bote sides, hospitals 100% full feeling beggining reported BNO news (whatever is), El Paso Times official city website? Yep. live Australia went entire winter next cases outbreaks. country same. Remember - winter isn‚Äôt anything like northern hemisphere, it‚Äôs mild comparison. 

Anyone symptoms encouraged get tested reappears it‚Äôs caught soon possible testing sewage done detect possible unknown cases public advised it‚Äôs found. far it‚Äôs worked well. Ale jest lepszje keeps overcrowding down... /s FYI, wife wears N95 ~~vent~~ valve, doesn‚Äôt shit protect gran.  US managed isolation arrival? border still open US citizens think going vacation abroad good idea.  That's great analogy would good bars shut down. exact things said people Slovakia Czechia, almost scary.

I wonder went wrong, first wave, Slovakia one countries best responses, everybody cared other, people sewing masks family members... see face without mask went outside. Now, second wave, we're almost behind Czechia, people believe hoax, vaccines nano bots activated 5G bullshit. really sad Checking El Paso- it‚Äôs infuriating much people don‚Äôt seem care, stupid follow simple rules. Everyone still going night, partying nothing wrong, absolutely enforcement. It‚Äôs people start receiving fines violating orders might able actually get control. Check many tests they've done, especially per capita tests. rank #152 right worldwide testing. extremely difficult get test Japan COVID. can't speak deaths, testing living, doubtful testing dead see much excess deaths due COVID. sub views COVID hotspots punching bags Yes, look US. make mistakes did. voted early Texas process super streamlined COVID mind. Minimal chances catching tbh citizens antisocial need martial law though suspect

This one problems. America much Europe socially compliant culture. Great protests agents change, good pandemics. 

China, hand: Great pandemics, Tiennamen go well, it... Idk could believe ever swam even drank something almost laughed. cant remember tattoo ear piercing lied gotten hs, yeah, lie. want give blood know safe it, check help human. 

I‚Äôve always found silly let administrative issues get way want help others know im safe so. 
But beginning aids crisis, think blanket policy made sense. knew affected population erred side caution blanket policy. 

The statement true along fact various bureaucracies history continued past abuse discrimination homosexuals. NZ it. they're covid free.

Victoria/Melbourne months. They're still open hit doughnuts today (expected rollback lockdown expected end week). 

It done. people charge lasted it, done. Might way trying keep people voting Wear Safety Goggles. They're even better. Fuuuuck. Parents making go Mexico shit happens. Right next el paso. think he's bad try Dan ""kill grandma economy"" Patrick Lieutenant Governor Attorney General indictment securities fraud accused corruption bribery. Texas Republicans nuts many consider Abbott ""RINO"" mask mandate, short stay home order subsequent closing bars reopening. reward strategically open masks. idiots whine lockdowns also want wear masks. figured manage virus, wear damn mask. They're prolonging us. Cool whataboutism Stay strong, get together Lol. Stop eating lead chips, bud. Ive always felt France high rate skepticism government experts. one hand, admirable government protest culture, hand, ton pseudo-medicine pseudo-science. people wearing masks city? Yep. I've casual rogan fan since newsradio thing. unsubscribe covid started. less ""inept"" ""uncoordinated.""

Either everything across country open, everything closed. think latter makes sense... Genuinely mental slog, I‚Äôm fairly privileged know wasn‚Äôt going anywhere near enough complain. I‚Äôm happy got things might look everyone!! Yeah difference proper hard lockdown temporary clear goal end: elimination, achieved less 3 months.  Permanent restrictions hand stay perfect vaccine. takes 2 5 years develop vaccine evidence long term immunity. mandatory, forced, rushed vaccine sounds pretty terrifying, anti vaxxer. El Paso, unfortunately ‚Äúrequest‚Äù stay home put required 10pm - 5am curfew, fined listened to........ screwed. everyone going vote reason getting spike? currently lockdown anywhere America.

that's well researched giant blanket statement I'm sure... Every country stopped covid strict border control managed isolation use display graphs? D3?    500K lot people. Willing bet almost special surgeries / procedures specific hospitals US best. 

The issue US routine procedures get quality anywhere world carry astronomic costs. supposed donate get free test. feel need get tested something, go testing center, blood bank. bet places around world act much earlier (

At least US. state local government takes actions like going armed protestors showing city hall/state house throwing shit fit. course spread virus around even more. politicization thing going really bad consequences. detected 137 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases Kashgar north-western region Xinjiang one person found virus previous day ‚Äì first new local cases 10 days mainland cases detected Sunday linked garment factory parents 17-year-old girl found Saturday virus ‚Äì showed symptoms ‚Äì worked, Xinjiang health commission official told press new cases marked mainland China‚Äôs first local infections since 14 October, one detected Qingdao.

Every single one asymptomatic case cluster far. another redditor pointed out, maybe they're detected early *pre*symptomatic? get anyone call hoax hospitals overflow. people overly cautious, see real world effects.  No, blood banks saying sexually active gay men ""diseased."". Rather, saying sexually active gay men higher risk HIV compared general population. form restriction always warranted long MSM highest risk. Terrible. wonder close El Paso Utah doing. saving ICUs younger patients pregnant patients. encouraging patients sign DNR. Restrictions Melbourne lifted starting midnight tomorrow. Melbourne join rest Australia limited cases restrictions. voting machines cast votes us always done. That‚Äôs awful. They‚Äôre available anyone New Mexico - short supply we‚Äôve surge cases knows honestly. TX numbers confuse based number tests lack active cases Dallas county. odd me. respiratory pathogens spread most.

stupid question: why? raining wet outside? know, second wave that's hitting almost everywhere right now.

Unless course suggesting Europe also listened Trump hope type-O hetero too. Wisconsin unseasonably cold snow several days, unseasonably large snowstorm. October. I‚Äôve denied test, repeatedly. I‚Äôm Oregon. worries, definitely taking personally. agree level muleheadedness, entitlement, general asshattery going US lately. 

I don‚Äôt even particularly *like* alcohol could use drink considering mess. Nice calming tea time, think. bash head wall times. Maybe both. 2020. Trump. UGH.  wrong. take entire goddamn year begin following basic precautions save life outdated. MSM still group highest HIV risk US. Putting form deferral high-risk groups justified. I‚Äôm following ‚Äî post neither mentioned state implied anything handling well all. Easter 2022 true positivity give indication trends clusters, again, pretty clumsy metric contingent whole mess factors related testing regime multiple environmental factors. one week testing whole community randomly next week testing people screened potential positives, positivity shoot roof. background information screening, mandates, outbreaks, whatever else included test results, positivity numbers likely give false indication what's happening world. 


You'll trust I'm far ignorant topic. Right US states effectively closed, yet others *wide open*... including strip clubs. mean? means local strip club closed: sex workers traveling across state lines order earn cash ‚Äî rubbing germs 'round patrons, 'round country.

Why strip clubs even open, *ANYWHERE*?! can't state borders tightened bit? It‚Äôs strange I‚Äôm NY work medical field know LOT people covid none gave loved ones. bizarre contagious it‚Äôs supposed be. biggest fear getting giving parents it‚Äôs small comfort me. live suburban area around atlanta hospital work already full. Every day pressured shift less acute patients favor something little worse. Granted work specifically covid, floors covid patients getting slammed, Critical care units MAXED. leads excess deaths 300k (by since article published) donated blood tested. However, issue blood high-risk individuals (like MSM) never collected first place. Tainted donations increase blood bank costs endanger patients. right, better everyone suffer together. For.. indefinite timeframe. Yikes I‚Äôm definitely finding things keep occupied! things considered I‚Äôm lucky able stay home loved one keep safe. look around don‚Äôt feel sense people wanting help fellow community members, gets me. days push on, days get stuck. already you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs important keep perspective  We're putting healthy children cages here, America, I'm sure sort moral high ground.  here's another data point you. mother something like 16 different medications, cheapest one, panadeine forte (30mg codeine) costs $1.20 per 60 pills, spends $316.80 year, everything else free.

Welp. 


I know always floated ""worst case scenario,"" is. **Because ten times many people died could reasonably possible, evidenced result different strategy chosen rest Scandinavia fucking dimwit** Man breaks heart reading man sorry countries lack leadership dealing pandemic wish countries would step like New Zealand Filibuster dead.

Everyone yelling small businesses children well being? fuck given Yes America cares stock market forgot Shocking people adversary government? Hmmm... thinking government democracy, scientists walk us. mean def see countries softer restrictions trust, last longer countries ""lockdown"" say - edge wont take another one.

Round round go. Glad well. Exactly, nobody wants order second lockdown (never mind US never really first lockdown). First wave definitely lot harder parse going on, death counts, might still higher cases right treatments drastically improved. One point goes around lot, instantly vent people now, seemed cause harm good lot cases.

Population density significant factor.

Nearly very-successful countries handling pandemic also high population density. South Korea, Taiwan, China, Japan.

Right US, pandemic far, far worse least populated least densely populated areas.

It population density instead behavior government response matters. East Asia lot experience comfortable using masks en masse. They've dealt respiratory viral outbreaks before. governments responded better. EU responded well many relaxed restrictions current state. US responded atrociously, many states responded better others better right consequence. seen France‚Äôs COVID numbers? Adjusting population absolutely dwarfing US right now.

That‚Äôs empathy works. feel like fully explained well enough. idea spread longer period time adding mitigations starts rise again. However, eloquently relayed quantify realistically long would be. honestly idea timing would definitely initially thought 7 months we're trending upwards direction that's getting significantly worse put restrictions place. really endemic, never. never learn.

Source: RN hospital transport team. COVID19 infects many people swine flu did, would mortality numbers look like?

No, admin prefers kill us, win. 

They FKN YEAR get hold virus. chose to. instead chose demonize mail ballots lifted restrictions keep virus bay. 

We CHOICE risk lives vote. administration made choice us. seems far lockdowns haven‚Äôt protected us disease, postponed inevitable. Look -Sweden terrible first wave even though infections rising hardly anyone dying. Non-American here: battling piece cloth? guy asking everyone get vote kick Dan Andrews out... without realizing voting mandatory here, we're nowhere near elections?

Also found early economic survey Denmark Sweden, March-April, showed spending dropped strongly countries, almost much Sweden (25%) Denmark (29%), despite different quarantine measures (Andersen, Hansen; Johannesen Sheridan 2020: 13-16). mid-June government foreshadowed 6 per cent fall GDP year (GOS 2020: 18 June) July predictions worsened.

It seems like people saying first wave northeast, second south, third midwest. would say incorrect. places separate starting end point first wave. Northeast definitely first wave, thus new jersey continues spike, wave number 2. However, current spike midwest still wave 1.

Sec 1, Article 8-

Now start saying given power impose masks, Chief Justice Reinquist United States V Lopez-

""Consistent structure, identified three broad categories activity Congress may regulate commerce power. Perez, supra, 150; see also Hodel, supra, 276-277. First, Congress may regulate use channels interstate commerce. See, e. g., Darby, 312 U.

United States, 242 U. S. 470, 491 (1917))). Second, Congress empowered regulate protect instrumentalities interstate commerce, persons things interstate commerce, even though threat may come intrastate activities. See, e. g., Shreveport Rate Cases, 234 U. S. 342 (1914); Southern R. Co. v. United States, 222 U.

Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes power regulate activities substantial relation interstate commerce, Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel, 301 U.

They would also capable using Spending clause section 8 wanted slightly softer touch. would simply say ""If want federal money, citizens shall wear masks."" Lmao. We're doomed. can‚Äôt even imagine US begin seeing headlines... 2022? North Korean one?

Can tell name tell graph tell numbers here, attacking you, I'm setting record straight getting facts objective, neutral observers make conclusions. thing El Paso though even stay home US side open Juarez side could freely whatever months, spread again. trump says we're turning corner! stop testing numbers go down, good, guys.

/s (obviously hope) Alright. Fair enough. definitely early tell rate reinfections. still personal belief figure better/easier way confirm reinfections, come light. many anecdotal reports possible infections, think still limited ability confirm them, hence low numbers. Yeah didn‚Äôt think that. Probably attribute unnecessary deaths due cold. Death many concerned about. lasting side effects caused virus many worried.  No, shows *mask mandates* panacea. lack enforcement means mask mandates worthless. Plus would cover private gatherings. 

It's coincidence countries VOLUNTARY near 100% mask wearing rates amazing. See Japan. there's one thing last 4yrs taught me, culminating last, we're clear American culture used think. seem picked positives neighbours, thankful. something wrong country thinks kidnapping children way justified. 

When illegally go somewhere get arrested called kidnapping... don‚Äôt always make statements cannot proven... lived country basic level competency, we‚Äôd able trace virus start.

You think arrest illegal behavior kidnapping. opinions seem worth much.

If country created web community like reddit could real it. ""facepalming"" believe me. However sides rhetoric got us imo Unfortunately many sub think money printed infinitely. Yes, yes. sign inflection, accounting lag deaths cases, looks like nothing prevent reaching even surpassing Belgium's numbers April. respect history doomed repeat mistakes.

Seemingly two week attention span. everyone wears masks outside home...it matter, right? Probably 3 days. great show government mismanagement.  see news update though. strange. first vaccine approved good question could people took seriously. quite vaccines there. definition phase 3 trial is, none made phase 3 trial yet determine longer term safety efficacy.

So, yeah, obviously. Even assuming perfect vaccine right currently stage 3 trials, early next year still sounds *very* early circumstances actually know that's hands. (The first quarter?) never done before. Please give blood. blood center safe Covid mitigation strategies probably too. Besides providing essential service people need it, also get free Covid antibody test give cookies! True extraverts maybe. fiancee felt better year social expectations much less demanding year.

Finally, year extraverts live way instead see us forced live way, we're liking tbh. reality disagree? +59% Stockholm county Q2 different +59% year think? mid June excess mortality, since late June Sweden average 5 year mortality. Q3 -1,9%. want discussion I'll discuss going disingenuous I'll move on. Agree test trace set-up probably best world \[Edit: remembered Iceland fucked ass poorly thought reintroduction tourism\] (and we've taken good lessons it), feel made serious mistakes others early judgement population-level adherence (incidentally SK East Asian country influenced US culture...). borne case numbers.

I think kind weird twisted racism / Anglo exceptionalism. Western world claim better basis East Asians somehow fundamentally different. might also NZ-success thread gets front page crowd morons trying really hard question make excuses - can't imagine different case. Yeah, vitamin way cheaper actually proven effective preventing worse outcomes. el paso, juarez emergency too, whole state returned lockdown, Chihuahua first state return ""semaforo rojo"" mexico meanwhile people still going hospital shit normally would can't receive adequate care either  think population density statistic misleading.

It‚Äôs ‚Äúa little‚Äù societal burden. asked make huge sacrifices. Masks don‚Äôt prevent infection, limit viral load turn makes let infectious limiting spread. It‚Äôs schools opening, it‚Äôs schools opening, it‚Äôs schools opening, however everyone wants ignored that. Icu nurse here. It‚Äôs hard want go either knowing home. icu temporary covid overflow icu little week airlifted mist stable pts state hospitals could staff it. One night 10 covid icu pts two icu nurses two crna‚Äôs rts. dangerous. enough locally, scary travel unknown too. heart aches hospitals already super stressed providers. feeling burned June. then, contracted smaller viral load wearing mask, likely also wearing mask go sniffles. Thus lesser chance transmitting others. wearing mask first place, probably likelier take sniffles seriously.  people vote Texas, likely goes blue. Unbelievably, letting people vote easily become partisan issue. next winter we'll starting low point probably vaccine.

We're barely winter epicenter virus anyway.

And country fine winter. end COVID? I'm guessing spring 2022. think quite bit lag time vaccines widely available due people get vaccinated. guess though UMC level 1 trauma center 250 miles. terms well-staffed academic hospitals chandler, UNM Lubbock decently close. We‚Äôre isolated here. okay, east coast votes blue anyways. /s He's sort leader need of. think turn case history prove right, powers moment. go unemployment? PA allowing leaving employment fear health others live with. April-May check people state requirements ate. paid UC use need it? That's...not freedom units. Well need shelters place acted smarter. get businesses hurting economy never going recover longer virus around numbers in. need national mask mandate. realize indoor dining gyms really work. sadly time people go, listened, it'll late everything shut down. like attitude! Research start shouting ""fake news"" ""DEY NEW DA RISKS!!!"" ""FEAR FATAL!!""    seems new strategy get infected. Hope recover. show something scared of. I'm conservative? Unless gonna pay stay home buy gym equipment shut lol Twitter news source. Melbourne pretty heavy lock time. 

Our whole country less cases since start state week.

You idea badly handling outside perspective.   imagine stupid. US FDA. lot countries 3-12 months deferrals MSM 30 million realm current possibilities lmao stop fear mongering. Fuck Trump. Read studies. jfc basic math. IFR .3-1% . spewing pure BS conjecture Yup, Trump Abbott totally control..... Eeehhh, $9.3 million - close enough. 

My remembering coach salaries might bit dated. 

Kevin Sumlin made $11.3 million 2018 result buy payments. Dealing people like roommate like playing chess pigeon. matter do, it'll knock pieces down, crap board strut around like won.

I'm sorry stuck situation. Well least hometown made front page. honestly embarrassing considering populated cities. work restaurant tell people everyday wear mask still customers trying come without one. Bars serving food keep business snapchat friends posting snaps bar one wearing mask. Bars shittiest job enforcing it. Along restaurants. lot people house parties like people dying getting sick. People really give fuck upsetting embarrassing. I've seen people driving cars wearing mask I've seen people try wear mask. Mayor shit it. restaurants going pick drive 9pm clearly going shit. wish could optimistic given current trends things going get much worse. Wear mask stay home, get essentials keep love ones safe. we're failing city could better. too, I'm worried parents :( everyone thread would bot ""Future analysis may shed light..."" Well...many attributed COVID. That's terrible. Great Fire London people trying save shit ends burning entire city  El Pasoan here! drive thru voting county you‚Äôre early voting, workers wiping machines surfaces every single person, distancing place well give little packet finger covering alcohol swabs qtips want cover finger touch voting machine screen wipe hands stuff. They‚Äôre super clean it. Usually El Paso really nice caring, people city failed horribly social distancing staying home. Football games, eating restaurants, house parties. 

It wasn‚Äôt someone knew personally got hospitalized covid parents actually start taking seriously going friends every weekend. 

Maybe it‚Äôs covid didn‚Äôt hit us early like elsewhere people became unconcerned it. Government failed yes, health officials failed yes, average El Pasoan think socially distance without masks?

A daring hypothesis have. Pretty sure non-distancing masks better non-distancing WITHOUT masks. enough circumstances socially distancing difficulty, work, school, etc. would far safer masks. go.  Oh aye know I've daydrunk night twice, generally clears lunch.

All I'm saying wasted conscious gorilla could've beaten chess. states flew national guard military medical personnel. Field hospitals added. Dang beyond depressing  Melbourne still lockdown. America, man... ? read article states: government failed provide incentives ramp domestic production. ?

Nothing entire world. know friends European country able get K95 masks without problems. Hit nail head. thing, ignorant people calling hoax, antimaskers, partying every weekend, large attendance gatherings, packed bars restaurants, spineless leader... We‚Äôre windstorm Northern California tonight tomorrow. don‚Äôt remember ever windstorm critical status. Gusts wind 70mph mountains/hills. Wait it. 30 day mandatory quarantine anyone coming country Yeah, literally did. live television.  record, 538 Trump 29% chance winning, Trump's internal polling 30% chance winning. polls within margin error, 30% chance real chance. reason error happened though polls mostly weighed education fixed 2018. year accurate polling year time.  Voting better essential service...  mean true several places, safe assume every positive case 10 without confirmation. lucky AC hum working, even there's electricity, long ago even one elevators collapse killed patient.

But also recognize took drastic measures handle outbreak even government knows capable dealing many people.

I mean cases reported? Yes, everywhere. Venezuela better americas I'll say course yes. Japan lock down...

They fine similar neighbors. Again, evidence lockdowns work. keep saying science Nudist/uninhibited/haven't yet learned properly prudish. 

I think kids like restrictive clothes be. Ever try keep socks infant? explain young kid bath shower awkward run room guests they're excited share thought had, say look clean really really need certain food? 

Letting choose clothes matter silly look helps lot though. requires police A) Believe virus real B) willing enforce order. .... Apparently still needs researched, tweeted scientist follow Twitter. Masks work, masks worn, there's evidence worn mask reduce severity illness...   agree...seems like lot people moving ok...it's ""risk"" general. saw good post someone yesterday said covid ""sweet spot people go around whatever want almost always ok EVERYONE consequences could disastrous some. So, stay strong ""some people""....you crazy!!! But, stay mindful &amp; grounded. anxiety &amp; 49 learned avoid cognitive distortion. Wish younger learned lol seriously, find ways things together &amp; apart stay sane. We'll better ""new normal"" place soon!!!  lesson learnt. Go hard lockdown + invest heavily contact tracing personnel things get better. Brazil imported Sinovac Vaccine. think countries follow suit buying vaccine? Second really.

The first two waves first waves different places, one nationwide resurgence. Belgium casually Lung% speedrun herd immunity glasses fog mask something every glasses wearing person deals with. happened clean rooms mask wearing places decades COVID still happens - even non-cloth industrial medical masks. We‚Äôve taking precautions seriously since March, one sons heart condition. also recognize can‚Äôt stop regular medical care either. went dentist couple weeks ago. one patient there, receptionist behind glass, hygienist double masked one step away wearing hazmat suit, lol. taking things seriously. 

I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt sit home suffer. least call dentist, explain concerns, ask protocols they‚Äôre following patients employees. Waves hot splooge pour streets favorite say need vote office next term.

I've heard good things  mask work also global mandate. many office workers wear masks. They're putting co-workers risk. keep hearing ""we're turning corner"" repeatedly. Saying something make true. Prayers stay safe everyone.  redditor wrong. Covid patients airlifted Imperial County Santa Clara county hospitals within California Fuck border patrol sure. mind paying world-class care, come USA! We'll soak get need. 

In news, medical tourism parts world *from* USA also happens people would like include legit vacation *and* health care, less would cost USA. agree this. many people tend agree tho real problem lockdown hard enough. need two week reset.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Almost countries hit hard first wave going experience similar second wave. Case numbers exploding many places, France early time. US, Spain Italy name seem trajectory. America even seen end first wave yet, unless count NYC first wave. next months going suck LOT people around world. better stock double-wide child coffins too. 

I left apt weeks either careless assholes. real, late pandemic still thought around people indoors ok thing do? 1) masks help

2) masks help much. variables play significant masks. ridiculous political mask debate gotten.

3) you‚Äôre subreddit, probably use subscribing fear-mongering circle jerks, pseudoscience, bad economics

4) people refuse wear masks don‚Äôt believe government mainstream news. think published data biased meant promote limiting personal freedoms. Making laws won‚Äôt change thing. cause people rebel. Everyone read summary. also analogous ground ambulances (apart staff pay). I‚Äôve felt longest time. March, known whole thing would last exactly 12 months (or however long), would find sort peace that. dread knowing things go back normal absolutely hardest part quarantining me. take number people divide area. know actual scientifically correct density uniform (and Sweden element).

It science, mathematics. still called population density.

If say ""orange"" apple, magically make apple orange. Happy there.  Many countrymen leaders stupid stupid people.  going lots death hardships come. one brought die shouldn't, prepared conversation probably brought up.

Multimorbid elderly close ""should die"" demographic gonna get western world, I'm OK sacrificing because, realize limits far country go protect them. Take influenza, efficient-ish vaccines COVID-19 proved (even Sweden, soft approach) changes behavior save lives basically making flu non-issue. see nobody talking implementing measures permanent winter basis, little talk mandating influenza vaccinations. borderline saw *nothing* either issue COVID-19 happened either, societies around world make plenty clear we're entirely OK people dying can't bothered make extra effort.

So we're really talking death, much we're willing stop it. Sweden willing less countries, others, end thing show response ""best"", thus whose reputation comes sparkliest, time. need proper postmortem, moralizing fingerpointing sanctity life. Great work all! proud moment  Australia bad 2nd wave, reacted decisive lockdowns interstate border closures, managed keep contained basically one city (Melbourne) lockdown rest. tough AF people city, they've today reached 0 new daily infections milestone less 3 months peak runaway exponential growth.

It possible free, advanced western nations beat captured right-wing populist politics. island nation helped Australia immensely first wave (since prevented virus getting foothold population first place; advantage shared NZ host Asia-Pacific nations) crushing second wave, exponentially-exploding local-transmission, people Melbourne actions Victorian state government heath authorities. see great news since getting closer herd immunity. 1000 cases El Paso? Holy shit. half WA yesterday. Yes, people smoke alone inflict people. Plenty people drink without driving drunk. 

But let's think two. work stop people smoking, protect others labeling, anti-smoke commercials, making smoking inside buildings illegal, etc. drunk driving illegal.

So let's put energy making people wear masks correctly. like would report business letting people smoke indoors, report business making people wear masks. We've gotten better treating Covid past 7 months.

But superior treatment matters resources available treat them. hospitals start triage, go back high fatality rates April. confirm covid gone left democrat hoax. ""dead"" people statistics actually bodies hillary clinton excavated graveyard dropped hospitals. quiet socialist!!!!!!11223344 work local store town since April, following reopening shutdown March. county 4.55% testing positivity rate week, town reported 11% county's cases since March. live parents, store one parents works at, reasoned risk contracting virus would similar either way.

While worked half year without anything Covid-related happening store, harbor reservations continuing holiday season. owner imagines store holding half maximum capacity allowed county. number 50 people, absurd considering wary get store 10 inside. Everyone wears masks, confined aisles inhibit social distancing. Worse, customers seem inhibitions regarding distance towards others.

Should quit job I'm worried this? one hand dream job I'll Associate's Biology semester, feel bad leaving; hand family already works know much safer I'd actually quitting. issue stay-at-home orders hoaxes? Asking president. another looming global threat could applied too... absolutely bears lockdown work point France now.

It come 2-4 weeks ago honest things clearly spiralling control health services testing contract tracing. 

There point delaying inevitable things pass point. means longer, harsher, lock down...or even worse lockdown entails.  exactly: border remained open essential medical travel. Commercial traffic took giant hit.

Sobering unrelated note, article: USA literal dirt-poor conditions advantages: Paso 19,177 coronavirus cases 386 deaths Aug. 21. Thursday, 30,624 cases 554 4,724 cases 682 deaths, also August.

Even future outbreaks / waves, amazing achievement. backdrop relentless sniping undermining various politicians huge sections media. going flying Delta November 13th. little reassuring me.

This speculation since work lab, maybe given positive sequence +90% matching.  need start home order. Restaurants bars need ordered go carry only, start NZ. science deniers protesting lockdown... lockdown finished amazing people sub simultaneously bash US growing cases, despite borders closed, downvote saying closing borders much already country. 

Its like turning stove kitchen caught fire thinking affect flames. can‚Äôt find source moment tons young healthy doctors Wuhan died weren‚Äôt using proper ppe exposed huge amounts virus sort news give anyone else mild panic attack overreacting? I'm even high risk group I'm actually scared go places now. pretty much includes going supplies like groceries household stuff. tried to, denied I‚Äôm low iron (just barely) :/ try though!

Uh, what? FL TX combined around 6k new cases yesterday. Somebody check math that‚Äôs half 80k. Victoria Australia would like speak Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thats wild assertion part. even numbers back statement. indications covid deaths underreported. repeating common right wing talking point. US midst uncontrollable spread many states given failures present govt. ever let forget this. going make it? like? could find fentanyl OD on, would happy. even want live anymore. lockdown lasted March June worked wonderfully France. Daily deaths went 1000+ 5 stayed almost nothing September started increasing again. started increasing month two kids went back school, parents went back work people went back bars, gym, etc... second wave direct consequence re-opening lockdown. lockdown saved tens thousands lives though. basically 30,000 deaths effects lockdown could felt 3,000 months since. Another lockdown probably needed doubt work well first one. Hopefully, that's last one needed vaccines arrive COVID fatigue real. people pushing manufactured lab rhetoric also group saying fake dem\*\*\*\*tic hoax till midnight. No, lockdown got control. closed borders impact thousands Australians virus. closing border, people thread pretending magical solution. US closed borders spring worst hit country. know difference US Australia is? effective lockdown. 

So lets pretend lockdown 99% legwork getting Australia's cases control think otherwise intellectual dishonesty. try make many assumptions think next time either, last half comment pitifully mark. New cases. Hospitals 100% capacity they‚Äôre airlifting patients cities, that‚Äôs great situation either... Nate Silver starts posting daily updates again, hide bomb shelter. Heartbreaking indeed, unreal find water hyacinth whole time truly fucked. definitely propaganda used enforce it. Remember stay home orders closure originally effect 2 weeks kept getting extended goalposts moved controlling virus fear death seem enough motivation. Maybe federal government offer buy pizza party (with ice cream) whatever counties kept per capita deaths lowest. They're talking social effects. They're actually expert pretend immune saying something worth voting talk expertise. Big babies gonna baby That's Indonesia identifies Muslim first, Asian distant second. Picture swimming pool filled people. lanes pool less people explosive diarrhea, they're part US Olympics-sized swimming pool. lane may less, neighbor's diarrhea going percolate lane soon enough. people like frolic shit super spreading shit around far wide, crossing lanes using poo-cannon propulsion. people think kids shit pool, know they're worst offenders. people assert right shit pool nothing say make put cork it. think bad itself. Flattening curve mandatory, bare minimum fight virus. flatten curve death suffering incredible. ""flatten curve"" good one start with.

But that's thing - START with. Flattening curve supposed step 1. Instead, US last step national strategy. never got another one. we're stuck purgatory ""we need flatten curve"", ""ok curve flat, mission accomplished everyone back normal now"", ""oh shit"", ""we need flatten curve"".  Yes doesn't. Getting tired hearing disinformation campaigns mostly safe drugs. HCQ another mostly safe. Whether worth it? necessarily seem be. But, decent studies done HCQ + zinc+ antibiotic.

Ivermectin shown effective even minimum recommended 1,443 new cases hospital admissions? latter ... that's higher entire UK ... think misinterpretation scientists government. Scientists said ""they know masks work not"" governments interpreted ""masks work"".

So what? start fallacy Trump hired someone, must terrible job since person terrible job, unsafe drugs approved never known scale killed millions people past 4 years, shouldn‚Äôt trust drug came person clearly approve anything. That‚Äôs logic. It‚Äôs wrong stupid many levels. assumes FDA dunces shouldn‚Äôt job scientists researchers also losers don‚Äôt care people‚Äôs lives either.  precisely line critical thinking people decided don‚Äôt need measles vaccine it‚Äôs clearly unsafe. areas United States COVID-19 outbreaks, new coronavirus likely became leading cause death among adults aged 25-44, researchers say. Using data U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC), analyzed deaths cause age group March July, along drug overdose deaths period 2018, recent year data available. three 10 regions country, identified U.S. Department Health Human Services, deaths exceeded 2018 unintentional opioid overdose deaths least one month pandemic, researchers reported Sunday medRxiv, ahead peer review.

Pretty stunning hear, especially ""COVID-19 hurt young people!"" favorite argument people looking downplay pandemic. knew going get worse weather turns, much faster imagined. disagree youth statements. sounds like searching excuses, wonder giving pass spreading coronavirus specifically? mean, extend logic societal norms laws? ""You maybe treated fairly since economy great, go ahead steal stuff kill people, fault. owe nothing society.""

Victims get free passes make *other* people victims. That's bullshit. We'll never recover attitude, that's Mad Max strategy spouting there.

TLDR: really depth report extremely rural areas Montana, Wyoming &amp; co experiencing - single COVID case 6 months, many people dismissing threat could never reach them. did, got person two county government suddenly learn contact tracing; get assistance National Guard. one county extremely low population numbers, someone threw unauthorized wedding 200 people, within weeks 80 fresh COVID cases wearing extremely limited healthcare emergency response resources.
It's hardly question ""if"" ""when"", even make joke socially distancing due geography since civil war. would literally stop walking suspended particle seems different everywhere.

How many fun police posts see area sub ""shocking conditions"" many plauge rats packed bars businesses? dosent matter makes pandemic worse, talking that, wrong people go pandemic. Thank lengthy response. see really angry whole situation. know help others guess rest Europe similar story. also bought masks vanished, arrived without certification, ventilators work etc. Lots money gone, one blame. Strict lockdown hit business hard, wanted avoid second wave long possible. Also, real damage lockdowns measured future years, online education negatively impact many generations etc.
Sucking church banning abortion really dick move trying times...

Stay strong healthy wish manage clean country free stupid money grabbing politicians. Somehow. tell Karen day 18 year olds working Starbucks responsible supply chain issue involving precious whipped cream threatening get people fired cool.

Fun fact, female cancer test named due Greek/American Doctor 1st developed it, George Papanicolaou. type cytology test. getting tested COVID done every point need show passport airlines open safely again.

That's safe way this. Testing Covid without quarantining much. virus 14 day incubation period, average 5-7 days. Testing negative airport mean it. way make travel safe require people quarantine 14 days least 7-8 days second test day 7 negative result (not safe 14 days, better nothing). What's poland obsession negating LGBT? Here‚Äôs non google AMP link directly Guardian article 1. clinical trials public attention involve million press releases every step. They‚Äôre going skip mentioning things might intuitive understand immune system.

2. Tried look didn‚Äôt find anything, measuring here? immunogenicity almost always antibody response, adaptive response. entire concept vaccination relies adaptive immunity.

This first issue I‚Äôve seen getting basic immunology vaccination incorrect. arguments make sense.

There millions smart working since months making law less complicated. matter evil companies matter actually realized save money people working remotely. still work much before.

You make points money. get now? Shutting thousands businesses going cost lot money. speak secobd lockdown. people dying everyday apparently schools untouchable.

Stay home paid happening bars movie theaters restaurants gyms on. going months. get worse. better direct money keep situation control instead facing disaster.

The occasions compared schools nothing drop ocean. clear everyone basic understanding virus spreads. Face it: people dying schools untouchable. 

The furniture useless. already tables. need fancy tables wheels? going help catch covid, come back home kill parents? Wow got covid got sitting desk wheels!

Schools miss technology. That's done. could done 6 months? LOT. Starting schools would problems implementing online lessons.

Its really filter medium though. electrostatic filters half masks / full mask respirators, filtration actually goes stuff clogs (as long get wet, exhalation valves protect filter humidity breath) 


That said... wear full gas mask plastic encased P100 filters everywhere reason... Utah currently rationing ICU beds : really infuriating discussion switches individual states ""as country"" time. Nah, won‚Äôt need winter jackets. distant people price ticket unrealistic people couldnt get home travel work least Canada, lifted lot restrictions summer I've avoided bus, subway, trains 7 months. always used mask. Last time went theaters, March.

Everytime went buy something, changed clothes. always changed shoes. I've always washed hands like crazy.

None matters. still got freaking covid. 

I assume people whatever can, get vaccine. Good luck trying force people wear masks keep restrictions take vaccine. accept that. know won't. Goalposts clear loud. Correct - we‚Äôre operating assumption behavior. end we‚Äôll never know true answer. Haters gonna manipulate anonymous accounts fabricate appearance hateful consensus.

Nah, prolly better, let's stick that. don‚Äôt think non-insane people would miss Black Friday weren‚Äôt. projection prediction. Although asymptomatic presymptomatic cases far 50k anyway. Even places actually shut properly: Hubei (China), Daegu (Korea), Vietnam, Bergamo (Italy), Victoria (Australia), New Zealand, Canada's Maritime Province (maybe) Hawaii, world anything like closed nine months.

Where shutdowns complete enough, spread virus stopped weeks. Since then, repeat sht downs places (e.g. Victoria, Australia). China went further. 

For weeks trains, planes, ships Wuhan. Every highway blockaded police military. personnel block smaller roads, tore up. Nobody left home weeks. Neighborhood committees delivered food medicine temperature checks, etc.

Since crushing outbreak around Wuhan, Chinese implemented CDC recommended states (but single possible, exception, none done) reopening. detected handful cases, tested entire population cities eight eleven million people. contact trace promptly monitor quarantine anybody positive exposure. Nothing like happened U.S. - even places periods success containing virus (e.g. Vermont)

When 'shutdown' March, perfectly OK go wander around Costco couple hours pick Panda Express way home. lasted two weeks. Since then, testing become easily available, results still come late much use. minimal contact tracing monitored quarantine.

People becoming ill virus afraid least much economic damage weeks proper shutdown would do. going become much worse weeks months ahead. 

The intelligent option US point would hardcore, nationwide two four week 'stay home order' $2,500 checks sent every adult. shutdown needs extended repeated, send checks monthly.

That happen, reason political there. current administration explicitly given trying control virus. (They never really tried.) But, even wanted to, would likely prove impossible make states tow line. lot people West wishes moms still tell wear masks. humble opinion better approach would downplay risks take seriously get everyone take seriously try play games numbers. Here, special needs opened earlier, specifically special needs schools. quoting vaccine supply, obviously include 2-3 available vaccines risk production, changes calculus. wondering iron anemia anything long haulers substantially likely female. 

Looks like I'm wrong deficiency problem. But, good see answers starting arise could provide solutions long haulers. make CCP less responsible. Tbf danger people 90s perhaps even 80-90 year olds seems could smaller risk Covid death high risk areas. Approving early ‚Äúemergency use‚Äù e.g diabetics 80 wouldn‚Äôt seem strange me. giving healthy individuals part trial all.

Peopled extreme risk groups die month vaccine approved healthy 20 year olds. politicians. forget them. Welcome Duda's land.  Actually Hungarian word. Horn NZ learns history. Others repeat history. ##ARE FUCKING DAFT?


How many times repeat this, ten times little still massive. 

All reasonable goals success met.

Different countries different countries different challenges.


You yet made response arguments, hyperfixated comparisons favour worldview. Sorry, fixed link. CCP didn‚Äôt great! Wtf. suicided whistleblower doctors. took research. lied long out. 

Let‚Äôs put way. someone pushed stairs broke leg, one blame person pushed you. got hobbled along using bad leg made worse, fault damage you‚Äôve done person pushed innocent. CCP took big fat dump world. cool. ‚Äú brain washed media people control masks lines‚Äù Oh shit sarcasm guy recognized username smfh good friend Saturday six hours. Neither us really wearing masks since two us. found went dinner someone Friday tested positive today. concerned? Sorry asked, able find good answer anywhere online. 'and', reminding people situation continues get better worse. üëç Sorry, post right link. way satisfying conclusion. last two NZ cases surface transmission.

FYI never confirmed. one theory Ministry Health had. believe longer investigating theory either since investigation hit road block. cant prove either way. seems likely theory. Oh God, that's depressing. people easily brainwashed loathsome idiot man.. Best luck partner. germans think like this. Sadly loud idiots there, get attention.
Stay safe, polish friend! shitshow countries started... T\_D gone I've slowly gone moderate democrat / republican mean forever. Tell people leave apartment. /u/blazingsaint Get load guy. Can't tell sarcasm even shouted megaphone. first world country forget listening doctors.... Well then... sucks guess? don‚Äôt get vaccine that‚Äôs problem. I‚Äôm social distancing ten years protect anti-vax karen. Thankfully, unlike masks, vaccines personal benefit. clusterfuck, president prime minister declaring COVID gone,&lt;&lt;

This untrue. never said covid gone, said said, July, epidemic retreat (what true basically everywhere Europe summer).

At time, leader main opposition party - Civic Platform Borys Budka announced covid disappear October. funny, right? Still first wave shows existing policies, actions, attitudes, etc. ineffective handling virus. 

Easy say need act. Hard say need act. Even harder enforcing appropriate actions nationwide. 

If 420th wave weed confidence actions appropriate there'd consistent track record effectiveness. 

Not past first wave sound alarms. really following much immunity, anyone know actually virus makes immune something like this?

Im getting stupid ideas, wondering research still early know? EXACTLY can't get shit US. Selfish people like wife putting others risk. tell employer exposed needs quarantine. That's do, won't, terrible human concerned immediate future. know. I'm leaving basement virus completely eradicated. risk .001% chance perishing virus that's still endemic. Glad see someone else sense here. member states ?

Why member states kind tiered membership ?

PS forget EU money offer member states. member states money getting back. Glad hear you‚Äôre making life lol let happen guys. going see Rammstein soldier field... definitely biggest disappointment year. understand, Oxford vaccine using adenovirus vehicle. body get immune response adenovirus itself. mean repeat vaccines might work? Yeah, governor Florida held press conference months ago sign front podium stated survival rate 20-49 demographic 99.98%.

I wondered concerning... governor *believes* constituents blindingly stupid 48 year old would put category 20 year old, constituents *are* actually stupid. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Nah champ fact estimate anti vax community huge amount it‚Äôs small group lol hey stay indoors want   Yikes. said initial response came understanding comment all. insult you. Sorry feel insulted, that's fun feeling. implies virus ever control, false. I'm Asian. I've spent plenty time around Asians. reddit seems think I'm wrong though. get downvoted pretty much every time comment people Asian countries tend governments say. government tells wear masks it. government tells stay home stay home. find many people Asian countries holding giant parties protesting masks. Americans protest pretty much anything tell do. Tell American eat three meals day they'll eat four spite. Tell eat four they'll eat three defy you. That's American way. Asians approach things. guarantee high compliance rates things like masks lockdowns Asian countries US.  sucks. curiosity like normally get colds flu? get legitimately sick every year? plan it. wanna get sick shit. 

Mods take type stuff - seem trolling people. months ago arguing person subreddit possibly seasonal component said probably wasnt.

If go back arguments masks.

Im kinda sick called alarmist Im right. Oxford vaccine sham know it. plan leaving basement til virus totally eradicated. I'm actually beginning fear virus may transmitted IP, limiting time Reddit, even though point. Cries U.K. that's like moderate

you almost 500 posts donald moderate....you part problem two weeks one order magnitude worse-if nothing change, is. people tends speak front wear masks super spreader events per article. country hasnt got resources - EU stands guess. much point EU times difficulty. Chipotle killing people even pandemic... Trump inept cronies responsible death economic devestation robust immune systems? It‚Äôs already mass produced USA distribution easy shit considering already logistics place I.e. covid test sites figured US right them. idea happening outside US. That‚Äôs horrific. Please stay safe best there.  I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs much research. flu shots flu shape shifts new iterations year. Scientists make best predictions year look like make flu shot accordingly always best guess never perfect. guess second half thing relevant: could push vaccination programs guess better hygiene general. that‚Äôs tough it‚Äôs like one time glorious campaign eliminate smallpox something. Even somehow gave everyone flu shot, you‚Äôd gear 100% scratch next year new version. It‚Äôs lot effort. Don‚Äôt mean downer here, think flu it‚Äôs tough make much tangible progress. Maybe one thing comes pandemic better societal attitude towards infectious respiratory diseases (washing hands, staying home sick, possibly even mask wearing high risk situations) cut things bit  idea happening outside US. Daily remind sound like idiot. think are, perfect would far far greater efficacy 60%. Now, granted, experience FDA vaccines limited it‚Äôs something comes often‚Äî don‚Äôt often develop new vaccines there‚Äôs usually little incentive so... 60% efficacy also seems low goal reach level herd immunity makes Covid easier trace outbreaks contained. Consider 50% US adults get flu shot best years 66% Americans polled say won‚Äôt get first vaccine (we‚Äôll assume quick math 50% population ends getting vaccine)... .5*.5 = .25 25% population would effectively immune isn‚Äôt enough get us herd immunity means vaccine would likely little effect wrt spread virus intermediate term. fact many vaccines require two doses face extra logistical problems suggest pretty clearly ‚Äúperfect‚Äù options even table. best options likely middling effect best (based reasonable assumption). would fantastic surprised one ended 70% 80% effective year longer there‚Äôs reason expect result, falls outside range statistically expected (which we‚Äôve tempered expectations around 50-60%). 

You are, however, right average American won‚Äôt see vaccine anytime soon. likely prioritize first line first. doesn‚Äôt matter long it‚Äôs mandated even best expectations efficacy, limiting factor getting enough people vaccinated *at time* create herd immunity allows us isolate outbreaks. Doesn‚Äôt seem likely me, given can‚Äôt even get people wear mask properly engage stupid,risky behavior. 

I expect we‚Äôll wearing masks 2022 every subsequent fall winter becomes endemic. 

It‚Äôs doom gloom, realistic picture likely expect. Things less go back normal contain outbreaks save wearing masks winter likely side effect we‚Äôll see less influenza well. mixed bag.

Edit: grammar phrasing Victoria's secret? family does!

But there‚Äôs five us.  kids stay home home

...which, unfortunately you, everybody. estimate large anti Vax community is. Good luck actually getting everyone take it. work sales multiple customers tell take Bill gates wants put computer chip you. level crazy becoming norm, much faith you. Poland: cheaper die.

That government joke. mean, survey also saying March 2021 phase 3 study n=5000 even reports results. I‚Äôm really sure ‚Äúwell EVERYONE ELSE gets go back normal!‚Äù tantrum coming from. Several European countries going back lockdown. challenge find one country community spread, masks, nothing. bet bottom dollar won‚Äôt find one, save maybe couple extremely remote island nations never really COVID problem begin with. Sure, countries BETTER, whole ‚Äúthe US one struggling‚Äù BS false narrative. isn‚Äôt Murcia #1 rant, realize we‚Äôre shit, 2019 normal doesn‚Äôt exist anywhere planet right now. ... widespread riots broke out, least one group openly anti covid ignoring safety (no masks nothing). signed kid kindergarten immediately hearing this. hope get hospital sit home spring, bad can't imagine much worse get 2 weeks. damage done. us also seen vaccines side effects take *months* show up, people trust anything that's developed accelerated schedule. see plague building bottom front teeth. üò¨üò¨üò¨ 

I know two ""soft spots"" molars last time, treated something made black know supposed redone. used take dentist every four months almost year pandemic. üò≥üò≥üò≥

She six BTW. Good point. 

I agree ""the general public"" wont able get vaccine 2021, will, goes well, able protect some. atm even know give elderly vaccine trials still running. 

A vaccine wont make changes policies next 2-3 years. hate herd immunity sort have, get back sort normality, wont either. never reopen then? I'm sure they'll find catchy name like SARS-CoV-2-INFL-2021 many countries need keep mask classroom seated.. wonder germany.
Assuming 7 years old properly keep mask 4 hours straight. Looks lessons really learned Victoria. lot countries say. starting condition one gone back person (older one stayed remote since okay far) idea may go back online saddening me.

It's really sad that, know? Kids deserve go suffering, especially young too. hope pandemic officially dust settles, learn that.

And no, ""just keep schools closed"" viable solution either. Maybe every student, students *need* go school learn optimal learning conditions. IEP accommodations, WiFi home, parents work need place stay safe...

Fortunately, school close again. tempting fate saying that? china whole pandemic happened. need held accountable. Something must done reduce economic stranglehold rest world. first world countries stopped outsourcing cheap labor goods could help get economy back track. first world countries need produce products jobs countries rather relying china. Yes, immune compromised, relying herd immunity, since immune system won‚Äôt give kind response vaccine gives healthy person. 

However, issue existed covid. example, it‚Äôs typical children treated cancer kept school activities due vaccine refusals.

We‚Äôll see happens issue forced various governments, works. Typical r/coronavirus reply lol /u/blazingsaint get load less people dying, know, freacking ton people losing lifes, number comparison, USA winning big time, duh...

/s Yeah, no, that‚Äôs it‚Äôs going go. previous record like 4 years make new vaccine it? still pretty quick. ... dont think could speak clearly sick. hit ignore calls. much energy, shit crazy. Many think record cases bad hospitalizations deaths increasing.

I giving two weeks, deaths seem increasing sooner. Polish president Trump wannabe another racist xenophobe anti-science dumb shit Literally name like five people actually try opposite fear monger Yes. 
States cannot shut airports. FAA controls it. Yes, guessed it. federal-controlled agency. hopefully turns okay us. access different paid data platforms I've watching data biologics. far didnt look bad mention people. currently im stelara prednisone ill move remicade one infusion center ones soon probably . is, article claiming spikes lot intense President comes town. True based. think it‚Äôs fact Reddit gives free award don‚Äôt get choose one *in trials

Literally world, different countries companies developing separate attempts vaccine. Check Australia's stats. Controlled first wave beat second wave. Five new cases per day country 25m. Wow. America clearly better countries like Australia South Kore. They've multiple waves America even 1. /s Still ridin big wave Phase 3 incredibly reliable study compared phase 4. Phase 3 good enough released public meaning good harm far current studies show. Lot drugs get released get pulled withing 2years due poor application/side effect/better alternatives. Thank you! ""there's nothing anyone could done"".

When people show stats countries, simply say ""they're reporting true numbers"". mean could quit lol got mild fever fatigue flu shot year also going immunotherapy allergies moment im sure body pissed everything one rare people witness hospital crisis. painful everyone yet little control many patients come front door. Meds supplies used, one available restock. trying take care sick patients. Bodies get stacked unused closets floor techs busy run transport them. cut many corners tremendous moral damage still working. know are
Providing shitty care. can‚Äôt anything it. governor made it‚Äôs illegal individual cities go lockdown. allowed declares one.

This betrayal ""conservative"" local control philosophies. expected ~~feared~~
 
FTFY OP millions smart working since months making law less complicated

Many companies brought people back offices soon could. law nothing this. changes anything required keep working home, companies whatever fuck wanted would done regardless home paid happening bars movie theaters restaurants gyms on. going months.

So think go occasions compared schools nothing drop ocean.

They aren't, literally they're closing stuff. saying anything furniture useless. already tables.

No didn't, old shit knows many decades ago, probably used furniture parents. majority furniture bought replace desks two people stupid antiquated furniture deserves could done 6 months? LOT.

No, also pandemic. Nobody managed change anything significant schools schools would problems implementing online lessons. Primary schools example.

The proble technology age students, even years time would change that. work. Nobody it. Get head. Don‚Äôt call comeback virus lead killer ages surges. Everyone always brings H1N1 didn‚Äôt cause massive disruption. 

Maybe didn‚Äôt are/were, was. teaching it, shut schools it. 

I quarantine four days get tested two students one class it. school closed cleaned several times since one outbreak campus. actually disruptive area. number schools around - several times. 

I remember county health department counseling husband needed quarantine test well, inform workplace might it. 

In area, H1N1 treated similarly Covid. much less contagious. ib right mind would accept take vaccine barely tested?! Weeeeeeeeee American, refreshing see kind thinking. good insane concert. Sweat everywhere. first band brought energy up, recall second band almost getting booed. That's insane. Store clerks Sydney changes masks every 4h. expect Spanish publication guess. 

European countries strategy involve ""head ass"" also done well. quite well Asia, expect integrated Sweden/France/Spain?

Nordic countries Sweden death rate much higher Japan's example. Germany, much higher, also many times lower neighbors. 

It's mysterious ""x-factor"", basic public health policy (except, suppose, stupidity society elects incompetent governments).

If believe orientalism crap one second, look poorly South Korea handled MERS. \*does\* matter. Defining spikes waves indicates levels control COVID-19 US, whereas that's case. defining spikes, essentially follow administration largely given attempting control pandemic.

In words, RIGHT WRONG answer here. US never controlled virus, essentially going Swedish-model far, larger, deadly scale. **BORDER CONTROLS WORK SHORT PERIOD TIME POLITICALLY FEASIBLE MANY CASES CONTROLS WORK BORDERS POROUS CASE QUICKLY BACK SQUARE ONE** would accurate slogan, quite catchy. 

And crux statement. That's like saying ""We imprison everyone murderer"" replying ""NO IMPRISON EVERYONE PEOPLE INNOCENT IDIOT"" One semi guaranteed, cannot promised anybody would like express gratitude post survived purge tell purged posts utterly insane anti-China conspiracy theorists; utterly insane pro-China conspiracy theorists show up, get whammied too. quite direct: people lied trust anymore. made exaggerated assumptions, published models full shit (we still waiting 500k dead UK), know spread alarmist message held account. changing even evidence could gotten 7 8 months: message still lockdown #stayathome. effort made measure actions paid unnecessary, nobody studied actually likely infected (or studied publish convenient), furthermore, army mathematical modellers responsible completely disrespects sciences, psychology sociology, including branches medicine, care anything curve graph. enough them.  2 negatives positive usually means false positive. You‚Äôre probably fine Good work Melbourne's 15-week lockdown ends midnight tonight. 

This probably relief several months strict lockdown ‚Äî earned it! Keep guard though if/when covid re-emerges Adjusted population, Wyoming reported ten times deaths texas today 1-2 billion 6-9 months? 

That would incredible, 1-2 billion ALOT doses vaccine. Theres least 3 front runners seem work..

Maybe could whole first world vaccinated 6-9 months Ivermectin shown effective anti viral many viruses. look different Cov-2.

Does rise level statistical significance solidarity study. 

I'm going read watch news article study. link original study? Right. We've established unbelievably selfish. Brag it. :-( cancel Xmas geez. like BLM back blue. appreciate police officers think good I'm blind fact excessive force often used people color.

Why can't both? Exactly. pandemic going fuck things many ways. Med staff burnout, PTSD, suicides etc one ways. Gonna laugh read obituary. Can't wait clips random celebrities feel need update everyone ok getting hands vaccine. Yeah, know, care people. stop telling us time. personal choice criticize president that's way want deal it, go it, change fact dealing irrational way likely damage health living life. clinging onto hero complex thing keeping sane right false sense superiority derive shutting friends family life referring ""cannon fodder"" working job around people. seem think knowing blood banking way relevant this. Disease spread prevention topic hand. Idk ever thought managing blood banks. see terribly confused along. Anyways argue anymore. Enjoy blood shortage. hospitals collapsing. government lame ignorant impose measures. tired stand up. Smart people self imposed lockdown since 2 weeks. enough hospitals staff? It‚Äôs possible shield children pandemic. Kids aren‚Äôt stupid, pick things going wrong around them. moment someone get's really bad reaction dies vaccine (which happens medicine- people died getting ananaphylactic shock using mouthwash) pictures intubated grieving spouse side makes social media. lucky 20% population gets vaccine. 

It 2030-2040 get numbers people vaccinated reach vaccine herd immunity- ever. Think flu anti-vaxxers bad? Wait see covid-19 ant-vaxxers. actually, China also stole time machine. Damn, posts laughably bad. Imagine claiming care ""ruined lives"" telling people they're ridiculous taking common sense measures (which, again, seem capable grasping). I'm actually impressed able maintain consciousness level cognitive dissonance exhibiting. joking 'joke' forced cringe. Except vote. Free speech. Right assembly etc they're close retirement age portfolio mostly bonds conservative investments. Fuck Sun saying wearing masks made people die?

[This (and many others) would much disagree you. 

Also I'm curious logic this. specifically support scientific process? think masks cause death? line thought genuinely cannot fathom came conclusion. I‚Äôd rather Korea. Missing footy games better rules live under. would almost guarantee wear mask based posts here. Turns common sense really hard people. going see Megadeth already cancelled previous year Ozzy. Totally fine, symptoms all. people's faults failed recognise many people saying back March, measures could never sustainable social toll take people far great. know lied probability actually stopping thing tracks, obvious going happen 95% countries planet, restrictions waves would return. 

If young healthy, go try enjoy short time planet. Stay away elderly vulnerable. grow old, come terms mortality never demand younger generation sacrifice year life extend one already fortunate enough live fullest. Third spike first wave Well, I'm pretty sure Finland we'd lot worse situation use anyone elses rules.

In Finland boarders closed soon start pandemia. Even capital region isolated rest Finland couple weeks (with quite easy exeptions).

We never closed industries, bars restaurans. workers had, recomendation work home possible. Schools put distance learning kindergardens open atleast theory, took childern home - like did. People shopping normally Ikea such.

Toilet paper run - momentarily. lot paper ndustry, worked around clock. Friend works Finlands biggest fully automated logistic center. panic buying everything running 100% capacity.

We even mask recomendation end summer. Even strong recomendation - mandatory. idea social distancing effective socialising mask + masks public spring.
Now masks easily available people use quite nicely.


That comes situation Poland... worked Polish people. heard 100 different variation ""KURVA!!"".
What comes work safety, Polish people seem care. seemed go convinient way, regardless moderate risk.
The current figures covid cases Poland shoking, I'm surprized, seeing carelessness culture.

How ever, Poles met efficient. I'm positive, Poles get shit together take seriously.
Take Covid seriously, get shit together. What? thats impossible! TX new case rate hasnt risen much all!  


:/ futility updated dataset trial reviewed October 26, additional COVID-19 patients hospitalized setting receive bamlanivimab. recommendation based trial data suggesting bamlanivimab unlikely help hospitalized COVID-19 patients recover advanced stage disease. add 99% covid19 cases were, means Australia basically covid-free. Posting looking mirror again, huh? won‚Äôt stay normal long I‚Äôm sorry say really effective therapeutic found yet decadron patients needing high oxygen. vaccine bust point lock downs work anymore. Social distancing complied anymore unfortunately. Humans tired people jobs. gotta vaccine gets us misery. England. Schools last thing close come close another lockdown Yeah I'm sure boyfriend would that...and care I've exclusive relationship 10 years either... Sri Lanka another example island advantages. country high population density, coast India (on track cases), still havent hit 8000 total cases crux statement border controls work, true. Finland dramatically lowered daily infection rate via combination mitigation policies preventing people entering country. Border restrictions loosened summer infection rates increased dramatically people countries much higher rates infection brought virus here. Therefore, **BORDER CONTROLS WORK**. really look study video Ivermectin Vitamin linked.

They gave hospitalized patients vitamin analog (calcediol/calcefidiol), results impressive even vitamin study. 

Ivermectin shown effective anti viral many viruses. look different Cov-2. consider Poland progressive democracy pandemic, ie global USA thing. look world graphs obvious we're still first wave, case growth increasing steadily almost without break.

In US initial regional outbreaks virus settled case growth widespread. virus building steam really positioned explode massive way winter/holidays flu season. US population largely giving surrendering virus. getting Americans simply ""listen science"" take care health achievable, 42% obesity rate. can't even get country take care something that's entirely control. absolute fuck would anyone right mind expect us control force nature? 1) ""Look dexter, cute get run lab whatnot, there's reason required, law, tell there's positive test. that's job ends mine begins. job ends, test diagnose. That's do. stick lab, drawing blood, testing me, continue answering calls questions tell to, law requires""

Gladly! would love continue serving responsibilities assigned üôÇ sure relevant argument, though.

2) ""Furthermore, obviously homophobic.""

Ahh, classic ""homophobic bigot"" card! üòÇ Give single thing said homophobic (you can't, never did). Maybe learn remove ""oppression"" glasses look science plus listen experts explain rules place.

3) ""You aware women sex men msm category also allowed right?""

Of course know that. know donor eligibility criteria place. That's literally job. get point, though.

4) ""But obviously also including ""ban gay men"" along people msm category.""

Huh? course not. talking ban MSM. making sense.

5) ""I indeed believe quite homophobic""

You're free believe anything want, even true üôÇ That's beauty free country.

6) ""and good thing client centered area medicine.""

That's thought too. then, learned training still get exposed public patients ask results, screen donors blood bank. That's still developed good people skills even though treat patients üôÇ

7) ""You seem biased therefore, unqualified provide actual, unbiased analysis topic.""

LOL irony extremely palpable üòÇ

8) ""I think I'm done discussing bigot thinks knows anything disease prevention, works lab.""

LOL never actually pretended expert disease prevention, accusation baseless üôÇ You, hand, pretending expert Blood Banking. one going lane. Stick know, junior. Let blood bank experts handle blood bank, stick handling community work üôÇ Radioshack entered chat don‚Äôt think so. think it‚Äôs going hard stop another blow relax contact, tracing, distancing mask wearing yourselves. Getting zero probably isn‚Äôt realistic. Continuous moderate restrictions like masks wearing better super harsh ones several times year. even tougher time compliance next time. wondering anyone going mention elephant room thread. lockdown new science, known millennia

This first time history tried quarantine majority world, healthy people, prolonged period. \#JustQuebecThings Sweden lot prevent fatigue fewer restrictions quite consistent strategy throughout pandemic. Nevertheless, illogical measures caused reactions. example, public performances 50 people allowed (the limit lifted 300 recently), restaurants could host 50 guests. one absurd situation performance singer sit dinner caused event labeled concert closed down. Would basically impossible stop people coming state live in. border Kansas Nebraska large quite obviously boring, western side too. little chance happen every day, unfortunately, big market turn would disastrous Trump.

Large cap growth mutual funds. know market inflated due Fed stocks wildly overpriced, let's real one invested sweating today's pullback.  Can't confirm specific hospital, I'm government agency told ""prepare vaccine coming November"". borderline impossible one here, make sure ready. Luckily beds cleared banning abortion.

/s Meanwhile, Houston ISD refusing close despite positivity rate thresholds met. strange footage like stopped italy? least seen footage patients. Maybe saw reality often people think pandemics That's public information, people's medical information private unless (or families case deceased) decide share it. could check obituaries wanted, grieving families often choose include precise cause death. support climate scientists traveling world making carbon pollution attend conferences achieve reductions. support going war make peace either. Oh god giant fucking baby. anyone know Australia testing asymptomatic people?  Haven‚Äôt heard though excess mortality. Graphs show amount people dying previous years. Nothing see it‚Äôs regular flu season. context I'm guessing Lillies multiply like weeds? fear anxiety hammer economy even harder. economic damage become self-perpetuating. People sick scared spend less. lead layoffs. absence substantially enhanced unemployment payments, people laid curtail spending, spawn layoffs. 

People opposed lockdowns cite economic damage reason (among others) opposing them. U.S., seems little evidence support belief. States, like Iowa, hardly shutdown seeing downturns economic activity little different happening states.

Hopefully vaccine immunize enough people say September 2021 contain spread virus allow people sufficient peace mind resume pre-pandemic levels activity. able impoverished businesses employed gone. would good time America's politician's open economic text turn ""Keynes"". question differ one thing another. people take mental health seriously dismiss ""whining"".

If able watch sports match go party something would alleviate mood someone feeling depressed suicidal, would probably put person ""eat shit"" category actually killed himself. Yeah Lets see March-April. specific, incredibly high risk public housing towers temporarily. memory.

At worse, 700+ cases day. know someone full shit get NYT NYP confused. Yep - meanwhile China locked sealed entire province week right Chinese New Year (biggest holiday year), entire country basically quarantine

Now granted, back fear COVID since knew little it, could imagine country like USA tried impose lockdown week Christmas? honestly bit ignorant Europe restrictions believe Victoria one harshest longest lockdowns world, including restrictions like:

- leaving home 4 reasons: groceries (once per day), exercise (1 hour per day), essential work caregiving
- 8pm 5am curfew
- mandatory masks
- shutting basically everything, retail. Food/drink takeaway only, gyms, hairdressers etc shut. grocery stores normal albeit capacity restrictions, distancing etc
- able go 5km home
- visitors bar exceptions (if live alone nominate 1 person one them)

We long pdfs regularly outlining rules exhaustive yeah. locked hard 100 days. Honestly probably least happy I've ever life get true freedom back worth it. nearly everyone going affected way

Debatable, considering Chicago schools still closed, many school districts elsewhere across country running partially open schedule, still others essentially back old times.

That may viable argument pretty much every state closed year back May so, unfortunately you, really hold well now. Let‚Äôs school summer. teachers that?? want give precious summer time off?? Hospitalization numbers high either first second wave either. Still 46,000 70,000 previous two peaks. Australia big getting handle asked mom (quarantining) going happen, said would ask sibling. 

And youngest sibling never even replied group text talking visiting holidays. 

So... I‚Äôm feeling great that. makes sense - us, one person got infected outside home, five others got infected home.

Preventing initial infection[1] prevents cases.

[1] FWIW possible case, likely acquired hospital trip, would many others. Thank you! daughter surgery 9 weeks remove tumor (cancer) ended needed blood infants low count 9 weeks. know thankful! Without people like wouldn‚Äôt today! Hell bet efficacy gonna around 80% +. got this..... confirm. germophobe guard become increasingly lowered. like it, cautious long. Texas one embarrassing states state senator full reopen crowd blows mind. Like like policies before, always thought one moderates party. course last year gone way deep end sharing kinds covid denial stuff. supported whole thing said lock downs unconstitutional. feel like I'm living crazy land. Texans were, couldn‚Äôt said Trump, Kushner, Republican politicians. called taxes. Maybe understand. adults pay taxes, children nearly enough compensate (that's literally excess death stats tell us). So, hospitals reach capacity... means death rate surely climb.

It's almost bunch smart people predicted already. ü§î  Meanwhile, still dumbasses reddit replying big deal states opened fine individual actions make difference

That's kinda problem. people making individual actions stupid. 20 137 started show symptoms? governor unilaterally outlawed shelter place orders executive order. health official, mayor, judge, council impose restriction governor currently imposing. Nothing permitted enforced including mask ‚Äúmandate‚Äù. 

This curfew. Hmm. Makes wonder demographics who‚Äôs testing positive frequently right now. People typically ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù middle night like 25 under. virus isn‚Äôt spreading workplaces business kids/young adults socializing night, makes sense institute curfew. CCP concentration camps? EXACTLY feel...it‚Äôs like groupthink masking social distancing really Houston. Slight tick since September relatively stable.

like I've said before, worry growth..  cost extra airlifted another hospital? I‚Äôm asking American friend. window opportunity. think closed. first 0 case day today

This gives hope. Thank that. thanks valuable input Maybe leaders actually take seriously lead example. narratives Trump serve encourage social irresponsibility. point might far gone US given bad third wave looks be. big events like elections, Halloween, Thanksgiving Christmas coming up, see letting up.  100% you, brother/sister. We‚Äôll truck along together. Let‚Äôs keep loved ones safe unlikely long. dumb, evil. Summer 2021 I‚Äôve banking on. live El Paso whats causing surge fact people nonstop get togethers large Hispanic population large families one gets whole fam does. Fact one listens 4th July supposed canceled one listened skys filled fireworks neighborhoods full parties. Halloween coming ive personally invited several parties get togethers. Also public shaming encouraged Pipe dreams. Chances effective vacccine health care workers want get low. surprise were. Doctors basically invest pharma form educated gambling. Yep. we're fucked. Got it.  cold weather lets virus survive indefinitely surfaces even arrived yet. maybe mean yes üòÇ went **hernia surgical center** fix hernia, oh no

Yeah, that's point. believed bullshit, he'd done here. know, best healthcare world likes tout. saved probably half cost done USA. 

I thought hated socialized healthcare. mean, constantly votes taken away . . . exactly said. want pay, we'll treat you.

Yeah, understood point. understand mine. hard part social distancing would public transport. really hard congregate crowded bars, beaches host excessively large parties. Imagine late November pandemic reaches worst levels yet, election contested, results delayed, Biden goes hiding, right wing extremists conducting terrorism extreme weather events hits country China blows US ship South China Sea. show reputable poll like either two projected that. occurs none vaccines get approval? Fatigue, case us one giving fuck. Ppl following directions, governments nothing stop it. Middle class Americans literally travel South Mexico affordable surgery North Canada affordable medicine. 

American Healthcare amazing rich. measures U.S. not? suggest could/should do? thought day. shit won‚Äôt even end Biden president idiot‚Äôs supporters keep refusing federal mandates taking court it‚Äôs sunk cost fallacy politically. We‚Äôre screwed there‚Äôs widespread vaccination. coming recession going *bad*, they‚Äôll blame everybody it. It‚Äôs child abuse  startling thing actually ride achieve herd immunity gonna like literally years. YEARS THIS. Cue Lubbock, Midland, Amarillo... areas work. Friend mine ER doctor El Paso. Said move ton covid patients ER floors literally beds left. Everything full. want be. never stopped killing ppl. looks like Westmoreland County hotspot now. pretty mild week two ago. Trump rally seven weeks ago. Maybe contributed. Neither ‚Äúlive virus‚Äù. build test trace. don‚Äôt. president literally mocking people wearing masks 2 weeks got virus. Never gonna happen admin. grew there, hs? country 15 year old boys. So... zero public evidence efficacy vaccines. best thing humanity right accept long haul adapt that. New Zealand, Australia, Finland Norway now? ""a cases could covered up.""

It work way, reason they've able keep control large part due contact tracing system. system completely fails try cover anything up.

Also underestimate social media China estimate much information control government has, yes keeps tight control official media censorship long long way 100%.

This reaction 1 case found neighborhood recently http://imgur.com/gallery/UkGC06e
Those medics rushed scene test anyone could possibly exposed (950 people apartment complex) images instantly local social media groups, everybody knew long official statement. can't kept secret. think 100k incoming Wednesday. time Halloween. Lockdowns continue there‚Äôs vaccine. virus go round round long kids going school person. Distance learning garbage little kids cannot sit lectures, schools intermittently opened closed. NEED light end tunnel 

This. lockdowns, social distancing etc end date least something look forward too. least there's end inevitable earthquake it‚Äôs going much devastating? listen Trump say spikes ""gone"" last debate. 

He either:

1) know what's going major cities or

2) Knows telling straight dirty lies. 

Which one better? bet people follow order yeah know people wear masks get social distancing hard man wear mask. So, literally, almost entire GOP? ‚ÄúWhen get acceptance?‚Äù 

Fucking never. stupid takes opposite intend. nothing matters anyway, might well burn mask go lick doorknobs yesterday. one ‚Äúaccept‚Äù permanently. Giving people hope going make likely comply. never happen either. punitive actions

What involve? Buckshot? forget much ounce prevention worth pound cure. Fair. think we‚Äôre close common ground here. Obviously U.S. could way better, states like California New York role models states copy approach. arguing many effective measures China + successful eastern countries wouldn‚Äôt work U.S. due privacy laws culture say did. said areas around el paso similar around fort worth, might case. That's nowhere close definitive statement el paso area. everyone dies. Nah, fuck that, park Carlsbad NM, walking river trail, huge party, like 30 people, maskless, dancing, yelling, smoking... Texas plates parking lot. anything, Texans spreading state travel. NM numbers going up, primarily driven southeast counties nearest Texas. zero proof efficacy right moment. Every success story met reality virus really is. need stop thinking vaccines savior finally admit long haul. changed humanity need finally deal stop pretending.

Edit: downvoting might help fears, change reality deal with. inb4 ""derp derrr derp muh lockdownz"" Dude, ever going recover that? Godspeed. Teachers too. Grocery workers. Damn near everyone except rich isolate comfortably. unemployment rate gone dramatically result pandemic. think lockdowns worth it, claim lived pandemic true cases. way? knew.  $16M worth jobs cleanup exactly $16M worth jobs new wells. One helps environment, helps already profitable corporations. actually tiny

According Wikipedia Department Commerce, Phoenix's population within city limits makes #5 populous city USA 1.7 million people. tiny? Buckle weeks Thanksgiving Christmas. Fucking Western-value nations. It‚Äôs fucking disgusting. Trump strongly implied hoax.

200k + deaths later, people still 'It‚Äôs hoax. There's pandemic': Trump's base stays loyal president fights Covid  Why? Yea, live San Antonio, support locations El Paso RGV area. People go across border time cheaper prescription medicine Mexico. Friend airlifted rural area special heart center, Ontario, free. true emergency, though. read article? see video? happening often seemingly absent r politics. weird! like talked someone playing coronavirus card cardplayer responds, lol. Awesome. Oh yeah forgot it‚Äôs 21st century point Mexico send support open beds Americans? pandemic absolute disaster comes women‚Äôs economic situations independence. schools closed families one parent stay home, usually woman. hard get back workforce long absence, lack financial independence women makes harder women leave relationships. Among effects pandemic increase rate domestic violence. worst thing happen gender equality since end WW2. interesting. didn‚Äôt realize bad analyses people don‚Äôt know anything = proof state fire, predicted. 

this better test volume adjusted data: current hospitalizations: worry, i‚Äôm willing wait another two weeks Y‚Äôall Texas outraged! can‚Äôt shuffle local buffet they‚Äôre HEATED. brother also never wrong guessed exact opposite

Looks like someone going wrong used strain term remember word mutation, I've got work brain right I'm fried. thank showing wrong misinformed. T\_D gone long time bud snooping ? Regardless, wrong wishing best? I'm sure many Texans kind, empathetic people wanted NYC come alright. Even entirety Texas hateful people, would still hope die virus. 

Kinda like ""an eye eye makes whole world blind,"" hate hate makes whole world... hate. small town Mexico once, came bad food poisoning. full appointment walk clinic, wait time, got antibiotics. whole visit $12 bucks insurance identical terms quality care (but faster). college football coaches big salaries, [not single coach makes $10 million per year federally limited allowed states. Well, least governor says early votes need thrown one reason another. Yep, hospitalizations way suggesting deaths come.

As goes cases rise, hospitalizations, deaths. can‚Äôt believe million cases every two days lol Trump say done hurt election. Hmmm. Hopefully makes difference, can‚Äôt imagine many places closing though dunno beat. many exemptions moving freely parts canada tale happy ending. im pleasantly uprised bubble popped. even worse that, El paso region geographically massive. pretty much entire west Texas NM border south Rio Grande. probably including parts southern NM well. swear anti-Newscorp petition comes perfect timing. conservative estimate least two-thirds mental health crisis Greater Melbourne attributed them. Kind much you‚Äôd think. Traumas relatively small percentage ER patients, care plans usually separate medical inbounds. 

The bigger thing ‚Äúhelp‚Äù hospital capacity people get scared go hospital issues likely pass away home. It‚Äôs bleak happened last wave. don‚Äôt unified data it, anecdotally 911 volumes went way spring people didn‚Äôt want get sick hospital. 12,103 dead total.

140 dead lowest rates big city country.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

what think going happen 30 days? post T__Douche ton, hard tell. vas mantener? Yeah, lot us bubbles live daily basis popped past years see reality always existed never noticed. Mine took two days went thru county's health department wow, idea. Appreciated. Screw that.

Literally. welcome!

Sadly wish necessary still looking charts üò© It‚Äôs low 31 degrees Tuesday.   Normal humans Texas did. live here, love New York hoping could tackle it. Actual mortality figures covid-19, including asymptomatic infected, thought .6 percent. 56,000,000 infected, equate 342,000. true, would mean already 36 million people infected, despite 8.7 million tested positive. seems indicate missed huge number people. That's gonna make voting tricky &amp;#x200B;

**How planning early action helped San Francisco‚Äôs Chinatown control agree, lot measures make small difference larger difference whole. Even theater pretending best makes difference people‚Äôs mental health. false. 

The D614-G mutations (Clade G/Clade GR/Clade GS -- mutations clades sub-clades, actual strains, term improperly used lot lately) infectious lethal original L Clades. higher R0, that's it. death rate/lethality/immune response/etc...

On top that, April sometime G mutations made 50% West Coast cases always dominant gets there.

They've dealing Clade majority pandemic like US general. Clade lost footing early pandemic.

Its unlikely Cali sees anything like France does. good climate especially time year lower R0. decent seroprevelance. currently one lowest cases per million US. Giving money people directly may effect birth rate, economy does. Birth rates US always gone depressions recessions economy thriving. I'm Ohio. cases breaking records last week two... really sharp uptick.  I'm really concerned hospitalizations follow another week two. would near impossible single case unreported kept hidden amount time without exposed family, gossips, rumourmongers, media, (in couple weeks) natural COVID-19 Singapore draconian criminal system.

What going mind wrote 'Yet' get downvoted saying that

They might agree way worded questions, phrased negative way. leaning towards implying trust them, even little knowledge subject. is? Climate change? China north korea mate, go visit day, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Beijing, watch travel vlogs youtube. still think china backward fuck? different every family. hard time staying away nieces nephews want see them.

However holidays absolutely getting together group. Yes mother still try likes family parties can't help herself. maintaining boundary around everyone getting together once. visit relatives separately wear mask limit time. way chance 16 us getting sick one event. creative ways get needs met low risk. might literally direct correlation holding huge rallies everywhere goes. Mostly maskless, packed tight, chanting screaming, throwing spittle everywhere...

This massive impact. Remember Shincheonji Cult Korea? Packed rallies, chanting, singing... led hundreds, thousands cases cultists. It‚Äôs different. hope cracks Dutton's shiny round head. get infected eyes well. really prevent reinfection would need face shield goggles. Goggles would ideal.   Congrats surviving like 99.99% people. Shit, hope dont go another six month lock again!

Until people take seriously lockdowns continue.  people distance, wear masks properly, part common good we'll get like countries better are.

Until then... snowed? problem one gives shit rugby Melbourne. There‚Äôs literally nothing constitutional stop interstate travel, means screwed long responses handled state local level. Buy movies??? Texas right now? lived El Paso years. moved High Desert Valley region California, honestly, similar. told pretty bad place live, got there, found West side really nice. boasted good education system new/newer schools, good shopping, decent restaurants. Rental properties bit higher expected, outrageous. family enjoyed time there.  Yep. 1,161 Thursday 1,200+ Friday. Hey yahaira! move goggles top head driving. driving alone glasses, free one ears mask loops entirely. It‚Äôs better US, still charged fees ambulances Canada vary based circumstances. Again, it‚Äôs comparable US, isn‚Äôt necessarily free. What's solution then? lol right? could also mouth reading outdoors instead inside. happening El Paso: [Wichita showing similarly steep increases COVID-19 hospitalizations. yeah people money come US special care. US people also go countries special care, common anyone saying wrong.

I doubt poor people coming US healthcare country universal healthcare bottom barrel. Don‚Äôt already tobacco use though? Employer plans commonly least Fear also keeps humans alive. NYC covid hit watching 33,000 New Yorkers get tossed mass graves sobered lot people quickly. Lockdown protests small never got traction, overwhelming majority people still wearing masks outside neighborhoods nutjobs insist big weddings, NY disciplined steady. hope doesn‚Äôt take 33,000 deaths wake people TX. Kind funny world class care yet Rand Paul goes Canada fix problem recieved neighbor beat ass. obviously talking restrictions routines everyone thread live here.

you wrong. Families don‚Äôt choice someone stay home watch kids schools childcare closed, even means reliant government. cases it‚Äôs women quit jobs earn less work involved raising children keeping home first place. Schools live closed except fancy private schools tons women working right result. No. not.

Deaths personally confirmed DeSantis' stooge DOH hovered 100 200 daily rolling average past month. total deaths epidemiogists estimate roughly 50% higher, that's taking account dramatically increased well documented lag time since put someone charge finding already confirmed deaths count.

He managed slow reporting dragging death reporting, cannot make go away. Looking forward it!!!!

Why people saying even distribution vaccine, life won‚Äôt return normal yet? missing something? finally get people stop listening idiots pushing herd immunity/do absolutely nothing approach? 

How much going take stubborn defenders balk even basic common decency aconcede approach disaster? &amp;#x200B;

the coldest winter ever spent summer San Francisco - Mark Twain. surge capacity like? Shouldn‚Äôt field hospitals stuff already? Especially Texas climate wouldn‚Äôt prevent that. wear glasses, caught yet either. 100% effective too.

Between me, conclusive proof hoax! Pfft, anti-vaxers consider vaccine worthless. people die not.

I edit anything, feel free reply. I'd OK us talking further. Well yes, put one come within certain radius, I‚Äôm reading previous comments implication 100% time outside. Meanwhile, PA serious lock prevented major breaks since March (aside hot spots) can‚Äôt even get country work together. can‚Äôt even get citizens stay home wear masks protect local health care systems. industrial effort dramatically ramp production high efficacy N95 masks summer (realistically combined eyewear) widely distributed free every US household

I think even possible. Despite everyone seems think, N95s can't reused nearly efficacy: even properly sanitized (using rubbing alcohol, example, cause far less effective) reused 2-3 times. we're talking tens hundreds millions masks needed every day (depending much lockdown demanding).

(Your window screen keeps flies mesh size that's smaller fly, N95s work like that. Virus particles small. meshes N95s actually far bigger viruses, they're given electrostatic charge attracts tiny particles otherwise would pass through. charge degrades time unless recharge -- current research -- going become far less effective sanitizing.) Dude don‚Äôt care trump, literally said that. I‚Äôm him. lol fixation funny ok. yea change it, killing people sending there. What‚Äôs point? Listen get hate people don‚Äôt agree everything say need safe space talk without objected that‚Äôs world works buddy, hope you‚Äôll learn day. good evening hope day find power accept everyone agree say. Addiction joke. pointed literal problem. choose addicts. took drug bam. Humans make mistakes. showing showing compassion individuals proves type person are. someone recovered Vicodin addiction 20 years ago broken ankle. took year get it. Guess what? doctors agreed addictive. PA resident - we're probably headed towards health system trouble, governor can't anything without risking pissing president (and losing whatever federal response might able get now) - targeted local terrorist groups  really insulting pointing poor vision people think break rules right dead wrong. insulting gives kind comfort worry free anything since internet trolls idiots scream idiocy without much backlash staying houses. Always help fellow redditor find way. French ticklers? Seconding question username signally support boogaloo domestic terrorist group dust settled we'll probably know changes human behavior ie schools Thanksgiving. L, weather. don‚Äôt wear mask take dog low traffic neighborhood relatively rural part country, never get closer 20 feet away another person, lasts two minutes. would absolutely wear mask walk dog Boston, densely-populated downtown area, multi use path I‚Äôm likely see people get stuck waiting light change next somebody. Pandemic fatigue Trump fatigue!!!! doubt that. One places world followed decisions based science look working  Reddit dense. really need /s, bro? Exactly, 2 questions responses. think prudent realize acknowledge volatility time we're living in. see point, I‚Äôm argue really, it‚Äôs great here, things also confused eu person. virus spreads little actual healthcare; might help preventing deaths severe cases, it‚Äôs government policy lockdowns, masks, etc. would prevent spread. Also think Europe densely populated USA. socialised healthcare means individual receives hospital treatment going face financial burden it, something happen quietly away headlines. think healthcare socialised, it‚Äôs upon people demand it‚Äôs properly funded, politicians act that. even it‚Äôs realised poorly, doesn‚Äôt mean idea bad, would say politicians deliberately underfund healthcare order introduce privatisation. Fellow Canadian, here. embarrassing. far behind Taiwan terms Sars outbreak, learned ton experience, didn't. Look effectively they've handled Covid. same... Terrible. ANSWER SINCE FUCKING BEGINNING.

* rapid response testing
* testing 1000x rate we're currently testing.

THAT'S TAKES. know LISTENING SCIENTISTS taking god damn look countries handling well.

But guess what? makes money coordination Federal Government's response literally ""Jared Kushner interns"" trying coordinate aid... that's going happen.

And hell continues. Meanwhile asshats supporting incompetent administration also ones amplifying problem refusing adhere basic preventative measures. we've become (or maybe along never really tested) mentally weak people need see current desires fulfulled *right now*. (We also see amount savings -- none).

Lockdown hard couple months order months respite summer (which Europe get)? thanks. *have* go party; *have* see friends *right now*. Two weeks loose lockdown already whining forced celibate monks.

And *before* considering huge proportion population led believe hoax. probable aquired see China something real spitting propaganda. major future planning different nations need prepare economically militarily. Whomever emerges full vigor first dominate areas. like new arms race power one nation hold another immense. doctor training laboratory medicine? Always pleasure meet fellow Clinical Pathologist! hospital laboratory practicing in? (This sarcasm, case get it.)

I would hardly say doctor training laboratory medicine knows *anything* disease prevention. Get back lane doc. Doctors treat, public health officials, like myself, prevent. Stop acting like know anything prevention lab doctor. UK France spiking too. Ill dying people phase Trump. Falling stock markets do. problem watching lose half value next two weeks. never happen, dream (and maybe make money trading derivatives). sorry hear üò¢ Agreed, UK could followed island nations exceptionally successful NZ Aus. Instead gave weak response, failed clamp breaking rules, took long adopt masks let everyone go summer holidays spread more. failings categorical tabloids willing call government it. someone living Melbourne, felt hopeless given media scrutiny anti lockdown protestors. holy shit relieving see everyone‚Äôs hard work paying off. Exactly. getting flu shot extra important year. flu already strains Healthcare systems normal conditions. ER American term AFAIK Whatever. win. really fucked mate, like US situation Poland.

Supremacist right wings ""defending"" churches aka beating old ladies. People driving cars protests ( ) police responding ""Well, call police"". Police throwing old ladies ground running peaceful protests insider police throwing bottle police provoke attack police: (2:30) Nobody got welded apartment, outrageous claim. High School kids shaking hands? Interesting, common way greet someone HS back early 2000s, got uni/college suddenly felt mature/adult thing fist-bumping waving awkwardly, lol. See would comforted knowing causing people sick. don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing illness, shouldn‚Äôt freaking fuck out? travelling frowned upon, it‚Äôs literally many countries restrictions, quarantine periods upon arrival return results penalties broken. double cost go destination unless desperate need tourism. many countries, theyre trying protect elderly vulnerable including Indigenous Peoples. Also second sentence started assumption ended question mark.. planes definitely 0 social distancing across North America anyways.. many flights book full capacity unless destination limits. hidden benefit current wave COVID cases it'll help speed trials vaccines. wish anyone get sick, one longest parts trials waiting see people get infected not. suspect much truth idea. doubt loons well, part, far evolved societies. well hold up, know lock downs fucked younger user base usually dominates reddit. 1/4 young people felt depressed since pandemic started, many young people felt depressed would likely lose jobs another lockdown. Young people likely work restaurants places would impacted heavily shutdown. Similar fanny packs, also exclusively outerwear Americas. Ahaha salut le voisin, je suis Alsacien avant tout ÀÜ-ÀÜ 
Ouais j'avais entendu parler de √ßa, c'est comme les virus qui ""contr√¥lent"" les gens pour qu'ils aillent dans l'eau ou au chaud etc, c'est fou can‚Äôt say would pay 99 day work hotel room. watched news. Pretty much every icu Texas 100% capacity blame people much, politicians (those government many others) told us there's nothing worry anymore, exactly straight people fear covid serving anymore. schools opened despite prepared suddenly also unprepared healthcare brink collapse. shocked_pickachu.jpg leadership ‚Äúleader‚Äù openly encourages people opposite science says. feels like worse started.

Oh wait that‚Äôs are!!!! Yeah world organization focused health. Actually schools worked Title 1 families mostly minority *for* closing overwhelmingly Blacks Latinos ones dying pandemic.

But yeah keep running talking points like suddenly care minorities. Maybe call Senator encourage offer stimulus extended UI money communities. know, actually *help* people. also helps Asia tends far, far authoritarian Western countries, value individual freedoms much more. It‚Äôs give thousands tens thousands certainly it‚Äôs rare side effects show up. Hi there, US. unhappy tell you, everyone going this. 1) yes, adult safer contagious virus stay family members. don‚Äôt know think around 100 people every day safer. Mind you, people aren‚Äôt bubble like nba was. Grown adults make decisions, much like wife have. We‚Äôve safe still enjoyed time together. 

2) $150,000 opt check would considered ‚Äúgetting paid‚Äù 99.99% people- including football players. Source that? There's evidence one way outbreak reinfections different strain whole purpose FDA ensure drug safety. department isn‚Äôt going it‚Äôs job, fire asses. Approving unsafe drugs vaccines undermines public health trust. It‚Äôs purpose. Blaming Trump bad vaccine FDA shouldn‚Äôt approved, gives cover FDA shouldn‚Äôt have. really. masks effective unless everybody wears them, even feeling sick. 

Also, 2017/2018 Nov-Feb flu season 60,000 people died. That's 500 deaths/day, half 1000 daily COVID-19 death rate summer 2020. insinuation flu big deal really justified. severe years, almost number daily deaths. quarantine covid patients separately, otherwise gonna get bunch already sick people infected covid too. That's reason building new hospital. Canada similar experience, tons tons tons sparsely populated wilderness, population packed cities along St Lawrence river, Vancouver two cities Alberta, that's really got, one major city Saskatchewan Manitoba. rest mostly empty / sparsely populated wilderness. is, without doubt, still first wave. trough waves. Please... I‚Äôve working ‚Äúbig business‚Äù 30 years. Every company culture end part culture acceptance lie make profits. tends thrive across organization regardless individuals specific department feel. Why? company values tend comes top built business practices employees accept. 

Don‚Äôt believe me? invite talk people company like Comcast, Ticketmaster, Well Fargo, Ford, Exxon, Phillip Morris begin get understanding company‚Äôs morality relative leadership. forgot Poland. It‚Äôs currently worlds hottest zone. first ever test bad all. seemed like went part nostril flairs out. feel invasive all. I've heard go way deeper, feels like pokes brain. missing something? wrong, health department, tested site work. Thanks. Forced vaccination gun point probably way government hit numbers. reason bring race. That's nonsense. hindsight may overreacted bit early on, supermarkets swamped hoarders meat flying shelves happily eating surplus beans rice sausage. able avoid crowds made worthwhile. Better late never 1) ""I this. guess keep going back forth saying need saying it, day like.""

Ahh, doctor training laboratory medicine? Always pleasure meet fellow Clinical Pathologist! hospital laboratory practicing in? (This sarcasm, case get it.)

2) ""Source?""

The US FDA guidelines. Here's go page 5 document, find following:

""Following careful review options, ultimately determined available information sufficiently compelling adopt approach individual risk assessment without scientific evaluation validity asking questions regarding monogamy use safe sexual practices.""

3) ""Ah homophobia comes out. gay men fall msm category.""

LOL ""homophobic""? üòÇ used term ""gay men"" simplify wording. obviously, talking men sexually active another man, since high-risk category. seems call everything like ""bigotry"" ""homophobia"". strategy used anti-vaxxers covid denialists claim people simply shills big pharma brainwashed sheep, discredit them. greater good common benefit collective society important whims individual""

The country drafted millions men go fight die freedom Europe world twice. considered people different ideas what's worth sacrificing for.  example suppression free speech talking about, many would find offensive number covid deaths I'm inclined agree. society talking worth living in. Trump got better. Hmmmm, wonder got better medical treatment? Nah, US wealthiest nation world. Could never happen. I'm talking flights airports since March 20. Ayatollah Atlas pleased glorious Iranian people's sacrifices pursuit herd immunity. Heck, whole world. Someone tell president thinks he‚Äôs immune since it.

Reinfection still rare different strain virus. strains properties protected antibodies t-cells strains mutated make antibodies t-cells useless. country (Sweden) definitely import it. government took antimask stance day 1 people still supports it. Saw someone Twitter today saying ""my parents wanted use masks??? stopped them"" got lot support friends, laughing like parents crazy. Bear mind right-wing conservative nut jobs. Sweden, left-wing antimaskers opposition argues them. think China justified detaining 1 million Uyghur Muslims? think USA seen significant spike (or least of) protests, open-air gatherings significantly safer we're really woried - crowded rooms. Especially people use masks (it seems do) Tell feel 100%. compliance broad population critical. figured, sarcasm humor hard enough parse internet without (at least) two sets informal cultural ""rules"" observe. thought developed asthma previously not. 6 months persistent coughing, went away. longer use inhaler dr recommended Im pretty much prior sick. notice Canadian envious you. would 1000% trust every country said American high hopes anyone trusting government puts out. anti vaxxer means even trust Trump administration put out. days away election hope everything goes smoothly. primary source saying seasonal component? Yeah that‚Äôs hard let‚Äôs masks lockdown forever. apparently hard people like me, too. Yeah vaccines kept within specific temp ranges, can‚Äôt set -100 expect flu, measles, etc vaccines okey dokey. vast majority pharmacies extra deep freezer laying around. think not. lockdown long complete know can't go another one. Yup, Bill said backing mass production 7 different vaccines, ultimately would end going 1 2 back further. would result least $1 billion effort ""wasted"" vaccines pan out, bought 6-9 months worth time would save millions lives. First may US American got one wrong. 

My life disrupted year issue, future children education especially one IEP keeping awake night, idgaf much. least worry finances health issues (no one household risk) least special need, see things say convince fall back sleep? Draining

And give break, covid19 denier anti mask family done right thing start. Children even get sick 99.9% okay, tiny fraction complications barely relevant. children hurt covid19. Check freaking privilege, glad none kids difficulties keep high ground morals bs. Maybe forced nobody even suggested point. Government still pretending control despite fact shitshow regarding covid many aspects thier rule. inventing fake virus nothing concerned about. Low dose aspirin? take one day. Good heart disease also (which also trying get) We‚Äôre trying‚Äîhopefully we‚Äôll get sense whether worked middle next week. So, corner turning vanishing going start? bit topic something really get. Many countries problems protectiong risk groups result this. Finland far opinion lot cases hospitalized/dying. mam works cafeteria cleveland suburb high school that‚Äôs hybrid currently. She‚Äôs risk floored (because doesn‚Äôt need work - she‚Äôs fed stuck home - won‚Äôt listen stay home) well school staying open despite cases. They‚Äôve back think two weeks now. 

I wondering county purple soon entail changes schools. It‚Äôs fiasco I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre dragged along. graph totally unreadable context. know numbers refer to. 

What know Swine Flu pandemic 2009 far less deadly even normal flu age groups. contagious, massively cases. much less deadly, actually big concern. 

And concern schools kids get sick die. concern bring home virus parents grand-parents. wish Americans passion children 3rd world never chance education. 

Again, entire world war status quo disrupted EVERYONE!!! contact tracing level Europeans North Americans would simply comfortable with. recent outbreak Kashgar China, learn happened links subreddit.

The first asymptomatic case (a 17 yo girl) travel history public last two weeks something like that. China (before people bring politics in), far know Korea similar system too. Bars shit live already 100% open. imagine it‚Äôs gonna another huge spike, like saw Labor Day. shit show man. new COVID-19 cases another death, 353rd Laredo community, reported city county Monday. man early 60s died COVID-19 reinfections also confirmed area, Laredo Health Director Richard Chamberlain told reporters Monday. Four patients women, one man; two 20s, two 50s one patient 70s.
A case considered reinfection span least 90 days two PCR confirmatory tests, evidence recovery plausible reasons patient would test positive again, Chamberlain said. 25% would symptomatic then. ppl wear masks, decrease spread equivalent amount. Better zero mask wear, right? follow that? Yes that‚Äôs far enough apparently. 

I don‚Äôt believe France hands approach, could didn‚Äôt enough beds staffs realized control virus instead trying play red line. 

This virus seems contagious counteract, even progressive restrictions slow down, going hit ICU limit eventually forced locked down. Reaching plateau lockdown looks impossible. Asia right approach seems. OMG, like Stalingrad factory workers finishing tank getting board driving front levels desperation. translation thing. Source: speak fluent Polish English. term pap smear Polish Cytologia ginekologiczna usually shortened Cytologia. English, cytology means study cells culture. rational fear getting COVID stuck hospital months way rational fear getting car accident. scary happens, fear let control life.

I'm going participate races I'm going wear seatbelt though.

I work hospital. I'm exposed. deal that. cannot deal people think rules basic decency refuse wear mask isolate feel sick. Probably zero immune response, still susceptible catching disease, opposed group full immunity. point assume full immunity get vaccinated.

If get vaccinated visit grandparents, example, might bad idea still wear mask practice sort distancing pandemic over. least that's I'll probably do. Seeing rest world succumbing second third waves whilst we're coming 100+ day hard lockdown makes feel much satisfying. 

Couldn't proud Victorian. Fuck Murdoch media bombarding us politically biased deliberately divisive articles. definitely feasible long term...but that's online teaching.

What proposing practically ""do nothing think it"" method. masks they're troublesome somewhat uncomfortable. Go work let companies lose money. Go school cause kids lose education. restrictions, cause problems delays. method leads tremendous amount people getting infected 4% dying. 4% might seem like much, highly infectious, yes, bad. 

Trump seems like ones would extremely troubling symptoms survived literally hospitals/medics around got worse got bad. rest us luxury. ""Go home get really bad, come back"". get multiple medics make sure get worse. medics get bad, even precautions. experimental drugs Trump afforded. 

&amp;nbsp;

What need think things listed (schools, work, restrictions, etc). Instead, think save people still everything. 
**Schools?** Distance learning. learn, teachers teach. propagation virus within schools large communities. 
**Work?** Distance work. can't, set stringent rules help customers employee contracting virus. 
**Restrictions?** Dude, distance line. Longer line, yes safer line. still gotta without infecting others. 
**Masks?** wear it, even uncomfortable. 



&amp;nbsp;

Literally things done way instead exuberant amount people getting infected. Much prefer empathy guidelines help curb virus' spread.

&amp;nbsp;

We're same. I've met great Germans, I've met assholes too. I've seen Muslim fundamentalists, one greatest people know Muslim. kind think statistically many Poles assholes online, maybe second hand embarrassment much stronger see tend remember them. r/NotTheOnion Wait, **you** joking? seriously contemplating Bundeswehr undertaking kind solitary operation Europe?! country still running ad campaigns less.

Deploying German armed forces part NATO action Kosovo controversial AF domestically. Bundeswehr touch anything related Poland regulatory 10-meter stick, precisely fears reminding everyone 1939, Molotov-Ribbentrop pact horrors transpired after. Especially current Polish government's recent efforts somewhat rewrite history Holocaust. America also 5x population France, clearly explained comment IIRC depends city ? sure know mandatory city (and think country.) Constraints liberate, liberties constrain. What's covid tracker app? Running 0 cases really feasible France, given Europe riddled COVID extent spread. leak back in. couple extra weaks eliminate it. Melbourne (and regional Victoria) locked early July hit 0 cases today. cases hopefully contact-traced 0 New South Wales seems doing.

France might able go aggressive system suppression restrictions requiring social distancing perhaps local lockdowns South Korea-style notices keep people away hotspots. Oooooooo spooky.

In lesser fear mongering, el paso experiencing first wave coronavirus, interesting fact goes hand hand number hospitalizations, el paso 33rd fattest city America, 1st diabetes. 

There many impoverished people already bad health, honestly, seen coming. military went northeast spiking first (I know live connecticut) even set 'pop hospitals'.

Where actually need them? used here! fucking joke, said everything could help people. not.

It's republicans. them. NEED burn mutherfucker down. let Biden getting elected make feel like people actually won. 

The media start preaching morales back, yes. still going horrible situations financially people rich PLAYING US. always been. Lockdowns work, look Victoria Australia. 0 cases today. Thanks! No, put profits life. Masks covid could also fixed top policy welcome!  Singapore quasi island?

It‚Äôs excuse countries fail manage covid say it‚Äôs impossible unlike it‚Äôs island. Singapore shares border Malaysia Malaysia js well covid. 

Vietnam also shares borders could questionable stats. look recent YouTube travel / food videos, see people enjoying less mask use, like Australia. 


Now compare western countries. Canada shares 1 border yet cannot bring covid cases low level. Canada alright, much better g7 counterparts, can‚Äôt low?

- government quarantine facilities, despite many empty hotels 4 airports accepting international travel could repurposed quarantining. Canada spent lot $ paying hotel stays Syrian refuges yet couldn‚Äôt bear cost (or impose cost travellers) mandatory quarantine 

- inconsistent government messaging

- slow government actions; Australia HK korea, new cases get 10+, start get nervous start limiting bars restaurants. 

Compared Canada, notation, new cases 150-200, Ontario proud... new cases 800, government starts limit dining 100% legal. Right refusal. 0.7L( pint) intelligent response. surprise NPC can‚Äôt form rational argument Hahah yas! Meaningless. it‚Äôs 80% effective virus endemic Sorry shitstorm here, really done hard yards finally bearing fruit. shepp response great


Worries bit community spirit y'all have. dhhs seems task now, hopefully... Slovakia mass testing population. require quarantine upon arrival. early ones imported cases. first community case March. Hence instant lockdown. Unreal. Sounds like there's plenty ways family could fall cracks end homeless like breadwinner household gets sick. America seems operates like 50 nations rather states. best bud, next months maybe rough ride us all. 100%, hotel quarantine happened, people can't take single day's break whingeing pat backs collectively kicking virus piss off.

Upvote heavy heart You‚Äôre stupid keep conversing with... Unblinding ""imminent"" Oxford/AstraZeneca trials, according Professor Adrian Hill - running trials.

Thank god nothing happened fever. would wracked guilt it, him. stupidest excuse heard. developing third world countries enforced mask mandates significant fines people no-bs-pseudo-medical-excuse attitude.

Well, us bother check expectations reality. I've hear read layers - Frontline workers vulnerable, going age groups get least vulnerable category. There's even discussion around separating races, there's higher chance BAME people could become ill, might jump ahead - say - 50 year old white males.

It‚Äôs like alone fighting White House. eggs Vaccine + contact tracing bucket Sick leave provisions, social security subsidised healthcare make control easier people supported stay home get free testing. perfect compared US support people need isolate much better. MUH FREEDUMBS! BTW...I noticed gave blood last week, drugs used PrEP added potential deferral list. articles say within 3 Well, she‚Äôs Staten Island. explains it. Plus assholes driving though Canada way Alaska - really Automation take 85% current jobs within next 30 years. It‚Äôs summer yet... Summer doesn‚Äôt start December. 

It‚Äôs cold Sydney today - 14 degrees! I‚Äôm wearing 3 layers dressing gown. Definitely summer weather. Never ask how, ""how high""?

( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) Can‚Äôt wait vaccine yet I‚Äôm terrified shape we‚Äôre going (figuratively literally) comes. That's really weird given states territories Aus managed control virus fall completely eliminate community transmission winter. also another coronavirus pipeline too. SARS 16? years ago. MERS 10? COVID. 3 novel coronaviruses 20 years, meaning expect another novel coronavirus arrive decade well...I hope learned manage things better future, fact world seems fractured even last 9 months give much hope. confirm, think partially immune, reason. 

I Austrian doctor working Sars-CoV2 pos. patients months now. Currently caught myself. symptoms light cold. even realize CoViD lost sense smell 5 days. meantime passed several checkpoints hospitals, bars, etc. highest temperature I've ever measured 37,4¬∞C.

Besides leg hurting (I hope thrombosis due nature CoViD19), feel sick, although want sleep usual.

Until realized is, insufficiently protected contact ~20 people.

I still young, might factor well, nonetheless symptoms seem unusually slight, even oligosymptomatics words support lifelong mandatory masks mandate never go away? LOL top insanity, masks don‚Äôt even work preventing spread, science backing up, basically it‚Äôs illusionary safetyü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è rumour France avoid second total lockdown instead curfew revised 7pm-6am lockdown weekends.

So basically government saying go work, think anything else. wonder, Fauci lied us, would meant deaths NYC March less overall. Looking researcher perspective always going biases randomisation, counties chose whether implement mandate. economy hurt most? Theirs.

Nope, try again. literally proven wearing masks work. Yep. spike summer America sunbelt AC necessary since hot humid. People eating inside, spreading everywhere. north, Europe, people outside, generally tamped down, big outliers like Sturgis. rising north there's freaking snow outside.

Lol clue, article english I‚Äôm hospital Spain right follow up. employee came said needs someone donate blood. couldn‚Äôt I‚Äôm recovered COVID enough want tax body, found alarming need go around asking people hospital waiting room. Incidentally, normally give blood whenever can, including COVID pandemic. I‚Äôm still bed 1/2 day though, would said yes. God hope true. I'll never take anything granted again. miss life. miss family gatherings. miss around strangers mall stupid crap like that. miss everything, im tired, depressed burnt out. done I'm going flight dont know home. remember around May-ish lot people claiming heat would kill COVID off. wonder they're gonna saying getting cold again. El Paso school districts already said they‚Äôre going back physical classes case AstraZeneca Oxford university collaborates vaccine development. means vaccine thinking of. live New Zealand virus eliminated yet two friends think conspiracy evil Jacinda Ardern ruining country. want us open borders immediately. insanity everywhere.

I've edited earlier comment try keep deleted. understand hundreds political comments mine gets deleted instantly. one, use population density calculate numbers. Leaving aside wisdom this, obviously false number. France 120 people per km squared, obviously can't less people per mile squared... Speaking grunt work, grab site (statista) pops making blindly obvious error threw search google? Cost living areas, also used living certain lifestyle may planned long without work. Trump capable good leader frenzy get fuck office. 

The part chaps ass he's running campaign ads Pennsylvania saying ""TRUMP ERADICATE CORONAVIRUS"" I'm like... how? steps taking? measures taken? Outside closing travel China way back beginning, single thing Trump done help this? Look, said before, correct use word.

Only believe refer apples ""oranges"", ""orange"" correct use word case. Check local places donate blood! lots colleges organizations blood drives, especially now. may able find one accessible blood donation center. Accurate. bloody North Face jacket...

For whole Vic lockdown, entire mood swung someone else‚Äôs sartorial choices Every single state territory Australia second wave, Victoria unfortunate breach one quarantine hotel probably 2 4 staff took home (another reminder insidious infective virus is).

Victoria another wave, surveillance contact tracing job.

The big difference Victoria Czechs heading second wave, Victorians brought lockdown back effectively get result Czech leadership put far long, hence Freedom Covid rate. Look, said before, correct use word. fight me, fight folks make decisions, ones listening tho ones making decisions. point getting hung something clearly grasp.

Bye Test results back 24 hours  difficult understand? 

Sorry new reddit, 26k comment karma people used it. think us fairly happy way things gone though lot pain lot people.

Its going nice going out. Well it‚Äôs Texas countermanding local mitigation orders orange god King doesn‚Äôt believe coronavirus 20 cases , one. puzzling. isolated cases, could make sense false positives. could small level community spread. today, 137 asymptotic cases China. found regular testing (of one person checking close contact) seems possible could certain small scale community spreading without seriously ill patients. also shares borders one could question stats still developing country.

I Vietnam covid broke out, mess around. one rich girl Hanoi broke stay home orders literally locked large parts Hanoi her.

Same spread broke Da Nang, got hundred cases literally closed entire city forbade travel there. People died say ‚Äúmuh rights.‚Äù Also, isn‚Äôt millions years real living lost young, middle aged, older worth last year two elderly? They‚Äôd agree too. Wow, guy got lot publicity. Good what's right.  come conclusion response? 

My question was: freedom right hurt people? ok never see eye eye  people couldn‚Äôt right thing wear masks avoid needless gatherings, everything shut way again.

It‚Äôs pathetic cycle stupidity. Brought maskholes ‚Äúpatriots.‚Äù unfortunately speak german refreshing sincs 11st October?

doesn‚Äôt happen nearly often penis! feel way able moat poison spikes outside house. bastards. hope get something soon!! Oxford said vaccine triggers strong response well! I'm really really hoping vaccine around corner. We're turning corner. don't, frank... think ambulances That's Italy.   Oh South Africa too. Clothes/technology/stationary/art supplies/hardware stores... basically anything wasnt food/fuel/medical supplies/hygiene products etc available 3 months. fear US, already shown they‚Äôre willing weaponize virus even Almost anyone Spain wearing mask. Specially since mandatory, heavily enforced (1 million fines first 2 months, 46 million country). 

It matter densities. Metro, work, schools etc. Part pandemic become politicized. unified front cohesive message day 1, don‚Äôt think would see nearly amount people protesting safety measures. Lockdown fun, absolutely loathe I'm really looking forward seeing people seen months...

...but like something recognize done right call make.

Some people seem understand duality loathing something completely yet fully supporting there's question least worst option available. false positives. Japanese government, example, confirmed second test, student arriving Taiwan tested negative.

If community spread Taiwan, would obvious. country open people even wear masks public anymore. I've going sold baseball games summer without issues... costs $5usd see doctor, community spread, hospitals would slammed. ""If want virus"" Keep telling 7yo time fall tree stairs. Emergency room visits ideal currently. Restaurant ownership extremely risky investment high failure rate ideal economic situations.

Sometimes right move close conditions improve close entirely, using available capital survive open business conducive economic situation‚Äîbefore bled debt deep lose everything personally opportunity adapt pivot opportunities.

Hanging weeks/months limits future options, exposes owners legal risk, places responsibility owners instead government supporting population pandemic‚Äîand forcing desperate people work unsafe unnecessary jobs, often net loss owners, serving irresponsible entitled segment population. Texas weird fuckin place socially. mean, literally different country far back nation's history. Places like San Antonio Amarillo artsy liberal, got places like Houston. Uh huh. Funny accuse anyone else sheep, like tricked believing baseless nonsense. poor gullible fools. working capitalist countries, though differing degrees capatalism. Rampant capatalisation like US arent sole cause inablity deal No, incorrect. people still keep upvoting this. guys love gloat America's failure. actually believe it. Europe learned hard way cooperation always best way forward. Fuck yes. 

We gone 750 cases day zero, something US couldonly dream of. 

Having hell, appreciate need wear masks, use hand sanitiser wear masks means Australians able celebrate Xmas families. holiday across breadth width amazing country (and hopefully New Zealand soon) without fear.

And importantly hug elderly, immunocompromised mother without fear killing her.

France, always making America look good comparison. highly doubt handful retirees live Mexico. others suggested, border towns like Ciudad Juarez make Detroit look like Shangri-la. Mexico isn‚Äôt exactly Florida. public stomache it, restrictions curb country rich enough. I'm expecting many European countries probably least go partial localised lockdowns.

Get lawn! mom‚Äôs BMW nothing this. dont believe word chinese figures us next door. sorry say even countryment overseas hardly welcome atm :( Dutchman here.

In March Europe took 6 week lockdowns effective, could re-open somewhat Guess depends want kill granny lol. work grocery store I'm sure I'll see idiots shopping tons food stupid parties. areas kids school problems. kids issue. kids problems either. kiss me, darling. We'l go international waters banana boat. Aint 6 feet there.... predictable. Ahh bugger. Hopefully opens soon! Vic gets bit control likely will. well. Taiwan positive outbound places like HK dont? must ganging Taiwan. somehow passengers Taiwan trigger false positive. Cases probably come back easily, whole country elimination quarantine people coming country. contract tracers got top notch process track contain clusters escape community. 

And testing phenomenal- unlike stories US people cannot get tests even sick cannot prove close contact positive, Aussies encouraged get tested respiratory symptoms, sniffle, cough, sneeze, sore throat want us tested. 

Add privileged weather, population distribution kick ass healthcare system.

As opposed nightmare fuel US right now. guess people want count time, sure, unless automated. I'm really sure honest. Someone still put machine either way. Oh US suppressing information? communist dictatorship. Makes sense.

And think China, country allows slave labor great number citizens ‚Äî country ‚Äúvalues human life money‚Äù.

The fact is, everyone outside Reddit ‚Äî heavily censored sub particular; lives truth covid another china-virus emerged due Chinese unhygienic wet market conditions, population density; incompetencies failures CCP lastly good old fashioned Chinese censorship. realize vaccines used induce herd immunity? dont know thats true get lot countries look like well testing covering numbers like know solution. certain strategies ever single country low deaths per capita have:

Contact tracing - either prospective (like Korea register whenever enter public space) retrospective (like Japan, hunt 'patient zero' clusters)

Testing - especially ports entry areas high numbers cases

Quarantine - Taiwan, get massive fine enter country quarantine 2 weeks

Masks 

Ventilation/filtration Unless course get new case somewhere. even allow reopening, isolation rest world near future.

But fine it, suppose OK. dont think UK third world hellhole. said, given also island(s) nation lot better position are.

The US isnt either healthcare people cant afford political divisions overriding sound medical judgment means measures wont take anyway :( Yeah I‚Äôm hesitant go well they‚Äôre taking many precautions I‚Äôd go needed sure positive exported cases almost turned negative upon second testing. probably cases tomorrow weeks remain hopeful we'll end eradicating like almost every state Australia. people get covid, 1% die regardless treatment

This overestimate. places CFR lower 1%, estimates seen IFR places excellent medical care like 0.5%.

Still scary high number though. would US still federally regulated accept gay men‚Äôs donations unless haven‚Äôt slept anyone -including husbands - anytime within last 3 months. least changed never, 1 year, this.

* encouraged people go out, ""live"" normally again, go work, lock down.
* opened schools soon.

It's current US leadership dumb, sadly global phenomena. Right Election Day huh Translation Part III:  
New Zealand liberal country already beaten pandemic second time. success New Zealanders also mobilization civility. New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, spoke fiercely ""team five million"". passionate appeal civility well received population. contrast, American disaster explained fact Trump, driven pure selfishness lust power, undermined civility divided country. politics make totally impossible feel part us.

Liberalism civility need excluded. Rather, civility responsibility essential prerequisite success liberal society. liberal society is, civility needed. pandemic teaches us solidarity is. Liberal society needs strong ""we"". Otherwise disintegrates collection selfish ones. virus easy. wanted speak also West ""factor X"" medicine cannot explain hinders spread virus, would nothing civility, joint action responsibility towards others.

This wonderful news. Holy crap. That‚Äôs terrible. Yeah. honestly know going see anything even resembling 'normal'. all, literally, self-isolate lengthy period time kill virus. know one thing or/and cannot happen. Translation Part II:  
It unquestionable Western liberalism cannot impose individual surveillance Chinese. better be. virus must undermine liberalism. However, West too, immediately forget concern private sphere soon start moving around social networks. Everyone shamelessly undressing. Digital platforms Google Facebook unrestricted access private sphere. Google reads analyses emails without anyone complaining it. China country collects data citizens order control discipline them. social credit scoring procedure China based algorithms Western credit assessment systems, FICO United States Schufa Germany. Looking way, panoptic surveillance exclusively Chinese phenomenon. view digital surveillance, already done everywhere anyway, anonymized contact tracking via Corona-App application would quite harmless. digital contact tracing likely main reason Asians successful fighting pandemic.

The word used Japanese finance minister does, however - remove unwelcome nationalistic connotation - contain point truth. points importance civility, joint action pandemic crisis. people voluntarily abide rules hygiene, need controls forced measures, costly terms personnel time.

It reported catastrophic floods 1962, Helmut Schmidt, time headed Hamburg Police Department, said: ""It crises character shown. seems Europe failing show character face crisis. Western liberalism shows pandemic is, rather, weakness. Liberalism even seems conducive decline civility. precisely situation teaches us important civility is. groups adolescents hold illegal parties midst pandemic, police try break harassed, spat on, coughed on, people longer trust State, signs decline civility. Paradoxically, Asians freedom, voluntarily abide strict hygienic norms. Neither Japan Korea decreed total closure confinement. economic damage also much less Europe. paradox pandemic one ends freedom one voluntarily imposes restrictions oneself. example, reject use masks attack freedom end less freedom.

Asian countries much liberal stamp. understanding tolerant individual differences. social imperatives carry much weight. also reason I, Korean birth, prefer continue living focus infection Berlin rather Seoul, however clean viruses is. especially stressed high rates infection pandemic merely natural consequence liberal lifestyle would adopt without ado. Citizenship responsibility effective liberal weapons virus. true liberalism necessarily leads vulgar individualism selfishness play hands virus.

Why Asia better Europe pandemic: secret civility.

The Asian continent experiencing second wave coronavirus benevolent Europe. explanation, says philosopher Byung-Chul Han, lies responsibility citizens

When asked Japan able combat pandemic successfully comparison West, nationalist-minded Japanese Minister Economy, Taro Aso, responded concisely word mindo, literally means ""level people. term without problems, Japan also used indicate national superiority. Mindo translated ""cultural level"".

This statement finance minister controversial even Japan. criticized propagating national chauvinism time global solidarity needed ever. But, face critics, Aso defends position Japanese vigorously enforcing strict hygiene measures, despite fact government plans fine violations. countries people could behave like that, Aso continued, even forced to.

First all, must said Japan, also Asian countries China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore Hong Kong managed keep pandemic control. Europe United States, hand, really overwhelmed right second wave contagion. Asia, virtually reinfection. Current infection rates low ignored. precisely countries show successfully deal pandemic even vaccine. Meanwhile, Asians watch disbelief helplessness Europeans left mercy virus powerlessness European governments trying combat pandemic.

In view striking differences infection rates, almost inevitable ask Asia Europe doing. fact China able successfully contain pandemic explained part fact individual subject rigorous surveillance, West would inconceivable. South Korea Japan democracies. countries, digital totalitarianism style China possible. However, Korea relentless digital monitoring contacts, responsibility ministries health, police. Contact tracing done technological methods forensics. Also Corona-App application, everyone without exception downloaded smartphones even though mandatory, works precisely reliably. contact tracking cannot exhaustive, credit card payments images captured countless public surveillance cameras also analyzed.

So successful containment pandemic Asia due - many West assume - rigorously enforced hygiene regime relies digital surveillance? Obviously not. know, coronavirus transmitted close contacts infected person specify without need subjected digital surveillance. meantime, already know chains infection occur, relevant briefly when, streets. explain that, regardless political system respective countries, infection rates Asia remained low? links China Japan South Korea?

This bad journalism New York Times.

But sertain trial, follow up. got sick, important information. severe symptoms got important know. Usually vaccines help even get sick, symptoms less severe body response earlier.

How ever, trial - lets say new antibiotic - I'm sure would tested life threatning situation, maybe last resort existing ones working.

But biggest point creating vaccines is, sertain diseases cure - like viruses. Better give immunize pre-emptively, do. easy cure, low risk disease, point put effort vaccine development. said nothing isolation. said everything isolation...

The last version Aachen homepage know contains lots recommendations, rather minor strict rules, nothing would compare lockdown spring. ""You get monthly $1200 stimulus caught without mask public."" Problem solved, money talks. Shut schools vaccine.

They're killing us! Yeah, people socializing indoors tight spaces now. travelling frowned upon some? Assuming one still maintaining pre-determined social bubble lower risk activities like outdoors walking around city sitting balcony laptop sunbathing beach? Planes probably distanced grocery stores. 

Of course bar-hop rage like springbreaker move around party size fifteen people. large amount community transmission, millions people likely currently sick count asymptomatic. go away overnight. first gen vaccines may 70% effective (the target minimum). 70% people get immunized (which even percentage people currently saying would get vaccine available)? We'll target herd immunity required R0 factor COVID. still need minor additional mitigation strategies make really go away. 

I expect public indoors planes wearing masks really make dent community transmission. Wearing masks standard 3-layer surgical mask might get another 80% effectiveness, talking 94% reduced chance get sick. people already infected COVID-19 earlier year?

Also small face trouble getting sort disposable mask fit properly. still providing protection cloth masks, considering specifically bought cloth masks fit face well?

If anyone answer questions, I‚Äôd really appreciate it!! RemindMe! 6 months I'm seeing lot folks celebrating rather early headlines vague words like ""ready"" ""approved"".

IMO, anything short point distribution wide populace reported on.

We still know vaccines prevent infection, prevent deadly symptoms. know efficacy rate.

What know need 2 doses, 6 weeks apart, full efficacy (whatever % is) taking place time second dose.

Even available everyone December, vaccinated immune (again, know infection-immunity deadly-symptom-immunity) sometime February soonest.

My biggest concern lead-in time is: many people, governments, declare Mission Accomplished vaccines roll rather vaccination efficacy reached peak general population. Also, someone gets first vaccine gets sick, % seek second dose? importantly American: much cost given doses? I‚Äôm NYC got beaten &amp; flattened curve. Gov. Cuomo, despite faults, early grandma killing mistakes seriously &amp; feel proved damage control done. biggest threat still remains. Covid fatigue &amp; irresponsible people party indoors. Weather drops 40s weekend, comes, plus holidays. Keep safe everyone.  Common cold coronaviruses spread best flu season air becomes cooler, drier, people largely start gathering indoors. novel coronavirus likely spreads way even ferociously immunity still widespread.

And would argue people China right free people United States. Practically speaking difference 6 person household 1 person covid 2 person household person covid.

The probability 6 person household covid lot higher 2 person household. reason people walking independently around day (6 vs 2) thus higher chance catching covid. 

Since none people family gatherings need tested negative congregating, much higher risk 6 person household meeting, vs 2 person household. That‚Äôs wondering also. Sounds like you‚Äôll need booster.

Because that's exactly drawing satirical picture mythological religious figure. highest case-count Saturday since pandemic began, like 3,300 something. Shit getting bad back argument, Australia New Zealand total 930 deaths happened Covid-19. 1,150,000 deaths world wide.


Also guy reading this, new Zealand isolated outsiders able little domestic restrictions. Thus economy still moving along. Imports/exports continued. Unfortunately yes tourism sector abysmal thats worldwide. Disagree statement government can‚Äôt much stop Covid. starters economic relief work. secondly much importantly, government shutdowns hugely beneficial. get cost vs. reward economic turmoil worth mandated closures (again, govt. economic relief would mostly solve this) I‚Äôm talking strictly effectiveness shutdowns. ordered closures non-essential business enforced said closures well capacity limits, would much better off. 

Anecdotal, know. acquaintance mine returned Singapore shit locked there. business ordered stay closed people streets sometimes questioned police business outside all.

Yay... America #1... think least mid-2022 research matter highly contested; many parts world, neither time testing capacity actually determine based data alone. Almost studies take data sets schools -- essentially include first generation cases -- hypothesize conclusion somehow young kids transmitting schools. This, labs cases confirmed following: 1) kids get infected virus; 2) kids present mostly without symptoms and/or mild symptoms, rarely tested; 3) even young kids transmit virus kids adults.  


The school thing rooted backward reasoning limited data. need SARS vaccine [there confirmed case since already since April. US ordered 300 million doses delivered EOY I'm El Paso everyday see EPT front page. Last time saw El Paso reddit August 3rd 2019 Walmart shooting killed 23 El Pasoans. 

I try avoid going unnecessarily. go Walmart often see families shopping. virus never left! Although people see around wear masks, absolutely reason take whole family shopping! make list go try verbally communicate people. simple nod wave adequate. 

What heck caused sudden surge El Paso? thing think locally High School Football. takes one kid getting it, passing teammates, pass another football team across town. players families infected adults go infect people work. problem going us lot longer anyone wants people can't seem find way stop recycling virus. real life zombies among us! They're quite like movies, lot slow slumbering fools brains looking infect others (look r/publicfreakout videos people coughing others). 

For young people get sick recover, better cross fingers hope major health issues arise anytime soon, wait 5,10, even 20 years we're going learn careless young going haunt future. watch people screen potential mates ask ""did get covid 2020?"" going want pay potential partner's medical bills 10-20 years now. Hopefully then, healthcare FREE, hold breath. SMART people, PROTECT yourselves; otherwise, ""hoy tu, ma√±ana yo (today you, tomorrow me)."" Welp Already is. nothing help.


Tests would help, foolproof. mass murderers.  üôå Two contradicting sentences right here. get fuck Well, yes... help us know many cases actually existed last spring. KNOW massively undercounted. New York spent like month begging CDC/the feds provide working tests allow develop tests prior March, tests. guarantee virus NYC well prior March, we'll never know exactly got many people managed get adequate testing infrastructure place.

So. February (or earlier, even!) virus here. tests! Positivity rate undefined, guess.

In March managed get handful tests worked, scarce rationed. like month could get tested like... showed hospital uncontrolled fever pneumonia?, sometimes even also contact someone tested positive. Obviously particular population massively biased toward covid positive individuals. happens test covid-presenting people covid? Positivity rate close 50%. course failed capture individuals mild symptoms symptoms later realized also caused disease (anosmia/ageusia/digestive symptoms/etc).

We idea many people caught back then. mom spent two months, ICU, summer '19. far I'm concerned med staff ICU nurses particular ain't making enough money they're doing. made it. 

For 36 hours sounds worth somewhat, they're paying hotel giving per diem. hangover cure I‚Äôve found actually works shot Ativan hospital. Although, almost three months clean. I‚Äôm never again. Yeah pressure trials go right all, thats completely safe unbiased died covid19, officially honored Chinese government ""martyr"", highest honor government bestow citizen dies serving China.

And last time, blow whistles considering Wuhan CDC notified Wuhan hospitals new covid strain day Li Wenliang WeChat message. Furthermore, picked news next day. hilarious Li touted ""whistleblowing"" people even bother Google covid19 timelines. Yeah talked it, understood risks agreed something we‚Äôd trouble avoiding. boyfriend brother work laborers, they‚Äôre assuming they‚Äôre ones brought home, since many guys work don‚Äôt wear masks duty. even guy work drink ton ice water getting temp taken he‚Äôd allowed work didn‚Äôt want cut job temperature. 

I guess doesn‚Äôt matter got end day. words Dwight Schrute: sometimes everything right, still fail. 

We‚Äôre lucky got mildly. feet turned blue though really weird rash awhile, interesting terrifying. Also lung spasms completely new me. Get vapor steamer happens you. helps. Oh, understand MMR prevent getting covid hopefully reduces severity symptoms. number people illegally crossing border relatively insignificant case. Surely statistically possible bring virus, tens thousands legal border crossings halted relevant data. Thousands participants Phase III around world would suggest given everyone. Healthcare workers elderly first. since say would available general population around spring, think they‚Äôd enough data effect vaccine children young adults well. Fingers crossed somehow missing outbreaks schools?

Nope... concern me. least much. worry teachers, since kids fine. Let get get back school. 

The way talk hard locking saying things like ""I gotta 9 year old that's gone nearly year without normal kid interaction now"" genuinely worries children contracting thing. probably damage kid know.

We're going quite fucked kids coming years due places/people handled year. What's baffling CEO AstraZeneca literally said expects vaccine 60% effective. 

In non-human primate study itself, AstraZeneca reported vaccine protected animals lower lungs. Nothing mentioned protection upper respiratory protection.

Beware Le Virus! Ha, synthetic perfumes always smelt/affected way.  may hypersensitive either body bit damaged edge, brain tuned constant smells daily life yet.

Try unscented products, hypoallergenic ones, use essential oils diluted water/alcohol mix want perfume spray deodorant make yourself. mean they've completed Phase II still need go Phase III give vaccine vulnerable (other healthcare workers people high-exposure positions?)

Or would enough data Phase III say there's need differentiate age groups terms prioritisation? good run. Seven days week, 12 hours days, plus per diem since road. That's one off, probably never happen again, hope well. Shit healthy way live. Right, they're standing outside calmly chatting whatnot care. children going rub snotty faces together. somehow missing outbreaks schools?

I family risk demo, hence keeping bringing them. Instead downvoting, I‚Äôm going try answer best knowledge. decent knowledge concrete numbers Andaluc√≠a, Spain Denmark. 

In Andaluc√≠a pretty good grasp infections occurring effect masks had. numbers indicate places strict masking observed, time spent together long, ventilation, infections reduced dramatically. Denmark, except little masking recently. 

Infections happening situations neither things followed. data shows behaviour changes, infections too. Meaning that, people getting infected office, preventative measures observed, people don‚Äôt get infected almost all. several case studies around globe this. Like Starbucks SK masked employees didn‚Äôt get infected. 

The point that, people wear masks public spaces you‚Äôre reducing source, people put situations measures all, infections keep getting high. Masks solution, it‚Äôs compound things.

Personally I‚Äôm glad people wear masks, really helps keep risks exposure low possible. I‚Äôm extremely careful personal behaviour everything reduce sources infection. Going run errands taking public transport unmasked people extremely uncomfortable. know mask doesn‚Äôt protect completely, compound greatly people wearing too. also makes feel like I‚Äôm alone this, like we‚Äôre together we‚Äôre trying best protect other. also helps long run believe üôÇ We've tried nothing we're ideas! What?? liability forcing vaccine onto someone gets negative reaction it? point, economy relies heavily tourism it‚Äôs understandable you‚Äôd want allow tourists back in. countries like Spain that‚Äôs 20% economic output essentially wiped out. Millions upon millions jobs gone. It‚Äôs pretty scary stuff. 

An effective track trace system would helped anything though. average life span poor areas?I‚Äôm sure significantly lower areas higher quality life. would risk may already succumbed diseases, health issues. Covid-19 wouldn‚Äôt people infect possibly kill. IMO Fair enough. idea even large sales Black Friday. Might check year China totalitarian regime contained virus extreme lockdown measures. NZ 5 million people surrounded water.

South Korea Vietnam really gold standard. countries also dealt infectious outbreaks built comprehensive infrastructure combat infectious diseases. Second wave hit, that's sure. reducing sensitivity test itself. danger others high CT value thus low amount virus.  first one researchers coincidentally already working coronavirus vaccine pandemic broke out. swapped one hit gas. Guess literally victory dance June lock country Republic hardly alone this. Cmon man kind odd take no? much trust liberals going put vaccine rushed thru process? extreme minority. pretty sizeable chunk need like 10 15% vaccine get rid herd immunity. another 10% get get immunity. Babies can't get them. Cancer patients immune suppressed. rheumatoid arthritis lupus patients taking immune suppression. Uncontrolled diabetics alcoholics, help them. black people. Ban too? capacity?? dare use word 'capacity' people like us people get sick, people die, people say Oh shit take precautions again, cycle repeats. Yes Swiper‚Äôs gonna pissed! Seems obvious. People want deals major appliances building materials...  Let's see trucker calzon say Well yes agree! Needs leaders/political system willing make unpopular choices. individuals aren‚Äôt going make smart choices own, especially social media showing everyone about. biggest issue Canada moment people content ‚Äúdoing way better America‚Äù incredibly low bar set.

But, opinion, current bar system functional enough balance people whining, keeping restaurants open minimal spread. much safer way bars opened officials willing manage properly. 10:30 last call popular decision, kept restaurant outbreaks low, kept open last six months Correct, irrelevant. donated blood tested, testing 100% accurate. Meaning, infected blood inevitably falsely test negative. best way prevent blood entering donation pool ban high-risk groups. MSM one groups. People tirelessly repeat stupid ""party bridge"" post (we already know it, smart guy posting again. Thank you), fact is, Czech Republic one first countries close borders, perhaps first one impose mandatory mask use, one strictest lockdowns. little effort find articles march april praising it, people saying went wrong.

The conclusion is: lockdowns semi-permanent work. Also, border closures might feasible New Zealand country exactly center Europe bordering 5 others access sea. point go well. Yes, troll, anti vax. half ass job got. good job like china, korea, bad situation. Exactly. human body needs time adapt.

I understand frustrating see people bars stuff wearing masks, areas masking practical. trying tell happening, I'm wondering context is. 

I'm definitely aware young people still compulsively attending gatherings, I'll bet drinking eating together, means masks. never mind Yep, watched Trump‚Äôs 60 Minutes interview well. narrow demographic see working well:

- needs quiet time work important spreadsheet report
- laptop computer
- need fast, reliable internet
- mind working tiny desk / sitting cheap chair hours end
- uses cellphone (infrequent) work calls
- earns sufficient salary justify room day rate. airport weekend full flight Dallas Heathrow. They‚Äôre already allowing flights. America exposed Spanish flu world, learned masks then, learned lessons? It's...not baby point abortions completed. death IUD birth control. March, Fauci CDC telling US residents wear masks all. Every leader US arrogant foolish, including sub's favorite hero Fauci.

I believe ploy get people hoarding medical degree masks. agree seriously backfired. US exceptionalism

Must disagree. lesson see world WITHOUT U.S. LEADERSHIP horrible. U.S. committed billions dollars protecting world infectious disease. fight AIDS today. Covid-19 happens leadership absent.

Trump cut funding PREDICT. PREDICT isolated contained infectious disease every 4 months. Two months outbreak Covid, funding cut PREDICT including scientists Wuhan lab first encountered covid-19. funding America would scientists ground isolate Covid. depended 2017 Anthony Fauci spoke GU history fighting infectious say problem much Danes went Sweden. wonder say that? literally visiting higher-level infections country returning home.

During summer time, (here NL/Europe) NOBODY anything regarding corona (social distancing / masks / etc.) R0 consistent around 1.2 / 1.3, that's lead current wave we're experiencing (a couple months exponential spread 1.3 exponent leads big numbers eventually....). Then, 'intelligent lockdown' measures, bring R0 back 0.7 0.8 (like April). So, take numbers, vaccine reducing R0 0.4 (so 0.9 without 0.4 measures), we'll extinguish Virus, additional measures bit faster without.

Point want make is, even nobody social distancing anything, R0 *slightly* 1, meaning need 100% efficient vaccine bring 1 Vox racist organization racism amplifies Covid19, Vox part reduce risk shutting down. Yeah you‚Äôre right, vaccines usually developed within days - they‚Äôre blatantly fixing it! Teacher - building, solid 2 dozen kids (our building typically houses 1600+ students) , seems like we're moving forward return school. We're running every building every bus route less 10% overall population county wide. El Paso people waited line hours sun vote. also Jill Biden visit rally. Everyone (at least non military) wears mask, many people together it‚Äôs going cause cases. Masks aren‚Äôt 100 percent effective even 6 ft small distance many people. 

Neither candidate actually follows science mail voting brainer. It‚Äôs like government actually wants us get sick Yeah agree. many US states worse UK?

Not many. higher per capita numbers, UK whole worse states. think wrong could always get abortion. Still blaming China ""inventing"" virus. Yeah, mean, going happen everywhere. ironic, could done everybody took seriously. going deaths survivors piling up. We're going deal virus years years put selfishness country aside months. getting worse, think restrictions would come back Texas. nope! Can't piss Karens Todds! Let's keep reopening everything act like we've eradicated sickness. else wanna do? Everything else seems work efficiently enough, alternative lockdown let virus spread like crazy. lead overun hospitals, lead lot deaths seeing now, lead economy lying shambles anyway. Whats magical solution this? really would love know. Yes. Japan truly simple, thing needed beat Covid flu pneumonia etc wear surgical mask street (but many public places). School closures, elective surgery closures etc entirely unnecessary super harmful. 

It pretty ridiculous truly think though. Euro countries even many Us states near universal mask compliance closed restaurants/bars schools still far worse Covid experiences Japan. And, serology study done Japan 45% Covid antibody rate, one highest world. So... definitely simple ‚Äògood Asian‚Äô stereotype see repeated often.

There's two things hate world: people intolerant people's cultures the¬†Dutch. look like this: I've never thought minute matter _if_ get COVID. Without vaccine, matter _when_. kinds reports virus causing weird, lasting side effects, even kill people. I'm willing bet vaccine given tens thousands people closely monitored significantly less risky virus itself. 

People worry ""rushed"", research basically ongoing decades make vaccines, SARS MERS. 

I'm taking soon offered me. vaccines absolutely _zero_ risk. even think that. know I'd start now. wonder world would like vaccine proven effective rolled masses. moral scold. ""We ain't going back normal cuz Y'ALL BEHAVE."" Church lady ass. completely ignores risk pool. risk pool focus, trans women part msm risk pool.

Also phrasing ""biologically still fully physically male"" inaccurate based binary approach biological sex. least, trans women hormones artificially intersex due effects cross sex hormones. Further, ignores one single ""op"". still fall definition orchiectomy? balls matter dick?

What saying seems nonsense. person sex straight man. part risk pool men sex men. completely separate group people!

You seem focused individual biological assignment even looking rational caused msm blood banned first place.

Oh refering trans women men makes cringe... don't. seem think supportive understanding trans conditions existence actual statements show.

2) correct. Monogamy asked can't always know partner cheating. again, partners PreP one cheats, still statistically impossible contract HIV pass partner. That's monogamous couples take PreP too.

JANUARY 18, 2018 2:28 PM EST

2017-2018 influenza epidemic sending people hospitals urgent-care centers every state, medical centers responding extraordinary measures: asking staff work overtime, setting triage tents, restricting friends family visits canceling elective surgeries, name pesky facts.. sucks still bad us dying. /b/tards /pol/aks. straws thing pisses much.

It‚Äôs scenario alternative (paper straws) grossly inferior turns people environmental reforms. France, pretty much Western Europe. US tracking direction. 100%. It‚Äôs like minor cold cold bad version flu. people don‚Äôt realise influenza much worse common cold. example. ‚Äúcough, cold &amp; flu‚Äù tablets cupboard people put together even though different. 

So people say ‚Äúcovid like flu‚Äù people relate common cold that‚Äôs think flu is. Wrong again. correct people dont know talking about. asocial anti social. Antisocial stuff like setting fires harming animals destroying property. harming people. want around people, dont care around people long time, makes asocial. take back right insulted teacher currently person, see even discuss returning person. observational study. type evidence used promote efficacy hydroxychloroquine rightfully deemed ineffective RCTs.

Here current RCTs done masks. Denmark‚Äôs done nobody publishing worked university; got free flu shots freebies coax us participate. Gloating pandemic easiest way anyone end egg face. recently still enough places get covid masks weren‚Äôt required (my info Switzerland btw)

-	Some schools
-	Clubs Bars (Masks drinking)
-	Offices
-	Private Gatherings

That cause lot infections Aight see bro, know downvoted though  close eyes really REALLY hard? make go away? think parents taught that, lying too?! üò≠ disagree.  put lid cookie jar... kid wants eat cookies. 

If explain cavities general health kind way, almost always come around. 

New York Post banned Twitter best recent example.  instead banning it, put simple educational flag links critical information, 80% people even looked it... let alone cared. Well, apparently going Santa-dressed promoters, thankfully got scrapped. Last Monday 13,243 cases. Initially traveling bad idea main way virus gets introduced new populations (excluding things like relatively rare fomite transmission). still bad idea could spreading new strains virus populations yet introduced into, mention bringing new strains back home. could reintroducing virus populations contained (not destination everywhere stop along way).

The chance get infected brief encounters low careful, enough people make rationalization chance spread combined becomes significant enough make risky behavior terms confining outbreaks localized regions. Kinda like chance getting struck lightning low could probably get away playing lightning rod roof cases, everyone we'd lot lightning deaths. 

Also, big part traveling seeing new sights, meeting new people hard believe people general really going sacrifice social aspect travel. kinda slesian feel same. bad cant get rid polish citizenship..... worse flu, statistically.

It isn't...you hate reality. may scroll fair bit. ever writes page likes repeat lot. Oh, reddit plenty those, too. People exhausted invites never want leave house, small talk office prison, myriad ways introvert co-opted personality trait defines person. reason isolating elective break demands, bliss. far that, even true introverts feeling Maybe points one problems many countries pandemic. Many leaders used make political career manipulation, ""narratives"" lies seem believe virus natural forces going fall bullshit like us. know another way operate. That's big business works though. someone else mentioned, area charge baby powder, absolutely nothing vaccine way, way independent scrutiny. 

I work tech company fraction size J+J never interact business units around me. 

It's like there's movie style scene bunch evil villains making decisions. I'm stylist well. Clients afraid come now. stretching appointments getting hair color much. really cut business. I'm still terrified I'm going get disease. guy voted super conservative government? reason fans/supporters back stadiums Nations League Ekstraklasa matches. I'm saying that's thing, described many steps involved, upsetting often throughout pandemic governments throughout world eased restrictions right crucial moment brief period restraint would allowed us return sense normalcy sooner. Instead we're vicious cycle shutdowns, re-opening aggressively, withdraw again. something happily surprised about. Also Janssen started upscaling exporting everywhere world risk. pandemic really revolutionised delivery vaccines. One greatly rare uplifting thing hear globalisation. done part. many fellow citizens done theirs. ""lockdowns"" many places many loopholes enforced. parts world almost back normal saw enemy fought it. many fellow citizens either acknowledge enemy refusing use ammunition fight it. 

It going long winter. Yup scares democrat leaders rhetoric Covid vaccine. Creating anti-vaxxers. Imagine Trump wins next week many people get vaccine president. Holy crap. first time I‚Äôve seen someone else saying this.

My friend, agree 10000%. 

Except outdoor dining. don‚Äôt that. don‚Äôt feel like spending money restaurants lmao. go gym/mountains instead. People getting 1200 month? Lmaoo news That‚Äôs going Texas soon

been hearing 8 months now... Good thing nobody interact or, interact with, interact ad infinitum, ever come contact old person, risk person, within two weeks. Talk statistical impossibility! Yeah, outside helped sure. Although gotta say, I'm pretty disappointed masks. thought would slow thing down, least little. Vietnam Taiwan among highest tests per confirmed case. China tested entire cities batch testing. I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre even overall. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going take nearly large effort protect people successful vaccine rollout, essentially nerfing virus vaccinating Well minorities.

There huge protests going whole Poland cause Consitutional Court ruled abbortion illegal 97% cases.

What's stupid, protesting ruling like pandemic statistics say 20% people want make law harsher? older, yes average people retirement accounts.

I've found common people twenties. honest, even vaccine guys gonna want people stay inside another year 2. Healthcare professionals: support you? help?

Apart obvious fucking careful exposing ourselves. help personally? know that, Brazil still huge sanitary problems plus huge population. Obvioulsy worst, regions, like city Manaus, sewage system cover 12% population us actually beat first wave ? state hasn‚Äôt case since mid year. opened borders limited basis. Though, looking forward us getting cases again, since we‚Äôve living ‚Äúnormally‚Äù year. signs hand sanitizer, it‚Äôs like pandemic didn‚Äôt happen. Ames IA, college town Iowa State University. school district started full online couple weeks moving 50% hybrid 100%. special need students school time. 

If interested, read story county. Gilbert school districts started 100% in-person late August. think schools districts same. school district, Ames, special case county spike August Iowa Sate University students came back partied. 

As college town, Ames steady rise new cases, number deaths barely changed months. best post forum quite while.  Republicans probably want economy tank Trump leave office January, claim Biden's economy horrible. worst things country.  Lol what?

It bullshit racist theory. difficult communicate diverse cultures..

White right-wingers huge part that, part reason diverse. cannot communicate them, everyone, made divisive issue.

It's also race, cultural political diversity also.

China instance anywhere near political diversity US have... one party ffs. 

You also geniuses like refuse address issues ignore ""racist"" suggest communicating planning amongst diverse communities difficult?

US diverse complex place planet, Europe second most. struggling PART reason why.

I love diversity want live somewhere like China everyone pretty similar race/culture/politically.

But truth. Make em dig mass graves watch bodies put in, bury them. Thank you! Frankly, think ""introvert"" wildly misused thrown around like intellectual superiority. Especially since us middle, still social species. People acting like grateful break, best thing fathom.... exhausting literally 1:1 recently. human movement communities exactly virus spreads. iterally root cause pandemic. Yup. anesthesia dept putting guidelines place case pull provide ICU services again. possible Bolsonaro worse leader Trump? think problem people say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got flu‚Äù usually mean cold. people often think flu bad cold - know, like runny nose, headache also aches fatigue - compared runny nose sneezing cold. people don‚Äôt actually realise influenza horrible get like bad cold many people. 

Makes covid situation difficult people were/(are) saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs like flu‚Äù people associate Covid bad cold. appreciate framed like guidelines suggestions Pride always comes fall.

America thought could hide ""China virus"" forever. couldn't. Obviously. Yeah gonna take lot -900. know 401k still huge year. would schedule check up, then. call office ask covid protocols, feel following would go ahead schedule cleaning exam. 

the stuff turned spots black sounds like silver diamine fluoride, occasionally done once, one treatment often enough attest decay. said, it‚Äôs almost year, it‚Äôs time checked feel comfortable so. See, exactly anti-Vax movement started. He‚Äôs researching vaccine. He‚Äôs testing vaccine. He‚Äôs manufacturing vaccine, done world necessarily US. can‚Äôt approve vaccine, that‚Äôs FDAs job. involvement vaccines maybe executive orders allocate money buy it‚Äôs available, good idea, cut red tape makes getting things done take longer, sometimes years, also good idea. yet going large contingent population get perfectly safe vaccine someone convinced Trump says works, can‚Äôt true. people die stupidity.

Because think FDA approve vaccine hundreds millions people isn‚Äôt safe, fire everyone FDA. would worthless organization. 

Just don‚Äôt like Trump doesn‚Äôt mean government ceased function. People saying going tough winter start. people starting saying seasonal would disappear like flu summer. disappear like flu summer, people thought ""well, maybe seasonal winter summer""

I'd say data we're getting now, still spread summer months, appear spread efficiently colder weather. Stronger immune system  ""If seatbelts work, airbags. airbags work, seatbelts. work, crumple zones?"" Australians enacted lockdown even draconian authoritarian China. People forced remain homes, Australian police every floor building ensure compliance. surprised international spotlight Australia's draconian lockdown policies. Everybody wants talk China, ignoring Australia's lockdown. High risk medical personnel, both. It‚Äòs probably combination both.

Yeah, summer mostly fine (there small increase) numbers low (exponential growth slow first), people still somewhat paying attention aforementioned socializing outside guess. Queue-Anon strikes again. say. gives flying fuck wave in. decision make doubt it‚Äôs easy decision make seem would essentially still March. Instead learning virus buffing hospitals governments used time nothing. completely wasted blaming population incompetence. could probably pull playlist Sirius XM's Beach Music channel. Oldies retro r&amp;b tunes. peeps swing dancing, cha cha, line dancing, hustle, even know others dance. European cases actually never traced back China, patient zero Italy traces back Hawaii iirc.

What amazing Europe even different strain beginning. China later. Sounds like might want talk labor organizer. That's true. wonder many would never gotten sick exposed responsible leadership instead deadly virus? Countries funding manufacturing doses. company dime. taking risk. can't quite wrap head around neoliberal propaganda managed make Americans think government concerned citizen's general welfare moral failure. took 40 years marketing convince citizens noble die collect unemployment. mention absolute shit show beaurocracy involved accessing services tax dollars provide us. beginning pandemic, global scientist community relied ""works time"" metric. since best masks, N95, block 95% time, plus fact general population know use masks properly, decided work.

Wat understand even slight increase effectiveness would save hundreds people dying, thousands suffering COVID, recovery. do. little bit late, better never. Measures getting stricter day past week so.

But yes, lifting earlier restrictions already 1k cases per day again, inaction thereafter asinine. ....out thousands complaints filed. hundreds thousands violations created.

I'm fan fining way making change. fine them. Big whoop. make behavioral change directed workforce, specifically leadership?

It's *always* directed lowest wage workers. go without, make changes difficult top gets sit comfy. would like see top earners take pay cut bottom workers take brunt. it‚Äôs going go away /s. Karma funny way working things out.  think Fox News encouraging people vote early mail spikes typically red heavy areas. curious see plays Election Day. Deeply sincere thoughts prayers.

My pet theory certain social circles go nuts, others careful. Covid risk accumulate certain individuals, risk transfer others careful ie. game time vulnerable we've failed protect.

But risk evenly weighted, heavily tilted towards grasshoppers partying. exponents kick in, they'll likely ones left without care they'll get sick once.

The apex fight covid getting infected makes sense, they're tip long stupid spear bad decisions. also ""rushed"" we're waiting step get clear money released next step like normally would. Money essentially non-factor vaccines. speeds things considerably. ‚Äúmask casket‚Äù ‚Äúbetter home DEAD!‚Äù messaging backfires (along messaging 2021). looking straight, objective numbers, far far far likely know people who‚Äôve got easily. headline: 500,000 new cases U.S. 10,000 people died

this sub: *38 excited awards* Oh gee wiz. wonder happened? Trump said rounding curve. 

Must run wall. 

They better hurry inject bleach arms stick ultra violet light asses get sick. 

I don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre going without them, election! 

Couldn‚Äôt come worse time. shame... treatment? Oxford looking treatment way get emergency authorization? Treating infected person vaccine makes sense me. There's still remarkable portion us trying best. many be, we're less visible, obviously. think people adhered 100% then, beach house Iowa sell you. agree French citizen expat US. tolerance take measures implemented showed success associate totalitarian regimes actions. French might little bit tolerance many keep way see fit. doubt that. Us people AVOIDING hospitals even need go, they're afraid getting Covid. Well, baby powder require FDA approval sold really feel like countries middle global pandemic, another agitation institutionalized racism, rise active white supremacy, crucial presidential election surge selfish ignorant people refusing believe scientists listen recommended actions professionals. No, US did.

Edit: maybe something happens them, going link directly facebook misinformation? last one.‚òùÔ∏è

The 200,000+++ dead US seem inconvenienced number NZ. fair like like comparison, life expectancy Europe whole 7 years higher females 4 5 males Asia, thats big difference example average age people dying covid UK 82. extra years life people Europe means fairly weak frail people would statistically dead countries still alive care homes generally poor health close death. average age covid death UK higher life expectancy, people dying UK covid would statistically (and potentially) dead decade Asian countries clinging onto life European countries due care system. watched US president get helicoptered best healthcare country pump full experimental drugs two days testing positive. wonder people rush hospital first sign cough now... argument Mammon. 
The virtues greed, cruelty, selfishness.

Such nature always value Mammon life. end result same. may may agree law, certainly time deal pandemic escalates.

And chose judges controversies around it, separate story. Vaccine approval start end, especially since multiple candidates approaching milestone within next couple weeks. They're getting downvoted post comes trying downplay that. 


Things start improve on. Yea sorry mobile would linked first got tests per capita from. another source slightly different numbers, also confirm US France least pretty close France bit better.

For percent positive tests, best source find France 17% US positive rate 6.3% No, intent abolish it. like abolished independence courts. point authoritarian lackeys pretend rule law trying assert control women's bodies. criteria us unviable? unviable babies talking here, survive days still births even survive severely disabled I'm can, like going speed limit - police seldom cares. fault totalitarian regime. People underestimate poorly West would react tho people close began testing positive highly-infectious virus days festival ended. past week, virus claimed lives Jeptha ‚ÄúJeppy‚Äù McDowell Donald ‚ÄúTootie‚Äù Brown, according friends family. Unlikely since El Paso largely hispanic usually firmly blue. Republicans probably happy this. everywhere Asia well. looked Indonesia, Malaysia Philippines? counting Asian countries like India Bangladesh... I‚Äôm reading elsewhere order non binding governed outlawed ability lockdown? wait 2 weeks first zero new cases recorded. Yup makes MUCH sense. Adding then, likelihood death? survival rate rather high? would hamburg d√ºsseldorf rammstein :( Wow realize Asia China. No. Freaking idiot. Right, like said, they‚Äôre inconvenienced rest world. sure politics get point. Definitely January. time, damage done :( dying. works criminal organisation done immense damage US, indeed world. 

Did feel Bruno Dey? 100% case. isolating thing 3 years health problems. never problem. Now, getting tired it, live people screaming can't bothered anything. 1 day able gather others death world. screaming bloody murder anytime someone even mentions word mask. literally exhausting trying best get spread virus close family/friends constantly lying trying wear act like them. Dancing fools, literally. Dallas call Safer Home Yes... Rights good thing still remember Cuomo said state closures would attack states' rights. city shutdown yes, besides weak attempt travel quarantines border closures. little pessimistic smoothly anything transitioned.

This feel too. Trump going IMPLODE! 11 weeks spew hatred false narrative. saw passed executive order giving power fire Fauci, know that's going happen. Redfield CDC. News flash: Young people *at most* half problem. old farts sitting around bitching young people wearing masks making workers go work sick much blame. wrong.. keep hoping apocalypse. Peace‚úåÔ∏è El Paso largely hispanic. Republicans care can't vote without El Paso, Texas chance flip blue. still got sick. Masks helpful foolproof think give many false sense security. said, wearing mask could help explain many (myself included) mild cases rest world getting control. 

Lol, Wales Ireland lockdown. UK, France, Spain Italy messes South America. models COVID response quickly getting succumbed. Elites dont need complicated plot prevent Trump getting reelected. bracing worst avoid let specific reasons doubt availability? LOT at-risk manufacturing going right pending trial results. dose every American right gate gears turning. People though winter that‚Äôll it. Next March year since ‚Äútwo weeks flatten curve‚Äù people willing sacrifice another spring/summer. someone feels attacked, deserved begin with. probably best, articulated comment seen sub days. Bravo.

The negative moral characterization people social gatherings seeing friends families, largely whole pandemic result massive government, political, public health failure disgusting. Explain US Covid spread like wildfire podunk country like Vietnam doesn‚Äôt then? elites (Democrats) shut states tank economy. Meanwhile, anti Trump Republicans opened states spread virus. Meanwhile, virus released China get Biden elected. obvious see. Pay attention, man article: ‚ÄúThe point earlier, contact tracing, able find contacts infected person,‚Äù said Mizoram Health Secretary, H. Lalengmawia, ‚ÄúBut late, become increasingly difficult. can‚Äôt tell community transmission begun Mizoram \[COVID-19 Tolerance Fortnight\] order prevent that.‚Äù

That's exactly point time lockdown order keep short keep people dying. benefit postponing it. close treatment. 

What interesting Oxford looking vaccine treatment well vaccine. would love see data. add more. Take time research well. I'm expert stuff. best practices almost certainly change response new infectious disease emerging somewhere world.

We got lucky covid relatively benign compared something higher mortality rate long term complications. good experience get less lucky next one. Again, read it. Increasing demand decreasing supplies two different things. Covid increase blood demand plain simple. Read title post. align quoted? again, numbers sources? even evaluate credibility read internet? lack response heartbreaking admit making little depressed today. school district won‚Äôt go back person weekly average cases less 7 per 100,000. recently 20s get paid that? 60,000 per day nation wide? realise nurses administer vaccine UK already got enough doses vaccinate everyone.

A realistic number would 600,000-1m day. believe Europe US, different timings, face worst epidemic times. People obsessed ""losing freedom"" Asia controlled tight contact tracing hypervigillance. great part Europe (essentially ghosts past totalitarian regimes) US (for political polarization) wants nothing degree control situation demands. wish wrong go really bad. Right watching overflowing UCI European major cities leaving place othe health assistance. Trump tried do, got slapped, make CDC change actual safety guidelines evaluate against. Luckily companies CDC told pound sand. vaccine safe one sat desks CDC 4 years.

I think meant ""FDA"" ""CDC"". can't understand given access efficient N95 masks. wrong system? beyond broken.

How assume would possible increase production 10,000 100,000 never felt hopeless future general life particular.

You talk therapist instead worrying masks. laughable. washing hands often? /s

I think good news. Water contamination ideal, Covid crisis hour mean ignore issues. Pfizer might sooner - far solid efficacy signal. Covid really test run us get pandemic response together. shit stayed infection rate fatality rate anything near Ebola we‚Äôd absolutely screwed. Civilizations could possibly ended. United States. Kind feel like it‚Äôs opposite. vaccine horizon, safeguard everyone best possible hunker could vaccinate vulnerable. vaccines proving promising see case: can‚Äôt go five years get Aw sounds cosy solution kids falling behind academically distance learning absolute mess everyone learn things online? let fall behind right? Know what....
After working bug since late December writing four hundred pages worth papers predictive analysis beat government months...

F*ck em all.
Who cares anymore.

'feared' ???

Feared?

It's called science exponential function.
Here simple equation set semi word form 

Exponential function √∑ months actual lockdown/mitigation factors √ó selfish, arrogant childish American population √ó Problems instant gratification squared = f*cked. always think That‚Äôs pretty obvious statement. cant wait 2022 think understand virus control location better do, whole country closed borders even though epidemiological merit. scientists government Australia , We're wrong right. Even though basically eradicated virus swimming it. I'm intellectually dishonest one? control spread anyone cross border bring in, difficult concept wrap cortex around. guys elected McDonald Trump even bothering else get across idea bill passed house effectively bunch measures Democrats ran nothing coronavirus? passed sole intent putting bill McConnell‚Äôs desk would never sign. textbook example attempting shift goalposts; I‚Äôm going bother responding whatever horrible troll response have. It‚Äôs hard control movement people think Higher US per capita basis. definitely canary coal mine us. US could looking 200k cases per day winter. hear saying, elderly already elevated risk various diseases well Covid thing?

I mean, think it, *all* demographics ever share exact risk profile?

I mean, would ideal say could true, think that's life ever worked. Well governing bodies? fda. least 6500 excess deaths, probably (because flu season year) end May. Related March/April case surge. know that, June July record low deaths, like February also record low deaths prior case surge.

We seen similar numbers April August early reporting, large case wave also July August. 

So that's easily 15,000.

Of course first heard it, Japan society runs face lies reason world accepts squeaky clean image. done next nothing contain Black sus dont know changed, SCMP‚Äôs mobile website extremely difficult use lately. Archive full article case anyone else   Oh, import it.   
 
Europeans like pretend they're *intelligent* *cultured* compared us *nouveau riche* brutes living across pond, deep they're stupid are. little quieter maybe, better. 1) ""Doesn't matter. Still easy find.""

I highly doubt find area practice. sure, feel find me, go ahead.

2) ""You ever done even simple search.""

Of course are. know MSM monogamous lower risk spreading HIV compared MSM multiple partners. That's saying letting donate safe. read FDA guidelines linked, explain that.

3) ""If able set policies, I'm sure could incorporate studies evidence. reason yet?""

See point 2. no, cannot set policies. follow guidelines set governing bodies. intelligence issue, trust issue, going large social issue us months. superiority snarkiness absolutely nothing fix it. really hope find way feel empowered enough able restore mental health. easy answers‚Äîeven trying get good therapist challenging guarantee mental health improve.
So hugs internet rando (me). Hang there! I‚Äôm proud trying hard it‚Äôs difficult. shows caring person. appreciate sacrifices made. Please well. Many well wishes :) think it‚Äôs really sad education social development children, also future generation, isn‚Äôt priority you. privilege lack acknowledgement kids terrible situations right school, really disappointing. Maybe give days, get tested. think takes 4-5 days exposure test actually work probably much safer well fitting N95 KN95 mask. would easier see lips move doubt sound would carry well. Maybe could get microphone wear depends loud fan is.

A regular mask, distancing, airflow room probably sufficient. wait several months anyway unless front line health care worker high risk. lucky get Spring. got plenty time..... posted hoping get input people elsewhere Colorado. proposed restrictions completely asinine. crushing small businesses might maximum 100 people (like big restaurants), completely omit public schools (tens thousands kids) also elaborate churches lawsuit state authorizing practically restrictions religious gatherings. beginning gave benefit doubt, political bias restrictions even veiled anymore. Don‚Äôt let fool you. It‚Äôs modified stage 3. stage 3 extra shit allowed. it‚Äôs basically stage 4. Still state wide mask mandate. Still hospitals diverting pediatric patients facilities make room covid adults. happen anywhere else? Cute talking points. Go find someone cares. Maybe learn evaluate source it.

It's funny watch stupid people blame others stupidity. stalks profiles Welp, I‚Äôm convinced. Time start taking these. lanes pool less people explosive diarrhea, they're part US Olympics-sized swimming pool.

It's poo. /s pass Halloween costume.

Then keep wearing :D ...cut scene Homer sitting couch eating potato chips watching bowling TV. Technically correct XD videos circulating internet early pandemic happening. great catch 22 absolves assholes responsibility: People assholes comply control measures, therefore virus get control need control measures last long measures extreme, therefore people get sick on.

Sounds like climate change apologists: measures prevent catastrophic climate change extreme people them, necessary measures become extreme, meaning fewer fewer people willing them, bother all.

This fate. young healthy, instead passing bullshit advice, go try enjoy short time planet. hope lose genetic lottery wind scarred lung tissue thousands dollars medical debt get spend many *long* years with.

EDIT: add county hospital, nearest county 97% hospital capacity including overflow, get hurt sick coronavirus, still might die lack healthcare. already hear smugly saying ""we die eventually"" though, I, like everyone else know, NPC you. clearly never Asian countries thats think. certainly cut recidivism. argument. call first kid tease ""sus,"" good. I'm conspiracy CCP held **a lot** world even countries idiots enough, think main problem. Even China spread this, countries could easily prevented lot didn't. That's main issue. High-five Netherlands rate USA always first wave COVID. Putting way might work may aspire steal Australia totalitarian state now. terrified people want here. China freer. It‚Äôs time ramped testing! I'm masks becoming normalized forward. sure thus far. Like, sick, stay home must go out, wear something cover face.

I'm kind ashamed I've never done before, even thought now. COVID made seem like basic common sense. We're literally reopening 14 hours now, announced yesterday Studies medical doctor covers videos description. lot major stores opted gradual sales starting early right versus typical ‚Äúdoorbuster‚Äù type deals usually see Friday thanksgiving. lot places decided completely close thanksgiving also. don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see typical noise Black Friday year. quality reporting source appalling. One sentence quoting nameless ""French doctor"", two sentences Spain. sorry, misled you. fault. forgot detail. RATM one best concerts I've ever palladium. Lisbon, Portugal '08. rest bands day great, Hives, Gogol Bordello, National, Spiritualized, CSS, Peaches, MGMT... Immunocompromised here... thing. I'm going back normal outside masks public.  /r/murdochsucks propaganda rugged individualism, dont let government tell do, American exceptionalism

Here's problem though,.... There's nothing inherently REQUIRED within ""rugged individualism"" prevents someone also being:.. Caring cooperative. 

(IE = person ""rugged &amp; individual"".. also make smart choices supportive/collaborative overall social-good. least children's best interest mind... seriously though, really disgusting action union. Schools country open assholes even *discuss* reopening plans. Really pathetic stuff. 

Also disturbing apparent overwhelming support union thread. ago infection caused diarrhea spreading public pools. infection spread part chlorinated water kill people going swimming infected. issue statement telling people go swimming diarrhea. Poland actually United States? 

In seriousness hope ok able stay safe healthy shit hits fan around you. matter. Still easy find.

Are telling there's studies msm monogamous relationships? know that's true. ever done even simple search. able set policies, I'm sure could incorporate studies evidence. reason yet? Godspeed brother safe. Figured I‚Äôd sell ‚ÄúAmong Us Cosplay‚Äù they‚Äôll love üòÇ I‚Äôm prepared handle brutal teasing.  Uhm thank  love people assume worst nothing person. 

Vocational education one hardest things online and, IMO, best way poor people get ahead. gone dozens local school board meetings. two thing press things kids vocational training. often contacted local school board?

ETA: offered $500 buy cheap laptops needy kids school district person classes online classes. There‚Äôs always one.

Being remote helped we‚Äôd advance warning thing started seeing significant uptick community cases, we‚Äôd example Italy see likely happen didn‚Äôt move decisively.


To honest closed borders thing NZ early actually pretty poorly done, we‚Äôve learned gotten better time gone on. we‚Äôd relied remote island, we‚Äôd broken. 205 *known* cases locked (*edit: March 25th*), enough kick create full blown outbreak. closing borders, ‚Äúbeing remote‚Äù, point, never going enough.

The biggest important thing lockdown, social distancing, community support elderly vulnerable. broke back virus forced R0 1.  We‚Äôre back living normally, expect economy recover quickly albeit pandemic causing world wide economic slowdown.

Putting ‚Äúbeing remote island‚Äù head sand ignorance, dishonours sacrifices made people couldn‚Äôt attend weddings funerals, say good bye dying loved ones, lost jobs, small businesses went under. sacrificed others could live, don‚Äôt dishonour trite simplistic hand waving. think don‚Äôt book anything requires deposit, certainly non-refundable one. need new friends Even EUA great news potentially vaccine(s) work, presumably first batch would going risk people whether age occupation. results good, positive cascading effect daily lives next year. mate. I‚Äôm talking Covid crushed. hk free speech anymore. arrested chanting slogan holding piece paper. enforce gathering rules pro democracy supporters. im saying mandatory masks/lockdowns reduce numbers dramatically, matter country. IIRC Coronavirus mutated Italy become much contagious strain spread West Asia since already shut borders. Stop complying much can. way end. It‚Äôs really fucking hard Melbourne last months. 

But now, maybe get pay off. lmao think deliberately trolling point, whole discussion strawman created. problem borders, closing virus already spreading rapidly throughout country pointless. response is.......

Plus, border controls perfectly effective easily impementable, Finland lift them? Clearly sacrifice involved could keep shut forever. fail many places? One country one visits middle nowhere proof policy work 95% places. I'm going keep going argument troll can't read English. great day. Think 75% effectiveness would R number everyone got vaccinated. White Knighting.....lol... one those. 

Not responsible conspiracies, also main reason Trump win. Again... unfortunate cutting nose despite face. agree countries didn‚Äôt enough information, can‚Äôt agree CCP dumped world. Yup, majority right thing I'm proud us. ask information without seeming like troll then? that‚Äôs trying do. strategy pursue ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù without vaccine never strong case begin with. hoping students beat time yes must Graduation rate 77% so... Yeah? Sounds appropriate  Infuriated, depressed - particularly see sooooo many area still screaming ‚Äúgiving freedom media-overblown flu never happen‚Äù (ie ‚Äòfreedom given up‚Äô l√° mandates, mandatory mask wearing, limitations put restaurants/bars etc, wow) ‚Äúbut death rate minuscule everyone losing ish nothing.‚Äù 

I exhausted. Exhausted worrying family loved ones. Exhausted gone anywhere - restaurant, shop, takeaway, seeing family, anything isn‚Äôt solitary hiking husband dot, - since second week March. I‚Äôm tired grumpy. No, I've read correct. I'm simply disagreeing bad info statement. think individuals reiterate others scientists believe minimum measures required safe need supported positive manner given credit caring enough voice concerns. We've seen opposite many times, though I'm accusing that. sense superiority derive shutting friends family life

Not wanting kill mother put friends danger superiority complex.

I told enjoy life tell I'm idiot isolating.

You're cool.  Building hospitals one thing. Another staffing hospitals. Hubei Chinese province coronavirus outbreak got bad, China organized doctors nurses (thousands) rest country go help Hubei. 
 
I assume American (apologies not), so, I'm sure aware severe lack federal-level leadership pandemic. can‚Äôt read article due written Polish. they're near ATH Oxford move trials abroad due drop cases UK summer, definitely contributed delay. 

Fauci US experts stuck November December 2020 target ever since summer, believe go where? seems like europe's shit hole place well considering they're worse Except hospitalizations, severe outcomes deaths...all way down. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Borders ZERO impact spread within country, affect spread countries. 

That people talking though. saying agree position Germany, country middle second wave yet bad France would well served French possible came Germany since would likely accelerate spread Germany.

A Frenchman likely infected German neighbour extra French man entering country chance super spreader German moving one region another.

To take different example easier illustrate, Ireland shares single land border UK. areas around border densely populated Irish side since UK good job keeping things control areas recently ones Ireland highest rates infection. areas became heavily infected accelerated spread country whole.

Closing border impractical would cause problems solved wrong say leaving open impact rate infection rest country. Seriously! I‚Äôm it‚Äôs great description bit much. Fauci gives conservative estimates he's scientist can't wrong. Furthermore, they're (Fauci Redfield) saying Q3 2021, really likely translates timeline proposed. sometimes takes hour get one side El Paso other. also doesn‚Äôt help there‚Äôs always construction going on. behavior sociopathic (it is), 

You know nothing cast shade seroprevalence based estimate

seroprevalence whole story, that's never mentioned implied U.S. somehow far behind rest world

The rest world much bigger, Europe hit Corona US. states, especially ones rising cases now, complained delayed cancer screenings, completely unironically, overrun hospitals would somehow able accommodate acutely ill patients.

Most hospitals capacity testing, patients either allowed visit, scared mass hysteria postpone visits.

You're interested discussion right. Wait six months. Chinese term schadenfreude?

It ""Âπ∏ÁÅæ‰πêÁ•∏‚Äú really interested. 

Although see reason anyone US western countries entitled feel way tens thousands daily cases.  way beyond stupid. 

Overall, pretty satisfied government handled pandemic since Jan 23 (the day locked Wuhan). Basically one two outbreaks every month 1.4 Billion population , outbreaks contained quickly died less one month. 99.999% Chinese citizen living normal life now. Idk actual chances reactions never got til around age. Never bad reaction shots. mean, personally I‚Äôve singing song tirelessly months. It‚Äôs article really well written felt sharing value.

It‚Äôs overtly antagonistic, sometimes fail be, appeals sense togetherness, believe need go back to. 
My frustration gets way try convey message, article it‚Äôs nicer I‚Äôve ever managed talking it. texas voter here. voting location line start outside building, provided hand santizers masks, distanced everyone inside. Five different times What? nation‚Äôs branch Red Cross started offer crash-courses volunteers, help take care hospitals facilities. (ok, people get compensation that, pure volunteering)(and obviously full replacement nurses, taking load them)

The courses filled quickly, matter days. still waiting hear back them.  politicians resisted school reopening resign? live 30-40 minutes El Paso, county I‚Äôm really high numbers, too. lot people here, work commute El Paso, vice versa. People also travel El Paso weekends there‚Äôs since relaxed lot restrictions weeks ago, people like there‚Äôs pandemic. explain? loop Actually, European country live you‚Äôre required go quarantine immediately upon arrival state starts clock following day stay quarantine extra day. mean ... might want stop w. particular comparison. kept drinking either go ole 'hair dog. alcohol poisoning. yeah, stop drinking point night, better keep drinking ""because I've already much"" don‚Äôt even enforce locations. I‚Äôve gone without mask (was hurry forgot) one said shit. 

My job requires employees wear them. Signs door ask customers wear them, aren‚Äôt allowed enforce it. 60% people wear
them, 40% don‚Äôt. Lol relax Australia  always interesting people defend market capitalism exploit workers, fails businesses need prop allow businesses whatever need continue exploiting workers.

Covid19 large part capitalism businesses need find way survive perish.

Hopefully force governments accountable provide assistance like countries managed. say wear mask leaving home. Japan 1000 deaths day virus?

Oh wait, everything everything else. pandemic going eight months, now. It‚Äôll likely go least another six. long expect family go without income basic human empathy them? grift like every damn thing admin does. schools, STEM research infrastructure need money. Putting hopes vaccine beyond stupid. There's guarantees whatsoever effective vaccine ever arrive.

And many lives destroy process becoming police state? Stock ya can, seen going $60-$100 websites, I‚Äôm sure sold tomorrow. wait, it‚Äôll get worse event something? kinda rate indicative multiple super spreader events. wife mirroring responsible behavior. It‚Äôs us want keep safe it‚Äôs people love. parents mid 70s I‚Äôm nurse treats elderly. people say living fear say living smart. guess Pence staff conspiracy too? Bad take? Dude, it‚Äôs words, idea. I‚Äôm repeated said Dr, Fauci. Good luck finding customers. question staying open, matter convincing patrons safe come back. Masks work well macro level combat pandemics epidemics. correlation Europe stricter mask mandates falling cases. 

Seems like obvious reason (considering scientific consensus June). Kids made rubber magic definitely want come now. Considering poorly Europe turned out. city Cambridge MA, Masks required. well past months, anymore. Colleges need better keep things like happening. first time. understand purpose lockdown (with exception conspiracy theorists), doubt would work reduce case numbers (at least short term). simply believe worth sacrifice. Nothing shameful all, lot gravely affected lockdowns.

Plus, lot people wildly overestimate negatives alternatives lockdown. take Sweden example, never locked down, scale death rate Melbourne, that's around 3000 deaths (a bit 2000 deaths anyway). So, exchange 5 million people locking 6 months we've saved around 2000 people. Sweden's death rate already remained extremely low months every reason optimistic well makes fucking sense all.!! matter anyway everyone indoors wearing masks!! 

There‚Äôs probably limited number people allowed store given time line get don‚Äôt envision scenario people going fuck around try things on.

The economy‚Äôs bad enough allowing items purchased one places buy things absolutely ludicrous! yet name single business actually shut down. case anymore, sadly europoors plan infrastructure buying populace place.  It‚Äôs easy it‚Äôs difficult either. Reuters quoting Sun - Welcome 2020 confused. vaccine supposed do? Trigger immune response ages? stay alive hang kiwis vaccine comes, that's pretty nice Easy wear mask town help prevent smell shit streets. Melbourne Australia proof argument completely erroneous. significant community transmission severe 3 month lockdown sealed birders brought zero hope it‚Äôs simple El Paso.....I spent month one night! Anyone know they'd start accepting blood people lived Europe, USA? know exactly thing coming from, bothers much. like ""intellectuals"" world got reddit comment everyone stupid one wears mask one believes pandemic that's things way are. WEARING MASKS 7 FREAKING MONTHS closed public spaces Bavaria, Germany, still one affected places country. never seen someone wearing mask closed space (maybe public transport people want special wear them, maybe 1-2 people per train hundreds). test.  fair, countries inferior health care.

(granted, poor care USA government intentionally destroyed country‚Äôs government, moral qualities CIA selling drugs USA)

And treatments handful people able perform. (of course, point going USA something ‚Äúsimple‚Äù open heart surgery lung transplantation, mean super-rare ailments experimental treatments) closest Texan city El Paso? Exactly, seemingly endless lockdowns painful get 100% understand people‚Äôs frustrations. end day, we‚Äôre getting back somewhat normal life within days time provided nothing goes wrong, restrictions continue eased time goes on. countries states around world similar populations densities us aren‚Äôt even close virus getting back normal life. absolutely feel countries still deal this, man happy place handled way COVID discriminatory asshat NZ pretty good. even stopped second wave right ? certain point becomes pretty hard contact trace EU population twice size US idiots say anything



and now, higher infection rate üòÇ mean they're wrong, even everyone gets vaccinated human contamination whole year, since virus apparently passed different animals, there's possibility keep reappearing humans' vaccine-induced immunity decreases. read article government officials saying 6 month long study demonstrated TR10 capable completely nullifying Covid-19 bother say kind study offer details. human study? Animal? Petro Dish? 

Is claiming 100% recovery rate 0% mortality rate treated human population? clues offered. Color doubtful.  place recording 0 cases international travel barred.

Sure. thank you.

and reply commenter, I'm ignoring anti-vaxxers general. I'm ignoring context question. even anti-vaxxers exist, would virus permanent fixture life due robustness? Wait, saying *could* real? ""big wave"" also oscillations within. could take 7-day averages that's somewhat arbitrary cutoff smoothing. like coastline problem--what resolution use measuring length? shape yo. economy took hit recovery start ASAP. haircut fools anti-maskers gonna drag next year.

SIKE trust Trump anymore. usual. another many politicians Well, originally say would ready September... Padlock doors closed put business owners jail cell.

Reckless endangerment end business tries it. live town 3 grocery stores, 0 options pick delivery. door dash anything like either. Yup, expected exact news right election. Everything deter people voting public dems rig mail-in ballots. Fair.

what diseases affect certain groups people? 70%-80% we're expecting vaccinate at-risk essential workers mostly done distancing.

Nobody social distancing past like March dude. I'm sorry. think society it. 200,000 Americans never, ever smell another thing. complaint smell mint gum compared cost people dying infantile. scares real. know Lmao fucking dumb ass comment I'm surprised! thought would gone Easter.

/$ Yeah less people sure would terrible thing, upside all.......... freedumbs may article, another article (that can't find) quoted AZ reps saying thought would provide coverage year. suck honestly. thing America: look way better they‚Äôre exposed.... No. Interpreting information forced go busier times foolish even worse disingenuous nobody common sense interprets like that. I've taken opening eyes. got Coronavirus walk things lot. even respond post. complained pointed behavior sociopathic (it is), vaguely tried cast shade seroprevalence based estimate (seroprevalence data scarce U.S.), implied U.S. somehow far behind rest world (nonsensical, locked EU countries behind U.S.), complained delayed cancer screenings, completely unironically, overrun hospitals would somehow able accommodate acutely I'll patients. logic dumpster fire. Orange tired poking nest yet? measure metro area El Paso 69th biggest. Consider eastern cities, example, Boston. huge standalone city include metro top 10 country. anyone actually go outside there? Applied *to*. None vaccines expected 100% effective, likely masks degree social distancing much 2021. shit excuses europoors now? H1N1 deadlier younger folks. gets fatality rate cars (35,000/year US) regular flu (56,000/year) think bite bullet go it. People need get used idea we're never going get rid fully. Like Influenza, persist. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even vaccine effective 30% population, we'd near there. basically, older population vaccinated, good go.

&amp;#x200B;

If get numbers, still live like this, massive backlash. People going want live like something dangerous seasonal flu (with vaccine) US really, really well compared Europe terms new cases. LOL. Thanks that. That's pretty scientific description alright. ex-physics major appreciate most. there's really justification make masks social distancing mandatory flu seasons going consistent. 2017/2018 Nov-Feb flu season 60,000 people died. That's 500 deaths/day, half 1000 daily COVID-19 deaths summer.

Isn't wearing small piece cloth face social distancing four months year small price pay save lives? 

(Aside: flu affects kids far COVID does. grandma killing masking distancing, innocent children.)   US companies cash tech companies. seems utterly desperate (about quarter medical staff reportedly sick Covid-19) heartbreaking. think deaths drop peak steadily bad while. 

The problem ‚Äúwave‚Äù terminology assume monolith response places certainly wave settled others rising taken together get picture doesn‚Äôt really represent anywhere.

Local rules varied, local population densities, hospital facilities, general health contribute outcomes. argument would be, effective, prioritizing highest risk, likely spread it? voting new Supreme Court Judge will... Ummm.... Uhh.... ü§îü§îü§î.....oh yeah absolutely nothing doom us entirely different manner....... Vote works? ridiculous.

Attack - ""criticize oppose fiercely"" Well, probably know end third trial effective vaccine booster vaccine helps. general reason vaccines given multiple times. 

And doesnt work you, shouldnt worry much since many others getting immune herd protection goes up, consquently R goes down. pandemic shall slowly fade away... probably recommended wear mask vaccine widely deployed, least that‚Äôs understanding things Almost europe new cases per capita America. talking about. think lack social distancing major contributor huge increases we're seeing UK. live south east area almost bottom regional list parents far away. quite surprised see couple weeks ago 50% - 60% school kids walking along street still wearing masks perhaps thats reflection peoples attitudes keeping numbers minimum here?

I went spent day parents couple weeks ago (I public building public transport since end March) astounded experience. walk around town mother everybody went way avoid streets. Nobody passed shoulder shoulder, instead stepping road allow others pass. narrow path one 4 groups walking direction keeping distance; person behind hurry pass got onto wide pavement. thing made cringe lad walking ahead us spotted somebody seen ages practically tongues others necks greeting other, meanwhile even make physical contact parents! moan quite often limited grocery trips see person two without mask supermarket full compliance one here.

Our next door neighbours 70s, husband told us ago COPD yet like people around trying hardest either catch prove hoax we're sure which. first day lockdown started going twice every morning 7 days week pick something shops (he used pop every day so) Interestingly day started newspaper delivered assumed avoid trip shop day wife work one out.
I'm losing count think today either 11th 12th day row family including school age children tradesmen home hours end. days ago even saw Mr COPD chatting carpenter drive kept touching arm even rubbing dudes bald head - wtf wrong people?
To add insult injury every parcel delivered come door stand waiting take us literally speed run door want go near plague rats pick parcels - they're absolute f'ing nuisance. still ""So begins"" Two Towers. even know means ""tired""? want give foot massage pat back? They're overworked overwhelmed watching large amount people die over. least idea hell saying trying make point. get it, you‚Äôre expert epidemiologist probably read tens tens headlines last 7 months. least understand Oxford vaccine phase 3 trials running multiple countries last months.  ""both sides"" never never We're wearing masking Europe way, way cases day per capita.   Oh yeah, completely agree. Plus week election US. I'm afforded luxury people respecting rights. deserve respect refuse give it. [Top 30 deaths per million Oct probably due Poland lot tourism/immigration combined distributed population compared Western Europe. want go office shoot shit coworkers Shit, close Wuhan Jan, NY month later...

Some people never learn. lol, fucking amateurs. Europe we're wearing masks 3-5 times amount cases per person per day US. wave defined start end point. can't wave ending higher started, that's incoming tide. Probably helps Johnson Johnson, Pfizer, several major pharma companies massive manufacturing plants headquarters throughout Jersey... really think early messaging masks going one biggest blunders modern history. Good them. vaccine ish control!!! really trying discussions come ideas. sad didnt open schools numbers low. Instead, wait cold flu season, open f 2 days (8 hours total), shut district teacher....working *remotely * gets corona. Tell makes sense. 

None measures make logical sense. Like kids band class masks w/ holes Tubas trumpets. Uhhh? Here, Things like sports snd extra-curriculars go. school. Even though school grounds. (???)

Its illogical unsettling me. 

Maybe targeted (not blanket) isolations?
Increased preparedness.
I hate say this, truly feel small businesses, maybe close bars needed instead schools. 
Cross train medical personnel. Encourage healthy eating, exercise, etc. Encourage people re-train cross-train areas need like Thearapist‚Äôs, addiction specialists, etc. 

I would also appreciate acknowledgment global scale ‚Äîof mental anguish caused lockdowns stress. need raise morale! 

Its despicable public conditioned care covid, dismiss discussion suffering people succumbing to. 

Hell, even mention worries subs, get attacked votes, 16k ‚Äústay fuck home hard!!!111‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúwear MASKKKK‚Äù comments. 

It bothers pro-lockdown crowd consider symbol virtue, yet many suffering, covid....then empathy you!

Edit: clarity country evaluate patients individual basis. counts biological chronological age. 
If previously fit healthy 80 y/o drops dead resuscite get ICU. procedure would perfirmed younger pt debilitating conditions remaining quality life.

Also half hospitalized pt Covid 65. affecting old people hcs cannot cope more. Every European Union state dealt way

That's true, totally interacted (by hijacking other's PPE shipments). FYI, think pap smear (that test girls parts, test cancer), could call Covid test.  tired. Sorry.

Lol. Yep dumber attention draw every country apart speaking different language different culture ordinary people wish people would get especially difficult times. H1N1 2009 nothing compared COVID-19 fucking know it, play stupid. dunno everyone got idea wave ends higher started. Yeah let's pretend merely missing things holding events deadly pandemic. Shame you.  healthcare worker crappy immune system, would feel much better working getting shot! Haha real! talking NFL, college. making arguments people made college... nfl players completely different environment college players practice. ""ready"" means rolling assembly line. Yep.

All blood hands. too! creepy way spin this. says much anything else one group openly anti covid

Protesting pandemic transmitted proximity peak Darwin Award material. likely claims seeing end summer virus became less deadlier. SARS-CoV-2 mutates relatively slowly, even adaptation appeared, many, many virions floating around point. happen everywhere, happen once. would take long time variant spread effectively. said current administration (to include White House state level) continue nothing matter wave/phase in. Stitt said mask mandate EVER. hospitals full patients flown states. Alarms going every day, yet nothing done. People feeling helpless, scared beat down. can't even imagine Healthcare professionals feeling. Scientists experts sounded alarm since January yet are.

Edit: spelling I've said prior. Two two go hand hand. complete monster time good dealing pandemic. 
Again I've said before, China give fk anyone else China. Yea, lie screw rest world. change fact dealt virus properly. 
This subreddit covid-19 unthinkable people talk handled covid rather china's atrocities. Maybe need go news subreddit something. may reality places, 100 something cases steady level much better US EU seeing right now. Mind you, SK seeing upwards 300-400 months ago. 

The fact countries islands cannot another Australia NZ; country's benefit rampant outbreaks, sensible think every country needs deal COVID way. well regulations like one nurse per 2,5 patients ICU (3,5 night shift). practice like one nurse per two ICU beds . 
So usually like 70-80 ICU capacity used one nurse per 2 patients. winter go 90% time time technically often don`t lake personal ( strech 80% 100 % capacity instead nurse per patient become 2,5 ) , start strech personal like quality suffer. 
I mean emergency plans rase numbers like 30000 (=100 %) like 42 000 ICU beds strech even sure manage , mean lack quality care , Covid patients others. 
I mean many countries like anyways one nurse per 3 4 ICU patients . 
I mean German healtcare system one potent ( potent one) , comes cost . think quotation still downplaying things unclear.

The medical expert bringing governor made clear ""could"" case ""this might might happen all"", ""this definitely going happen, might might next 10 days"". viable, mean design high potential. trials many steps determined viable, late stage phase III last part. actually way schedule initial estimates Q2 2021, already optimistic based previous history vaccine development. Lobbying government anti-renewable energy? look graph daily cases see initial spike, lower numbers followed second spike currently riding third spike. really disagreement semantics. people call spikes wave really look never really ever suppressed point others consider one long first wave. Well, estimated 750m true cases occurred month ago, probably 1b now, vs tested positive number 44m, tested numbers don‚Äôt much relevance. Regardless, study needed Japan determine almost Covid deaths, almost shut downs, hyper dense old, least serology studies show widespread Covid transmission happened.  don‚Äôt obviously can‚Äôt read. thing (but worse, due higher death rate) happened Influenza pandemic yestercentury. 

The infection rates went bit, restrictions lifted course second wave hit.

It painfully obvious 2nd wave COVID-19 gonna happen exact reason... 2020 stop.
I feel like covid upper hand here. Guilty charged! goddamn right Well breathe toes! tough decision requires difficult conversations.

It's safe return yet, end discussion.   Sorry, right. said, ""the federal government dictate states could do""

I'm sure example that, part, hands (outside aid mentioned). *H1N1 2009 entered chat*  literally top sub today:

[Covid-19 coronavirus: Oxford vaccine 'will ready Christmas' says professor leading count vaccines making dent coming Dec/Jan peak flu season spike.

(Oh source ultimately Sun rumor mill -- [see today's example I've read people missing annual check-ups doctor visits may caught something like cancer earlier. school district, special need students never stopped in-person school. Sorry, misunderstood. Canada Chief public health said March messaging senior leadership media similar Europe well North America Europe happen virus completely control. It‚Äôs dim witted opinion comparisons countries don‚Äôt matter. ramblings brainwashed child. **Of course comparisons countries matter**. literally way determine strategy better worse strategies. refuse address point? break back trying ignore let ask three clear questions.

Sure. I‚Äôll leave nothing out, contrary constant skipping arguments questions. Swedish healthcare system fail?

Yes. let people die would lived gotten care gotten. fear overloading system caused many die. want sources that? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve sent already. Swedish economy crash?

Yes. Swedish economy suffered immensely, virtually zero difference rest Scandinavia, less countries rely tourism Sweden does. prevent Second wave devastating?

Yes. second wave generally mild, seen across world. mild Sweden rest Scandinavia though. 

So sum up, again: Ten times many deaths Norway Finland, damage economy. still try defend it. diseased mind must have. fucking 6 months prepare government anything...

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck politicians I'm terribly sorry gone that. wish best, take care best right now. valleys peak still high can't say we've ever exited initial ""wave"" infections; stating we're past initial wave would imply things (on national level) degree control, point - case. 


Instead, regional surges throughout country different places, different times, given false impression we've moved beyond first wave. get source numbers, blogs please. support terrorists. want admit yourself. Thing is, people eating *alone* they‚Äôre definitely keeping masks on. I‚Äôve seen area pretty much everywhere else, single restaurant respecting minimum distance tables/customers, maybe found one place actually put safety profits, knows. grandparents live Poland. grandmother tested positive last week currently Warsaw hospital fighting life. They've move THREE times accommodate influx patients. feel awful especially visitors allowed pop pop can't go her. Absolutely heartbreaking. 

I urge everyone stay safe continue wear masks 24/7, pandemic going anywhere, anytime soon! Dunno, maybe something *doesn't* involve massive disruption everybody's daily life? almost like we've known since February, CDC obfuscated picture much humanly possible.

Almost everything said media since April meant minimize panic, basically string people along there's vaccine.

Everyone trying hard anything, hopes covid goes away egg head comes save them. far none happened, things keep getting worse. Masks can't stop viruses stop gaseous molecules... Jesus idiocy obviously denial phase. totally wish virus would go away like Mr. Orange keeps saying, take while. We'll lucky wide-scale availability vaccine March 2021. take several months deploy vaccine - done talk dropping masks.... take while. know inconvenient truth. compared states stricter mandates compared looser mandates? should. always check speaking something. MAN, Romania following path. School reopening happend two weeks later, like start october maybe. closed 15th October places high community spread.  decades making. propaganda rugged individualism, dont let government tell do, American exceptionalism... country fucked, fucked disease thats easy prevent. 

I immigrant would happily go back, home country fucking ruled complete ban abortions. allowing LGBT Free zones cities. also seeing insane spike Covid. 

Fuck this. Agreed, I'm really tired seeing argument everywhere everyone's epidemiologist know pandemic wave supposed look like. I'm like ""who cares important?' Serious answers who?

From you, logistics closing schools, asked comment. [That standard widespread practice. virus controlled effective implementation measures countries trying hard make different, They'll blame someone else. LGBT, ""the evil left"", EU. Anyone themselves.

Few weeks ago blamed health workers ""lazy"", I'm sure they'll think scapegoat time arrives. Shh, say stuff like r/Coronavirus! Everyone's gonna argue you, downvote oblivion! EU proving impotent powerless time time comes solving biggest problems, realizing ambitious projects, even delivering core declared promises. 

I fundamentally pro European integration (and even unification/federalisation), hard see EU going much current state... far know, peace time non person older 75-80years old accepted icu, due fact way icu treats patience invasive old bodies cannot recovery treatment itself. would considered torture... submit article users r/coronavirus called ‚Äú told so. didn‚Äôt listen?‚Äù /s CDC's 2007 pandemic ""playbook"" recommended school shutdowns 4 weeks max pandemic like Got flu one work, although required doubt it. Like real vaccine? whatever pisswater trump pushing? Much easy people dismiss terrible things saying due culture. cultural. flawed healthcare system (overall was) way COVID unprepared much world pandemics. reason Korea well prepared shit YEARS happened. People already using percentage ailments. can‚Äôt start base number. thing happening lot US states. Yo dude, what??

Almost everything either wrong irrelevant. 

Kinda weird arguing October 2020 SARS 2.0 ‚Äúnot particularly dangerous.‚Äù less dangerous Smallpox pretty weird litmus test. updated one school district neighboring school districts Iowa in-person classes since late August. Online learning always option one third students choose that. school districts started 100% person classes. Some, like mine, started 50%. far schools great. outbreak all. Actually it‚Äôs good school district voted go 50% 100% in-person starting next month. talked last Corona Podcast. Millions listening lack care (workers) actually main problem intensive care medicine, even Corona. conducted surveys it. also know 20 30 percent intensive care beds Germany cared for. Although physically equipped ventilators monitors, available even pandemic. intensive care beds per 100,000 inhabitants Germany worldwide. That's good, too. helped us lot pandemic also set beds. see many free beds intensive care register, filled. main problem moment. improve working conditions payment nursing staff, otherwise problems. Covid19's patient numbers hospitals increase now, must redistribution nurses intensive care unit. lead reduction performance areas. must clear us. would always pay attention it: must always refer free beds. indeed free, thus DIVI, present personnel, order care one must explain briefly, exactly proven, many beds intensive care units Germany occupied free. looked number. Yesterday one third, beds free. mean relation personnel? one simply calculate size? milkmaid's calculation, say reserve, looks quite reassuring one thing. think say one Germany die cannot get ventilator bed. happen. redistribution. UKE, University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf, beds well occupied terms intensive care medicine. relatively normal operation again. already two Covid intensive care units. know: clear guidelines public health department regarding separation Covid patients, suspected Covid cases so-called quarantine patients, i.e. contact, perhaps even home relatives coronapositive. example, must cared nursing staff. means two complete intensive care units umbrella term corona patient care leads restriction intensive care patients. words, continues, longer able provide level care patients stroke, heart attack cancer Germany would otherwise able to. must clear us, nursing staff also lacking, beds missing cannot operated moment due lack nursing staff. must come regrouping then. leads losses operational business also conservative www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)

So look like they'll able care number ICU patients (up 40.000) cost regular non-covid patient care. countries like Poland Czech Republic way past point. They're building field hospitals. Poland fewest doctors per population EU. new field hospitals need staffed workers know operate ventilators. easy operate workers actually need trained time personnel...

Here entire podcast Shut fuck up. 251 probable cases huge outbreak? People stop following rules, yes. 

But places forced close, won‚Äôt choice. Sounds right. Oxford vaccine coming early november many clients got it? know. I'm expert, saying German media reported. Maybe vaccinations done shorter time span, maybe not. reason think read false. mom says catch cold wear socks! country random checking Everybody mom put work preprint server.  SK religious extremists minor faction Korea, like almost sole anti maskers there.

So minor managed cause least 2 major outbreaks, sure. point SK perfect. Even though they're perfect, make excuses blame public. necessarily. Asian countries experience pandemics. issue people saying due collectivism makes seem like Western countries hopeless, really case. Asia also monolith. say Indians Indonesians less collective suffering much reasons beyond that. necessarily selfish either. I'm wearing socks zoom meetings coronavirus either! Oh thanks. completely missed that. :) Yeah, brought doctors China Wuhan. longer possible Europe virus everywhere reported recently national news. Trump caused Covid didn‚Äôt know? kidding. said post 52k daily cases ""American numbers""

America hasnt come close types daily numbers ""We listen science,""

How much rhino horn powder helps erection again? ""C19 nothing like flu, except it‚Äôs like absolute worst flu pandemic 100 years""

Don't daft. You, I, everybody else reading knows ""just flu"" meant ""just flu we're used dealing with"" ""just like H1N1 novel flu."" I'm honestly surprised they're quarantining. dear leader Trump got sick, soon pumped full meds gave Walter Reed, went right back started rallies again. also decent amount anti-maskers covid deniers France? American here, know sort ignorance wide-spread. countries never full lockdown. 

I know, that's point. Japan's testing stats extremely poor see hospitals overwhelmed ton excess deaths anything like that. There's excuse set decent system like South Korea's 7 months; complain compliance 2-3 months general good behavior, 4-6 months places. government plenty time prepare stable reopening didn't, get scot free sit around fighting amongst ourselves. think pride thing right now. recently Poland largely avoided high infection numbers. Feb beginning October total 90,000 cases peaked 19,000 concurrent cases. 

Right 250,000 cases almost 140,000 concurrent. huge surge less month. think caught guard. matters next, seeking help neighboring Germany would make sense. buy virus thats got everything Christmas?

More warm bodies. Sweden lot less daily deaths single digits right now. Deaths per day dramatically decreased since peak ahead rest. 

most people ""over it"" honestly, many Trump getting getting better fast final nudge needed. ""if fat, 74 year old man ok..."" Poland ancestral home. grew traveling time visit family eventually, living two years. loved inspiring progress country made since fall Communism.

But pathetic sad. can't even stand family members willingly vote PiS hide intolerance like cowards. voted anti-science hateful party, OK go Church. leave shit behind! /s

This person probably also tells people complain cost housing move across country random city lower cost living connections. couple things say response this. first bit simplistic boil safety vs. political financial gain millions people unemployed we're grips full depression. second yes essential workers unaffected pandemic health wise, also dismiss can't work right due gathering restrictions whose jobs peril scientific intervention arrives. battling Hillary biggest cunt also called smart educated listening scientists. Koreans managed oust president long ago. personally happy coexist bipedal gas bags get confirmation elderly vulnerable longer considered risk.

That's really number. point time rest easy knowing I've done ensure I've harmed someone else. hospitals... ""easy"" build hospital real problem stuff it. Simply doctors nurses. Czech republic build army hospital 7 days well. also really important note people get ""flu"" really flu. usually they've got something else gets lumped bucket.  real actual flu knock ass like week, using pooping guts vomiting

I used downplay flu younger. got it, junior year High School.

I *very* good physical shape back (ran track field, etc), flu *knocked ass*. school 2 weeks, period 5 days pretty much unable get bed.

The flu joke lower humidity, respiratory droplets travel farther aerosolize faster. fucking idiot. 12? think restrictions punishment? thinks might covid, absolutely stay home (unless going hospital need be). Going work knows negative fair people. k  directly responsible deaths lol Maybe get Covid something really nice won‚Äôt infect anyone 2021. advice

Advice own!

They already  read numbers above? lot states went without cases even winter 5 cases time. Haha, bullshit. Koreans LOVE party Asian communities tend much social conventions obligations week...

&amp;#x200B;

They might celebrate kind shit Americans tons traditional celebrations festivals.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, celebrate American shit top it. Look Koreans celebrating Halloween Itaewon (it's packed). iirc, Korea contact traces credit card records too. Drastic measures like would never fly Western countries, that's covid 19 would never get control countries. gone Comparisons countries literally matter. Especially comparisons want make. counter argument.

The thing done try demean character, telling.



Now let ask three clear questions.

Did Swedish healthcare system fail?

Did Swedish economy crash?

Did prevent Second wave devastating?

Yes no? Wow. ceasefire one party keeps shooting. Maybe go share assessment doctor see she‚Äôd say. make difficult counter accurate lol. Yes, Ada, though grew rural kuna. 
I say see referring to, though it‚Äôs still problem, feel slowly getting better. Whether that‚Äôs bc California, Oregon, Washington, etc move younger generations open access things like social media world wide news. locking necessary, contact tracing necessary, going ""oh that's draconian dictatorial would never work liberal democracy"", really mean ""would never work society filled selfish idiots led incompetent fools"". 

Plenty democratic nations gotten things control. necessary.

[The replies perfectly exemplifies think secularism key metric this. France (in Europe know) pretty secular they're rough time right too. coronavirus agrees truce I'm in. Oh no. answer interpret constitution majority voters see it. 

You may call abandoning constitution, that's interpretation.  helps turn dire situation around.

And what? reopen rise 300% 2 weeks we're back started. 

Lockdowns made complete sense spring, hold summer. lockdown predicated staying locked problem dealt via either national plan (impossible election probably January beyond), enough vaccine doses something useful (no timeline), summer comes (6+ months off).

State unemployment funds already near tapped and, least state, allowed constitution either run deficit raise taxes. happens unemployment checks stop coming?

These fiscal problems even serious impending death 1% population. simple answer anymore; squandered chance come one summer. Reinfection seems pretty rare. antibodies seem last 3-6 months, memory T-cell may last longer. Washington State recently said studying ~100 reports reinfection, state ~100K cases far (so 0.1% reinfections, though know first infection date 100 cases calculate rate). Previously researchers wondered virus hiding body, broken viral pieces causing someone test positive again, one research paper Hong Kong proved individual reinfected different strain, virus sequenced first second infections. People completely incapable realizing consequences seen couple weeks proper reaction looks like complete overkill.

We keep repeating lesson everywhere people incapable learning without directly experiencing bad consequences themselves. Sometimes people financial means follow guidelines sometimes they're hard headed see point they're one bed.

It's massively frustrating. article literally says, ""Professor Hill, founder director University Oxford√≠s Jenner Institute, admitted timing tight begin vaccinations Christmas √± insisted indeed possible."" article leads someone believe Christmas real possibility, even likely, article clarifies total confirmation. Furthermore, later goes suggest early 2021 even spring 2021 it'll roll out. Additionally, look articles story, one, goals optimist ones scientists. 

I'm trying negative, want vaccine ASAP, I'm pointing misleading articles vaccine articles have, ironically later clarify elaborate text. hard find staff it

That's happens doctors paid would qualify minimum wage across western border... Serious answers who?
Because seems politicians many european countries failed understand even basic principle behind way virus spreads.

The risk infection gets higher take bunch people, confine hours closed space masks. Repeat daily millions. expected outcome reopened schools?

I reading months many asymptomatic younger likely symptoms.

Now someone explain could good thing. combination constant close contacts asymptomatic fact come back home parents grandparents viral bomb.

Unless idea asymptomatic unlikely infect someone else. that's case first politicians point scientific evidence supporting claim. somehow confirm theory, explain asymptomatic cases tested, monitored, required stay home actually test negative. government mandate companies must proof workers tested negative Covid coming work. Airlines already requiring Covid tests 48 hours flying overseas, State Hawaii requiring thing tourists. 

So although one refuse get tested, one won‚Äôt legally able go anywhere anything that‚Äôs government decrees.  problem millions schools everyday masks. closed bars 6pm.
Prepare disaster. Rule 1. Please attempt stir drama. also doesn‚Äôt help everyone thinks people‚Äôs opinions subject matter black white. support wearing mask enclosed public spaces best keep distanced people don‚Äôt know, anything passed isn‚Äôt worth (and many others know opinion). Locking indefinitely isn‚Äôt option normal people. 

We wear masks stay open provide funding medical centers combat this, giving government permission close whichever businesses want something sit well anyone. 2 strategies western world:

1. NZ/Australia - complete supression (very tough larger non isolated countries landlocked countries).
2. Sweden did- Sustained spread summer aim sustained measures withstand 2-3 years attempting shield elderly (which managed initially).

Both come tradeoffs. Ultimately either hurting Western societies. strategies equal successes.

For example Canada :

* atlantic provinces followed strategy 1. Right barely cases , life largely normal.
* British Columbia followed strategy 2. Normalcy maintained balance ""measures"" ""restrictions"".
* Quebec Ontario neither suffering.

Its extremely cold hearted finger wag ""partying youngsters"" selfish youth. demographic largely unaffected pandemic due hare brained, flip flopping policies graduating potentially worst economy century owe nothing society. Im sorry really dont. sacrificed going pay next decade random health official secure government job say ""stay home "" without exit plan without considering social, emotional financial aspects this.

Staying home till 2022 strategy-its byproduct glaring public policy failure governments. Heard faicu say press conference first doses early December general population would access right away. I‚Äôm guessing worked logistics deploying certain people first √±. Well, despise Italian PM. absolute moron. got friends still don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs real. is. Yeah know plenty places closed sucks, they‚Äôre going eat doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre going literally nowhere. I‚Äôm saying there, opinion staying home avoiding everything largely minority, regardless might seem like expect lockdown announced Sunday Grow own? /r/eatcheapandhealthy?? Dude hard eat healthy u think people lazy shit lol failed schools. Every group loud minority ruins bunch. Yes, millions people like incredibly damaging personal societal level; probably way Christians fall line thinking/philosophy. Keep good Christian.

a non-dickhead atheist Worked well may 18th mid september.
Then reopened schools 2 weeks got second wave. Oh sorry right. yesterday (1,042). Today 851. country size New Zealand, logistics required contain spread compare many landlocked countries bother people coming via flight also road train illegal crossing. NZ great largely understood ok isolated island unless people get batshit crazy like US. Even country like Canada great, US remains big threat. Merit NZ neighbouring country poses constant threat. may waiting forever. 3 days, makes 6000 Even india see people wearing mask + faceshield literally everywhere. would get treated like mad nutjob EU US. Removed rule 1 rule 5. Please nicer users here. üëè COMEüëè ONüëè PEOPLE!üëè Exactly. doubt positive results, without knowing took placebo didn't... really measure effectiveness? US government paying manufacturing companies, contracting buy produce. believe British government kind IIRC decent amount animals (the one remember cats) get COVID. IK comment joke figured I'd mention anyway. Color shocked. could possibly known ignoring virus sending kids back school people back work attitude distain toward masks social distancing could lead this? /s 

Sorry, I‚Äôve apparently lost ability roll eyes silently ignore bullshit lot dining restricted. Partially people cautious, partly poverty. live Utah. also see lot. next door neighbor went large wedding nobody wearing masks. nOvEl ViRuS Sheesh someone lives alone kids almost sounds worth it.

Risking hide 4500 week...

Oh wait, except get sick lungs work good Somebody know thinks masks bullshit may super spreader. 

He tested positive covid last week he's flown two planes, visited clients 4 states, ate restaurants, altogether everything shouldn't. 

The list people contact massive. 

IS HARD WEAR MASK? guesses something might be? think depends vaccine itself. Things consider second third vaccine target. target protein, second third vaccine would probably killed existing immunity.

Still, can't really hurt might prime immune system create t-cells. 

I'm expert would read anyone knowledge share ... ;) least Agricultural workers already got covid guess God bless nothing normal nothing normal nothing normal 

I hate repetition thing people think makes little speech sound impactful. 

Honestly read one line got bored don‚Äôt really valid point make. sure let‚Äôs CAPITALISE random words too, sarcastic reason. [I‚Äôd say reasoned analysis likely timeline enough give everyone Keeping mind there‚Äôs huge amount money line competitive space, exercise caution. That‚Äôs rational response. Shhhhhh  make claims would put jobs line. know people producing vaccine stock heavily interested making money know college money making machine soooooooooooo much money invested making vaccine ever gets first going insanely rich. would someone lie. answer almost always money!! use reason logic develop beliefs, going use reason logic escape either. Counting government pump money markets sustainable even guarantee anyway. reality cities can't get control going force shut like El paso hospitals completely full. trying prevent happens number cities it'll indicator everything tank market-wise. Nobody asking solve problems, especially since clearly tone deaf obstacles people way pandemic force put danger irresponsible actions people. China, think people mandated wear masks time (pre-Covid least). Normal might mean greater acceptance wearing masks, hope mean everyone needs mask time permanently people public that's meant Asian countries. Yep. going ""Christmas Surprise"" everyone instantly vaccinated back ""normal"". take long time roll out. challenge, convince vaccinated keep masking social distancing they've confirmed proper herd immunity. mean look Trump. got vaccine ""instantly cured""... ok. They‚Äôre also mainly islands. Easy restrict travel access know exactly people coming of. Literally staying home constantly never leaving house? Probably &lt;5%. people taking pandemic seriously leaving anything essential trips walks/exercise? Probably 30-40%? That's friends parents doing. also really depends live. go college NYC, seeing here, I'd say number higher people know serious is. house FL, I'd say &lt;20% taking measures seriously. question is, viable vaccine ready spring 2021? Genuine question havent keeping news. Maybe ill find reddit  Obviously not. point I'm going request stay reschedule next year.

To honest, think parents likely catch virus daily routines catch visiting. Fiance work home minimal contact others. parents commute office, go eat, social distance. Mizoram reopen two weeks strict lockdown, confronted problems trying avoid? person responded said people want businesses close even talk it, willing use income support affected.

I accurately pointed people want businesses close willing that.

You changed topic specific state government doing.

Which first, falsely assumes taxes Illinois collects goes Illinois. doesn't. states collect taxes (california example) actually heavily supports states raise least (like lousiana). 

I agree people options time. different topic responding to. changing topic argumentative.

I agree enough done support already said ignored. Yes, insanity shown fact 9 months still people one side refuse wear masks go house parties hand got people sanitise groceries don‚Äôt even go walk. difference China jail reeducate anti-maskers, need people advocate already history involuntary commitment. Fair. actually mentioned option day well. ‚Äútherapeutics‚Äù, course. world fly Toronto London England half day thing island. 

You create islands strict border control. 

Do lockdown. Close Provincial / state borders outsiders 2 week quarantine mandates individuals crossing said border accepted reasons. 

Then control keep border sealed tight flights / shipping traffic minimum essential traffic only. work neighbours same. open ‚Äúisland‚Äù combine. Rinse repeat. cases show lock area take step two back contain it. 

Easier said done sure. It‚Äôs easy. sucks while. contain bubble prevent entering bubble tame live normal albeit travel free life. is, they're whatever slander politicians like. definitely Puritan component pandemic like saw AIDS

Not surprising Fauci also charge botched AIDS response. copypasta (though mention it, might save post somewhere else). may believe though someone feels fine without social interaction.

He'll less half hour risk transmission low even covid positive. make sure talke OUTSIDE, inside play safe. done.

But done, need reopen cases zero

Not hundreds, thousands even tens thousands, certain places did. understand. know means much, I'm proud you. fix entire problem mean useful. come contact someone it, maybe go much spread others learn it.

Yeah.... will.... El Paso 6th largest city state.

Ah see, one adenovirus. idea means! :) Shag specific type dance, shuffley since meant done sand. music to, imagine like ""Carolina Girls"" etc. people, one them, probably since March.

I guess new Bugatti gonna wait... cheating still rewarded, whether white collar crime Astros World Series. nothing inevitable deciding let pandemic kill people months vaccine. stimulus, fed asked month ago moolah keep
It inflated look good trump. Trump tweeting like idiot day covid fake news cause test exactly rest world pity‚Äôs us right now. usually warn either way. people get symptoms close contact someone positive, assume probably covid. What's point getting tested then? centralist

what think word means? might help understand point.

the app block anything, notice respond comments?

this aint rocket surgery bbnjb. Jj dw yea, Reddit hates Russia Isreal equally Either way society protect weak. 500,000 total global cases everyone starts hoarding hand sanitizer, canned food, toilet paper.

500,000 global cases daily it‚Äôs back dining out, frequenting bars, gathering friends family. anything entire thing made take time realize there's rush get I'm going means might die getting there. keep ‚Äúturning corner‚Äù. soon realise we‚Äôre actually circling drain? eliminates candidate. Anybody covid toes? Wishful thinking part. make vaccine. government distribute inject vaccine assume people understand immunization works.

Definitely good news, considering well US screwed management Coronavirus far, I'll hold breath actually starts happening en masse. people think they're immune day one shot making worse get better goes wear mask, hugs kisses people. percentage people think staying home constantly since March? Forward violations state authorities something it. Dude drive sports car like grandma amount people see driving Honda civic Prius 90 mph highway nuts. People swerving lanes. I've seen people driving light *on purpose*

Something going on. entire thing something people good. 

Really fuckin bad. Breakdown society. problem nationwide gets worse every day. Ambulances sick go hospital hospital looking places wait several hours admission. fact currently making hospital football stadium capital clearly says bad ... Maybe directly foolish think idiots, wherever live, emboldened fact president United States essentially agrees encourages them. seriously tho, china manage contain virus, people go , like city density almost order magnitude larger alot european city, city population entire country, hell contain this? Yeah that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying March. It‚Äôll pretty much 12 months day shit hit fan never control. temporary respite Summer weather allowing people spend lives outside, plus little attention prevention protocols (although degree Europeans followed protocols uniformly always vastly overestimated). flu!?? test then?!?! /s Yesterday learned infamous (((name))) formerly meant virtually hug another user.

(((u/bored_in_NE))). ‚Äúfake virus‚Äù ?? /s Exactly. Merry Halloween, everyone! TLDR: 
Human challenge trials like untypical (used developing vaccines treatments Typhoid fever Malaria, example), remain risky controversial. sample size 90 people, led Imperial College London. 


The study quite late vaccine game, starting early January 2021 results expected May 2021; begin, pass ethics panel. 
The viral load would given volunteers nasally droplet spray, lowest dose possible cause infection. difficult make mandatory testing Europe, yet make people mandatory pay taxes. problem that, there's proactive strategy. Everything reactionary West instead attacking problem head on. Czechia seems certainly surpass Belgium's daily deaths November based latest models. People dying now, infected September. peak 15000 infection last week would start show next month 3, 4 weeks delay. Czech health statistics already operate 15000 deaths January. One model predicts 25,000 deaths. Covid became leading cause death last week Czechia. Fyi, RNA vaccine. could see trading suspended week. market knows what's coming even politicians can't admit it. Honestly... I've ventilator 3 weeks still even managed kill once. starting grow bored, had? Lol Oh yeah exactly. don‚Äôt use straws, you‚Äôll save world, government doesn‚Äôt anything. Yes course. love spend time laughing pointing rather learning. bold assume let guys mouth. Argentina~~'s lockdown management~~ joke 

Corrected.

&amp;#x200B;

Out bad joke, yes. lockdown government joke. plan lockdown print money. K Sars-cov-1 sars-cov-2. 

You confused. Another dangerous idiot far right loon. 12 months earliest, guess virus never ends... shoot people though call cops. can‚Äôt shoot virus! kind fucked analogy that? 3 weeks back normal everyone taking things granted again. wired forget put crap behind us. sad, true. feel like even significant number people vaccinated still social distancing masks much 2021. Even I'm able get vaccine March I'll still required wear mask place since know who's vaccine, vaccine likely less 100% effective. press release new information early data published show immune response old people. Alaska got near zero, opened migrant workers fishing season, worst per-capita numbers world.

The state borders shut sides equal unified response. part world liability strong can't this?

There's week goes read stories hospitals fucking killing people sort negligence malpractice. ""You covid, go home"" going get anyone trouble. Anywhere. Super soaker filled spit. Combine love guns spitting Covid believers one! aFfEcTs oLd pEoPlE almost like something like bound happen. certain people continue think big hoax nothing going happen them... president got (still care) wife kid got (still care) half White House got (still, cares) propaganda machine Fox News get (still, care) VP chief staff gets (nah, care)

Absolutely baffling borders opened sometime summer, August believe Protip: person saying extensive American political post history, assume thats reason think vaccine cuz Yes, correlation causation üôÑ right wing country is, higher covid death toll. Poland March, April May (you wouldn't, borders closed) would see one strictest lockdowns Europe. praise Poland, Czech Republic Slovakia news, ""Eastern European countries got better western, let's drop obsession human rights populist like Poland"".

Now Poland list ""countries actually lockdown"" Deaths still relatively low increasing. new spike cases 3 weeks old. Next week tell whether death toll get back April levels not. I'm antivaxxer. wondering vaccine safe. Oxford vaccine death neurologic symptoms presumably transverse myelitis.
EDIT Addendum: Looks like death unrelated imagine also mother's life stake. Similar kind narrative pushed climate change/environmentalism, pressure consumers right individual impact pretty much nill compared corporations. feel like I've read headlines similar rises back March. ""shag"" sounds like specific dance. bet people meeting variety dances including shag. happened China, scrambled build two hospitals built. doubt happen Poland. death rate going high. Droll, droll üôÑüò∑ Seeing Korea still musical theater went depressed blindingly furious. West far behind, might even century anymore. Women's rights public health crisis lot people. ironically, travellers China still banned.That US end like government uses political diplomatic preference make decisions. I've got sympathy people exhausted lonely. I've got sympathy empathy people broke desperate.

The people whining want go foot ball party thousand person wedding eat shit meat OP's comment.

But nothing comment. Got it. repeat Wuhan.

*‚ÄúThose fail learn history doomed repeat it.‚Äù* Brussels amazing! man take notch. hate fox news much next guy, weren‚Äôt decent folks would even unfiltered loony. Baier, Juan williams, Bill hemmer, etc. leave, Murdoch fill Trump shills. shitty situation absurd one hand see articles sounding alarms quickly rising cases hand fans stands college football world series. It‚Äôs still good line like ‚ÄúI drink know thing‚Äù line. Season 8 caused leave bad taste mouth, like guy doesn‚Äôt eat enough pineapple. would survived without overload die. Given extensive worldwide cost virus, cost producing billions doses going relatively small definitely worth risk. Lol ok blood bank website link supposed add something click bait title? Also didnt know USA today blood bank considered entity. Anyway, ""source"" linked doesnt say anything covid INCREASING DEMAND blood. 0 mention it. even link that? even read link? like people giving shit claiming hoax. Americans awful people. countries better acted early tech-based tracing system would considered blatant borderline undemocratic privacy violation West. 

So, saying article horseshit, immediately make point does. value individual privacy\* saving lives compatriots. apparently islands (Korea included, really)

That would news afford shut rest world.

They can't afford can. difference priorities, afforded.

(\*) privacy entirely imaginary, we're already routinely spied governments, carry smartphones pockets wherever go. government wants know we're doing, need press button. adjust level testing wave?

MA like 60k tests day, werent anywhere near april That. Big percentage older people/vulnerable ones already died it, younger populations affected. Dude's dumb post. wish statements covered all. said US constant blaming bars college students. refuse believe bars thing fueled spikes summer people gathering place time. people blame college students partying President hosts super spreader events over, town hall meetings done without masks, generally everyone still hanging maskless other. 

There definitely Puritan component pandemic like saw AIDS Actually Australia, there‚Äôs one state ( Victoria)with sustained community transmission second wave. However it‚Äôs opening long lockdown, cases average less 5 day, state boarders opening month so, yes possible sustained due international border closure. Really? J&amp;J Netherlands built it? ""Us"" means ""the group I'm part of"", ""every human earth"". Mask wearing accepted East Asian cultures even covid. least used see Asians airports wearing masks years pandemic. Good. totally hear you! Hang there... Go compare population Bangalore population Hyderabad talk,like said get bubble.

Anyways back point,I volunteer NGO's think bit inclined talk might know situation ""everywhere"" guy spends time TV/internet thinks whole world revolves around one grocery visits get groceries Mum.I see way many people without masks masks half covered nowadays ofc bothers leads suspect numbers.

The Lancet recent posted article false optimism may prevailing India think case perfect case study above. Dude, like dozen people outside shooting guns randomly telling someone, ""Just avoid getting shot.""

Disease social problem; individual solutions social problems. Thanks. it‚Äôs specific type dancing. It‚Äôs sad got sick dancing time wasn‚Äôt smart. Thanks going detail. view considered find value learning someone's position regardless opposition. One biggest factor - people asian countries proactive disease rather wait government suggestion, recommendation, mandates. fact think government enough, think government countries correct thing time. Use common sense, cautious.

I know there's currently lot anti-American comments going around - understandable since eyes right considering Covid ran rampant forget West includes Europe. countries hot either. think thet 4.7m tests. found less 200 asymptomatic patients 4.7m testings. send quarantine getting treated. China fucking scarily efficient comes shit like this... babbling. even make sense. lying Internal EU borders ""practically non-existent"" normal times. EU member state choose impose border restrictions deemed necessary. many EU countries implemented border restrictions year response virus. can't believe much miss taking kid stupidly crowded playgrounds. Seeing happy running around, always miserable hard find parking kids screaming everywhere. But, sad see alone everyday playing alone room. restrictions NZ international exits?

NZ opened quarantine-free travel Australia (with restrictions).

NZ specifically banned anywhere world. US is.

The US NZ anywhere close specifically regarding INTERNATIONAL TRAVEL. Covid-19 complicated.. mentioned risk factors increase chance death. 

You've probably heard New York horrible job deaths. 

It's horrible job. population density, multiple high traffic airports, combined lack knowledge time created rapid spread overwhelmed hospitals. 

When hospitals hit max capacity death rate increases dramatically. many beds, doctors, nurses, supplies go around. 

This ""flattening curve"" vital. know increased transmission hospital beds taken. Sadly, blunt. People die overwhelmed take care them. western world blaming China violating human rights back January locked Wuhan. 

Do think China lock 11 million people fun?! Cant government see serious was? absolutely nonsense, hope India use excuse stop improving hygiene water air quality, India, long way go.

The reporting government propaganda numbing people, telling accept now. unsure long term effective plan block virus

South Korea Hong Kong seem fine. Singapore great example operate post-lockdown society. Sweden good example too, even though people want say otherwise. wish made happy feel safer doesn't. people care probably chance getting all. year, anyway. read it. 

Doubtful, [it‚Äôs *super* telling don‚Äôt seem understand data comes straight ‚Äúthe media‚Äù. ... thanks chuckle. blood centers **are still reporting** significant declines blood collections, leaving blood supply United States critically low levels, according **a joint statement issued late last week AABB (formerly known American Association Blood Banks), American Red Cross America‚Äôs Blood COVID-19, **coupled wildfires Western states, recent hurricanes storms**, led ‚Äúunprecedented fluctuations‚Äù supply demand 80% blood collected American Red Cross comes blood drives**, returned pre-pandemic levels, schools opt virtual learning people continue work home. demand blood strong ever, hospitals back scheduling elective surgeries. makes sense. That‚Äôs why. get everyone vaccinated? Globally? Yeah sure. public health measures first world countries would long, long gone then. worry, go next day. I'm okay that. Literally irrelevant  lol china lying numbers disease harmless anxious, it? get Poland? thought borders closed non citizens. Last heard ok? Asking cause apparently massively uninformed Thank you! Stonks go wooooomp. That's scares me. Around every flu season like that. Hospitals overun, people waiting days seen, hospitalized waiting room hallways. People die waiting room, sometimes.

And COVID much worse. country really preparing this.

The hospitals worked fine, people die waiting, enough beds everyone. EVERYTHING COVID. And, due closing schools, almost kids hospitalized. even moved kids specialties hospitals pediatric hospitals make room COVID patients.

But everyone acting like nothing, prepared were. ""So much people died! outrageous!"" Yell people idea awful regular flu season is. clue many people would died nothing. No, government slow react people arrogant behave responsibly without ordered to. wanted say hope you‚Äôre ok. LOL, well, matters Trump appointed federal judge ruled Wolf's lockdown orders unconstitutional awhile back! States rights!!! (Until manipulate court system say otherwise.) ""What mask? I'm wearing fashion piece""

Or better...

""Thus mask, anti-asshole apparatus."" Island nations (New Zealand/Iceland) countries welded people homes (China) noticed articles keep getting posted saying vaccines safe effective every hours, even though vaccine proven safe effective?

They're delusia right now. believe either 2 weeks, 3 months, nothing convince otherwise, can't anything this.

You see pockets insanity covid fixed, even things keep getting worse worse. 

No, one expects first vaccine prevent covid, he's 100% right. guys keep ignoring multi year time frames sane people give, post metro guardian regurgitation Trump's gone 2 weeks. literally shows BSing debate lol. real. got message notification within 30 seconds posting this. 

I figured mods deleted post. Nope. Excited award.

Mad fuckin weird. stitch time saves nine Ah yes, virus made fuck Donald Trump.



Please. need virus fuck regular basis. vaccine already production tough? France: Amateurs include lumber? probably testing first batch vaccine poor Indians. unethical happens poor countries. hard time believing wore mask appropriately compliance.

Not mention... Masks 100% time spend public, indoor locations... closer may playing fireüî•.

Therefore, mention social distancing. Yikes. ma'am. perusing webs. 

and believe controlling masses much harder time around, businesses fucked people tired shut in. 

I'm hard lockdowns btw, I'm anti lockdown whatever. 

But absolutely believe West fucked *together*. 

that includes Europe silly smugness. long, two half months virtually homejailed? Yeah probably less restrictions. Can't imagine go went before. 

But hey, almost certain locked similar manner week so, shall see. looking around found book addresses lot mental health issues surrounding COVID-19 infections recovery. PhD Someone released ['mysterious vaping pneumonia deaths since mid 2019'] tho countries vaped none pneumonia. [COVID-19 Barcelona waste water sample early Cool, keep blaming others. People color much less likely able work home, yep, gotta go essential, person job hope nobody pulls mask sneezes you. Hopefully getting sick makes realize Trump bad job vote him.. need get brainwash hope lot have. course can. countries it. Would income tax, Medicare tax, social security tax, sales tax, property tax, payroll tax, excise tax, luxury tax, insurance premiums/deductibles/copays I‚Äôve paying whole life, need new tax one too? Cause feel like I‚Äôve paying lot got return tuition bills, mortgage, cops harassing walking neighborhood night. think people won‚Äôt naturally lock everything turns shit anyway? Might well everyone simultaneously get benefit letting fuck society months years end test whole one block. Cool.

But seriously, data China BS. billion+ people get 20 new cases day, whereas remote island Pacific thousand inhabitants get like 5 new cases per day. believe you, China. Milan...the economic center Italy. How? They‚Äôre even allowed check cages helmets. Medical facilities shut down, many places discouraging disallowing elective medical procedures need resources COVID patients. fact individuals choosing go doctor.

Can show example state initiated lockdown made illegal people go doctor? feel random grandma back watching window apperently obligations life snitching far. virus spreading that's viruses do. OTOH, people they're able allowed do. Rules made time. people drive side road more-or-less within speed limits they're magically willing behave right way. following rules get trouble. open. (private school school may open high need students). still distance learning major part socal. heard hotels quite like people pay fraction usual price hotels need perform deep cleaning afterward. Varies country state. US, aggregate, typically Sunday lowest case day week. Obviously situation rapidly rising declining cases, Sunday may exceed prior week's Monday (or vice versa) - universally local minimum. exception rule holidays - recently US's Labor Day Monday local minimum. Ok, point quote back claim clearly agree claim? 

Isn't better make optimistic prediction &amp; point expert's prediction says unrealistic? It‚Äôs funny say I‚Äôm projecting replied comment getting offended angry. didn‚Äôt engage you, engaged me. good day big guy, you‚Äôre clearly delusional lol. El Paso border town overrunning illegals. listen artists like Stef Ekkel dance electronic dutch music? Case count nothing severity. We‚Äôve known case count way higher confirmed testing restraints. said possible 10% entire world infected. resources handle completely swiftly. also half country brainwashed literal kindergarten level propaganda.

Okay buddy, nice night/day Nothing special, I've seen worse things Austria last months.

Skepticism means little doubt. phrase showed 100% doubt. Without actual proof warrant doubt, except clever media induced fear. well researched statement. lockdown subjective term. health order designed restrict movements best necessities. lockdown. 

No one America lockdown right now. 

And think anything anyway like, restrictions restaurants nothing leaving house. 

California restaurants never actually closed. actual lockdown could get pick delivery. soon after, opened restrictions restaurants follow. Numbers went summer started open outdoor dining. numbers went open restrictions indoor dining. time around restaurants seem following guidelines. Restaurants never closed. never denied McDonald's wont back normal spring.  way reminded objectively better healthcare systems pandemic ""swing"" voters, think they're swing voters anymore. Sickle cell affects people African descent adaptation increased likelihood surviving malaria. lack lockdown means live police state? Yep, rounding corner Public shaming drunk driving illegal js seriously. boss uses evidence China many deaths proof hoax. like imbecile, reason death rate low ENFORCE mask mandates, contact tracing, mass testing. they're way responsible caring community instead promoting stupid freedoms individualism. ‚ÄòFree‚Äô lol , whatever means. I‚Äôm happy guns, sea belts OHS. Free hurt selfish assholes place I‚Äôd want live. No. fuck downvoted that? Lol. There‚Äôs end sight idiots sub like ‚Äúno wait, need gloom doom forever‚Äù better stop late never.

Alcoholics stop, time break sterno. busy mom. Wow, find bit demoralizing propaganda. completely unrealistic, imo. ones still alive. ""...but need us favor first."" Oxford started Phase 3 May, also seen recent numbers? probably already crossed treshold now. technically flu like vaccine covid won‚Äôt completely eradicated flat earthers skeptics too. set gofundme? That's hospital bills handled greatest nation Earth. Seeing retail workers shot, beat up, spit anti maskers, YES. It‚Äôs retail workers jobs law enforcement.

Most anti maskers ‚Äúblue lives matter‚Äù believers, shouldn‚Äôt problem following direction law enforcement.

However, Karens Kens see retail workers beneath them, like throw fits potentially get violent retail workers nerve tell do. aren‚Äôt either. one non-replicating viral vector vaccine - different virus delivers genetic material make coronavirus spike proteins can‚Äôt create virus. It‚Äôs really ‚Äòlive‚Äô also inactivated since infect cells. Also coronavirus. 

Anyway, couple live attenuated vaccine candidates well. Many best vaccines live it‚Äôs worth trying.  border vast, even there's cameras everywhere, patrolling impossible. first business owner wrong. employees HIP, regular Medicaid, uninsured, government paying get sick go ER hospitalized. customers. He's effectively driving healthcare costs government taxpayers spreading COVID-19. wait see, dont even think Oxford even reached original target yet vaccinations. getting twindemic well? ( flu + covid) 
This scares most. 10x mortality rate count complications diseases already have. 
  
Nobody counts heart attacks influenza deaths even tho complication occur.  
Check out, tenfold difference. mean like sickle cell? honestly don‚Äôt know science behind well article posted said Victoria getting average 500/day lock down. delaying inevitable inflicting harm necessary economy.

Enjoy turning third world country go police state lockdown near future cases start popping again. particular vaccine trial (there hundreds) always get lots media attention? People done. Another 6 months question consideting vaccine won‚Äôt even completely effective. point cure becomed worse disease. Australia one new locally transmitted case recorded today. sure 500 come from. few, even single country, would put citizens first? Oh yes. They've actually dug enclosure wall see popping holes park. kids always enjoy seeing them. People must really short memories

Yeah. That's really big part problem. remember broke, etc. though that, unfortunately, motivating lot individual response. need keep quiet USA 8 days. undermines criticism US response SARS-COVID-2 moment US people need know. [Covid-19 killed police officers year causes combined, data Remind please get reminded! Yes - let's smart here. US, second third wave bad first wave simply March testing. NYC probably 10x many actual cases tested ones.

Look hospitalizations deaths compare things. oxford even reached original goal 30k people vaccinated, mid September stated like 17k people vaccinated.

I dont know, seems like arent moving super fast compared pfizer already 40k people vaccinated? think isn‚Äôt Murdoch pos problem ? Freedom speech okay, people overwhelmingly decide delusion fantasy reality ? Wish could much simpleton days... Christmas going beautiful. sounds like price driven free market wasn‚Äôt dependent healthcare insurance....  Perhaps wearing masks visiting still large gatherings homes socially distance mask. matter perceptions population masks socially distances transmission decreased greatly. Except countries also handle it.

Feel free inform countries are. There's also attempt articles differentiate school children teens high school, suspect much bigger problem. college students helping make oxford vaccine? mean 500 new cases per day? We're getting 2k+ one state. country getting 80k per day. Good Australia needed done, hyperbole little silly. None know of.. lost jobs like countries im guessing fewer died would otherwise? think happening exactly? followup; could vaccine go production *while* data review taking place? Exactly, every dose vaccine kept within US economic impact us dose leaves borders. America first Hmm.. Maybe opening restaurants, even less max capacity, good idea all. think find peculiar nobody talking hard numbers.
""When daily infection rates drop XX"" 
""When daily deaths YY""

Nobody seems want define thresholds. Well am, least Again, unless medical laboratory training, basic understanding blood banking, epidemiology infectious diseases, qualified all.

Furthermore, now, MSM claim monogamous validated safe blood donors. cannot take risk sure safe so. safer thing ban sexually active gay men sure catch high-risk MSM. God took dump Poland. dumb live.

I also think goes show vulnerable peoples vaccinated, it‚Äôs going hard hold society back full reopen imo, even opportunity get it.

I‚Äôd like see real metrics end-game looks like terms societal risk tolerance. non-douches likely stay home outside work. like last game Oxygen Included. feeling like seasonal flu, still there, much less dangerous due vaccines GoodWorkRoof post based sad projections. could actually help themselves, extend help others. Mexican hospital, understand. Party brige story populists fake news, center disease control trace single case ""party"", people taking precautions. 


What important, people Czechia eat almost fish (neither supplement vitamin D), vitamin levels suboptimal combination russian fake news claiming virus hoax discouraging people masks school openings lead shithole in. really hope people stop bullshiting party brige instead take inspiration Czech story - wear mask, supplement vitamin dont asshole. Spread always likely within house. avoid large gatherings, rest above,, less likely get transmit within house small gatherings.

Either way, right, gatherings problem, limit those. 

Is really hard hangout 1 2 people time get food go?  something could done prevent this.... infected people still spread others. I've read reports NHS workers/doctors/nurses get first doses early December (and second dose month later) risk group followed high risk groups. looks good Oxford vaccine goer, hope get early next year spring.

I hope everyone everywhere get access free, least cheap. discarded I‚Äôm British. One friends stroke hillwalking airlifted literal mountain hospital treatment. moaning ¬£10/month prescription charge got released treatment. Even prospect invoiced ¬£17k air ambulance ride would cause rioting one bringing ""anxious,"" dipshit. I'm area. ridiculous many people going right across border close. acquaintance mine got sick last week going restaurant/bar Friday night near border, right everything closed again.

I would stronger mitigations stay home orders felt like could reap investment public health. believe could hold progress surrounding areas proud give damn. feel powerless anything beyond staying home myself. 24/7 media keeps reporting useless news flip flopping news. Within day hear 50 things scary coronavirus time also hear 50 things hopeful it. People tired going infinite roller coaster. wish journalists gets culled 1/10th 24/7 News station media banned eternity. Places like going experience significant economic boom one places world come early. Every day one city spends lockdown day falling behind another city live freely. whole pandemic going change shape world local economies forever. actually totally amazing roada even drivable amount people driving like do. people actually drove like ""everyone dumb bald monkey"" people act like do, roada would permanently gridlocked accidents every half mile. Boy howdy, sub seems exceptionally dark today. Monday blues? Ughhhhh. stressed. daughters teeth look BAD scared bring know dentist one risky places. üò≠üò≠ thing happened antivaxer fantasies. living long time even effective vaccine.

Nice strawman. probably many ways giving climate middle finger ways respond? dealing covid - disease party-goers immune spreading - yes, /s necessary. Tons people think it‚Äôs ok they&lt; go twice week. dont know downvotes totally agree this. system cannot rush something pretty much everyone going need. think that's big factor behind China's success containing pandemic : country mostly secular. Someone shared participant information sheet Like went walk alone? Literally left figuratively? Let's kill properly time. Omg tasty nooo :'( I'm still seeing lot people crying hoax. Insane. pandemic medical emergency. Doctors medical experts. Therefore, listen doctors pandemic.

Seems like Asia got figured least war class war. Let protest without masks, fine them.

Make sure masks requiered country (Not state) - States chance require it. literally buy thousands masks convenience stores US now. isn‚Äôt surgical mask shortage. see voter turnout getting scared. think complaints doesn‚Äôt follow quite way. And, argument tough always best refer people preferences, getting brass tacks require less-subtle labeling (sorry, everyone.)

A trans woman, let‚Äôs say pre op, would need celibate despite fact biologically still fully, physically male. relationship another man, puts fully physical MSM relationship therefore require guidelines. Saying person identifies female sex man poses risk greatly different man sex man nonsense me, shows making strides comes identity, still behind comes rest. 

Like said, tough fully support gender identity, referring trans woman man, makes cringe bit. But, think that‚Äôs I‚Äôm frustrated guidelines. Politicians get ridiculed prioritising economy health citizens, every, damn, time.

Also got something back analysis spouting BS? post stated EU governments took measures, would imply took measures point. Discussion article hackernews : May backfire since larger majority absentee voters Dems... weird time history don‚Äôt know immediately it‚Äôs placebo it‚Äôs BLINDED! independent reviewer knows thorough investigation. Maybe people stop stupid wait full story.  Texas #1 now.....past California! can't even form actual comeback. Sad. gonna test West Bank communities? gets 5,000-10,000 dying day I'm sure people change.

Nope. Based things learned past months, people soon get used number think normal again. Imaging back February, tell American going tens thousands cases day, react. now, part life. Great, another conservative populist government screwing up. Damn liberal scientists! Wait, Rib Mountain isn‚Äôt mountain?!? youth lie?!? Fauci one first say wear mask. Never late. Stupid suggest that. caught yet? Seems good true Proud Oxford scientists, preproducing-at-risk-thing done companies well. yeah, good either way! Proud see ACEP telling fuck bullshit. keep abusing us, lying us, expecting us keep showing every day.  cringe-speak I've ever heard. Like really, really bad. bet think sort new-age poet something ü§£ stage trailer trucks states high cases put front governor residence Many die within days born, within minutes, really matter. extremely inhumane. exactly. days feel efforts undermined chuds bother? soldier anyways, exhausted before. miss human contact. girlfriend left pandemic I'm lonely hell, I'm holding safely find new partner whole thing over. Pretty sure doesn‚Äôt track fact Africa low transmission mortality rate rest world. know, get cabin fever, get whole humans social creatures harmful I'm anxious get back things normally again. can't pretend happening wearing mask asking lot. El Paso: ""Are happy now? Proud yourselves?""

Republicans: ""ABSOLUTELY!"" There‚Äôs time place everything. Obviously academic setting poke holes everything, it‚Äôs awesome.

But pandemic, listen fucking experts ""we're turning corner"" Fer Sher. people connections private doctors. know, ‚Äúconnections‚Äù. realize many people cannot right? Naw, start near alcohol poisoning tough keep alcohol down, that's break funnel, long plastic tube start butt chugging. 

That's way make sure pass die. relevant? influenza vaccine, roughly 75% effective among risk populations. 

It's rarely high probably depends data ground. vaccinate elderly/vulnerable healthcare workers probably start working demographics. see hospitalizations deaths begin drop. likely causes governments begin opening things up. illness continues drop continue open things up. things like theatres open matter personal comfort. probably won‚Äôt going movies 2021 people will. Case numbers uncomfortable today may common deaths dropped dramatically. People know China media act like country literal 1984. miss movies. need Alamo come back full swing. Thanks!  FIL works astrazeneca predicted end october. ready though doesnt mean mass-produced Yep. medical laboratory training basic understanding blood banking, epidemiology infectious diseases, no, qualified judging validity blood donation rules.

Then clearly know read anything I've written. much basic understanding epidemiology infectious disease. actually wanted follow evidence based practices screening bad blood, would still allow msm donate inquire partners monogamous relationships. would cut bad blood non msm populations well allow much needed blood msm population. don't. Probably people like around. need stop fetishizing countries like NZ Australia focus countries efficiently dealt community spread post lockdown/state-of-emergency like South Korea, Thailand, Japan, Singapore, China.

The problem idolizing NZ Australia neither dealt huge outbreaks, many Asian countries did. single one countries listed made attempt shift full-on normalcy immediately, even though restrictions lifted. measures never recommended.

Jesus Christ. Support lockdowns masks point mental illness. Reminds dude. see point Chinese vaccines capable going abroad quickly, China, like powerful western countries, gonna use vaccine leverage poorer countries. shame, rest world going shafted either way comes vaccine  Measles, polio deadly COVID yet still caused many towns close stop spread various epidemic outbreaks both. 

Your assertion seems silly trying counter point. COVID 'rules world' far dramatic way measles polio, possibly assert things rapidly return normal much lesser diseases? Yeah I'm waiting bated breath 200,000 cases per day. Think I'm alarmist? That's around France would US population. Feels like I'm wearing nothing ^(nothing all) don‚Äôt know seen headline looked intense amount cases. months people refused stay home wear masks. hundreds dead thousands issues caused covid. morning announced another 1400 new cases. pride friendly small town mentality. brag kind matter side border come from. We're border community love native heritage Mexican heritage. We're big talkers comes much value family. happens. father owns small business slew bad reviews many people he's refused serve without masks. embarrassing people hospitalized convention center plastic blow tents others airlifted out. embarrassing read articles online always comments saying political event people dying anyway. embarrassing supposed better this. people know somebody who's died know least 5 people sick. fuck need wake community?? Many us feel powerless. study Qatar attempting get bottom specific issue seemed reinfection rate around 0.01% worries many citizens country okay throwing hands saying, ""Fuck it!"". 

When humans get pathetic? Can't even wear mask protect people without losing shit throwing tantrums. Getting mighty tired selfishness Americans. Famous last words need make r/covidracebaiting stuff like Voluntary donation protect blood supply ongoing emerging pathogens. goal get much possible, clean supply possible, motivating people via cash encourages lying screening process. also ends wasting lot expensive supplies find hepatitis along, secondary inventory consequences.

It would investing quarter lose dollar. deaths US fault europeans anything it, instead fault us anything it. That‚Äôs pretty sad. wearing masks OPEN areas even closed public places places till rate infection 1.0. going last year that. Get yourself! leopards feasting. honestly really sad. grew loving internet growing progressing, marveling connected made feel. sad see darker side internet ‚Äì enabling disinformation massive scale.  I‚Äôm honestly jealous lol. Since live close we‚Äôre expected family events whenever express concern we‚Äôre told we‚Äôre paranoid etc. I‚Äôve given arguing isolate 2 weeks see least won‚Äôt spread anyone else. least friends page us though. Looking forward hopefully seeing spring summer rush. Yup, masks wearing 99.8% Paris, ime. issue house parties, private gatherings packed restaurants. I'd almost guarantee required telework, encouraged it, banned indoor dining kept curfew place, maybe started couple hours earlier, numbers would improve dramatically. fully suspect it.

They already left lot people die March April without even trying save couple small areas hospital crowding problems United States Well next election Poland 3 years? whatever want ""undecided"" voters forget. exponential increase death..
 
in France tripled every month..
 
like said before, worry growth.. current number..
 
tripled every month means 1000 daily death end year.. referring cases. Much Europe still phase spiking cases advanced death yet. Yeah, there's also that. Especially Taiwan Korea's response outbreak quite poor messy. Guess ""civil"" back then. Unless either first subsequent infections mild. many people getting tested treated even telling anyone don‚Äôt get gravely ill? paywalled Around 3% infected need ICU. higher figure needs hospital oxygen.

0.5 - 1.5 % die despite best care (deaths concentrated age group 50).

No healthcare system could stomach numbers spreads 70 80% timeline. would Wuhan Bergamo every town city.

The alternative solution problem letting old people die homes without care pupose. Nobody country. It‚Äôs communism dumb dumbs. Capitalism liberalism failed. can‚Äôt ways - either you‚Äôre honest people risk compliance falling significantly, lie - point doubt even work.

Fear effective tool 7 months ago. Now, much. Coronavirus deaths becoming normalised, better worse. We're testing 1.2m people per day opposed 800k summer peak. positivity rate still well then. vaccine already well tested proven safe

No no, typical vaccine testing standards. also Moderna's first publicly available drug. basis reality argument keep posting. completely agree sir. 
Everything said , brought back old memories
Yesterday Ihave diagnosed covid-19 , searching topics hope developed vaccine terrible virus . 
I affraid anything , fact right , difficulty breathing , care , sake family , everyone sick , pray God everyday , still hope everything better soon , 

Please take care ÿå easy guys 
I hope everyone ok . 
And remember 80% cure disease . Vaccine ia coming also. need stay home guess also first one celebrate idiotic way. let people die streets en masse lockdown. part surgical mask squad ? We're much cooler cloth mask squad ridiculous think right. noticed I'm getting voted another thread asking OP masks required outside his/her countr distancing possible. Apparently even questions possibly construed disagreeing particular restriction forbidden. Starting December. 

Delta's keeping middle seats blocked next year. die covid tested covid, likely many US states worse UK? yet people freely travelling... sure meant quarantines NY problem states, people know travelled, zero follow-up.

Travel UK testing lot safer current travel problem states oversight. Every country refusing passengers US. currently highest rates infections since virus reached US. Comparing asteroid hurdeling towards earth actually kind apt. Leaving scientists politicians would make difference. still trying figure out, general consensus normal conditions virus survive surfaces enough quantity infect.

Obviously, still researched might completely wrong.

As pets one, seems incredibly rare. Can't lose even play. America's strategy yo tickets see RATM!! I‚Äôd never ever splurged big arena tickets before. would seeing hundreds maybe thousands atm, whether easily test Don‚Äôt plan terrorist. Boog slang possible civil war. You‚Äôre going find boog boi actually wanting happen. prepared wanting happen two separate things. They‚Äôre fucking compatriots either. makes think happening already. that's scary part. Things bad right now, capacity get much much worse. Sure, message sent part discussion. people mindset almost over, it‚Äôs actually going make worse. People need understand bad could get. That‚Äôs thing, it‚Äôs gonna improve. People aren‚Äôt gonna stay home unless everything shuts choice, mayor... isn‚Äôt handling situation well. we‚Äôre screwed. ""Sorry take *statistically pure* blood"". Funny thing, we'd actually stop hiv infections allowing msm donate would cause. Many msm get std screenings frequently find std donations. Oh well.  * 20 states reported record-high numbers average daily new cases

We know long immunity last given short trials far , constantly monitored though start seeing lots vaccine getting infected 6 months would tell us example lasts 6 months. think expectation likely year + lmao good? specific example, even ridiculous exactly legislation hurts people.

Also there's good reason stores still sell sweets, chocolate, crisps, biscuits alcohol purpose visited 'essential' purchases. According [ONS among best source hard data UK, adjusted socio-economic, demographic geographical characteristics, multi-generational households, occupational exposure co-morbidities (diabetes, heart disease, etc), black African males females 2.5x 2.1x likely die respectively. Black African, Black Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani Bangladeshi heritage correlated higher death adjusting factors. implies effect might biological, words ethnicities, group, could higher incidence genetic traits predispose serious covid disease death, could observing influence low vitamin levels, on.

The idea caused socio-economic health disparities idea media jumped absolutely evidence, do. there‚Äôs end sight hope things getting better anytime soon, people increasingly give say ‚Äòfuck this‚Äô. 

It‚Äôs hope keeps people going. article says less sanitation poor water sources means people get diseases; immune system better ""trained"" resist virus result. compared developed states India.

Take grain salt posted science website shares unpublished scientific studies yet undergone peer review. solution elected leaders stop paying much attention whiners take decisive action. elect representatives reason, everything needs run referendum. hell even mean? tell, opinion lockdowns death total pathetically low and, people, Flu represents deadly threat. points noted concerning support government mandating closures response. Basically, enough people dying make huge deal propagandized as, propagandists released (or not) lately led avoid trusting world views present. leaders call hoax would magically disappear day now??

If so, they‚Äôre stupid Trump ;) It‚Äôs interesting used Wake Forest Review article written school school‚Äôs official newspaper accredited school writing articles school‚Äôs COVID numbers weeks.

That aside, sharp increase numbers shocking, you‚Äôve head sand past month campus, would know coming. I‚Äôm guessing continue increase move red shortly. held long could FFS exhausting someone never quit stay home behavior. hear people preparing hunker again. many us never stopped hunkering I'm tired right thing many others give fuck. sub full kids elementary school would tell teacher constantly someone broke rules even rules made sense one followed them. Sadly deaths weeks. people start care. :/ say that? saw one article NYT headline body article said one way knowing it‚Äôs extremely rare test it, means headline unfounded.  virus eliminated China never pretended was, one reasons methods successful. Uh...having closed borders different internal lockdowns. South Korea restaurants etc open long time, New Zealand even large sports events reindeer. Interesting. Thanks responding. different, masks required walking outside home around people outside household. I'm sure parks here.  said thing mate. true large parts Canada too. 

In Alberta:

1. manditory masks everywhere;
2. Free universial testing pharmacies, doctors offices drive testing sites;
3. contact tracing app; 
4. Closed border 
5. Social distancing work home encouraged; and
6. cases came ""known"" exposures high risk areas (I.e. shipping receiving sites essential goods). 

The virus totally undercontrol two weeks ago. respatory season hit came back. capital, Edmonton, saw cases explode. introducing restriction cancelling surgeries again. 

This virus insidious, need one asymptomatic case slip cracks cases explode again. 

The one bit relief moderate measures work summer. soon respatory season hits comes back. Overall hospitalizations still 30% either previous peaks. yes, individual hospital North Dakota may more, overall still down. Trending either way, see gets level above. would situation improve trivial measures? No, lots Asian countries acted well hospitals hit capacity. call friend tell jeans tor ass need new one preferable express amazon shipping? people without internet usually use teleshopping something like that? hope burn fk nose like last one did. still get scabs look like boogers bleed peel off.

I'm outside Pittsburgh pretty red area, local officials like.. consistently talking masks sheep they're really vocal trying overturn Wolf's orders. always knew surrounded people agree politically even ethically, like pandemic unleashed super deep conspiracy trail many people. less handle neighbors go goop, elected officials supposed helping us shit too, like--please no. loved ones high risk I've pretty vigilant whole time, I'm starting really get tired fact risk people can't basic things like trust science wear masks. Ugh. Hang stay safe &lt;3 gods name praisable US? clusterfuck beyond belief. one harshest lockdowns running relatively normal again. 

Only Wuhan lockdown 76 days, Italy Spain longer lockdowns. took China 6+ months go back ""normal"", drop restrictions soon lockdown ended. People love praise China pay attention China actually China rush harsh lockdowns soon virus pops again.

China currently dealing outbreak doing? Mass testing contact tracing, last outbreak. Compare Vietnam lockdown Da Neng outbreak 11 cases. reason China locked Wuhan stave outbreak, plus wait every single COVID case disappear ending lockdown. Asian countries concerned preventing mass outbreaks clusters instead random cases, one reasons they've successful. proactive versus cant get people even wear masks hope somehow adhere rules? 

SK dealt outbreak caused religious extremists, give punish rest citizens want comply. get rid red lights speed limits people comply? no, car accidents communicable illness they're still dangerous. Yeah basically Italy experienced March except unprepared 7 months buckle Hm hurt much leaderboard? ‚Äúwinning‚Äù countries corona battle important you?

Grow up. Gotta keep invisible sky fairy happy dispose unwanted parasites. know Europe rough go, got cases control earlier, able handle reign back in. I'm confident ourselves.

Americans subreddit continuing act like country struggling Covid getting tiring. Get head sand already. U.S. problem, global problem... also likely live cities states pay welfare.

And yet, Illinois coming support. Mate, please read German media issue. I'm expert hard think reasons biggest vaccination program history going happen days, weeks even months. Sept. 30, FDA put request written comments Fed Register prior Oct. 22 meeting. Pfizer responded Oct. 15 felt ethical duty unblind trials offer vaccine placebo group efficacy signal resultant EUA. Much meeting 22nd dedicated problem losing placebo groups might resolved offering expanded access opposed EUAs evaluate vaccines other. Also, FDA noted looking 60% efficacy signal order build public confidence.

None gives much faith average US citizen see vaccine anytime soon. Perfect become enemy good. would love wrong, though. say anything hateful. pointed lies CNN political. Failed word filter.

All lie. give facts, ignore reply lies. US shithole country you. Well referring biologically, also that! real there'd stats. Anecdotal evidence really evidence dude. indeed bracing worst, based going experts said terms timing public availability. deployment details seen place timeline mass availability 6+ months release. based experts saying, general public expect access next Spring/Early Summer. üòî Let's go!! hope someone taking advantage media make bucks quick pump dump. sad first thing came mind upon reading headline. time live now. cares young?

I'll stocking essentials Thanksgiving Christmas b avoid crowds.

I'm presents shipped. Yes please! Biden lot cleanup around trump party bus. pitch help maybe get back track. AMERICA? Never. gotta remember large portion population refuse virus, vaccine work well fat people. So, infections continue rise even vaccine widely distributed. George Soros personally spits every mask manufacture. Yup. better writer recently wrote, lockdowns. upper middle class people hiding basements working class folks bring things. Sorry. 60,000 moronic. could fill Bayern Munich's stadium many done day hundred nurses.

Multiply 10 different locations already 600,000. think Germany places couldnt organise something like wrong.

Quick maths, assuming vaccine takes 5 mins administer:

Each vaccinator could administer 96 per day. would take 6250 people employed roles carry 600,000 per day. UK certainly soldiers, nurses, pharmacists doctors approved carry vaccinations. 6250 staff members doesnt sound unrealistic delusional all. Cool, go kill babies money machine do? Brrrr still it‚Äôs cold? government busier elections preparation country second wave pandemic. absolutely nothing. shame talk scandals ... spent millions respirators, bought ""arms dealer""! money gone respirators delivered date one imprisoned.

In last days already cases death patient could admitted hospital due lack places talking capital country! radio recordings paramedics ambulances ask place people wait sick car several hours. government insists true places available hospitals. Yes, paper ... reality.  remember watching videos Twitter starting. crazy. example, Jan 23 seriously, got Oxford one, found one 20% whatever effective on, could get phizer one might work? Could keep trying 6 Canada purchased? Preface: wear mask always, stay 6ft away people can. I'm taking seriously.

I personally know anyone even GOT it, neither anyone family. Despite fact spreading like mad, statistically going least percentage population coincidence actually positives show social circles. longer goes on, people going convinced virus come them. brain loves find patterns extrapolate based what's already happened. love accept there's basically random chance this. Sure, one family know got virus 7 months, maybe someone tomorrow. knew vaccine produced robust immune response elderly today.

Throughout whole ordeal I've seen lot people muse lot people ""get it"", understand respect situation someone know gets sick. 

Ironically, reality closer opposite. person make mind based anecdotes (which are, need someone life personally affected make mind something), actually far likely take LESS seriously acquaintances catch it. vast majority infections lead serious symptoms. someone know catches it, overwhelming odds basically nothing happen them. anyone taking cues that, going get less less concerned go along. know masks cause virus.

Either know dumb guy shut mouth stuff know understand fact know influential morons dangerously convincing stupid shit simply money-grubbing piece shit. do, two reasons:

1. imply people countries failing contain spread wearing masks wearing correctly, whereas often case (see Italy Spain);

2. imply, hand, opposite true countries currently containing spread, also necessarily case (see Norway, look within Europe).

Additionally, actual truth little scientific evidence effectiveness masks containing global spread - simply would hard time-consuming set proper case-control study. common sense most, touted self-evident statement. Again, wearing mask since March, I'm saying people wear masks. lot us Americans ashamed. could throw every anti mask moron Grand Canyon would. stain already stained American reputation.

It seems like naturally happen long enough time line, unless get lucky. 

When heard guys got hit expecting hunker Thanksgiving. Melbourne heads up, even everything done right come back. I'm getting ready hunker Christmas order given.

Hopefully vaccine guys go respatory season fully vaccinated. going second respatory season without one. 

Have beer mate enjoy summer. True one dose vaccine shaves full month time table. also safety pauses (hopefully not) initial dose...it won‚Äôt throw schedule deaths correlated cases. good memory Jamie. remember much. 

He fucking dipshit honestly. still listen good guests gets holy shit needs sit fuck right now. lucky equally effective influenza vaccine, roughly 75% effective among risk populations.

Excess mortality absolutely terrible well, peaking +40% normal. Right it‚Äôs normal, trending upwards. case, excess mortality amazing measure you, brainwashed are, want be. excess mortality includes died COVID-19, also causes. **When studied period fewer people died causes (such road accidents), excess mortality statistics might suggest death toll COVID-19 lower actual total.**

So no. Deaths less 2020 previous years ‚Äúthe end it‚Äù. You‚Äôve still sent anything kind article study supports inane conclusion. pumpkin picture looking thicc. None statements imply lack complexity. fact masks effective used widely fact situation complex mutually exclusive. Democrats absolutely nothing it. Biden said he'll leave fully hands pharmaceutical industry, commercial delivery services, medical offices, etc. words distributed like annual flu vaccinations medications (both over-the-counter prescription) already delivered daily basis.

Trump, hand, spouting nonsense [using military deliver makes absolutely sense whatsoever, given basic role nothing even remotely close this. Department Defense even [issued statement ""Our best military assessment sufficient U.S. commercial transportation capacity fully support vaccine distribution,"" Department Defense (DOD) spokesman Charles Pritchard told American Shipper, logistics industry publication, last month. ""There need large commitment DOD units personnel support nationwide distribution vaccines.""  Democrats everything right, motivated enlightened altruism. greedy, corrupt Republicans even care people get vaccine. They'd happy keep virus circulation keeps population controlled. read native language, article mentions *Frankfurter Allgemein* source information. calculated taking least 4 years 60 000 vaccinations done day. **Matthias Schrappen** one experts quoted magazine. many different autonomous regions many ethnic minorities Xinjiang province. Population density one highest world.

That's real issue. see Tokio, New York, etc. 

The real issue extremely unprepared negligent government, lots empty discussions foremost: Combined culture civil disobedience it‚Äôs recipe disaster.


Examples: regular illegal parties 100s people, football fans packing together, 2 months discussion parliament whether mandate masks law needs change. Ill believe happens. also surprised even publicly available outside 1st responders high risk individuals next Summer. really are. national mandate send half country protests, likely making spread worse national mandate. 60iq take brought Tesla fanboy. Dumbasses easy spot nowadays. Hypocrites get scared live Canada well. mountain town next cases. Isolation helps. 

There example large, densely populated country contained virus without extreme lockdowns or, well, island. That's Reddit though innit.

Europe = good (UK excluded)
USA = bad

When things happening America 'we wearing masks! like Europe' happens Europe five fold 'ah well, inevitable' Define ""lockdown"". means different things different people. Analog thing, digital thing. That‚Äôs correct. Governments held accountable leaders voted office. New leadership choice invest improvement overall health care build comprehensive infection control infrastructure. Pandemic ends reduction deaths cases. people dying/catching lasting effects threat gone infinitely big word Yeah that‚Äôs getting people vaccinated. Also, experts need comically conservative timelines hold public trust. subtract couple months whatever estimate give. 

Then there‚Äôs second part, restrictions. might take vaccinated everybody long begun wane public restrictions around springtime. sustainable feasible continue longer, matter wanna spin it. vulnerable populations longer hospitalized rates now, incentive intrusive public measures. Even right now, case counts high little hospitalization, little need motive politicians tighten measures, otherwise would it. cant build new hospital shelter? election talk investing billions infrastructure? need it? idea try minimize capacity shut nonsense, demand build capacity. thought could pray away stop blaming people following it.

totally fair. let's hold trials &amp; incarcerations numerous obviously criminally negligent government officials get virus control. hear people really dont want vaccine body, even tough arent antivaxxers. Tbh , im also sure, try wait see gives I've worked \~15 African countries, this. Well, injecting people's eyeballs, would make sense possible outcome. Governments (on national local levels) honest start.

It‚Äôs funny much hear ‚Äúfew isolated cases‚Äù Sweden, isn‚Äôt it? Watchdogs starting investigations, healthcare professionals relatives making frequent headlines huge issues. guess it‚Äôs really nothing special, see picture countries, no? What‚Äôs that? Sweden issues. Hmm, odd. not, overall mortality far year infinitessimally higher last year, historically low: exactly disgusting fake talking point mentioned. claim 2020 would even lower historical low without covid, would pulling stuff arse improbable.

They laying measure taking (implementing mass testing schemes, contact tracing, preparing isolation facilities quarantine positive cases, securing PPE), measure sthe public taking (masking up, restricting movements uncontrolled spread minimised etc.). 1000+ new cases Ontario today :( ear response keep masks large number people years least

As long people elected officials. We're rational adults last thing PM wants people listen him. boss, know? require masks going forward? point restricting businesses make sure business owners, like ones, put employees needlessly risk. 

It's also account for, hard imagine now, consumer actually looks local federal government guidance. doesn‚Äôt?! make chart. know, full house beats flush, beats straight. beats asshole? course I‚Äôm joking. record, don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre asshole simply different opinion me. many mean people internet, try polite even face disagreement.

What think thousands people phase 3 trial are? Fake populations? kinds stuck mask debate implementing first line defense hassle.

Tbf, think west moved mask debate, non wearers wear regardless arguments. latest debate around lockdowns lol

No mentions TTI whatsoever. People still ending police states authoritarian measures people welded homes. hilarious watching self defeating idiocy people thinking they're clever. half Europe back started? Unplug doom little bit provide sources claims. make sound like going peaks valleys. temporary slowdowns speed infection rate increased. different.

We 500K dead New Year's, even normal public gets vaccine February/March, another 8 million cases next summer.

If put twice much water pool every day 30 days fills, full pool day 29?

Half-full. virus progresses population refuses science says do.

THAT going America right now. Let's pretend people certain political persuasion happy see bad numbers. lets hope take trip safely! per capita cases passed usa. 453 million people living eea 130 million usa. Lets math. 

* USA: 320 million people. 9.8million km2 (3.8M mi2)
* EEA: 453 million people. 4.95million km2 (1.9M mi2) 

If evenly spread people that's:
* USA: 32.65 per km2 84.24 per mi2
* EEA: 91.51 per km2 238.42 per mi2.

So see EEA vastly larger population (40% larger) roughly 50% less land mass also. time managed less deaths usa whole. yes transmission rates might higher right overall deaths stand 209K (eea) vs 225k (usa) 40% people 50% less space. winning US clearly losing. google. life expectancy HK 84.68 years.

82.63 south korea.

84.10 japan.

80.09 taiwan.

81.16 UK going dumbass anti-maskers pandemic deniers still it.

When people start coming senses start shooting IDIOTS? cops balls it, people WILL. Months!?! Weak! Hikikomori known isolate rooms (""room,"" ""house"") *decades*! reason see anti-mask stuff cultural thing. also SARS outbreak 2012, settled issue. every Asian country already pandemic solve masking, less decade ago. still fresh memory. really. work rural farm, shoes broke would unable make money feed myself. foot problems well working heavy labor rough terrain day, need buy pretty nice work boots specific brand orthopedic insert...wearing cheap pair shoes, ones dont fit, without good insert could unable good portion job within week two.

ditto gore-tex winter coat need work extreme cold, pouring rain snow.

these items clothing expensive, cant afford extras closet like would sneakers sweaters. 

this one small example specific people work outdoors manual labor, likely examples pertaining walks life. 

people live different lives different environments - make blanket statements essential outside pure recreational activities like restaurants, concerts etc. savings what? Money?

Time, maybe. Even ~30 minutes since stop reaction earlier care 35 cycle positives. exact amount labor reagents per sample actual cost going change. Unless bottleneck thermocyclers (it usually isn't) pretty pointless move. Unironically yes *Look Iowa, businesses stayed open, market spoke anyways.*

If that's true, what's point restricting businesses first place? People go they're scared, need rules implemented. Wait, thought 5G? can't keep anymore. im confused stance. i've heard sure, party power state legislatures? party governor's mansions? controlled US senate, president, supreme court year? party gain covid going sideways killing ""mostly 80 year olds"" mostly vote party? seems counter intuitive I'm seeing, people confidence, telling confident everything open right solution.

I've found telling people truth, ugly may be, usually best. People square shoulders lean know must deal with. 

When people tire, throw hands quit, usually fatigue off-again, on-again messaging. Yeah. Still stupid, selfish, morons. people almost never change. Nevermind cure virus exists. Except Victoria, we're coming lockdown now. Here‚Äôs health official PhD Idaho saying thinks it‚Äôs coronavirus making people president chose to. illegal states enforce borders. state control international airports, federal. 

I'm defending US response. defending state response able legally enforce kind border detain people quarantine. state.

Our federal response shitty, states could even choose defend ourselves. Free travel cannot restricted states.

My state 11 million people. basically larger country Australia population. could defended virus giant moat around us allowed enforce quarantine. we're middle country would let us enforce quarantine airports.

Our stupid federal government wants nothing virus, delegating responsibility states. states allowed enforce borders kind, choice really autonomous authority. 

Basically top leadership wants actively nothing, *but also made sure states could nothing.*

We avoid restrictions hard. administration *actively* wants discourage fighting virus all.  Sounds right feels like told number 2 path sort happened, testing contact tracing still significant challenges treatment methods better, staff prepared, least testing available reasonable turn around weeks.

But seems like we're trying weird balance 1 3 many states seems like we're well especially something works exponential growth. Despite mistakes Dan Andrews (Victorian Premier) Vic government made, overall they‚Äôve done damn good job getting everything back control data knowledge mask wearing Texas back wearing them? whole conversation lockdowns, pointed necessary demonstrated countries changed topic leader charge, case state Premier (equivalent governor) Dan Andrews keep firm hand even face unrelenting whining detractors non-stop toxic coverage almost media. Kudos him. shame trying belittle leadership recovery second wave (which, admittedly, started due fuckup someone(s) team). Yes, that's excuse used avoid responsibility stamping pandemic.

BTW, big countries got infected SARS succesfully stamped out? mean dumb people dont wear masks, uncivil people dont wear them. True, even Dallas restrictions governors (when get away it), ""lockdown"" bars restaurants closed (takeout still open), stores closed figured things out, walmart groceries open (wear mask), work home rates high. 

You could also leave house anytime wanted, outdoor trails packed.

Still, something - enough lower RT, number hospitalized patients dropped lot locally. already mass produced dude. That‚Äôs slow day America encouraged beachgoing

I agree, early people used beach place go gather large groups. live beach town spring break level parties every day, day. rules put place try break large party groups. wohooo Republicans: Hmm, many people early voting

Republicans: Hold beer, really paying attention convo, you...? Proud what? implemented totalitarian police state what? can't keep virus unless plan isolate rest world indefinitely. Lol pass export countries fucked. get virus sorted, they'll continue fucked sell less goods, hurting economies.  


Not really, exports countries west asia, latter seem shit together. live one biggest swing states. I'm voting 3rd party foreseeable future. HoMe ChRiStMaS

Believe see 15 minutes exposure 24 hour period. Could take N95 mask, attach exhaust? Filter outgoing breath?

I know pain breath respirators (I basically model you, without face shield, mask part - use woodworking), okay breathe that, helpful others. Refusing wear mask nothing intellectual. Yeah. concern though state suspect elsewhere governor heads basically flat said changing course. agree scalpel rather sledgehammer try minimize economic impact. Help! Weve done nothing nothings working! scorched earth policy really never good idea we're seeing headlines White House contain pandemic really looks helpful week leading elections. burka trying slow spread corona virus? - Creepy TSA agent Oh yes, plenty ways anyone could fall cracks. federal ban evictions nonpayment ends, seeing massive amount people suddenly become homeless. read horror stories /r/unemployment ... awful people going through. Yeah America indeed operate bunch different countries aspects.

All best well, friend. indeed bad winter. trying political though. 2Q 2021? bet half world natural immunity then.

There almost one year bring health care capacity reasonable levels. done yet ones blame outcome.

Where live, 5-10% capacity needed handle Covid-19 spring taken current cases. see possibility 20-fold increase now, many people already immune. Agenda 21...here come. Hey thise guide stones still standing north Georgia -Florida line? always wanted go see monument. UK US never even started trying.

The US strategy use masks social distancing keep hospitals overrun. Aside scattered pockets places, worked. South Korea, New Zealand Iceland strategy would never worked US. big many points entry. Blocking ducts (and cold air return) getting space heater seems like effective. anyone recommending this? Sure, stricter lockdown start August 2. still lockdowns since well that, adverse effects entire time kid done fine excelling home schooling. Kids adapt, best as. funny thing kids meet expectations behaviour attitude effects them. negative vocal miserable are, mirror you. Children survived thrived much harder scenarios this. R E K sub full people take virus seriously even believe it.
Here's upvote facts. Thank you, probably published 2 weeks ago, data since. Jeeeesus never talked viruses Bible, bro extremes definitely became widely publicized viewpoints either ""lock forever"" ""open way up"" without real room middle ground clearly answer somewhere middle likely sway back forth depending what's going on.

I definitely understand people heard long term lock downs would freak out. guidance evolved slow messaging even putting clear directions containment. gets back incredibly muddled frustrating. Sweden disproportionately live alone multi generational households, they're also less ""hands on"" Europe (from UK Med East) comes social interaction..

there's joke saw culturally similar Norwegians, can't wait til 1.5m social distancing rules removed return normal 3-4 metres. really Table Slap Award moment people equate freedom mean zero responsibility family community, society large. one reasons Trump's rhetoric resonates strongly. El Paso super democratic though Thank information. 9/11 sent soldiers go kill die convenience national security. 

The difference is, (at least beginning war) general population THOUGHT national security. thought oil, seen conspiracy theorist.

Nowadays, ""it oil"" opinion much prevelant. drop blood? Convenient timing reason rules written way _because_ anti-maskers. look every gap letter rule go it, instead following spirit. 

If around lot people, particularly close circle, wearing mask. See easy is? lifted altogether, relaxation restrictions. many (less stringent) restrictions still apply. Could PCR tests, mostly generic, picking influenza increase COVID? Oh bless heart, home spring bet wouldn‚Äôt put money problem become polarizing symbolic topic broader discussion easily gets reduced masks only. Imagine someone living jungle completely unaware pandemic reading sub. would appear masks fact panacea. also binary easy attack antimaskers. means spectrum (what optimal social distancing?) masks literally one other, either wear one not. pay me. France healthcare, extensive social programs, nearly free education, livable minimum wage, so, France never makes US look good. think point make people buy groceries GTFO, instead browsing clothing section hours, trying stuff on, etc. great point hope right. always lasted month lowes home depot. 7 test positivity rate calendar week 42 3.6% plumbing Hvac contractor approve message. ridiculously rant stranger knows absolutely nothing me. 

You‚Äôre sure ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù comes media somewhere outside experience, make accusation you.  France tell quite attached freedom downsides it. Wear mask people Ah wait environmental catastrophe. Ain‚Äôt seen nothing yet. joke doesn‚Äôt work. Since list incomplete, *those extrapolate incomplete data* hidden option, option 1 should
be reciprocal that: really hope end near.

Even though vaccine might available right away, knowing sure works good rate without safety issues would major relief. Yes mistaken mother nature racist? üò´ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è think little old nova scotia envy world right now. Nothing shutdown right now. Everyone wears masks public spaces mandatory two week isolation happening time entwr province. I'm proud little province. basically land hurricane. live Paris. went walk yesterday, half people saw wearing mask chin (the mask mandatory here). Lots people restaurants, brasseries etc. lot people terraces obviously mask they're sidewalk. People really mindful. Get Oxford horrible. friend postet something fb regarding climate change religious ppl came him, ignorance devestating. apprently God's read bible. Yeah, don‚Äôt care virus. Good luck getting people social distance next year. Nope, discrimination. Blacks Hispanics, MSM still account majority HIV cases. argument falls flat.

Also, guidelines based science. Calling ""homophobic"" magically make so. MSM still group highest HIV risk US. changes, always form restriction blood donation. better focusing efforts helping MSM lower risk, rather whining imaginary ""homophobia"" blood donations. need control per capita testing rates too. Europe wear masks part, curfews guess what? ""Record number infections"" every day. work.  similar Qindao, 4.7m stabs, 0.47m batch tests. Bro healthcare workers probably gonna start see roll March widespread availability starting fall already started. I'm looking forward time one vaccines approved least defeatist saying ""we'll never vaccine never one coronavirus"" come end. surging states neither pretty sweet tbh sales last whole month instead stupid fucking friday never hospital surge. Unfortunately older population handful old folks homes got hit pretty hard Synthetic antibodies working EUA's speak. So, imminent. Vaccines widely available 2Q 2021. regardless, we're overrunning hospitals already places like El Paso **with** mitigations place, we'd asking occur widely, completely insane. ends also killing people otherwise chronic conditions hospitals capacity treat them. Thanks! Exactly this. Absolutely disrespect, know us Norther Hemisphere people associate July w/ summer, December w/ winter. critical. American psyche egocentric fault. stated, people lack empathy compassion (truthfully along desire) put another‚Äôs shoes try comprehend pain struggles. It‚Äôs self, fuck anyone else. it, makes things worse, trust true. individual mask can't stop virus 100%, aggregate R0 drops 1, virus start burn out. population level masking (plus distancing hygiene) aim thing virus highlighted bad science math education US many years. Phytologically would help something ready, even available ship mass produce. You‚Äôre going like global warming planned shopping mall... important thing economy booming again. /s  always curious conspiracy theorists, makes tick.

I feel sad corrosive effect society general, never really thought much self-destruction bring lives, hurt loved ones. ya 240k gonna cure PTSD get, one month maybe ok, 9 months later we're still going circles... well, looks like reaper gonna stealing youth change attitudes hoax flu libs made up! can't catch hoax!

/S relaxed mask mandate July. Well let's recall, half students age left home alone die, imagine. people contract school workplace. already pre purchased hundreds millions doses. That‚Äôs don‚Äôt see benefit vaccine sharing program, benefits poorer countries can‚Äôt afford pre purchase Yea El Paso long that‚Äôs weird layout geography. It‚Äôs 30 minute drive get El Paso I-10 mountains drive huge wedge center city. Take Patriot freeway north Juarez city 10 minutes. I‚Äôll take three please next critical stage process ""unblinding"" trial results, see data participants given jab compared placebo group. 

Seems like probably wait revealed start talking distribution. even wedding party. schools, offices factories still open, wearing masks much slightly delay epidemic. ironic paying premiums literally paying people's healthcare. Multiple studies show cloth masks effective. worse square one. beginning pandemic virus localized hotspots. growing like weed ground everywhere. They're generally cheap I've seen, although can't say counts every hotel country size China. lockdowns meant sustainable longterm, sustainable mass testing, contact tracing, level social distancing, mask mandates, border closures, on. China course handling initial outbreak transparent way means give benefit doubt.... significant difference can‚Äôt won‚Äôt. Many asian societies hither sense community civil responsibility west. Doctors government say ‚Äòwear mask‚Äô helps save others everyone wears mask. yes, clearly vested interest, revealed ranting us wanting blood sex another man. gotta statements backtrack.

I would imagine every human vested interest amount blood available blood never said MSM face oppression bigotry straight people. saying deferrals MSM example bigotry oppression MSM face. evidence-based practice designed protect patients catching infections blood products, nothing more. Conflating real discrimination bigotry gay men face quite offensive idiotic.

I'm sorry profession credentials make think know disease spread prevention myself? blood bank professions mentioned qualified, comes Blood Banking Transfusion Medicine. sure point is, though.

My point profession qualified comes prevention disease spread, practices supposedly place for. see might miss point.  Attacking anyone thinks virus warrants attention prevention. really depends whether vaccination also reduces Covid-19 *severity* get it. I'm absolutely COVID-19 hardliner we're seeing mass vaccinations *and* people get much less likely get moderate/severe cases (as opposed flu like symptoms fewer permanent effects), shits done terms major restrictions. think people need settle fact virus never go extinct. would nice would like said it‚Äôs impossible+of course people unluck draw helped vaccine.

But vaccine would bring simmering levels allow everyone return normal. Sarcasm canary coal mine -- fascism. exemptions, sure number calculated using capacity 60 000 vaccinations day, reaching number optimistic acording quoted experts.  hard believe this.

""You need vaccinate everybody things ""go back normal.""

This true people seriously thinking things back normal next summer living Trump-like delusion. Lets hope vaccine vials don‚Äôt get stolen monkeys like infected blood samples XD
(This actually happened) I'm actually implying opposite. Lol truth hurts it. world go real world? originally September October Christmas. rounding corner right!? keep kicking ball field. wish people dumb. said time time till late 2021 best. almost spent savings desperately need make money can't field work yeah want thing stay same. South Korea, Taiwan, Japan communist nations? Sun tabolid piece shit believe say, probably smart half family (around Houston) intent massive Thanksgiving gathering. Glad mom sense go. Dude Hyderabad one biggest cities India different city. better talk know see like spread negativity without actually knowing situation everywhere. effective it? 100%, 99%, 80% 60% like flu shots. Wow. scary. Yeah think work, might fog bit want keep everyone safe, myself. Internet. Internet like nuance. people haven‚Äôt going much eight months, tolerance lower.

Oh know friend. mask wearing? one incident enough accuse Koreans uncivil? Yes, even then, still 2.5 months sulky, pissed Trump contend with. please let landslide can‚Äôt drag out!! view watching darwin action.

It help unlucky one walks infective cloud (out ass) 1 hundred them.

These people danger themselves. bet countries laws spreading contagious diseases purpose. enforce them. Yeah, that's bet. like states told submit distribution plans Nov 1st. mean would vaccine Nov 1st, rather wanted plans place Nov. really doesn't, says lot people know actually believe that.

Your edit shows moron that's projecting best. anxiety? care people. don't. FOH. Lol Europe? came China! /sarcasm

The president keeps saying blame China research shows virus spread US sources outside China mainly Europe. virus originated China spread sources outside country. praise idiot like Trump president consistently failed nation 4 straight years? People stop glasses fogging Women stronger immune systems likely overreact. probably they're prone long hauling. 

Fortunately, least case eventually go away. I'm grateful. Took six months. NYC closed months numbers showed that, let's kid ourselves. NZ, country owes keeping borders closed lockdown people realize. EU countries severe lockdowns like NZ, except EU countries opened borders summer... American, part glad we're country struggling masks. Cool, don‚Äôt believe China‚Äôs schools businesses opened life gotten back relative norms countries closing back believe whatever want believe *Principal Skinner meme* : chasing health director town pandemic bad idea?

No, acting like tyrant, done. numbers China dubious. original epicentre outbreak, huge built cities, economy relies heavily production goods (no WFH, lots connections outside world) yet late April onwards New Zealand posting per capita case numbers 100x seen 

This pure copium. numbers China's neighbors less corroborate successful, since chinese travel SK, vietnam, etc. vice versa Donald Trump count. accept staying house 7 months makes bit outlier. people things life would prevent this.

Most people things care throw away fit virus anxiety. I'm guessing relationship/don't many friends interests outside home?

What able template normal people follow. never deleted  stop, good news. I'm genuinely interested view. Would elaborate endangers patients? world comment threaten encourage violence way? sold rental property last week traveling notary came house signing prepared ventilated room windows open spouse put masks answered doorbell.

The notary stood front porch wearing one stupid transparent shields, kind sends message ""I trying way hard pretend compliance actually showing contempt it"". told coming house puts mask take stupid shield put mask wanted $350 gets overseeing document signing.

So, got experience satisfaction making one jerks mask will. next 20 minutes awkward one point started tell story masks put hospital told I'm interested. I'm not.

Since traveling notary, assume visited houses day, people let get away wearing stupid shield, disease present, contributed spread it. know better, makes feel... angry. Oh wow. Edited title removed.


It's happening!!


IT‚ÄôS HAPPENING!!! know mocking statement presenting it, even phase 3 data comes out, means steps closer vaccine approved. still far going away. Luckily places winter means ski season, socially distanced get.

But don‚Äôt think Wisconsin mountains :( Uhh, yes, clearly vested interest, revealed ranting us wanting blood sex another man. gotta statements backtrack.

I never said MSM face oppression bigotry straight people. saying deferrals MSM example bigotry oppression MSM face. evidence-based practice designed protect patients catching infections blood products, nothing more. Conflating real discrimination bigotry gay men face quite offensive idiotic.

Yes, professions mentioned qualified, comes Blood Banking Transfusion Medicine. sure point is, though. shit. What's point government, mention law, first place?

Obviously, governments unjust things, do, resisted. ""I government told me"" bullshit childish mindset ""I parents told me"".  happened demyelinating disease transverse myelitis people getting one? Completely understandable northwest cops busy trying save world anti-fascists worry real perils. I'm sorry hear friend. Actually, girl EP, tell anything what's going says tired covid EP, wanna talk it. thanks giving context don‚Äôt ‚Äúwant right‚Äù, taking points, insults aside, supported science data. look rising case numbers U.S. vs countries strict lockdowns, South Korea New Zealand, find support arguments. viruses spread common sense, people infected higher probability contraction others. I‚Äôm stating personal opinion spewing conjecture. 

When send kids school curve hasn‚Äôt even flattened, case numbers go up, would‚Äôve thought? Especially reasoning behind sending kids school get get with. You‚Äôre literally encouraging purposeful spread virus. really see what‚Äôs wrong that? right though, even took stricter precautions able return semblance normalcy, masks safety protocols would still necessary. 

And said can‚Äôt afford lock another month? afford spend billions, perhaps trillions, providing liquidity stability equity markets, definitely afford support American families another month. don‚Äôt, American families aren‚Äôt number one priority anymore. 

There‚Äôs really point trying convince anything. you‚Äôve seen data science that‚Äôs readily available right sub still choose think way do, simply won‚Äôt listen. "" test negative virus three times row, anchors broadcasting shows home, according two people knowledge situation, ""

\[X\] Doubt

"" flight ... New York ... Nashville. person tested negative departing Nashville positive returning. ""

That's 2:30hrs flight. Really unlucky what's there? mean tests, couple hours neg pos. Well, Sweden recorded large increase excess deaths, Stockholm County 2nd quarter excess deaths 59% 5 year Finland, excess deaths period, first 36 weeks year (719 per 100,000). fact, excess deaths slightly 5 year average.

The interesting thing Swedish Finish approach actually similar. like China

The numbers China dubious. original epicentre outbreak, huge built cities, economy relies heavily production goods (no WFH, lots connections outside world) yet late April onwards New Zealand posting per capita case numbers 100x seen China. 

It's coincidence soon virus got going Europe/USA early April, eyes world turned China new cases basically stopped there, virus never reemerged everyone lived happily ever super competent CCP. I'm guessing rocket scientist either. joke seriously...The flu bad COVID definitely tests hospital workers it‚Äôs bad flu season. kills shit load people overrun ERs. 

My mom ER nurse said peak flu last year scarily close severity April COVID peak, less deaths. Still, flu stresses medical resources lots places, even places excellent healthcare standards. 

She‚Äôs wondering earlier COVID spike (I doubt it. Prob gnarly flu year).

People please don‚Äôt respond ‚ÄúiTs FLu‚Äù

It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs worse. bad, flu pretty damn bad. one realizes that. believed reason Ireland. home small groups, outdoor BBQs summer, smaller house parties small household visits summer mask use lax.

However think since Irish people put masks social distancing went window well good hand hygiene. Masks became superman's Cape, people believe somehow magically protected cheap ‚Ç¨1.50 mask clearly made cheap recycled curtains. Covid capacity actual capacity? El Paso heavily Democrat.  Burn way killing host quickly reliably transmission could occur. invading armies. Depends program. Kinda hard fake LSAT. impossible. Difficult. Something tells next year instead, especially America is, still nice place live. Compared places people come here. Like family. simple narrow minded less stable job humidity, mean they're stable low humidity? in, stick around surfaces low humidity / effective cold? ExPlaIn SWeDen! It‚Äôs late won‚Äôt work. El Paso hospitals closest state trauma centers three counties Texas, plus lot southern New Mexico, lying numbers whole time.

And military hospital Abbot asked take non Covid patients? Well also capacity sending Covid patients hospitals already. 

The city locked down, base, smaller towns around Texas New New Mexico won‚Äôt Abbott (Texas Governor) awarded $300 million contract contact tracing back June.

Here's thought rustle jimmies--if ""work"" home probably real job, probably paid princely sum it. knowing it‚Äôs coming works best xmas present ever. shit ton unemployed people going spending much anything holiday season. Q4 pain. yet certain someones trying ram certain someone onto certain bench order contest upcoming certain something instead working get aid people. said going businesses they're scared. one it? early say things would smarter choice

While makes sense theory, practice think would smarter choice. Time essence infectious disease move fast, we've seen. one better safe sorry moments. unfortunate, yes, perfect. certainly mistakes made.

But imagine public health officials say ""it's early say anything yet"" people see hospitals overwhelmed people dying. would public say? would say, ""Why tell us soon idea?"" People would've said ""we could acted sooner except public health officials scientists told us early on!"" That's literally thing people criticizing China over. inkling definitively say anything sooner. government wanted make mistake China. better put kind public health messaging say nothing all. amazes anyone could think health care form could ruled solely free market. need procedure medication merely preserve quality life, much less life itself, bargaining position, pay price. Okay obviously bullshit. one much spit them. work logistically spreading false information.


Bill gates splits time 50/50. Removed rule 1. Please nicer users. Ready Christmas, long distribution? No, case. Like tests, PCR tests produce false positives, sensitive make higher likelihood producing them. 

Now, start course treatment someone another serious disease, relies use immunosuppressant drugs, probably want sure person Covid, high-sensitivity test appropriate.

But false-positive tests costs, particularly vital employee (doctor, ambulance staff, air-traffic controller - whatever) ends staying home unnecessarily two weeks. makes perfect sense consider appropriate balance risk false positives risk false negatives, adjust appropriate.

The discussion also taking place Netherlands sounds like right wing bs me.

Perhaps good idea recalibrate BS meter. Removed rule 1. Please nicer users. People trust politicians ever end this. Goalposts keep moving clear way end pandemic victory declared scientists world leaders. number people refuse comply rules reaches critical mass becomes impossible rule. Exactly. sustainable practices. Maybe smaller graduations, smaller classrooms, spaced restaurants (outdoors possible), outdoor proms, smaller outdoor weddings etc...

Plus massive ramp testing course ramping medical capacity (and wanted, military national guard deploy disasters, don‚Äôt know takes hospitals overrun ramp proactive Jesus!)

Accept it‚Äôs going perfect...maybe even ‚Äúgood‚Äù it‚Äôs sustainable longer period time less strife. even daily deaths higher would like, hopefully wouldn‚Äôt spike drastically stay sustainable lower level longer period.

Edit: And, actually...most proposals make pandemic adjustments enjoyable! wouldn‚Äôt want smaller graduations/classrooms/outdoor proms (weather permitting)? actually sound great! That‚Äôs new normal!:) Removed rule 1. Please nicer users. It‚Äôs hilarious also sad PA ppl call tyrant, feel everyone lost jobs losing job better dead imo *40% us aren‚Äôt fucking going anywhere* regardless there‚Äôs goddamn pandemic happening right now.

He literally say that.  People bussinesses. survive this. People work sacked. It‚Äôs tremendously disruptive ton reasons peoples‚Äô lives kids school therefore unsupervised day. Working parents either pay far much kind sitter older kids end taking care younger kids day cant focus studies. Kids neglected home nowhere go basic emotional physical needs. middle-class parents jobs transitioned work-from-home they‚Äôre actually loving it, spend time kids, working-class people already struggling nightmare. Haven‚Äôt even mentioned privilege good home internet connection. 

Edit: plus studies I‚Äôve seen younger children, least, unlikely vectors transmission, young people may quite ‚Äúplague rats‚Äù may imagine. actually 1000 cases day, 225k dead. expand this? noticed resting HR 10 BPM higher infected, increased HR small tasks well, level ""high"" high? BIG relative increase. said, overall total number deaths age segment quite small relative deaths overall.

Also, note indeed COVID-19 become number 1 cause death people category, would overtaken accidental drug overdose, would new number 2 prior number 1 age group.

It's bad, scary sounds. absolutely deserve it. It‚Äôs insane many healthcare workers we‚Äôve lost Covid. it‚Äôs incredible continue treat people one, lives line, two, lot people helping likely ignorant safety guideline concerning virus. would imagine countries low-quality water, poor hygiene (1) less obesity (2) less older/vulnerable individuals tend perish causes long they're 85 nursing home type setting &amp; (3) less robust way counting tallying ""COVID"" deaths people likely die home vs hospital setting. 

I'm sure I'm fully bought ""immunity training"" theory without first ruling out. Saw video Italy. got set initial backlog dry goods first place.

I've added backlog. pandemic getting worse mild fears unrest election, I'd like able completely lock several weeks need be. really doubt I'll need it, last time thought shelter place order go effect next day so...

Glad see random fucker reddit acknowledge sides crazy entire country one day high 80k France alone one day high 50k. compare US entire EU compare? zero cases positively affect life concrete way? part US we're allowed go restaurants, hang people play music, go bookstores, etc. trade lower number ""cases"". cases come back too, bad before, wishing throw away past 6 months hiding inside. 

""Cowards die many times deaths, valiant taste death once.""

Basically ""how best get population need do"" instead ""we're going tell truth"". think happened become business usual politics days, ability influence constituents instead way around useful politicians. 

Anyway, that's are, came strategies influence us rather giving us information letting us make choices. Thank premier Trump! guess Karens able get haircuts worth it.

Clothing stores deemed unessential people reasonably expected already clothes. Food runs out. Medicine runs out. clothes last months, snowflake. What's effectiveness? many people immune response would sufficient enough?

How long remain immune for? 

These questions need answered public gain full confidence vaccine. 

In addition, social distancing mask use need remain same, rather increase compared now. Reddit echo chamber misinformation biased viewpoints. always get downvoted posting opinions I‚Äôm used point lmao Lol thin skinned reported me? Wow little sissy. Shouldnt post crap article cant take criticism. Moving goalposts back ""prevent hospitals overwhelmed"" implementing Nordic guidelines (not going say ""Swedish"" Norway Finland took similar approaches too) sustainable solution. 

Telling people work home possible, wash hands, stay home sick infinitely sustainable telling people treat every human disease vector assume we're asymptomatic carriers. Social media made worse. FB, Twitter, even reddit need regulated far spreading conspiracy nut rumors. yelling ""Fire!"" movie theater. trauma docs loudly considering operating hallway

My God. wish ass-hats let us get point required go help front lines. maybe they'd change tune.

I hope feel better. would absolutely terrifying know going receive care fast enough hospitals overcrowded. Damn. cured depression agree, trouble though antibodies showing people early problem catching already it. general public would hard distinguish who's stubborn wearing mask, lol. China fascist. authoritarian centrist. thing thats fascist extreme racists tolerate one race Asian, genocide ones besides han Chinese hundreds years ago. Hashtag boss babe! r/holup worries, tensions running high general people usually reply reason argue! 

We looking behaviors impacting spread areas students back person versus not. example, county students &lt;50% remote seeing increase per capita cases 10 per 100000 (iirc hand recent look) since school back session sight decrease/ consistent rate infection areas students remote. 

We know students appear source infection themselves, seeing play data statistically significant way intriguing. also know correlation =/= causation general, looking else going counties increased infection rates may impacting infection rates present areas also decided keep kids remote. Looking hidden drivers, will. 

We also trying isolate true changes infection person schooling counties versus testing (hence interest hospitalizations less noisy proxy).

Overall looking data super interesting fun data science perspective, trying translate findings meaningful recommendations people policy makers greatest beneficial impact minimizing harmful disruptions life challenging.

*edit: additionally, less commonly used methods analysis CCM prove causation, directionality causation, extent degree causation utilized. None research I've seen yet taken approach analysis think would interesting/ beneficial see. lie Supreme leader Donald Trump, spinless governor. agreed worst passed, small cold. Wave 3 third lock deep south Texas come.  video literally filmed front tasty burger hahah. tasty burger goes....there goes neighborhood. declare virus exist. Yes. FDR one generation president. Dude save union. cannot agree April assessment.

In opinion, seems like next 4 months worst history virus far. Holidays, people getting infected families spreading back localities. 

By April \~1.5 months post-holiday boom point we'll starting see tertiary infections (primary Holiday infections, become secondary one-back-home infections, become tertiary community infections).

If El Paso overrun, Utah rationing care now, country's going horrific state March. worst been, judging data past pandemics.

More people staying home new year news infections, school, communities, hospitals rage control.

I think we'll lucky end, social otherwise, October next year. want case. cannot see mathematics supports people behave less well virus gets 10x worse coming months.

People still going Movie Theaters opened long time. means consumers still overall virus-conscious, spite bars, stadiums, restaurants would lead believe. I'm talking straws, I'm talking oil companies causing irreversible environmental damage giving shit ten billion dollar fine make twenty billion profit one ever goes prison. Ok makes sense. about, actively ill, wear mask? think habit lot countries exercising along, maybe time become thing western society. shaking hands anymore. srs - old crap go. 'Member ""flatten curve""? 'member I'm glad giving up. worth always keep trying. Sadly won't. They'll go sort mental gymnastics say increased hospitalizations deaths expected qualifier, they're old/obese/co-morbidities, etc. Anything somehow dismiss discount covid deaths disaster is. 

Everything ok! Let's go grab drinks dinner!

/S South America actually exploding harder

And tried lockdowns (though could properly impose them), actually wearing masks.

And even really proper winter except almost nobody lives anyone who's anti-mask probably gives little credence hospitalizations important metric, probably idea bad number goes ripple effect. Death probably big deal whole 6% confusion/cluster fuck. say reason whatsoever. added that.

They talking context businesses seem dining related.

It objectively false seen aprx. 40% decrease people dining either caution poverty. already seeing mass closures, pleas businesses support high reduction.

Its state fear acknowledge reality. using b.s. phrase dismiss anything support preconceived ideas. family south jersey they're mix-my mother saw happened NY decided wanted part it, go out, wears mask to, etc. Grandma too. Aunts though....""well party!""  Turns covering mouth, main source infection, reduces chances spread. 

Who would‚Äôve known?! fair, Caandian literally mind paying extra taxes someone else get airlifted hospital.

Probably I'm forced pay like $500 month something useless medical insurance top taxes. Fuck hope folks ok. Unfortunately, think states hotbeds point. people expected actually enforce mask mandates retail workers.

Trump left governors, governors left mayors, mayors left cashiers CVS Walgreens enforce. humans potential health threat

Only want hyperbolic easy

What's difficult costly.

What's cost? haven‚Äôt even done yet. fake post. I‚Äôm lockdowns believe covid real serious health concern. seems fabricated nothing support tweets claim. we're seeing year, distraction shifts focus away. reusable bags, carpooling / mass-transit single use items giant drivers least areas made positive steps... much 2020. Honestly know people this. I've seen many examples. Maybe believe nasal oral cavity connected? Another issue droplets land outside mask, would possible inhale droplets. Colorado Trump loves blame China says let covid leave country. 

I wish someone would ask ""if covid originated america would done contain here?""  I'm going risk going jail government employee give blood people voted laws first place. Especially risk leaving equally gay partner, alone. LOL I'm someone skeptical lockdowns think cause harm good, also recognize Fauci right 90% time. 

Please stop replying. Corona great environment.
Alot less flights, almost cruises, remote work less people... say going happen months ago cripple world shit. Good see numbers inflated sketchy tests think anyone fears fighting ability group people weak can't stand putting piece cloth mouth minutes store. thought writing that, wasn‚Äôt sure reference would obvious enough. Yup people go Tecate dental work lot people need socialization feeling something. China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, South Korea seem handled COVID amazingly. 

And China definitely far US address climate change.

China fastest growing EV market world, rolling world's largest fleets electric buses, well world leader developing high speed rail verge maglev, mention developed world's advanced centralized logistics systems trucking reduced transit times increased efficiency, addition automating seaports transitioning using electric vehicles load/unload cargo, fact process cutting meat consumption nationally 50% world's fastest growing market plant based meat alternatives, world's biggest investor lab grown meat... oh, China also world's leader advancing development renewable energy tech infrastructure.

And mention China also planted 66 BILLION trees since 80's?

[China track meet Climate Change goals 9 years Same. already lost extra $400 unemployment boost started October, else next? Plus, void exists Pittsburgh/Philadelphia filled anti-maskers fucking hate ‚ÄúWolfe‚Äù (because none one spell fucking name right reason). buddy, end. Got airlifted 60 miles 2 months ago. Chopper around $55k. 

Thank god great insurance. think paid like $200 since deductible easily hit!

For record, /u/trenlow12 deletes dumbass comments well said. I'll honest you, visited dentist I'm afraid hygienist might visit whether they're careful. I'm afraid get exposed. wife nurse tells time co-workers works constantly going out, partying, going restaurants, wearing mask, etc. wont even go dentist routine cleaning. !! I‚Äôm type 1. think doctors med staff get pretty quickly. Moderns Pfzier 50 million doses pipeline. would ready almost immediately approval. hopefully 100 million. 18 million healthcare workers US. either one approved enough. one percent one percent. 1.6 million people plus sports movie stars. guys covered. sub turned god damn cesspool. running joke? First vaccines production first non-trial vaccinations coming winter. Well done Victoria!  Thanks encouragement, maybe I'll look seriously start research. Trump moved scorched earth construct. Nothing matters get elected. gets elected, can't 3rd term, one matter afterwards.  least edit ""fake post"" comment, like, jesus. see easily debunked claims like contributing factor thing spiraled control quickly? need get paid stay fuck inside go work... hard figure lol Doesn‚Äôt matter say idiots man. death rate % stuck head actually care still percentage people die directly impacts them. It‚Äôs American way life. don‚Äôt give shit anything affects us directly. idiots stop ignoring dead. reasons complex debated, one people indoors often poor air circulation. Another thought temperature humidity allows survival virus longer period. theories state people become susceptible infection colder. could also combination factors. 

While exact reasons debatable, data clearly shows aggressive spread respiratory pathogens happens fall winter, CDC epidemiologists concerned since summer. Carrying high case counts summer fall winter seasons coronaviruses thrive puts us bad position. many models predicting upwards 400,000+ deaths. Whether actually happen, know. would give man, circle jerk strong still spreading, make pain go twice long vs letting rip like FL/AZ did? They‚Äôre best trying MI there‚Äôs many real Merican‚Äôs still don‚Äôt believe anything Tronald said so. dump nation become!? corrected data great. still really bad though, think OP's points still stand. Can't wait get beers. remember something posted Oxford vaccine ready September. Kinda curious find ever came pretty obvious load shit probably shouldn‚Äôt pushed mask, service, debate. want hear Europeans stupid. always shortage blood.

I say downplay need, always need donations. Good thing left October, would show increase. Vietnam closed borders March, authorized people enter undergo 14 days quarantine. far good, right there's handful cases everyday imported cases found soon reach quarantine facilities. Yes. live northwest amd driving literally gone hell. People run red lights time, blow stop signs, 65 school zones, tailgating, people drive sidewalk, name it. fucking insanity.

Thats mention drivers shooting cars, pedestrians bicyclists weekly basis crazy - used like 12 shootings year 150 already. add note dog idea....honestly don‚Äôt take vet time get healthy dog younger side. Dog food isn‚Äôt expensive. dogs toys secondhand. real cost food, like treat likes don‚Äôt even that: dog really wants love, walks, you. vet clinics don‚Äôt charge much, sometimes shelter use discounts start vaccinations such. mean: homeless people keep dogs, local shelter gives donated dog food free! course may want commitment understand totally. don‚Äôt let expense get way getting new best friend live home. ‚ù§Ô∏è problem! gotta look other. wish daughter happy healthy :) am, people waiting line early voting 50/50 masked/unmasked. waited line nearly 2 hours half wore masks outside polling place little distancing line. 

Those unmasked put went polling site, leaving noses exposed. 

Our polling site small room something like 20 people smashed inside, social distancing, shoulder-to-shoulder voting. 

Surprisingly gave us stylus vote passed sanitizing station. left hellhole state? Doesn‚Äôt matter Texas, it‚Äôs still shithole breeding ground idiots. think Virginia permits indoor dining, stupid. went get take out, couple sat down, took masks eating.  Question: hospitals capacity due scaling back past months legitimately room ? Australia chillin, 1 case today it‚Äôs known source considering every unit donated tested HIV among things quite masks could spot stands people‚Äôs chins. North Dakota highest number cases per capita country 49 per thousand. No, I'm not. lie. Western nations, think ANZ beat there, pretty much ones attempt keep away.

Worldwide, probably China - advantage knowing everyone contact without ask.

... Facebook could probably give similar info willing, come think it. idiots think better looking vaccine? 

Meanwhile, smart people warning people work creating vaccine nobody listens them??

What time alive...I hope survive. You‚Äôre confusing PCR serology testing. forget fake news People stopped caring. many restaurants , bars even following restrictions put on. seemed like nothing ever happened. People forgot it. waited situation got severe even anything it. Money matters lives apparently. ittttttt

Most packed cells end issuing patients comes guys blood shortage since pandemic definitely caused additional logistical issues hospital system. Appreciate bud Taco Bell essential voting not. You‚Äôre right thing, thanks sacrifice! must really bad there, alone-together! exactly. what, expect attendants police passengers? belligerent passenger (which, even pre covid problem) decides wear mask?

Maintaining safe healthy environment, especially enclosed space, requires work people. wear masks, less (if no) problem. takes one person, one person break (or point view, bend) rules. upvoted white police officer caught ""peaceful protest"". Wtf? No, that's terrible advice. supposed lie questionnaire risk assessment tool designed protect recipients blood donations. questionnaire donors good assessing individual risk. Lying questionnaire makes selfish individual. Im confused, get it. Fahrenheit unsafe? Got it. bet places wouldn‚Äôt. Hopefully guys become norm (commented well) thus I‚Äôm dead wrong looking around world‚Äôs surges right much extensive many anything guys had, I‚Äôm optimistic.

And ya, bias likely position that‚Äôs likely lot pessimistic yours. I‚Äôll take insight again, hope proven wrong.  Yes! dig graves like Indonesia. Ever seen mad max movies? Polls essential. Polls shut way. hospital beds available, kind big deal. 


So... yeah we're sure. Exactly, virus EZ mode still screwing up. nothing else shown typical American culture hyper selfish. Many exceptions, know. trend direction clear brief window period HIV antibodies show testing. window problem straightforward problem dismissed homophobia.

The US country struggled issue. Several countries lifetime blood donation bans men sex men. Still others deferral system 1-5 years since last sexual contact. 

Again, really complicated issue. Much complicated dismiss homophobia. Ventilation probably pretty poor. It‚Äôs old log cabin. It‚Äôs still we, I‚Äôm American grouped idiots even though you. It‚Äôs way Yes, flight attendant notices mask aren‚Äôt actively eating drinking ask put back on. Last time
I flew older lady row poorly made cloth mask kept slipping chin 3rd time asked pull handed new mask President tried politicize pandemic enough us let worked. Leave Fauci make call.  Exactly. CDC study wearing mask ""always"" half restaurant last 2 weeks. chilling eating? LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOO Winter definitely coming. Schools remote areas here, getting ready open. They've given families choice stay remote go in-person. 60% said they're going in-person. record number cases. Heading flu season.

This country get it. they've given up. both. Yikes. one spring lockdown too. There's nothing stopping spike. like 70% urban texas already voted. early voting numbers texas year incredible want lot death Iran help that. bag dirt never made dumb decisions. insane rate US may actually even need vaccine. virus spread own, people spread it. Nightlife sooner sacrificed day jobs slow spread, way is. Proactive interventions way begin limiting transmission. Reactive responses never achieve this. wore glasses early safety net touch face well. Better yet, get line completely. doubt US EU will...but should! data, sounds pretty solid! RIP. seriously position parents controlling movement, young enough likelihood asymptomatic. worry them, yourself. Western societies become individualistic. agree more! exactly need doing. least SA, $75 year net ambulance insurance reduces ambulance fees $0 (at least last checked years ago). I'm surprised people saying purpose. like hospitalizations half high summer peak. Anyone site specific counties? doubt El Paso capacity, title seems imply. ""We manage cases really want true.""

 -Everyone public company... Anyone could invest fast click buttons. think need paid good person? litter unless someone pays throw trash away? HIV would also spread around unless someone paid to?? see list 70 article. rounding corner 180 back started exactly decided schools. student contaminated, rest class considered risk anymore. sure voted. ""covid researcher"" friend group never taken virus lightly, completely agree 41K deaths continent 1B+ people. South Africa hit hardest even population dense top 30. 

I wonder every one reported big ones it. Also, lethality seems weaker well strains India earlier year think. case don‚Äôt follow sports: World Series held Texas, packed fans drinking eating together. point is, agree Mexico deaths per capita US, fucking egotistical uninformed need fabricate Mexican response fits pea brained world view, rather accepting fact pandemic happening USA. lying? earlier hospitalizations 50-100%??

Because lock ""too soon"", ie anticipation know going happen, certain 40% Americans lose minds. Americans need see people dropping dead streets accept action. entire world trouble. Enforce social dancing, limit gathering sizes, provide encouragement support remote learning working, procure distribute PPE, cleaners, sanitisers etc. 240k year gonna convince already-employed ICU/CCU doc state crazy female governor? Argentina's lockdown management joke, like sitting government. city news border city central asia country Nah, Europe passed us per capita new cases tbh. It'll still terrible though. Also what's America hate. every single bad guy country blasted news, countries well either.  Also, mentioning France put context American sees France 1/2 cases. US poorly top (federal govt school adminstration individuals throwing parties.) could imagine US 200k cases day, that's bad many European countries, Europe clearly screwing now, too. us west need look Asian countries handling cause competition, they're winning. ‚ÄúOver Christmas‚Äù high success rate terms world struggles Replace talking heads Powell, they're pumping least $1.4 billion today. Removed rule 5. spread misinformation. happened call say today? governor Campania shut schools weeks ago next day already people protesting street. Moreover moment 75% high school classes online, general I‚Äôd say didn‚Äôt work well. 
Many, universities, hand, started new semester already online classes, much doable acceptable students teachers. 
Shutting schools would easiest option, always best one realize shifting goalposts ""two weeks flatten curve"" ""restrictions there's vaccine"", *you're* one selfish, right? majority population want this, demanding comply *you* want, one selfish. Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, probably going released first UK, two doses, six weeks apart, full effectiveness creeping second dose, probably another six weeks. 

Most vaccines released first Europe US also two doses similar timeframes, except Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine single dose. one might ready emergency use January according latest headlines, may may accurate rumors point.  I'm saying rich folk think herd immunity means poor get wrong. true all. Socializing normal part human every corner world people leave houses interact humans. Also, places like Japan Vietnam famous nightlife tradition going partying. can‚Äôt argue people believe way. Believe know whole bunch them! ever loving fuck wrong people personal life? 9 people. want truck along hangouts like normal

I empathize wait month two. got phasmaphobia discord play friends anyway People weren‚Äôt told stay away friends family Cold War. Pubs restaurants weren‚Äôt shut en masse. Education wasn‚Äôt widely disrupted. Sure, scary uncertain time everyday life continued - imagine much scared people would 60s/70s cut loved ones? 

9/11 - scary time life went on. 

Why think either things appropriate comparison know. nothing alike. 

WW2 probably comparable thing recent history terms disruption daily life, dare say bombs raining indiscriminately major cities right now, people would taking seriously. I‚Äôd sure hell shit scared thought bomb going land house. stands, coronavirus isn‚Äôt big threat people doesn‚Äôt instil kind fear. Oh, people still allowed socialise freely war - pubs etc stayed open. Affirm. contracts several manufacturers world, including Russia China. Leftist communist countries death tens millions due starvation regimes lol. seriously guys stop 'this amount cases equals X US', dumb even comparable. Imagine country 2 people 1 getting Covid, like saying omg that's like 175 million US?!!! okay, talking heads TV, jawbone stock market back positive territory end day dont get people suffer covid fatigue never actually acted appropriately. Theyre tired hearing imo. [the proven case? Seems lot straightforward taking chances spend week home. I'm guessing Fauci let go point probably retires. I'm american know year, gather he's done heroic effort life. could enjoy time off. Drugs, alcohol, suicides, medical misses like cancer screenings. Prefacing saying comment replying accurate. However bad flu seasons ERs (and do!) definitely overrun severly strained. top draconian measures, people China Asian countries well used wearing masks. problem, [here screenshot lesson crisis government cannot solely rely self-awareness public. eye, anti-mask protesters basically paranoia.

You may argue enforcements overturning unnecessarily strict. However, nothing particularly wrong done CCP handling pandemic far. turns US, pandemic already become political ammunition attack another party country. Quite amusing. understand argument, I'd like (I've heard around lot). 

Where corporations fit in, corporations specifically talking about? experience, corporations exist (in capitalist society, right now) fulfil consumer need. example straws (since someone used it), everyone decided stop using straws, would mean straw making corporations would longer make straws, they'd longer buy plastics make straws, plastic maker longer buys oil make plastic, etc. proposal straw making company stops making straws? maybe that's strawman (haha, get it?).

In mind 2 possible solutions problems unethical consumption (which know would argue consumption!). 

1) Legislative - Government creates laws change equation, whether that's things like carbon taxes, outright bans certain types goods services.

2) Societal - People make choices make certain things unprofitable make, think Tassimo (which learned stopped selling machines). 

Corporations exist fulfil market need, change things demand side. Even every current corporation given market made decision stop supplying certain goods services, demand still there, new company going come along fill it.   El Paso Strong! think 40% reduction business across board seems little high right now, person responded claimed *40% people going reason whatsoever* right now, objectively false needs argued ever want get state fear we‚Äôre living claim know ""I shut travel China"" stupid. time travel China shut down, virus world. evidence shutting flights China actually positive impact? Thank you. I'm proud moment, maybe someday. people don‚Äôt care! sad! Exactly, unsustainable correct statement. cannot reasonable expect people isolate friends family, forgo events find important lives 7 months two years. sorry...that even includes people wear masks around friends family private gatherings holidays. Get. Real.

As such, it‚Äôs clear strategy isn‚Äôt working sustainable...so...maybe another strategy? Looks like bother read article.

Its linked specific small windows rallies including times cases decline right large social gathering thousands maskless covid deniers. Many came wave spikes across globe. there's compelling evidence suggesting immunity last (a reinfections 5M cases ""compelling), antibodies tests encouraged anybody tests positive allowed live lives without shame. Biggest population, biggest state Also make sure it‚Äôs valved mask. seem popular contractors ineffective. I'm angry, going go stranger internet unless they're downplayer/denier. We're side. already seen social media. Used state tweeted daily numbers plenty open everything posts. That's stopped now.

Even reddit see less widespread use Germany well Covid patients Flu hard work since various strains mutate. accurate thing say Covid severe typical flu strains deal bad worst case flu strains. delete comment, removed. No, listen them, actually wore mask telling us ineffective. Still do, completely unacceptable cause suffering children based kind paranoia results ppl scared go hospital. Time buy. I'll wait contact tracing start leading back them. took MUCH welfare NEED? slimey republican piece shit. I'll reporting feds. isnt going be. Thats clinical trials for. Masks lockdowns completely different Check Victoria, Australia, lockdowns work, need done properly. left leaning Americans reddit really hate country much?

Yes, also Europeans burying story. election free talk though worry. long righteous protests need ignore for. disagree. Europe try. beginning, country shut 2 weeks March like 5-10 cases. people started suing government stay home mandate somehow direct violation freedoms, threatened major protest. government caved lifted lockdown. Things okay started lifting even more, opened borders summer let tourists in. schools opened knew it, middle shit storm. please put Europe US level. European leaders try, maybe enough, did. I'm one work wears mask (unless customer wearing mask, put one on) infuriating. mask door closed. know air recirculates office, least close door keep mask on. lockdowns work. live (Switzerland) dropped 1500 cases day single digit numbers.

The problem loosening restrictions much lockdown. Even ""lasting effects"" narrative falls apart personally know dozen people it, even ones serious cases recovered within months. lockdowns work. live (Switzerland) dropped 1500 cases day single digit numbers.

The problem loosening restrictions much lockdown. I've never donated blood life, I'm thinking even though blood pressure fairly low. Reason: I'm 0 negative... anecdotal I've found people sometimes tend equate flu cold. tried posting last night (12hrs ago) - get past auto-moderator bot thought politics.

Eventually, one day, someone tell story happened Trump leadership first told confirmed case infected recent foreign travel recent contact confirmed carrier. moved Covid house needed work operational. met contractors door mask arrived without wearing one. opened doors they'd need pass need touch much. would long enough thought they'd use restroom, dedicated one them, put fresh towels, wiped everything left. cleaned anything they'd need touch disinfectant arrived, sake, left, sake. 

I trouble one person, appliance delivery man thought mask beneath nose. pretty clearly dumbass general. Otherwise I've happy conscious people home. they've seemed appreciate efforts keep safe. imagine they're encountering lot people considerate.

I would think risk work would low. extremely concerned, purchase replacement furnace filter swap left. 100+ business entire United States America last 6 months? rate citations tells business worry OSHA much comes covid. That‚Äôs saying. 

Literally there‚Äôs study KU says masks reduce spread. folks conflate reduced spread spread. course masks don‚Äôt 100% prevent spread disease, reduce it. It‚Äôs important reduce spread hospitals ability take people.

Also reported low quality argument. Canada also huge SARS outbreak, apparently didn‚Äôt learn it, smh caught developed antibodies I‚Äôve wearing mask public that‚Äôs it. Everything else haven‚Äôt doing. ""People completely isolated! can't anything involves socializing others."" Tbf claims outlandish.

The claims may agree need sources one permanent effects. know (with data research) effects may persist decades, know fact hospitals right facing Bergamo / Wuhan horrors speak. there's aspect covid long haulers unable work 3 n months still displaying symptoms infection march.

There's lot said caution face virus return normality. 6 months later little current state affairs individual country. leaders responsible now. think Google stopped publishing it, used show reduction mobility different areas based location data. remember seeing stats NYC reductions 50-60% recreational activities, workplaces, etc. can't find anymore, think figure far off.

Google activity look specific user though, aggregates overall levels traffic areas. seem concluded 50% normal activity means 50% people staying home half going business normal, I'd suggest likely 95% people going half often. Every single wave affected poor way worse. I‚Äôm sure even make claim. said that. idiot

You made grammatical mistake commonly made poor education. ""Your"" second person possessive adjective, used describe something belonging you. ""You‚Äôre"" contraction ""you are"" often followed present participle (verb form ending -ing).

You may want ensure spelling words correctly using correct grammar accuse someone lacking intelligence education future. Nobody notices exponential growth late American isn‚Äôt great virus defense. article happening back march, I‚Äôd somewhat agree. we‚Äôre ten months this. know do. worlds leaders much worried economy it‚Äôs devastating population, still fucking economy. 

Sure, China didn‚Äôt great. took full month take hold US, example- Time could‚Äôve used shore hospitals prep inevitable. Instead downplayed made half-assed travel bans. 

China longer one blame here. Numerous people around kept saying ""oh virus go away winter, may survived summer last cold""

South America exploding hard US was. gonna survive winter too. subreddit unironically thinks refusing everything reduce infections literally equivalent murder. Florida completely reopened hospitals capacity, meanwhile people putting full blame 200,000 deaths American government. agree. Also, people forget first time Europe United States dealt pandemic ""modern"" society. 100 years long time ago, long ago. problem arose then. Eventually people became numb whole thing unwilling go along strict public health protocols. could spend day reinforcing belief conspiracy theories internet. Eventually, people gave virus swept society. playing game now. difference possibility vaccine. course, people need take vaccine work. boiling point france. They're recommending companies allow work home mandating it. They've closed bars(despite ARS finding majority cases universities , least cluster cases) curfew . already hit 20k cases day week . That's recently escalated 40k cases day three straight days 52k cases Saturday. fucked. People bitching whining whole time, matter govt govt complacent anything serious. I'm scared , folks.

Nobody cares anyone else anymore. live society. shame people think state funded murder christian option sick people wearing scarf pretty little mouths.


Reminds bible verse: "" sick murdered me"". something.


Edit: 25:36, ""I sick and....""

No worries - Church Utah. It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôll gone April. Like miracle.  live lightly populated county upstate NY cases starting go rise. Unfortunately local Nursing home really bad outbreak. 61 people (14 staff members) tested positive week nursing home alone. like 500 beds total significant amount people one nursing home. small little town, stuff like incredibly scary. People definitely getting relaxed terms social distancing mask wearing. pray everyone nursing home ends ok. Personally, I'm going public quite while, risky point work home anyways. one thing could stall Biden's response get Senate majority. Mitch still pulls strings, knows?

538 puts 80% chance good odds, still realistically Biden pres + Repub. senate, difficult situation COVID response. Poland‚Äôs population approx 38M. average day, approximately 900 people die causes. PEAK COVID period approximately 80-120 COVID average age dying 84.

So COVID leading ~15% increase deaths primarily focused old people likely multiple comorbidities.

Nothing take lightly catastrophe Reddit makes be. don‚Äôt think people required google account get testing, would rather use google typical government built account. Let‚Äôs face it. might see privacy issue google. would trust google security state government online security.  Oh absolutely. first lockdown wasn‚Äôt bad mental health. weather great, wasn‚Äôt busy spent lot time outdoors.

Now? Cold, gray wet weather. shitload Uni work looks like lockdown basically vaccine here. don‚Äôt know make tbh. I'd give like 4 6 weeks. Awwww, tough break bitches exactly Southwest stock rallied almost 8% earnings last week even though biggest loss history. Every airlines went earnings however. concur 84 year old mother (60% heart functionality, type 2 diabetic, multi time cancer survivor) tested positive 16 days ago never developed symptoms. That‚Äôs downplay given real life experiences many takes fear away top message falls deaf ears. downvoted making statement? likely what'll happen. Unfortunately, reality grim denying helping anyone. get it! I'll watching says what, European Canadian regulators. figure broken clock's right twice day. Obsessed. Move take meds. use critical thinking.

Ok, recordings ambulances paramedics situation also false? Everybody lies? evidence video, audio recordings photos well witness accounts also untrue? Somehow hard believe even assume 50% true. worst, truth lies middle ...  Look, Mr Trump, *did* make America number one something!! retired social security, pretty analogous. hospitals last forever - long enough, did. Never mistake need urgent tactics strategy. place. remember either trump pompeo said February March pandemic China good thing manufacturing would move back US. one's talking standing apart grocery store lines.

We talking full-scale totalitarian lockdowns ruins economy. That's kinda hinting at.  ‚Äúisolated‚Äù island saw 1.4 million Chinese tourists 9 million international tourists year shutting borders. China lock Wuhan bring numbers control, you. think biden going win buy puts. admin going tell rich asshole friends short markets pull money want burn house get kicked out. offer instead? Miss them, yes. Hold weddings, parties etc. midst pandemic purely reckless self-indulgence. deserves contempt poured upon it. mass produced many different factories. many, know. partner tested positive, quarantined. started showing symptoms 12th. fever broke week half ago, that‚Äôs left residual symptoms (ie congestion, runny nose, infrequent cough, coughing phlegm, shortness breath) 

My question acceptable go back work testing positive? She‚Äôs done lot research, seems place, don‚Äôt know anybody else positive could ask. Thank advance. Correct.

Like, even question. still paid right? Nah, schools last close first open. potential detriment student's education (especially younger grades) simply high.

There plenty alternatives school closures. requiring masks, enforcing social distancing policies, implementing hybrid schedules, rather outright shutting schools altogether?  enough. schools must implement online lessons. soon possibile.
The alternative lockdown everything weeks now. Ugh. This. came small town last week already seeing uptick cases. family self quarantined two weeks saw pictures (including people know) 28,000 people close proximity attendance. think it‚Äôs irresponsible politician holding rallies musician hold concerts, etc. also think people need use right minds assemble stuff. brain reason. free choice things like people still do. Ofc find hilarious walk eggshells neckbe@rd adm1ns delete comments d00mers vitriolic like. F u. us FDA allow interim results/documents submitted study/trial over. Places like Canada, allow interim results/documents submitted trial studies continue. people won‚Äôt follow them. 

The story you‚Äôll see 1) vaccines may always 100 percent effective 2) everyone take vaccine telling Next fall everyone wants vaccine vaccine, fauci stated vaccine widely available March/April. keep saying every time one threads pops ""normal"" switch flip one state another. gradual progress. Indoor concerts? happening spring. Mask mandates, least major cities? gone spring. way many people living lives? amount personal social interactions, fraction people eating restaurants? things increasing. Outdoor concerts events? Probably happening late spring/summer next year. Full thousands people music festivals people travel around country congregate? Probably happening fall. heared Chinese friend state regulated 7000 rmb 14 days, meals included. mask studies fake.  liberal conspiracy control lives muzzle us.

A glimpse flat earthers. wearing masks??? longest time enough vaccines everyone anyway. wanting vaccinated change much. men want watch world burn Think warranted case govt said hoax we're going anything govt B said serious shit need everything Santa delivering it? arrest virus resisting, plant drugs it? It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs worse. bad, flu pretty damn bad. one realizes that.

It's also really important note people get ""flu"" really flu. usually they've got something else gets lumped bucket.

The real actual flu knock ass like week, using pooping guts vomiting. Covid even worse may leave seriously long lasting permanent damage.

Wear masks people! OWS wish list. guarantee. actual pharma companies producing vaccine made clear wishlist met multiple statements. US see even 10th number first delivery.

Even Fauci said vaccine widely available 3rd quarter 2021. 


You setting disappointment. Pretty sure 50k cases day. like dont need vaccinate children, children really impacted virus, deaths children covid proportional yearly flu, vaccinate everyone else, kids go back school.

And importantly me, college students adults, so, everyone able get vaccine go college, wouldnt surprised colleges gave vaccine students considering billions dollars lost lost housing contracts, lost dining plans, long parking tickets, etc. Yup, think go outside reddit anyone see people living lives somewhere middle. I'm licking doorknobs, I'm also hunkered basement shielding even sunlight. take precautions I'm crazy it. meet others, wear mask we're eating, stay outdoors. go outdoor dining. carry hand sanitizer always wash hands anytime come home first thing. I'm cautious, I'm going let entire life come grinding halt either - would disastrious mental health. think government could communicate moderate response coherent messaging they'd able get people board. There's many people think lot health officers asking us strict therefore they're throwing anything. point, need pragmatic people willing do, I'd rather taking moderate precautions slow spread letting spiral completely control. 2 weeks, 9 months, vaccine, close back down, 2023....just ‚Äúthese jerks‚Äù wear masks....clearly none measures working, people truly suffering lack normal medical &amp; dental care treatments, business loss closures, poverty, emotional toll staggering. Global leaders need new plan. agree, doesn‚Äôt make holding rallies wise thing do.....particularly crowd refuses mask up. Except zero people denied beds USA demonstrated capacity build field hospitals like week coworker told what's happening son, freshman NE university athletic scholarship type. caught COVID couple months ago got it, done heart damage him. He's going cardiologist they're lots testing, he's pretty much benched fall season least maybe beyond.

That sucks, he's 18. know happens scholarship can't play medical reasons. school got COVID, too. Heroes, heroes, bravo. Clap hands, clap clap clap. means, continue spreading much possible, take measures 2 months late. [Here's death rolling average. shape curve promising, say least. end sight begin finish line kept moving Yes, smart. Westerners viewed whole ""masking Asians"" culture bemusement. confuses years doctors decided compare contrast flu spread countries masking culture vs. countries didn't?  big question whether masks worked all, seems like topic study long pandemic. countries world large amount old people still alive, comparing first world countries developing world disingenuous.

I repeat, Sweden never many cases hospitals could handle it, main goal countries since beginning. Flattening curve whatnot.  think they'd quickly introduce exception. I'm sure enough staff work beds, think do. issues like workers falling sick like we're already seeing Belgium Czech Republic course whole situation interrupting regular hospital business. Politicians experts want avoid situation, that's we'll likely see restrictions/lockdowns long hospitals full. Hardly anyone talks bad suddenly hospitals preoccupied Covid-19. 

A friend waiting surgery glaucoma March hospitals postponed indefinitely. Imagine sitting home helplessly slowly turning blind. turned fine hospitals quickly realized going get overrun see different time. Maybe hospitals edge April :(  Good ya! gotta part I'd like go favorite restaurant again. KBBQ! One day... perhaps Christmas? could say debates 4vJuan. Probably difference summertime wintertime (when people much indoor). yeah, guess numbers assume summer  Yeah, went back parents' home gym. worth three people tested coming back positive virus eastern Belgian city. Hospitals transferring patients elsewhere cancelling non-urgent surgeries, days Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke warned country close ""tsunami"" infections authorities ""no longer control happening"".

It‚Äôs obvious longer control failed duty control. Yeah, found year government public large places value lives. 

The government provided us PPE science-based guidelines. public placed wants needs. go bar restaurant get sick, come workplace expose it, I'm wearing month-old N95 mask. 

I sign sacrificial lamb. way see (I live Ireland), definitely ideological question guess understand others feel differently. ""It's flu."" That's works. suit-and-ties get bailed government, turn around, give million-dollar bonuses. Meanwhile retired science teacher watched retirement savings disappear sticks gun mouth... get even worse cold weather coming, everyone going congregating inside more, lower vitamin due reduced sunlight. Going get lot worse fear. Workout home man. need drive germ central lift. Poland send patients Germany? Atm still space hospitals? total...only 184 apparently hospital. can't catch rona video link.

Well, many students unable access video links! everyone affluent you, realize that? Especially big city like Chicago!

Also, families parents work? leave kids? can't let stay home themselves, we?

If support reopening schools, propose offer education students without internet, take care students families? wonder percentage people getting purpose? Buddy mine works plasma donation center said ‚Äúregulars‚Äù coronavirus parties try get infected. reasoning you‚Äôve infected Covid-19, sell plasma $100 time instead $50. Geniuses lol 1000000000000% virus became deeply partisan issue one side tried pump wave anti capitalist rhetoric. side played anti science base neither innocent. way many businesses treated power shouldn‚Äôt awarded crisis it‚Äôs never given back. sub discussion debunk/fact check lies etc people post online?


For example there‚Äôs paper circulated deniers would like know counter arguments. 

It old paper sars-cov2 predates covid19 decade knew this. Thanks.

I always wondering happened Fridays. Skiing maybe, bars, restaurants, lifts lines lifts total opposite Also, sick. need rest take care themselves. There's going lot people vaccine approved figure health crisis go back business usual, even though personally vaccinated. Ignore them. article attracted lot anti-maskers COVID down-players. assume this. starting test vaccines children 12-15 years old. least 2022 kids 12 receive vaccine. 

Even vaccine adults spring 2021, take year distribute. 
You wearing masks taking precautions next several YEARS. Please STOP false hope next summer normal. Kids literally rat plagues this. read another article today (in NY Post, maybe?) linked new stats I'm starting see family friend gatherings. People taking seriously 2 months ago starting give in. watch others go lives fun things, getting together friends family, taking vacations nothing happens. hard convince keep sitting home everyone else fun nothing happens them. personally, I'm staying home, resentment growing. Damn socialists!

Some Big Pharma CEO probably. centralist meaning in-between political lines believe universal health-care provided taxes all. believe Illegal immigration without acceptance documentation. I'm Pro-gun ownership think cats bag terms guns. Pro choice women wants abort baby body choice unless extreme late term health consequences. must think everyone aligns certain belief right wing leaning / conservative.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess considered Moderate centralist incorrect meaning i'm super political know terminologies.  Irish schools done suggest friend. Ending us Education twice likelihood getting Covid. ticked boxes terms mask wearing s. distancing much feasible. still rates up. sign babysitter. signed educator SUITABLE environments. government deeming appropriate. one politician Department Education knows like modern Irish classroom. shows. lack sensible honest guidance sickening. Christmas probably. importantly, stay away Donald Trump. Probably similar South Korea.

Masks, testing (lots lots testing), good contact tracing.

For example, China plans test 5 million people Xinjiang outbreak 140 cases.  Lemme guess, solution print money devalue Venezuela‚Äôs currency. Maduro‚Äôs solution everything....

And violence. Maduro likes violence. Here‚Äôs covid cure:

1) Citizen gets bag worthless money.
2) Citizen gets punched kidneys military.

= side-effects, COVID gone! oooof fucking course guy blames peronism everything left wing legimitalely believes rich country classically liberal governments lmfao

this right-wing agenda y'all came see! people's sarcasm detection seems turned recently  lost started anti mask bullshit. See ya later rogan. Curious. would argue exactly?

Considering role State institutions, State-mandated revision history, concentration camps, ongoing situation Hong Kong. pandemic? show says this? reading article.. actually say vaccine provides protection, should.  Uh, even need book smart. Rich parents pay way get kids school that's norm decades. pancreas that‚Äôs 3x normal size!!  
notice daily death around 1% daily case two weeks prior, consistent two weeks delay.. There's herd immunity flu flu endemic. Herd immunity mean 100% population resistant virus, means antibodies native resistance stops virus replicating uncontrollable manner. real dammit. Lol Hong Kong says hello Huh? even worst case scenario seems way long.. downvoted? echoing lot experts like Dr. Fauci. agree also can't complacent. total deaths per capita COVID? Obviously Mexico violent. Redditor right. Mexico closed border non essential traffic Americans. America leads world infections vaccine finally hit, far simple end Covid-19 exactly reason, unfortunately. know affect younger people... much less common less severe shrug off. weight odds kids getting severe complications vs damage could occur locking down, zoom learn year, away social interactions kids.

To me, risk Covid essentially zero compared full year lost learning social skills, ignoring mental trauma going hard lock down. 

I actually aware long term effects, rather fact really understand long last. thing worries most. know I'm going die contract it, barely breath 12+ months afterwards? unable work? scary thought.

But weigh odds reality situation is... I'll probably fine. like much choice anyway. need go work pay bills, working home option me. can't afford keep kids home even wanted to. reality sort dictated disease anyways. 

It helps I'm afraid it. I'll fine. Everyone know fine. really worry risk factors, live risk factors. 

But also believe focus specifically helping protect risk factors locking everything down, country (well, US least) social nets public plan assist everyone lock down. 

Kind rambling post part, basically... I've weighed risks disease find incredibly low people (especially children), we're getting better treating every single day. I'd probably sing different tune caring society and/or social safety nets, don't. life goes on, pretty much unchanged was, minus big events wearing mask public. Hospitals overrun annual basis flu. Wut mean shut 2-3 weeks waaaay back months ago nust like everyone else guv said old people want get back work sacrifice lives next generation. Go Texas! 

It'd easier cheaper zap anyone 30 health conditions like movie Logan's Run. Yes today 0. ever heard phrase ""how someone smart dumb?"" usually talented smart people prideful. Prideful enough stupid things stuff say, 'infringes freedumb'. Also, taboo mean enforced punishments anything. alone lot US's covid efforts (more specifically lack effort) half-assed disaster. focus daily totals looking trends. Look 7-day moving averages smooths variations reporting schedules. past 7 days around 10K higher/day previous 7 days. Yea live Canada.

Can't much non compliance - obvious current situation we're in. fact US got Europeans got China doesn‚Äôt really change anything.

huh, maybe europeans done something tell new Yorker, people state island already operating half capacity brain. fact they're going New Jersey places monumental event tells they're actually here. goes on? 'breakers' come play month line? limit access general goods time, start eroding quality life. also block sweet aisle too? need sweets. Might stop people browsing.

Electrical goods could also break down, require replacing. Dude, leading candidates Phase 1-3 testing awhile deep review safety. could still side effects, already pretty damn good idea safe point. great. Congratulations that. say think making bit mistake trying eliminate completely. personally think going Korean route make sense. think it‚Äôs likely outbreaks difficult get people comply may think it‚Äôs useless. Hope I‚Äôm wrong that‚Äôs fear. happened complete pricks. I'm assuming you. Parents ACTIVELY testing students quarantine student continue playing football, cheer, whatever.

This top Texas government tracking data properly. numbers various different ways. Santa touched wee wee five. hope gets Rona! It‚Äôs really frustrating see people come sub keep repeating tired old line ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work.‚Äù

There‚Äôs literally article article sub, accredited R1 universities saying masks help prevent spread. 

The lack scientific media literacy fucking astounding. Source? give data assumption people poor hygiene dirty water immune systems better prepared fight virus. voting? Understandably that's going everyone's priority right now, want vote able to? Canada looking pretty nice right now.... Remember: Switzerland size population Virginia. Manage existing shoes *temporarily*! Ffs. Apparently misinformation. Looks like guliable people expecting wonder cure appear like every respiratory diesease have. 
There cure. El Paso 3 months ago work. Actually went bar told us wear mask. Promptly left. Rest area seemed taking 95% seriously though. thank Dr. Judy Mikovitz one. Yep I've pointed quite bit. Iv fluids.

But congrats, really slow myself. getting really bad months ago. Like liter whiskey every night bad rules allowed vaccine UK excludes 50% population.

I've heard I've yet seen either precise rules coherent justification them. absolutely believe I'd love see source. poor family - kid needs new shoes, internet access least researched topic get opinions experts commenting.

1) Yes, blood tested. that's irrelevant issue. Testing 100% accurate. Meaning, infected people inevitably falsely test negative. best way avoid block high-risk people donating.

2) Yes, even sexually active gay man ""clean"" results, banned still high-risk. Even previously tested negative HIV, recently sex another man, another high-risk exposure could missed testing.

3) Yes, ESPECIALLY PreP banned donating. PreP lowers HIV viral load, measured NAT blood donation screening. asymptomatic HIV carrier takes PreP donates, NAT falsely test negative, patient receiving blood get infected.

4) Individualized risk assessment already explored studied FDA AABB. occurring slowly make bigots.

5) No, rules ""archaic"". Sexually active gay bisexual men still highest HIV risk US. long change, still banned. reason also ban high-risk groups like prostitutes, injecting drug users, recipients blood transfusion, etc. Nothing bigotry. Younger populations, low obesity rates, extremely limited testing, inefficient reporting, governments can't trusted share true covid numbers, people can't even reach hospital treatment dying home therefore counted covid deaths, etc. So, yeah, I'm going ahead say really can't know true numbers covid infections deaths many countries. No, doesn't. Give realistic scenario person's need buy item clothing, shop, today, outweighs need keep shoppers minimum pandemic. Yep, I've 3 free COVID antibody tests this. I'd donate anyways, nice bonus sure. Large group people one place, indoors. like spread schools (see happen time every school) matter time. Though happy see precautions taken, slow it, stop it. article gives rather optimistic view. Yeah going back point original comment, effective way deal rising case numbers is:

1) Lockdowns &amp; restrictions bring case number down

2) Testing, tracing, masking, etc, keep number low

All successful countries steps, less successful ones tend Step 1. that, willing even repeat Step 1 things get REALLY dire. Step 1 much effective implemented early. hope going blue lost last debate Biden stated intention transition oil really worse US Europe, South America, really anywhere outside Asia far.  Losing implies US Europe ever political try contain begin with. Winners come strategy win head battlefield. Europe US, focus win try ""live with"" virus, interested negotiating people. remember - also remember found new data showed masks fact work. Science neat new data  It‚Äôs it‚Äôs like article encouraging poverty. good news poor people suffer much already may less likely die virus. centers allow bring rusty bucket ! Murdoch press (SMH owned another media group) unrelentingly trying promote unrest Victoria restrictions. Without much success, seeing ""Dictator Dan"" narrative press unpleasant someone living lockdown. 
 
Similarly members federal government (Liberals) endlessly various state governments (particularly non-Liberal governments) open up, state local lockdowns, interstate travel bans.

Of course plenty genuine reasons criticism various levels government. People stuck overseas, quarantine restrictions, failure quarantine procedures, uncertainty future, employment loss, business closures, non-C19 health impacts, loss activities give enjoyment life etc. highly partisan attacks helped (and perhaps others) get it.

Notwithstanding this, public pretty supportive actions control C19. Random C19 response surveys limited, difficult get clear picture. People enjoyed it, think many support and/or understand actions reduce disease, death, hospitalization, long-term health impacts etc.

In context negativity people may questioning worthwhile, see article telling people worth it, something really great achieved. Yeah, wouldn‚Äôt summer nice people gradually getting vaccinated? Maybe could even tracker that, there‚Äôs like new category Worldometer prevented infections view progress. Either everybody get disease eventually winter. 70-80%, something like that. really know going do, doubling every ten days big cities. governments:  People dying hospital corridors, okay. Economy important, take measures.

Why historical revisionism popular sub? order KN95 masks like that? Desperate cope countries like India overall mortality much higher developed country. still believe real China example then? Vietnam? Taiwan? 

People want throw hands give rather continuing measures contain virus. even pay taxes for?  virus become endemic herd immunity like said? much fairer response. 

As foreigner lives China found reason doubt numbers now. think pretty obvious original case numbers way more, also think kind understandable, complete shit show little testing.

The border issue fair parts southern neighbours also pretty well. think count border India considering inhospitable pass is. Russia border, that's something they've problems incredibly strict there. Western border quite leaky, hence recent outbreak kashgar, I'd say almost certainly came across border.

My city case day, imported case
 family 4 allowed quarantine home, still incredibly strict, actually install camera outside door monitor make sure go out. father passed 2 tests negative 3rd test showed positive. picture response that.
http://imgur.com/gallery/UkGC06e
That medical workers arrived test everyone apartment complex (950 people) 1 asymptomatic case. take shit serious. Also worth noting picture social media, went crazy new local cases found, idea could hide ridiculous, everytime cases reported grapevine goes wild.

As said I'm foreigner love ccp, many reasons distrust honestly believe situation right reported.

A long response seemed like might interested. first wave still biggest thus far. Look estimated cases v. confirmed cases. Testing nowhere near needed first wave. Wow! make one every state! Granted rather pedantic distinction, somewhat akin calling Chongqing province, Isle Man country, Washington DC state. Man, trusting college students responsible, kidding? like dumbasses never went college. Belgium: french amateurs too. 105k cases population. Pakistan planting trees. Pakistan China different believe half second number China reporting COVID cases

Attitudes like West foundering. Westerners can‚Äôt distinguish reality PR. Saying blood demand rises covid19 bit stretch. ""journalist"" write anything clicks. people - way know everyone can. IFR inject billions, ironically dangerous COVID-19. Testing thousand tell us might end.

0.5% IFR 1 200. thousand significantly 200.

If see pile zero corpses due vaccine, good. Wait....does it? didn't. NHS staff probably early mid-December second dose January.

There rules allowed vaccine UK excludes 50% population. recall correctly, UK following EU guidelines (specifically ECDC EMA (European Medicine Agency) 31 December Withdrawal Agreement. Same. see lot friends/ acquaintances home social media acting like nothing going on. gym, family parties, about, masks. thinking past months ‚Äúthis catch eventually‚Äù... are. sad. Stay safe EP. fascinating help explain places like much Africa seen Covid deaths. exception South Africa, wealthier better sanitation. Young demographics, less obesity, vitamin exposure, perhaps undercounting explain it. doesn‚Äôt really explain 68 million people UK suffered twice many deaths 1.1 billion people continent Africa outside South Africa. Poor sanitation additional factor makes sense.

And it‚Äôs interesting earlier pandemic worried poorer countries would suffer lacked soap disinfectants. would sure ironic studies come later show disinfection incessant hand washing we‚Äôve airborne disease actually led deaths. mean everyone temporarily manage clothing already have. keep drinking already passed fuck .

Of course always worse, sometimes late already never (for people, be). Isnt pretty much already confirmed vaccine approved end year, mean fauci stated 100% know vaccine works Late November latest. what‚Äôs causing difference positivity latest data showed university fairing better COVID-19 positivity rates, compared state Ohio. positivity rate Ohio State testing 1%, state Ohio positivity rate 5.6%, Friday, Oct. 23. lockdown happened first October. see total shutdown inevitable death toll hit 8+ thousands remain active infection rate goes significantly down. Simply far ahead are. secret civility US F'ed B. either covid doesn‚Äôt seem slowing down.

Even peak outbreak, 4% people Wuhan actually infected. city people dropping dead streets.

We're Wuhan levels yet, got plenty room speed keep speeding that. like Mass long while... Stay Home really farthest governor willing go. lockdown damn near unenforceable needs $$$, assistance god damn plan. True. time, far greater source testing now. also way better large parts Canada manditory mask order. 

 Toronto Montreal seen massive growth covid cases. provinces respectively 1000 new cases per day.

Even neighbouring province. major cities: Calgary Edmonton, manditory mask orders new cases exploded even cancelling surgeries again. million fewer people posting close 600 new cases day. 

What told begging summer going easy soon got back respatory season gonna get bad. respatory season overnight cases exploded.

Vancouver generally mild winters, also might account seen crazy explosion rest Canada. also seems feed respatory season argument. actually optimistic Fauci since always spoke vaccine candidates approved end year early months next year. part, avoided putting date smart. go far third point -- many people believe get vaccine (most likely prime booster) drop precautions hug everyone. Let's put fans baseball game sure way prevent people voting person? Pennsylvania deaths per million: 683
Texas deaths per million: 627

You're right bud lockdown really working

Source: based baypilled China locked ppl apartments. mandates met us, would seem like better option Time educate use discord video calls.

Talk whoever there. You‚Äôd test negative, totally quarantine 14 days hope everyone gathering same. Silly goose!! polls dead accurate, electoral college put trump whitehouse. feel like personally know enough blood donation blood screening strong opinion rules around men sex men.

But find frustrating people act like main issue homophobia infected blood killed many people. Blood donation matter life death. wonderful Houstonian feels like ominous foreshadowing. first wave different regions.

The SECOND wave hit NE college students return turkey day get parents killed Xmas.

I‚Äôm happily introverted, also haven‚Äôt seen family since last December. want least able go home. sheer curiosity, say? young person want everyone healthy. need lockdown completely like March, it. want grandparents parents stay inside. 

Speaking lockdown, chances going another go nowhere lockdown? Schools closing work closing again? feel like may become necessary many people resistant fear losing jobs suffering economy I'm really selfish. volunteer, donate money, usually treat others respect. believe confining people homes extended periods time strategy worth pursuing. Simple that. 

Please consider people different lived experiences may different viewpoints. necessarily make stupid loser. Getting along people different values worthwhile makes life better Literally nobody said lockdowns would completely stop this, stop spreading misinformation lockdowns somehow work, do.


And need us forever, many countries successfully managing virus. assume leadership fucked horribly impossible. Yep! faith start! I'll sure end! Yes. opened borders. Losers. think New Yorkers would tell first wave 100x worse. thats mind blowing, mid teens positive % too. fuck fuck badly?

Yes Automated drones could deliver still undergrad, would absolutely bother semester (probably year. younger brother started 2nd year college decided year local community college-- saving shit ton gen eds plus could go fully online). 

Our grad program agreement agree teach undergrad classes, school essentially covers tuition + pays small stipend... complete program certain number years. able took year off. 

And honestly? sure university going open like 3 weeks shutting again. figured since teach chemistry labs, everyone's already wearing goggles, mask gloves, room well-ventilated.... bad three weeks, right? 

Yikes. keep mind healthcare workers, especially now, need supply masks. want public buying available masks. Captain Obvious letting people know alarming news!! Damn wasn‚Äôt ready We‚Äôre big island. we‚Äôre island. We‚Äôve mostly shut borders. great tourism hold border closed keep cases zero. See NZ WA. virus spreads via droplets.  cannot stop it, slow bit Everyone needs hospitalized turned away sent home **WILL DIE**. 

COVID patients need hospitalized require average 22 days hospitalization, everyday patients beds, means compounding problem, Case Fatality Rate (CFR) COVID skyrocket.    

When people need hospital sent home good chance everyone house get sick. entire families die.  

This October, peak time viral transmission happen December thought February.   

This going get ugly.  

If already plan isolate sick family member need develop plan **NOW**.  house force air heat make much harder isolate patient.  patient needs wear mask **ALWAYS.**  believe breakdown fathers mothers rearing children become skewed towards mothers again. kind strides eroded rn, men stepping level wives children housework pandemic. right people secure persons, houses, papers, effects, unreasonable searches seizures, shall violated, Warrants shall issue, upon probable cause, supported Oath affirmation, particularly describing place searched, persons things seized.

i'm hoping make Luke Combs' first show back tour scheduled August feeling pretty good that. mean time head back college spring maybe catch ball game two i'll ecstatic. 

either way really nice see people finally discussing end-game scenarios pretty serious it. we're gonna get this! Lol extensive test, trace, isolate system. That's really significantly differently. I'd say less social distancing almost western countries (which seem intermittent lockdowns related orders). border still open there? Winter Coming! - Ned Stark! Fingers crossed something approved December, healthcare workers vaccinated Dec/Jan slow roll based need/priority levels. back normal time next year, I'll happiest person planet. I'm never, ever, ever going take social interaction &amp; living freely granted ever again. conspiracy theory Friday results may delayed, keep massive spike affecting futures opening. MAY normal distribution, except things got smoothed. want six figures headline resting weekend.

That's literally disgraceful certain things right now. asserting true. France French Toast comes negative Uhhh no, proven strategy enforced. absolutely can't wait Fauci announces vaccine approved vaccinating healthcare workers imminent. 

I'm honestly okay living lockdown measures another 6-8 months. NEED light end tunnel rough date look forward to. Like miracle it‚Äôs disappearing. Lol whoaaaaaa! Also though, must point article written April. sure puts time line new studies. Also, article self talks problems studies. several articles talking women taking brunt house work / child rearing. lost jobs staying home, overworked. keep seeing local Red Cross Blood Center wife make appt 2 weeks (appt 2 days ago) even couple slots....

I work event weeks ago can't till Nov, filled too. live nobody suggested would two weeks, started with.
What crazy miracle happened week infections went down?
Sounds absurd hindsight people suggesting might happen. Would silly shutdown two months right away something like happened. guess I'm saying hindsight 20/20 one. Good point though. verified true? feel like huge deal setting new precedent areas re-lock down. links reinfections? Incredibly curious hear opinion. statistics, facts affirm "" collective stupidity going right France "" ? everyone wear masks, follow rules curfew widely respected. facebook comments, doesnt represent mainstream opinion. Netherlands allowed get medical masks. standard ones. medical ones medical staff. least, gov says. story May Ratlickers denied. think Texans said NYC worst?  highly doubt did. Gaining speed again. wrong direction. üòÇ OP r/conservative troll outdated copypasta thought dunking people taking seriously. see plenty purpose, given poorly countries handling pandemic, I'm comfortable staying closed. That‚Äôs neck woods. state relaxed lot restrictions people went back everything like normal. People nothing ever happened daily numbers climbing. people wear masks don‚Äôt. 

I even got argument uncle says COVID isn‚Äôt real it‚Äôs political they‚Äôre controlling us us wear masks. told parents house, know he‚Äôs taking seriously. Stop measuring waves raw case totals. I'm saying downplay severity what's going right 2,000 people dying day lot worse 800 day. reference, like America 200,000+ cases day adjusted population. Doc too. cant get patients PACU ICU floor overflow. sure hope people stop heart attacks, car wrecks, strokes, getting cancer, etc. Northern winter Southern winter hardly comparable... HIV first came out, moral panic people like ""Hey, gay=HIV!"" rules passed prevent blood donation.

Eh.... little complicated that. 

The big groups initially infected HIV men sex men, IV drug users, hemophiliacs. Gay men still unusually high rate HIV infection- [69% new US HIV cases among gay bisexual think decent argument removing ban access faster testing, rule men sex men donating moral panic, public health. hemophiliacs alive age 40 many died infected blood 1980s. HIV infected blood real health risk.  agree. biggest prob city people still restaurants eating without masks. Gathering together groups. People aren‚Äôt taking seriously enough. get many people going shopping all. I've done delivery pick-up since began. forgot schedule pickup groceries couple weeks ago go grocery store first time day. 10% people wearing mask (there's mask mandate state) another 20-25% wore nose chin. 
I'm going extra careful forget scheduling pickup/delivery future! many people, Texas especially, far pandemic actually going heed stay home order follow social distancing guidelines? ""thanks obama"" Fuuuuuuck that. know, I‚Äôm sorry calling like that. course finally speak vent lo behold you‚Äôre helping special needs. I‚Äôm still astounded mad hell every district that‚Äôs mandating school session. school special needs provides services. wouldn‚Äôt let us work masks-off one requirements. client would SOL. Even though, they‚Äôre discussing waivers younger kids person, small class sessions masks ppe clear barriers teachers still ready boycott. Developmental delays not, close quarters masks much risk everyone involved allowed. must mountainous bare. winter approaching don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs pleasant cross.. Lmao even North Korea brave enough tempt crazy Tr**p Thats really works though. spend 16 million P&amp;A 1600 wells thats basically 8 guys working year thats it. give 200k subsidy thats potentially drilling 56 new wells. well grosses hopefully $12 million revenue (672 million total) decade state takes tax 6.5% pull back $43.6 million taxes new wells. I'm listening Dr. Osterholm's weekly Covid update podcast- he's 1 week since march. 

He said week ago next 6-12 weeks going worse March enormous spread taken place particularly Midwest, along almost every state showing troubling numbers case loads.

He said there's much done governments POV actually stop this. going needed people practicing social distancing, mask wearing, hand washing, smart crowds, etc. keep it, 6-8 months vaccine start see going end thing. 

He's saying 5 year world war drafted go fight in. going 6-8 month effort part willing contribute much possible vector disease. suffering ""pandemic fatigue,""- hang there. working it. making sacrifice worth something. friends live El Paso, post snapchats/stories clubs bars multiple times week. assume already COVID fine, give damn masks whatnot there, seems. Although, Houston - see snapchats IG stories people clubs packed like sardines pandemic going on. kinda wild. blurry, here's screenshot showing friends it. masks sight, people making out, wild. last weekend. bar packed. Australia really needs buckle media, death don't. work multinational based US offices throughout world. European coworkers generally acted beaten virus. spoke going restaurants pubs work.

Check youtube channel: scare pranks Europe. masks vidoes across Europe pandemic. issue 10% world's population infected. every one person who's sick, there's 9 ready get infected still. That's main issue IMO. Lots people getting fatigued pandemic, taking risks - less masking, gatherings, bigger gatherings. top that, schools reopening help understand tried. 9/10 infected getting infected. consider last 7 months results 10-15% population getting covid, start appreciate much ""wood"" left ""burn"" still. body-shots. extent much longer

-No hateful message half country morons deniers.

-Realizes can‚Äôt US 

-Checks subject... yup it‚Äôs somewhere Europe People know think like flu, numbers inflated, kind sickness getting marked covid, go away election, lie left media. look Fox listen president, would think isn‚Äôt issue. care give reasoning behind Trump ""wanting go bad""? either, would embarrassing. city mandated masks put bunch restrictions like max 5 people gatherings. Public compliance apparently high. continue see record number cases. People frustrated follow rules cases go up/shaming continues. don‚Äôt think many people rebellious. rules aren‚Äôt cutting due privacy government refuses disclose spread - rumoured large families household, communal living, restaurants allowed open.

What I‚Äôm saying is, it‚Äôs necessarily rebellion everywhere. current politicians dead time shit hits fan *here.* already hitting fan parts world global economy built cater to. problem large population centers often significant population lives outskirts. Take New Orleans example. may 360k population, add surrounding ‚Äúsuburbs‚Äù, daily number people interacting sharing resources swells almost 1 million people. 

This winter going blood bath. ICU nurse here. Offers $4500 plus per week El Paso us. you? Fewer Let's overload hospitals, great plan. open first place months 35 thousand dead like saying planting tree. 

The best time take measures 2-4 weeks ago, second best time now. Cannot wait republicans conservatives cry freedom.

What think happen, people want go lives, sign piece paper giving away right go hospital receive treatment. I've spoken people think hoax sense. usually say combination dangerous say, numbers stated, easy catch, etc. dont deny exists people caught it, seem intent underselling aspects it. also one voting location per county? people gonna together voting one building. super spreader events across country voting I'll surprised. One big wedding takes I‚Äôm afraid Yeah. Killing lot people order. People still encouraged go vote. need wear mask entering leaving gym, 45 minute workout?
 
My gym requires masks whole time.

...No? They're risk reduction measures. wear can, hopefully least mask.

Do better Donnie. better. country acting exactly Spanish flu. mean, covid19 helping global warming. best way, albeit. ""Life free die. now?"".

What indeed friend.  Isn‚Äôt happening countries? ask cause keep seeing posts Paris example instead we've doubled ""Blue matter who"", we'll elect Biden world praising sun things back normal, completely forgetting ""normal"" disgraceful disregard human welfare societal improvement.

""Blue matter who"" **in general election**.

What's point victory every four years, immediately cede back ground next guy pure enough?

We two good-ish years Obama (2009-2010), went 60 votes Senate 51 (2011-2012), 53 (2013-2014), 44 (2015-2016). stupid purity tests got us Trump 4 years, we're returned 2008 worse, ACA get axed decades 6-3 Republican SCOTUS.

If president Clinton, even passed literally nothing value 2016 today, we'd 3 SCOTUS seats, ACA intact, infinitely better response COVID, need start rebuilding decade ago.

These ""not good enough"" fights take place primary. lose there, take motivation next time, excuse sit set back another decade.

AND, course, Biden winning White House mean gets free pass. things want? Organize rally them, been, except demands issued receptive party, met tear gas riot police. thought Joe Rogan leaving California avoid lockdowns? lived viruses before. worked. stupid. Nah.

Her spouse compromised immune system. worried. course agree lol. I‚Äôm amused many people not, however We‚Äôre already almost one it‚Äôs literally worst it‚Äôs yet?  going lockdown anyway (and yes well predicted outcome) sooner? Add flooding massive hurricanes well :/ Ideally rural areas stay home Texas swings blue. afraid actually are. have? Step 3 one keeps night. Likely move suppress voting Cool, sorry snarky. tell anti-coviders viral tests universal, covid test wont able catch influenza vice-versa.     Humidity also bigger factor people realize. Low humidity allows respiratory droplets spewed travel longer linger air longer period time. 

Sources: shows coronaviruses peak December early stop confusion, absolute humidity defined actual amount water vapor present air, whereas relative humidity percentage water vapor could possibly hold. ""People kind forgot virus"". No, one confused different types threatment covid. 

For example: Danish nurses say patients need oxygen sent hospital. means sent hospital need oxygen. quote dosen't claim patients needs oxygen, dont. I‚Äôm justifying behavior, Mr_Boneman said parents suffering cognitive dissonance, I‚Äôm suggest could something else.   

I agree, behavior reckless others. say China, [94% live 43% denser part China it'd 324 per km2. wholeheartedly agree, main vectors transmission : schools, work public transportation; and, well, operating full capacity days... Venezuela doesnt test people. several doctors fled asked govt disclose info tests. 
Why?
All tests sent govt-ran labs dont disclose results hospitals. realize big Texas is? real answer. People need start defining mean ‚Äúend Covid‚Äù ‚Äúend pandemic‚Äù USA probably uninhabitable land + national parks, farms Let guess... lemon juice? mostly right. regions enjoy benefit increased crop yields, general, outweighed damages extreme weather, energy costs, water costs, on. Really hopeful vaccine quick enough effective enough combines serious thirst travel bounce industry back... whenever is, ugh good luck. They're mostly trying rationalize downplaying virus. convince demographic effectively immune really easy go around saying nothing. problem low chance thing chance, know I'd feel like chump acted like threat happened one rare guys gets screwed. Basically, Yes implemented free healthcare /s Spring 2021. vaccine readily available would presume V-Day thought US problematic country, right r/Coronavirus? agree see west disputing numbers last time checked plenty western countries pissed them. Sure intelligence agency would something show now?  DONT GO HALLOWEEN PARTIES PLEAASSEEEE!!!!! impressive big state, impressive US. That's meant. comparison comparable sized states. mask wearing 90% part OC - since OC people 17 states. US re-elects Trump know say. Thank  trust me, waves 6,7,8,9 better Autocorrect changed keyword ""citing"" ""voting"" much Spanish Flu change society over?

That question might backfire you. might seem like Spanish Flu changed nothing, that's coming heels worldchanging events incredibly downplayed time events. COVID-19 coming heels world war, example. despite certain individuals' best efforts, one pretending country's problem.

[Here's AskHistorians thread Apparently incorrect. France.  agree everything said, I‚Äôll sort disagree super spreader event. Instead one event, there‚Äôs culmination multiple factors. things think coincide:

Football season: stadiums allow fans stands, people football viewing parties congregating bars watch.

School: Lots kids young adults back school. 

Weather: much country cooling now, people head inside instead socializing outdoors outdoor activities.

Offices: reason shit ton people called back work office despite able successfully work home. county (San Diego) actually tracked major uptick rush hour traffic starting 5 weeks ago urging employers people work home.

TV: lot shows recorded NY gone back studio live audiences... talking you, SNL. think irresponsible gives appearance isn‚Äôt serious pandemic over.

Basically, single event, wave things make us feel like things going back normal. guess fans go stadium, friends watch game, right? guess kids school sleepovers parties, right? go back work office happy hour work, right?

That‚Äôs think happened.  matter. get 80% compliance even 50% compliance get R0 1, like tons infectious diseases.  fourth amendment:

The right people secure persons, houses, papers, effects, unreasonable searches seizures, shall violated, Warrants shall issue, upon probable cause, supported Oath affirmation, particularly describing place searched, persons things seized.

China uses cell tower data (among surveillance tools) trace covid positive people may spread virus. violates fourth amendment U.S.

The 4th 5th amendment also gives Americans right say fuck contract tracer asking info

As far harsh penalties, believe would major backlash Americans. agree disagree one.   Thanks sacrifices! Keep up, we‚Äôre together! Seriously! Stay home watch movies wear mask grocery store. Maybe I‚Äôm introvert, don‚Äôt get hard don‚Äôt understand wrote there. would inflate grocery prices, prices, even more, well past actual production worth goods. fundamental economic problem hands way worse covid Haha well sexual pervert. that...

I‚Äôm sure means pre-Covid? means going distancing wearing masks years would roll eyes that. Many people already aren‚Äôt don‚Äôt even vaccine yet. try telling people social distance wear masks vaccine.

If means maybe reevaluate social policies shown inherently flawed, suffer massive collective trauma equivalent World War...id believe that.

Edit: also checked date article. It‚Äôs May. height new normal BS he's going fine taking abortion antibodies cocktail Sure, want compare neighbouring countries, New Zealand Taiwan? think island plays part, Vietnam Mongolia?

Sweden held *lot* example let borders reopened, really hard see benefit all. true, airlines issue guide first time flyers even pamphlet flying pandemic. covid 

Never, going become endemic, one virus eradicated took 200 years massive global effort covid anything like ska, wave worst. Thanks Homer. makes sense italy unfortunately aren't. Well hopefully see death rate sky rocket next weeks. stays level actually good thing.would mean mostly one less dangerous strains. rate death going down? Better per week since March Well ones cry it, care happening them, poor never go people Say ""well get better job stop lazy"" care humanity care themselves, protest able go bars knowing kill people care think gonna happen them. fuck'em Hey I‚Äôm trying find answers respond covid-denier/antivax guy daily Zoom meetings. 
Being controversial given much stronger response/quicker answers here. ;) 


I‚Äôll take downvotes, given good stuff far start researching get back him. bet places around world act much earlier they‚Äôre near hospital capacity anything near fully restrictive lockdown while. Restrictions sure even move slower before.

That‚Äôs terrifying reality something going long. Fatigue, limited resources, political pressure... leaders looking cut dry line justify significant actions; preventative unfortunately going hard sell.

Of course enough places go there, get easier action again. fair, American voter turnout almost always lower among younger demographics older demographics. isn‚Äôt 2016 problem. Haha didn‚Äôt pick it. show evidence smart guy. Asia done better best metric. ashamed ?  Speaking lot athletes buddy. 

And like keep changing whether talking football athletes it‚Äôs convenient you. 

Im checking though, enjoy evening. population evenly spread however 

New York example far denser anywhere France No. guess didnt infect many people first otherwise wouldve never seen huge wave Summer hotspots. 
Texas peaked end June doctors catching infected people july due testing plus backlog. 4 months later, new european strain going TX. doubt amount UBI given enough people quit jobs. way government give individual crazy amount UBI. think people think amount UBI like hundred month..

And birth rates decreasing decades also saw increase divorces. overall shift cultural values cause decline. bad thing per se something money fix. Send sick Colombia! Oh, clear message save *own* life! ordered best promising drugs treatments himself. think us plebs getting Trump Treatment? doubt folks reading issue, stay strong stay public. Im finding getting complacent. Curb side vs. restaurant, stay public gatherings, yada yada. +10 years point another, feel like countries going start attacking America. I‚Äôm thinking maybe going say screw all, can‚Äôt get contained - time help (bombs)...just thought, don‚Äôt blast lol. Staying in. leave work (retail tho) maybe little frequent grocery store (still maybe two days week most. Always closest one house). 

As pre-winter last hurrah, went Downtown Disney Japanese grocery store birthday last week. still us staying safer home ‚ù§Ô∏è corner turn? We‚Äôre first state hit 1 million infections. heartbreaking. struggling well, almost year imagine kind norm. lot people dealing lot. I'm trying extra thoughtful mindful work others. Thanks sharing those. found info school. super effective could tell buildings positive fecal RNA tests coming from. Obviously would tough time making work communities. 

On makes much sense start testing sewage treatment plants way see overall community infection rate at. would help inform policy related locking things open things up, also hospital preparation spike identified early. definitely exciting. prevent selfish assholes go work regardless fever. people exist.  totally agree! bad many Americans would riot jailed wearing masks. dumb understand science. isn‚Äôt political, virus! jazz age literally straight Spanish flu pandemic. Oh yeah, they'd insane let tourists :) Ok ridiculous. want cherry-pick lowest case countries Asia, even lump Australia, Western nation, one going take seriously. wife makes bit money do, going back work soon parental leave over, point assume role stay-at-home dad. Everyone wins, ""traditional gender roles"" even get foot door. makes science prediction incorrect? Wikipedia page shit, nobody lives mountains. Even outer suburbs ~2000-3000/km2 didn‚Äôt say answer everything, never wrote Sturgis rally caused cases go Boston Philadelphia.

Sure ignore obvious Philadelphia Boston large college populations cold weather causing people congregate indoors. 

But sure blame elementary schools. never said colleges high schools aren‚Äôt possible igniters Covid outbreaks. point solely elementary schools shown drive Covid outbreaks anywhere world. still arguing 6 7 year olds driving Covid outbreaks went back school 2-4 weeks ago unbelievable me. US lucky isn‚Äôt dense European countries. number could easily way higher Hmm, believe Dr Fauci completely random person internet... Australian wildfires. Thank much!! sorry hear band. many lives affected many different ways. Freaking sucks guys aren‚Äôt back playing. Total failure administration citizens taking seriously. I‚Äôm huge music fan. What‚Äôs band name? Anytime talk musicians always ask familiar Jack White! He‚Äôs musical God opinion talented artist. Real talent!! smoke mirrors. 
Anyway. Bless family. Stay safe. came contact affected co worker 5 days ago tested negative yesterday ( thank god) Im feeling terrible. Hopefully it‚Äôs damn virus. Ugh. anxiety get least little bit feeling well. wrong sub unwelcome dissenting opinions, arguing mask wearing dissenting opinion, idiocy (as /u/DChapman77 said). 

The nuance matters. Arguing lockdowns, example, valid opinion would/does get downvoted shit sub goes prevailing opinion. Even pointing good news coronavirus situation often gets downvoted. childish unnecessary. coming arguing virus go away Nov 4, 6% deaths covid, arguing masks, etc. valid opinions well deserving downvotes. shocking governer asked really nicely wear masks. worry number, growth..
 
20k infections day probably alright stays 20k day next two weeks.. worrying part is, france's new case doubled every around 10 days..
 
the number daily death's growth also similar.. 
 
I say sooner later, growth slowing down, stricter restriction would necessary..
 
and notice keep using graph ending 11 August (for france data), try using graph ending today/yesterday answer say screw Constitution get want. telling. room? Air France one big covid cloud right country ""did right"" then? death rates costs end far less already are. find procedures tests costs us pretty. Meanwhile, places better healthcare, it, social safety net. trouble beforehand, devastated many areas US. bit like nsw days 0 new breakout teens 2 weeks later back 0 testing contacts said relevant compare countries, Scandinavian countries. Sweden could probably learn lot example Belgium South Korea. countries mention.

Do mean dont see purpose opening boarders? seasonal flu cases right now? Wait tell happened May June.....Us getting 0 cases absolve government sheer fuck Hotel Quarantine program much much larger fuck contact tracing led 3.5 month (and counting) lockdown. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think things start look whole lot better we're talking ""end covid, full normalcy"", August September safer bet.

if wanted get tickets MLB opening day game, instance, probably problem. indoor concerts might different matter. 

guess we'll see!  Thanks! actually made got tired Texas DSHS hospital dashboard showing metrics [they  NZ appreciate too. Lots us waiting see family Australia again, visit us.

We newborn Auckland, waiting Tasman bubble least parents finally see grandchild. European parents wait 2022 probably. 'Mild cases' clog hospitals... treated sent home. say hospitals capacity, almost certainly mean beds. terrifying think way  second afterwave first wave nsw got 1 local (plus international arrivals ) . wonder long since australia 0 local cases hard someone pays rent bills food too.
Nobody work home steady check end month ever ""tired situation"".

Is hard expensive. never Yeah right, nothing going change election. essentially letting exponential growth run away us. like Bush Jr. left Obama with, instead fucked economy, horrible pandemic, worse economy, experienced civil servant bureaucracy gone allies happy us. Almost GOP wants country fail Dems watch. use plan worked: Test, trace, quarantine.

It allows catch cases, connections, quarantine prevent infection general population. reason working Europe Americas steps. Early Italians role models me. friends Torino, copied States. one,limiting trips essential one family member time. people expect buy holiday gifts work long? don‚Äôt need that. Better vote dictator next election then! 2 Dakotas since became states 100 years ago.  They're going merge (mostly Californians, I've noticed) like means get 4 Senators combined. horror!

Eta. Since civics, understand exactly population irrelevant Senate representation.  locked either death everything awesome. I'm sure go directly tied one, 10 years scientists actually evaluate long term effects COVID,


But, possibility something discovered ten years abstract people? 

Certainly possibility future problems Covid minds many scientists health care professionals. people focused concrete problems today day after. ten year ""maybe""...well, wait. half? thought stops 95%. one graphic 2 people using masks vs 1 using 1 vs using said so. would mass inflation, many people sub seem ignore. Hope chopper ride network... Flu 0.1%. I‚Äôm disgusted literally everyone around me. I‚Äôm boat. People think I‚Äôm lame, alarmist. Sorry caring! Fuck me, right? 100,000 new COVID-19 infections day January, baby!!!!!!!!!!! death numbers risen tune case numbers, Sunday not. idiots need stop counting dead. pointless. wrote several times issues within Swedish nursing homes. never denying it. 

You hand read article found confidence make bold statements, even though obvious lack pre-knowledge elderly care works so. 508 *people per* km^2. People guard there?  It‚Äôs never gonna end, it. No. year. Aren‚Äôt one people? President given people green-light act selfishly hatefully want to, talk however want to. need pretend decent moral anymore. large burden lifted millions Americans. Don‚Äôt me. Don‚Äôt give hope. thought still first wave? appears denmark testing 4 times people per day sweden   Dude havn't kissed anyone ages! fucking weird. started new job never kissed coworkers...

I miss :( usa
usa 
usa time surge fits nicely Trump telling America give shit corona ripped mask. many idiots listened moment figured they‚Äôd fine too! Voting way fix time.  Elected officials pander voters voters only. matter public record whether voted (not how). politicians look watch YouTube, catalogs buy buy, magazines subscribe to, etc. know vote, figure want consumer profile.  

If didn't, elected.

Non-voters often take individual action voters issues like, say, environment, turn lower rates. despite this, continue pay there?

A degree worth used anyway, risk life top paying full price? still people walk right past I'm shopping somewhere. even come right behind look something can't even see unless move. dictatorship looks like. Ya, I‚Äôm hoping something shift soon enough bounce back chance shrinking shrinking every day. Again, left big ugh feeling implications around. Yeah! stay home watch movies one year! work! see anyone face phone! worry crippling mental health financial impacts! worry seeing family 18 months! can't that??? selfish! /s

It's easy everyone, dude. disingenuous best. New PR bby! Let‚Äôs go! 
USA USA USA 
/s None #s actually factual. Funny watch though. That's crazy! scary? sure going lobby baby lol happen once, like taste whatsoever. things may taste weird, metallic. you‚Äôre losing sense smell things taste weird well. get tested. Stonks  sociopath? Mine 30 minute baby came one burst, pause shoulders, head perfectly round. black blue all. 

You know was, I'm remembering, took lot primrose oil softens cervix little resistance. Bullshit, China thier doctors Hazmat suits said that. knew wrong. agree, would say universities club sports teams. Colleges revert intended for: higher education learning. blasphemous kids run 4.5 40 (whoop ti ay!) hit baseballs steal spots competitive schools others potentially studied hard throughout high school likely much promising academically. much ""non-profit"" institutions.  guys use PCR Test? I'd say March April. precise 1/20th 1/17th Go bed, Xi. missed that, explain? would think might make worse . place hot cold better staying home would help Seven? Seven what? think we're going die. Either we're testing positivity rate actually 40% lower second wave. argument use people ask this. dems must persuasive get every country participate global pandemic spite trump. Pretty much yeah New european strain strain ravaged italy opposed euhan strain circulating california, texas, arizona florida. actual study said ‚Äúthat strain‚Äù taking over. Wait...3rd wave? hell talking 3rd wave? never escaped 1st. bunch propaganda bullshit. keep thinking thing can't possibly get worse, keeps proving wrong. Yeah entire world it! Grow spread beggars belief. live El Paso, people care. restrictions light none even nobody listens them. Parks always packed well bars restaurants. People rarely wearing masks lot people still gatherings home. less 3 dozen citations enforced since March. Check alternative media surprised. sub echo chamber mostly. antigen tests recently released used lot detect cases. thats already one game changer already happened, even though doesnt mean enough fix everything. NZ article. written inform *Kiwis* cases. fault redditors keep posting NZ articles ends hope USA doesn‚Äôt offer NZ Aus help way. treating Americans like plague rats. Nah, Putin threw Trump bus. They're preparing opposite point. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs correlation something. know. It‚Äôs nutty, right? point number Dakotas, need two them. known difference seat apportionment House Senate since 9 10. There's difference saying someone deserved die someone willfully chose live life put serious risk medical complications already thirties. already cold. also snowing lot places already. rookie numbers!!!!  People wear masks work public, get togethers family friends sans masks. Mostly, Louisville roughly 25% +/- daily cases. idiots abound...

Spice: live LVille. state tell to. Urban Texas votes blue. That's still first wave, numbers barely dipped!

I would guess people saw numbers falling thought they'd celebrate crowding bar ... BLM protests ""decreased"" spread? believe saw article back said transmission within households/friend groups. Staying home going inadvertently get lot people infected. time over, society likely condensed changes might taken decade two year two

Yay, accelerated mono- oligopolization era-defining industries... sigh. I'm Midwest July coached softball, made kids wear masks unless 10ft+ away wore one entire time.


My son soccer he's kid team wears mask.


I pull hard kids anything, done correctly safe, really good glimpse people (including myself) letting guards Hold fucking phone. El Paso 22nd largest city?

Edit: looked 22nd terms population. Although kind weird statistic entirely dependant cities boundaries. instance imagine another large city near El Paso, somewhere like Denver (19th) much larger, also made cities Aurora Lakewood steal large amount population. bet

RemindMe! 1 month :(. It‚Äôs usually 2 years. Two long, difficult years. simple way match South Korean levels??? Well that‚Äôs horrible thing say prezident problem trying use interstate commerce mask usage regulating passive activity doesn‚Äôt interstate commerce. requirement would simply being. Congress cannot compel citizens engage commercial activity (NFIB vs Sebilus).

In regards spending, penalty could extreme could unrelated subject hand. Congress must coercive ask becomes compulsion. addition, tying federal funds would still necessitate states pass laws, would include proper notice.  back am, states need pass laws. 

Furthermore, seen regards ICE, federal government ability force states enforce federal law. really think best use FBI walking around handing tickets? According Reddit wear mask time worry safety others you‚Äôll fine. dare worry yourself. didn‚Äôt you‚Äôre talking about. Unemployment sucks right people still kept jobs. sound like literally wanted 80% workforce unemployed whole different beast Masks socially distancing  Exactly thinking. pay players this...

People think US France different. (American) right left reason promote bet French right left own.

When comes politics, US France super similar. US younger brother grew taller, France older brother kinda short (no Napoleon jokes here). they're same. They're probably similar even UK US. It‚Äôs two weeks, op There‚Äôs vaccine we‚Äôre gonna wait next year? People don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs real someone told Reddit day California never even got close hospital capacity therefore COVID biggest overreaction modern history. 

Could anti-science Redditor wrong?

Good all! Hope works. want know work, watch US. 

And, Canada's sake, keep border closed!

(If still showing dog, last would hard bit advice.) site real conspiracy?

I can't tell anymore. Im exhausted. We‚Äôre #1! /s Based data far, infants lowest category hospitalization death. (The 0-4 age group, is). Infants 1 tiny airways, 0-4 group, considered higher risk cohort. 

Blood type.. sure there‚Äôs enough data know sure. AB blood seem susceptible severe case. blood may less susceptible severe case. Sounds like they're warmiing Death Panel. 3rd wave? Seconded Still spreading tho...why can‚Äôt admit it‚Äôs hoax come together stop it?  Absolutely correct. Bars metro Detroit area around literally record business. Absolutely packed even nights use slow. trial, data shows overwhelming benefit appropriate side effect profile, halt study certain circumstances. rare, major component every study safety data.

Skipping altogether happen. can't even wrap head around 34.4% infection rate. live everyone sold shut 5%. guess long way slide. government give people UBI there's incoming tax revenue? Utah also hella white. States larger minority populations reporting higher death counts ethnic minorities often denied quality nutrition, health care, standard living whites enjoy ""LOL, still want want. Virus real.""

College Frat party, anyone? happened twice LSU Football Game (Death Valley closed public still games opponents, LSU, others I'm probably forgetting---but nobody stands everyone PISSED). Winter coming pick c) ancient ritual? Hidalgo county, TX similar issue summer. one highest deaths per capita Covid Texas.

Another mass dna g gg harvesting build stronger surveillance systems  Trump said pandemic cancelled! mean correct that, far know, vivo clinical trials confirmed viral load theory **for COVID specifically.** 

But, viral load idea viruses general new confirmed fact hundreds years now. literally inoculated smallpox back 1800s. reasonable scientific theory, ""nonsense"" would pretend. 

Plus non-clinical, mathematical modeling studies reinforce lower viral load theory Would small get together close family fine?  might skip Thanksgiving year, last couple weeks pretty rough maybe need around family. likely wait Christmas though make sure basic family unit. holy shit it‚Äôs last year defense, religions equally silly. link actual study El Paso 600 miles next largest city safest place? taiwan, long set 2 extra weeks quarantine arrive Lockdowns reduce economic hardship, force lockdown people inevitably go self lockdown death counts spike hospitals become overrun, get mass social unrest people fight resources (aka food water) leads economic collapse, yes absolutely take depression economic collapse Feb, right things turned wild, first ever blood donation, knowing things would get much worst soon. Wish everyone that.

Humidity temperature relative United States attempting mitigate factors, socially distancing mask wearing. Densely populated areas Delhi high rates poverty poor sanitation spread covid regardless humidity. also New York City one first places become epicenter.

Edit: I'm saying is, coronavirus still contagious regardless, becomes contagious due certain factors absolute humidity. likely end October 5 days time. hope cracks one! never good plague inc Sounds like great place Sucks big time given circumstances however dire understandable. something article read airlifting ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù patients. assume code ‚Äúwealthy.‚Äù many success story cities became examples soon seasons changed? sure public health measures compliance helping, doubt primary cause. buying gifts. alone holidays. imagine worse people children. children. must favor UBI then? would help solve generational poverty problem sure!

I bet 15$ fed minimum wage too. realize solving poverty important issue you, bad. NICE ONE VICTORIA! know El Paso far cities Texas? #winning? Thailand know mean that. seem think 337 0.2% 65k, know what's going head.

But whatever consider ""in tune"", given approach math I'm sure match rest us - deaths consistently risen, weeks *following* rises case numbers, remain robustly 1% CFR. Given cases risen significantly last week, deaths rise them, sadly predictable time major ongoing case surge happens, gets denied confused cherry picked time kind people think 337 0.2% 65k. Almost like frigin science medical advice WORK?! Flexible spacious office space - nice; flex hours perfect families, pets emissions; Exercise equipment, shoulda kept, next treadmill see curb, I'm taking it. Gender roles change much. like distance learning taking place homeschooling professionals charge curriculum, there's less mass school shootings. French definitely smarter Americans. Westerners much alike think. I'm *totally* predicting spike Halloween well Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's. We're fucked.  ??? certain point, even lockdowns work except temporary crutch, costly economicaly psychologicaly socially, also politically populations cooperate indefinetely, especially government totally failed strategy first lockdown. sustainable start reopening back case Zero.

My country 4-5 months lockdown (depending cities) first Africa daily cases.

A neighboring country (Tunisia) reached 0 case certain point thousands daily. 

The countries suceeded either lockdowns reached even 2000 cases, daily total (Thailand/Vietnam), extremely totalitarian China hardlocked people home can't emulated, islands quasi-islands border North Korea (Singapore, South Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan, Japan ) protect you, protect others.

If true, would incentive people mask up. Protecting literally reason wear mask. Also South Korea imo. experience test tracing definitely helped NZ creating model manage called ""dance"" we're going now.

I know rest west unwilling learn accept East Asian democracies are, areas, better learn them? better states U.S. wish mask wearing outside hone mandatory states (except eating meal, etc). would really lower risk bad resurgence event occurring or, least, mitigate severity. playing people's lives. good all! ""...only one person per family member allowed""
I think makes sense. Turkish shitposters world-reknown endless shilling Turkey. waiting next economic depression home. seriously, probably get worse next year matter president already screwed up. It‚Äôs diabolically difficult stop. announcement granting increased freedoms Wednesday. shops allowed open, allowed meet people outdoors. Repost ok reposted thousand times. complete bullshit. millions need aid due pandemic North Dakota wants put money back pockets big business. Disgusting. Walked past anti vaccine, anti mask protest Tokyo yesterday. world same. Cheers. We're blessed far though: healthy quite quiet :)

Mainly relief parents well managing without help moment. Luckily there's enough free ways videochat nowadays. I‚Äôve saying it‚Äôll November 2021 things finally getting point vaccines distributed. really sucks guy Zoom convos üòè nations one trust. do. mean, sort liberating know ""world cancer"". care, cancer already spreading much faster handle.

It depressing first. like ""Eh... what?"", started enjoying whatever little time left. find Fauci provided evidence

You get it. 

Scientists like Fauci EVIDENCE. Yeah, authoritarians sub start panic, first instinct shut borders keep diseased foreigners, even though there's evidence working countries already widespread community transmission. depressing see first places human mind goes state distress. America shitter. That‚Äôs ridiculous statement. Icu doc here. Got absolutely lit recruiters last couple days coming help. I'm position could right now, must really hurting judging hourly rate credentialing/licensure fast track promises making. Texas going blue year, matter read site. Glad left hellhole city long ago. Aka $hit hits fan Canada mostly eliminated virus fall hit virus came back. 

Same thing happen fall hits again. Hi. perhaps might want leave United States. don‚Äôt feel need apologize working ass majority life buy small home. realize many cannot afford home - - refuse denigrated born whatever traits may ascribe it. I‚Äôm going assume 90% El Paso disregard entirely. wearing mask right fogging glasses. Oof shithole country  Yup. fucking horrible. quoting? Fauci always spoken 12-18 months best case timeline vaccine ever really die there? Victoria, Australia checking in. first 0 case day today since June spiked 700s two three months ago. much harder guys Trump, know individual actions make difference.  though true AZ least. Metro area meaningful way compare population stats. Phoenix actually tiny, add Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Scottsdale like 30 cities considered Phoenix non-residents. bowl, mom first time able see since march, seeing someone moment leaving. Dumb would rather know saw alive literally one all. said, ""states, best."" hope allow voters leave! definitely telling truth. way, course. But, telling truth. going squat. - business usual, then. Holy fuck dumb you? Hi everything random crying random screaming matches! takes authoritarian response. saying aware policy lead people care homes denied adequate medical care?

You saying aware way care homes operate elsewhere Europe? avoid another world war, think 2030s could another 1920s-type decade.

We long road misery recovery get first though. think economy really improves late 2020s earliest. Lockdowns don‚Äôt stop virus. even slow down. Period. Especially Halloween, voting, holiday travel coming up. Check local blood bank, they‚Äôll screen screen blood anyways. Huge decrease yesterday! We've turned corner go back normal! /s  I‚Äôm sure contingent mouth breathers Texas (like states) weren‚Äôt pulling NYC, I‚Äôd imagine majority Americans want best everyone. said, guy charge actively wishing demise jury people respond that.

EDIT: Spelling

EDIT 2 : clarify live NYC.  Large part volunteer base behind blood drives everything else seems always older people too. Talk compounding effect. 

All organizations work moved including ‚Äúwhat home‚Äù messages main message still ‚Äúwe volunteer shortage‚Äù (and money one without donation events). We'll get vaccine, eventually country get it, help make like bad flu season every year. government mandate it, almost every employer want lost productivity sick, pay hospital costs. Fuck two party system Welcoming government move, health experts said Covid-19 vaccine long way available proof effectiveness also still uncertain.

I wish people knew understood this. vaccine excuse reckless behaviour, especially two unknowns. certainly point work research response type role tend attuned diving kind stuff comes light. also helps friend works big medical equipment company tends way insight stuff care know.

I'd like hope long term planning thoughtfulness probably correct people worried now. I'm seeing, people confidence, telling confident everything open right solution. People want act like aren‚Äôt still best/one best countries world we‚Äôre struggling covid. two things related high significance know, especially don‚Äôt hate like UK Belgium shitting much countries covid striken though. virus spreading within country already, stopping travel outside countries would significant impact. That's development. Large scale manufacturing still needs occur need figure possibly hardest hurdle widespread distribution. We'd lucky next fall. Realistically, probably mid 2022. also expect people stop giving fuck mid summer 2021 though. I‚Äôm Texan. course hoped best NYC. Wuhan. Italy. Come on. Okay, EU going pass something working fast produce vaccine. US can't say we're rushing ours. necessarily mainland. outbreak near border.  Let's hope so. Body nectar, drain veins. funny used edibles maybe twice year drink maybe twice month . drink weekly eating edibles forget state world long enough go sleep . 


And that's less destructive culturally acceptable options tht I'm addicted . 


If hooked something right would hard conversation get stop. Question: go Santa Marta Colombia every work. got Visa could drive Marcaibo relatively safe? know google Venezuela supposed crime ridden shithole I‚Äôve driven across Central America, around east Africa, many places told shitholes never problem. Thanks. Same. People gotten shittier shittier goes, too. huge news? Masks lockdowns work. Look Ita...Spa...Fra...Czech...shit.

We real world experiment here. Time abandon unproven, damaging measures return traditional pandemic response. Hmm ok. one done Center DC next hq bldg guess kind makes sense. rate ya might well pull ford put patients conveyor belt.... conserve energy save time walking poor medical staff.

Patients placed tiny shipping containers Tesla battery attached. Bathrooms obviously conveyor belt, rest possible (unless want patients tiny RVs instead shipping containers). lockdown another 8 months? Damn can‚Äôt it, I‚Äôll wear mask another year  I'm Florida. nurse running rapid tests day every damn shift feels like past 300 years 3 7 regular doctors testing positive (one hospitalized) I'd feel like I'm going nuts reason are.


However case. I'm actually going nuts deal steaming hot pile biohazard trash Orlando attractions area. *way* many tourists coming back. 


You're irrational. Rationality rare nowadays. closed can‚Äôt afford open. Well Whitehouse today said control pandemic. hope snows much forces degenerates stay home. read again, still saying lockdowns stop virus.

That's misinformation, lockdowns trying stop virus.

At least I'm ignorant ass read... wrong, found answers without help. 

Next time don‚Äôt bother ‚Äúhelping‚Äù. Two half difficult months, definitely worth it. Congratulations Canada, setting negative records today 2000+ new cases per day.. Fuk yeh article federal mandate. They‚Äôll tell call appointment. sure. approved better even ""less useful"" ones massive game changers end sooner later. Get first, better vaccines ensure squashed making shit. never said anything claim. Let's hope not. Belgium peaked 300 daily deaths. USA! USA! USA! USA! Get prevent spreading chance messing ICU capacity, I‚Äôm going get mine week even though skip years  Population density simply big impact rates virus. typically getting virus passing people street. getting congerating indoor spaces extended periods time. Bars, restaurants, hanging indoors, clubs, churches, dinner parties etc driving large majority infections.

Just give idea, right place cases per capita USA literally north dakota, far-out region north barely people. UBI would probably come Income tax. people working government shuts down, UBI funded?  Donations vary regionally. usually well many med schools hospitals, people work people know people work them. people aware need donate. doesn‚Äôt mean National supply sufficient, though. cookies. Gonna long winter :/  live apartment NYC. love that‚Äôs it‚Äôs getting cold, I‚Äôd prefer look ocean warm get sun deck. shouldn‚Äôt issue you. far lockdowns, I‚Äôd rather stuck house looks ocean apartment.  Holy shit man blood gods... Get ass drain veins.  Happy Halloween üéÉüòÖüòÖüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ true, Paris twice dense NYC highly doubt did.

You're wrong. 

Source: Tx time worst NYC. People spoke Tx wanted best NYC. I'm sure think anything different.

 NYC Fall 2019. personally hoping best them. April... long one going continue get worse without proper action... going magically disappear.... Turkish president probably bitching everyone else *distraction* Turkey's shitshow (not virus, wider problems authoritarianism plummeting international reputation).

And seems working pretty well. forget requisite dunk Fauci changing stance. Read post again, read mine. Illinois relaxed restrictions last month. fact, tightened quite bit. ignorant ass. ""free"" Japan? large sports events? Large gatherings, basically life back normal. achieve elimination go back normal. Countries virus around never able go back normal, unless eliminate virus strict lock down. Austrlaia New Zealand go back normal now, restrictions, provided course quarantine control points entry strong. game wasn‚Äôt even Penn State. 

Next weekend, home Ohio State (night game) College Gameday. Oh Halloween (with extra hour). long last? 

I know supposed used label mine monday- sunday put baggie wear mask week pretty much work day. I‚Äôm sure non-invasive contact tracing methods countries using aren‚Äôt. use whatever‚Äôs legal effective though. fact don‚Äôt cooperate contact tracer U.S. huge hurdle though. New Jersey found half positives replying cooperating contact tracers.

I get you‚Äôre saying harsh penalties. could it, perhaps people would supportive, think would bring major protest minority prefers freedom security situation. People also psychological need feel control fate, admitting nothing stop acceptable. People accept anything sounds like might work, especially people bearing burden solutions.

If Trump understood this, he'd faring lot better polls. needs look like he's something, even none work. Saying may true, people want hear leader. last sentence, true. took many things granted, let's say 45-50 years old never seen world wars such, crazy. Believe people indoors. one living outside non-summer/fall months. live here. cool, windy damp afternoon/evening. Yeah, looking metro area gives much better idea city boundaries vary wildly. Using Denver/El Paso comparison, Denver [still El Paso way #69.

I live Ohio three largest cities pretty much size, look city population think Columbus largest far annexed lot land Cleveland Cincinnati did. local blood donation center closed number weeks. reopened, appointment get appointment number weeks due restrictions number people could building. 

It may drop altruism causing donations slow. Probable cause warrants bro lmao Yes. go every eight weeks. Thank Oh darn. I'm gay give blood. pity. Anyways. maybe Texas expanded vote mail limited drop boxes one per county? feel like I've heard recently US deeper dive. Yea guess harder that's forced you. easier us moved abroad years got used distance, though hard know can't show parents first grandchild he's going 1.5y so.

But break semi obligatory meetups maintain friendships networks welcome. stay touch online, that's easier expectation high frequency meetups (and lose contacts prefer staying home time time) Interestingly, early reports South Korea suggesting seasonal flu vaccine making people susceptible SARS-CoV-2, infected, increasing chances developing extreme-- potentially lethal-- symptoms. halted distribution seasonal flu vaccines gather information. DANG France trying take USA country.

With 1/5th population USA agree pessimism. realism.  patients could taken neighbouring areas hospital capacity Texas lots places capacity. gist. facebook though. Youtube, Google, etc... guilty using algorithm provide user-tailored content. well known contribute radicalization: people shown agrees them, expresses extreme views.

It's retains people's attention most, retaining user attention algorithms designed do. Yeah good points. unfortunate valid economic concerns often expressed alongside ridiculously impractical (and often likely genocidal) views responding pandemic, ends getting buried. there's silver lining cloud come encouragement given rethink practices resource economic management.

In case USA, think massive hit oil taken (not attributable CoViD-19 alone), incredibly poor management virus ascendency China opponent (who holds treasury bonds) going punish currency. already seen repeated global movement away dollar global fiat currency think times may well accelerate it. would death blow American economy.

In case UK, Br3x1t already continue cause untold economic damage, especially hands Eton elite, ideologue psycho-lib-er-t@ri@ns (looking you, Cummings) corporate wealth-extraction trickle-up paymasters.

Holy fuck I'm glad edge earth! Hey guys, I‚Äôm 21 haven‚Äôt flu shot 10 years. I‚Äôve caught flu once. However, situation pandemic going on, I‚Äôm debating whether get it. havent missed day work working nyc im deemed essential.  im medical field give people much credit rough. girlfriend lost job 11 years havent stopped even one day. im literally explode. still taking care son making sure dont starve. literally nothing left worse. drinking becoming bad, id drugs could find go bender. literally nothing fucking left man _The Scarlet Knights send regards_ that's people united states seem understand. reopen, they're typically reopening many active cases community closed much smaller percent population exposed realize. thing still long way go. tinderbox scenario. People aren‚Äôt voting blue want ‚Äúwin,‚Äù like sport. voting want functional government can, among important things, help prevent spread disease. Fox News way reporting 
‚ÄúMask effectiveness question virus spreads wildly countries forced mask mandate‚Äù. can't ""flatten curve"" virus 5 times contagious 5 times deadly flu. Elimination way! Congratulations Australia! 27, know example overused *so freaking much* True economic impacts. expect people wait vaccine jobs businesses lost. Hungry people won‚Äôt care vaccine can‚Äôt feed families Something wrote days ago seems relevant:

6 major temperate southern hemisphere countries passed winter. those, Australia, NZ Uruguay, community transmission stopped beginning isolated lockdowns parts countries otherwise well. 2, South Africa Chile imposed tough lockdowns serious winters. Chile 8th worst death rate world. Argentina lockdowns even enough new cases still rising, positive rates 70%+. None countries 500 new cases day winter.

What happens Northern Hemisphere winter, longer colder remains seen. situation winter begun lot countries worse southern hemisphere countries lockdown fatigue used up. Although always nice see police almost always far outnumbered protesters. Yes, idiots, yes, loud, always them. Can‚Äôt sit inside, sadly. to-go orders only. Wisconsin pretty gnarly right now. :( Sure, keep business open footfall zero pandemic. surely make money , obviously lights, heating . staff etc free ,. right ? customers open good. Lol, oh no. honest it‚Äôs best candidate, we‚Äôre gonna need multiple initial vaccines work make way better vaccines later teachers chance talk since march school kids attend (including resources teachers services part IEP) WANT person, attended board meeting pledge case students back summer came decide exactly school year would handled. district even allows medical conditions families priority remote spots, one forced except ones suffer closings. talking like gened teacher worry IEps selfish. part Sped teachers WANT teach person, jobs nightmare done remotely. 

I making sacrifices do, okay it. Good you. may think selfish entitled last thing tell someone disadvantage stand (let say financially due restrictions lost hours money, say content safe okay work cut hours?)is ""i sorry idc"" saying indirectly.  reject idea refusing socialize without masks physical distancing upwards 7 months level precaution wearing seatbelt. 

People tired treating others like disease vectors. hope FDA approves vaccine November 4th, final FU recent abortion law changes? bit dark joke. Sounds terrible nevertheless May. think get vaccines Jan-March, vaccination starts. 

And also think covid decline somehow gets warm movie socializing outside many places. spreads summer well, seems much. Sweden did- Sustained spread summer aim sustained measures withstand 2-3 years attempting shield elderly (which managed initially).

What crock shit. Sweden 5-10 times number deaths neighboring countries. performed fucking horribly. Fake news already hear goalposts effortlessly moved deniers, yet again. Desperate times... prepared. Given locked like every country prepared? already locked down. Including schools workplaces, terrible, thing slow spread moment. going end well.

Almost European countries same, couple weeks behind. end winter 50-60% European population disease. Users can't see ban, would know? universe Reddit free time? good portion us, included, work labs involve little time desk. Maybe understand EU works.

You *do* need authority asking. EU started charging around taking powers without reference institutions (which constituted reference national governments EU populace) national parliaments would arms.

Also ""the EU"" supposed allocate national healthcare resources efficiently national governments? Unless started 401ks, they're fine. start going retire soon, screwed anyway. Rather trying fight stupid people, smarter them.

Stock essentials way storm shops. 

Get masks sanitizers early. 

Invest form protection, gun something else. 

Don't attract unwanted attention, pretend dumb confused are. Who....do think appoints head FDA...? Horrifying, although faith overcome this. place Poland - fiercely independent, proud, hard working country. US right Texas- hospital Covid pts currently 21% admits Thank this! appreciate it. 

I call ask say. Covid makes everything hard. think even know yet. heard aiming 60%. No, non-frontline workers receive vaccines like Imperial vaccine IL hemorrhaging businesses due taxes regulation. Rona speed process inevitably happening. know thread's shitshow *virologist* downvoted... *sigh* That's happens idiots rule us decide open schools, react fucked.
We around 15k active cases time 300-600 daily, 145k 10k+ daily.

Eta: Also according prime minister, we've defeated covid june, nothing flu... Asian vaccines ain‚Äôt bruh! want people buying PPE US leaving front line workers even worse predicament. plug masks first. supply chain issue want made worse. saying obviously huge side - did. Wear damn mask! Note actually speak Spanish, whatever information got less direct sources. 

""we get many deaths streets"" corresponds situation never even properly reflected Western media... like around-the-shoulder-pat, bro so? say certainly freedom's too. mentioned also freedoms. Freedom simply capacity take certain actions without bad consequences. decide freedom's value more. bought case get sick, prophylaxis bad idea.

Edit: saw posted elsewhere. [Hospitalized COVID-19 patients taking daily low-dose aspirin protect cardiovascular disease significantly lower risk complications death compared taking aspirin, according new Big yikes.

Disinformation / misinformation one biggest problems humanity faces 21st century. vaccines year delayed. Belgium supposed get two weeks ago, deaths Korea. get it, keep get COVID, would simultaneously get flu. Multiple are, including Pfizer‚Äôs, Moderna‚Äôs Imperial College‚Äôs believe virus lol. democrat haox. worry. put together wear masks test, it'll gone. 

C'mon man. Please listen president. willing risk kids inherit life time disability

Bruh, really think COVID's ""life time disability""?? I'm going opposite. I'm going take everything granted stop *care* fucking much. someone comes near I'm going think whether I'm close wearing mask, I'm going even think person. feel talk waves doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs coming next weeks explosion cases dwarf we‚Äôve seen far. assume Election Day probably multitude super spreader events nationally depending polling place run. got preparations holiday season time Thanksgiving rolls around we‚Äôll start seeing effects possibly crowded polling station sites. Christmas we‚Äôll see effects Thanksgiving/Black Friday, inauguration we‚Äôll see effects Christmas New Years, even vaccine announced middle that. dont worry second, cant second wave first never ends Covid-19 fucks ACE2 receptors everywhere, including brain, causes strokes become much likely patients.

It also severely increases mortality rate ischemic strokes 4.9% 38%. basically Simpson's Paradox, splitting data gives different interpretations.

We road three spikes country, specifically three clusters first wave hotspots.

That said, several areas experienced first wave entering second spike. heard Operation Warp Speed? love hard china cracks virus heard much contact tracing March, state really dropped ball system it. 

I downloaded app, one know can't useful. scary part pets seen reservoir virus ever get virus control. Infection pets humans doesn‚Äôt seem happen yet, think it‚Äôs seen minks. Maybe seen large mink farms? idea wild minks. Long term? literally 1.96% drop last week. that's great news you, means there's still tons money made shorting market. Quickly, open positions rest world catches on. Iirc, map dark knight rises Sandy Hook aurora circled. friend convinced still. ‚ÄúEven though it‚Äôs legal, it‚Äôs still considered moral ethical pay cash blood donors‚Äù I‚Äôve heard thing colleges asked paying athletes. pay something get free. someone asks you‚Äôre literally sucking blood somebody giving nothing return, say it‚Äôs moral reasons. Sounds like bullshit me. Doesn‚Äôt excuse fact don‚Äôt ban obvious trolls people spreading misinformation multiple threads even it‚Äôs reported you. nothing free time. Depends mean, likely become endemic seasonal virus. restrictions hopefully gone, probably virus. I'm telling you, March, I'm this. I'm living one year lockdown. I‚Äôve seen depends gym it‚Äôs members state, regardless find people businesses ignoring rules. said, anywhere far south US tends less rules/people care less. quarantining? Pence isn't. Also, BNO's detailed COVID reinfection tracker whoever wants follow far, time interval infections usually ranged 2-5 months. 

**This tracker officially includes genomically-confirmed reinfections** (a fairly high bar evidence), also lists *suspected* reinfections (several hundred total Mexico, Brazil, US, etc) timeline below. trying insinuate 20% Koreans masks? numbers?

You realize evangelicals question specifically offshoot cult, aka Shincheonji Church Jesus, entire 20%, right? land scale zero fucked? Yes hospital deaths, numbers get daily France. Note nursing home deaths also added statistics Tuesday Friday totals, that's France usually deaths 2 days. See, you‚Äôre projecting *you* would safer home wife around 100 people. can‚Äôt that. ask average player, average age 26, less likely get virus not. You‚Äôre assuming young guys would stay home brother ain‚Äôt happening. accountable team. 

MLB didn‚Äôt bubble &amp; what, two outbreaks? close non-bubble success get. 

As $150,000 stipend? go take 90% pay cut say you‚Äôre still getting paid. disagree. 'The Unmasked' can't follow even simplest suggested safety guidelines, surely going snap attention suggested 6 ft revised even farther distance. 

If would simply currently suggested, personally, would love see, mess. people insist schools there's evidence it? september schools open, adults go back work. infections come according studies read. feel free share shows that's schools. think there's point. Maybe year. schools open point. think 3 months last year FULL year would help. that...I mean, obvious schools education centers they're essential daycare workers practically. 

The problem schools opening hygiene rules implemented. I'm hearing kids go wear masks. Kids careful (not lot adults are...but expect adults careful) touch lot things. Even Cascadia it‚Äôs going up, horrifying rates seen elsewhere moment. read it, wasn‚Äôt sure people flight got flight already flight. able tell able clarify me? Yeah. Go tell user post's comments tried minimize issue.

This pretty significant. Another second-hand casualty lockdowns school closures. undercount. mean everyone gonna get vaccine time. gotta transport apply billions people. That's gonna take time gonna prioritize frontline workers risk patients. good news. Well done guys. Hopefully get travel bubble open soon! flipped onto Fox briefly Bret B studio right normal show yeah, bailout comes, companies, ""essential workers"".

sad Exactly r/remindme 4 weeks US big country categorize entire Nation one ‚ÄòWave‚Äô. Epicentres fluctuated Nation States hit multiple waves. have, now, [1.098 ICU beds.
506 use COVID patients. 431 Exactly week ago 379 ICU COVID patients. We‚Äôll reach limit probably week unless either add ICU beds cut regular ICU care.

Yes, get capacity back up, takes time. meantime we‚Äôve got hospitals [outright refusing COVID also already [shut Emergency Departments Amsterdam, Rotterdam &amp; We‚Äôve got ambulances driving patients hospital hospital they‚Äôre admitted. [We‚Äôve got patients waiting ambulances front hospitals waiting take Belgian patients. barely take own. 1) Uhh, no? PreP users automatically high-risk. recommended MSM: group highest risk HIV sexual intercourse. Duh.

2) No. Again, PreP, automatically part high-risk group. take PreP risk HIV transmission sexual activities. enough research proving PreP users among high-risk groups safe blood donors.

3) Uhh part group individual factor influences risk. MSM group HIGHEST HIV risk US. say putting deferral group HIGHEST HIV risk wrong? changed 3 months SCIENCE EVIDENCE said 3 months safe. want ban totally removed implement individualized screening instead, need SCIENCE EVIDENCE supporting that. virus may kill you. That's Nursing home deaths added total count Tuesdays Fridays, exact 

So, days last 24hrs hospital deaths + 3 4 days nursing home deaths circle. Every turn corner. completely agree you. I'm AZ, huge spike summer send patients states treatment. also brought hundreds medical staff areas. almost everywhere surging time, situation worse everyone everywhere. help coming states, hospitals able transfer states. People halloween parties, people going sacrifice Thanksgiving Christmas traditions either. dread think bad get. said today. absolute shit show. possible students access internet, students parents available make sure they're actually attending class playing video games day.

EDIT: person edited post. That's reply make sense anymore. linked comment article claiming said picture officers (some horses) surrounding protesters saved national archives. Well context China SK homogeneous.

Culture obviously much bigger factor.

So guess right, race important. mistake. confirmed genomic sequencing then? go BNO's list reinfections. I'd donate sick time anemic. Oh well, maybe volunteer drive something. Why? already manufactured. ask new N95 KN mask every 24 hours. SANI CLOTH wipes reasonable supply. modified paint gun spray rooms ambulance antiviral Solution. lot staff already got hit hard months ago, isn‚Äôt lot fear here. Staff well COVID. Staff members families, much. Well masks subject human behavior. cannot relied on. Neither lockdowns. Humans gonna human. Compliance. compliance. Something Europe going change pointless. worth changing whole culture virus 99.5% people survive. happen get it. Yup. I'm trying tell folks think disappears March Mid January Mid-February going absolutely horrific time people seem want fool thinking everything's pretty good.

They realize right we're (Americans) experiencing surge first 3 weeks school 10 weeks school year even everything locked places still overrun another month.

And even hit Holidays yet. Dogs 'innocent bystanders' comes virus ... uh werent give break, covid19 denier anti mask family done right thing start. Children even get sick 99.9% okay, tiny fraction complications barely relevant. children hurt covid19. Check freaking privilege, glad none kids difficulties keep high ground morals bs.

99.9% ? source that? novel virus like take many years figure long term impacts humanity. 

You might American, American entitlement shining here. care needs regardless cost teachers health families health. 

Everyone trying adapt fluid situation here. Again, I'm sorry hear going through, everyone making sacrifices here. I've seeing people argue open schools (all countries, US) finally say something, baffling infuriating reading comments. 
(The people seem almost get real point, come close understanding actual problem actual solution - temporary bandaid solution - then, every time, end veer wrong direction. makes think Phoebe/Joey meme format I've seen kicking around.)

Schools open, virtual learning. Teachers babysitters, ever learning time lost made later. 

The point everyone seems missing every argument opening schools arguments BASIC LIVABLE WAGE EVERYONE. That's comes to. matter country live family situation, everyone around world would better (obviously) minimum livable wage offered everyone *would able handle situations like pandemic much better.*

Corporations/people control wages say possible, that's lie: comes corporations/people already way much money unwilling risk *slightly less money before*. 
That's it. 


So, think schools open trouble supporting yourself/you family kids home, instead blaming teachers closed schools, perhaps ask possible support family work do. (And that's even getting people forced work multiple jobs, *still* able support families.) Looking forward lining first vaccinated city. even tent, I'll get one occasion. That's going V-day equivalent generation. Here‚Äôs link nonpaywalled full article anyone can‚Äôt access worth read. almost ;) No, point ""cults"" ""tiny ass fraction"". yes, definitely think would strange 20% Koreans masks, including many evangelists, wears government homogeneous hive mind without opinions stuff. doctors health care professionals much. something politicians. come right regulations, disease stopped. course regs come health care professionals get enacted politicians may may listen them. think tests got better, got one definitely felt quickly. Define this. metric ‚Äúunder control‚Äù?

Is medical system overwhelmed cases? yes, virus Oh, numbers. abstracts.

See above. local/regional healthcare systems likely published numbers operational capacity regards virus. systems overloaded, whatever number is, control. numbers check, effort required. simple Careful, would want accused Enlightened.

More trolling logical fallacies. need confirmation, thank offering it. Sun trash, never believe anything say wife works hospital. department still plexiglass front desks deal 50-100 patients day. Patients also screened symptoms tested prior entry... welcome America.

Stay safe everyone, I'm afraid worst yet come Oh yea best friend works West Jet. Theyve laid Air Canada working smaller planes crew besides friend fly around North America(Canada US) literally packed like sardines people opting iPhone/Android coronavirus contact-tracing feature? know available states far -- seems like something that, widely adopted, could help play role flattening curve? 

People countries/states option -- going? traveling within country don‚Äôt think anyone frown upon that. mig exposed airplanes driving problem. know early stages people frowning upon seemed like could contained traveling doesn‚Äôt make much difference Yes it‚Äôs American problem. whole world major issues, besides countries, don‚Äôt Trump Kushner. me, felt like went whole cheek Still nowhere near bad minorities treated USA. link nothing lockdown. simply says people infected stay isolate 2 weeks beyond symptoms stopping slow spread. No: fellows care. got heads numbers inflated attack Trump. Trumpanzies country literally think virus hoax plot Donnie. fellow Americans think conspiracy invoked countries well. boring. What? ü§® Ahhhh must hard. worry, eventually get fireplace back! Considering big picture call lucky Imperial College‚Äôs vaccine also going 3rd world countries. said would try vaccinate people world, whatever country‚Äôs GDP cares wave in? There's much obsession number. We're shitty shape.... Period People told travel freely often incentivised undertake activities blamed.

Right, point people need held individually responsible, instead getting free pass someone high gave green light. governor gives terrible advice public health experts say bad idea, YOLO roll it, use brain make responsible choice.

The virus care governor mayor says. Oh business wrecked. Barely making ends meet months definitely localized waves spikes, different areas waves different times, there's really much value discussing wave country unless manage seriously reduce cases across whole country comes back later, something done.

Soo first wave.  we've never gotten control. Sorry say brick Friday BS canceled year top comment thread also gives terrifying insight whats going. incredibly sad. Best luck you. 

People honestly consider letting someone drive Germany point instead calling ambulance. top comment thread also gives terrifying insight whats going. incredibly sad. Best luck you. 

People honestly consider letting someone drive Germany point instead calling ambulance. LOL, mods ban shit here.

Ok...I feel like I'm living completely different Reddit everyone else. Deleted comments show fine, banned users keep posting. get it. using RES what's difference here? remember said back March couple weeks. Lol Americans won‚Äôt even use this. Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax etc going approved faster better Brainwashed. I'm Melbourne office workers office moment.

They drawing rules Covid Safe planned reopening offices I'm sure mask wearing mandatory.

Masks low cost, high reward virus reduction measure  Thats going mars soon Schools universities opened. Public transport crowded around universities students spread quickly. too. put travelling last year wanted add money take first half year off. Well didn‚Äôt work well I‚Äôve stuck flat four months.

I swear god get this, I‚Äôm booking one-way ticket travelling travelling travelling travelling. Never taking granted again. Op Fauci's fan smth? Trump cause this? Also, families parents work? leave kids? can't let stay home themselves, we? know whats really crazy? want talk breathing CO2, direct attention house. 


I CO2 monitor next computer sometimes reaches 2000ppm opening windows day two. Atmospheric CO2 levels 400ppm people begin cognitively affected CO2 1000ppm. 


Cram people house levels rise even faster. live modern airtight homes they're literally drowning CO2... house. mask. forget pandemic started winter Australia still managed keep control Same! alone sub! case everywhere. Students access internet legitimate issue need address. US aren‚Äôt going use this. They‚Äôll use Pfizer‚Äôs Moderna‚Äôs looking approved faster schools.

Ever see mold spreads contaminated loaf bread? first sign small, barely noticable. left unchecked quickly fills bag.

It's like children :( I‚Äôm public health nurse I‚Äôm trying mentally prepare whatever madness might come way next. false statement. messaged basically ""SARS back"". 

In case, knew new virus 31 Dec, Wuhan hospitals sent news new virus 30 Dec, Li's WeChat message also 30 Dec. still consider whistleblowing know. long hard road lockdown. Feels fucking amazing though. It‚Äôs even fastest vaccine, don‚Äôt worry elderly usually less mobile, less likely spread it. Medical personnel makes sense, high risk catching spreading it. witnessed spread colleges,young adults seem uniquely poised super-spreaders. Targeting super-spreaders would seem likely slow spread fastest. 

/ means young, benefit. also already COVID. least wait winter holidays things start warming again. 

I wonder shift school year go summer safer. Ahh ok full capacity plane different proposition. post referring domestic travel assuming empty planes, didn‚Äôt realize still packed. one longest parts trials waiting see people get infected not.

That fairly important part vaccine trials though lol. yeah I‚Äôm also hoping helps society better realize critically important vaccines government biomedical industry continue streamline processes allocate resources accordingly. priority getting schools could help spread virus getting students internet access? lockdown border control got control. One fairly useless without other. arrogant ignorant look place employed successful strategy, say 'nah that's us, we're gonna keep going way we're going, continue fail spectacularly ' tell it‚Äôs ‚Äúliterally giving single shit whole thing‚Äù approach handling virus. People everything wasn‚Äôt fucking pandemic get bill it. Zero surprises here. going finally admit virus spread wildlife meme slogans 'wear mask socially distance' end pandemic? Great!! love moon cakes pretty hanfus Good point.. well, like dogs, us innocent. really see smart people ruining world ? smart vs dumb.. dumb going win sadly  someone help understand exactly immunoresponse tested? dont inject test subjects virus presume feel like though people fatigued, plenty still enough right behaviors (where live least) keep things safer (though numbers rising too).
Feeling fatigued doesn‚Äôt make someone selfish. behaviors choose determines selfish not.
I‚Äôm fatigued trying hang there. don‚Äôt think anyone know isn‚Äôt fatigued. people know adhering guidelines pretty well. Even aren‚Äôt, don‚Äôt feel like shamed much, least me.
But people really throwing caution wind. things like big, maskless parties without distancing (and ones know liberal‚Äîso it‚Äôs political thing), definitely allowed live right now. cases like that, I‚Äôm going call spade spade. Selfish selfish does.

Edit: accidentally hit send early American vaccines like Pfizer‚Äôs ahead UK‚Äôs (Oxford Imperial College) *better vaccines*. Why? Trump, lawyer, top cabinet members say exact things?

For anyone believes followers stupid enough believe nonsense, might want check MUCH injectible bleach fake church FL selling comments. tough good knows. usually talk terms needs say need feel safe. little bit difficult work environment sounds like getting resolution THIS. really sad see people privilege WFH pit people working person. heard people state ""associate"" WFHers badge honor rather privilege. profession pays well well-respected, working person, wear mask 8+ hours per day, risk exposure due people come contact with. makes mad hear people basically ostracizing people like option luxury WFH. share sentiment. *whatever* reason, seems like sub down-in-the-dumpsy usual lately. Yeah cni uk worsens grade v 65 die, wont put machine. live years problem even maybe get old old renal tx. Thats like living working :-) lockdowns follow expert guidelines. live Florida... what's insane Desantis moderately effective beginning ordered lockdown phased re-opening. However, clear things way worse now, assume similar, stringent responses put place.

Au contraire! No, God wants us care creation neighbors. People ignore science say ""it's old people"" regarding virus ""that's future generations' problem"" climate change following Jesus read bible. know effectiveness vaccine yet. doubt 100%. think likely virus around long time. developed countries, would $0 Agree disagree. Haha Poland goes brrrrr Intuitively plausible bottleneck manufacturing. Transporting applying enough capacity get done 3 months. feel much way, horrible. 
My family 5 careful possible; curbside pick groceries, go restaurants, send kids back school person, we've met one friend (and outdoors, distanced wore masks). go places, outdoor places, wear masks keep distance everyone. Meanwhile, see people know behaving though pandemic, numbers rising predicted. feels pretty hopeless. 
I know we're right things, we'll continue, unfortunately many people they're going make things worse everyone. somehow seem proud ""refusing live fear"" like say. lies problem

This whole fiasco could stopped china. How? Shut China way rest world shut down. GIVE ton money china offset losses. Virus stays contained there. 

&amp;nbsp;

THen spreads month two, people bored. Conservative governments around world (russia, usa, brazil, others) prefer people get sick like common cold continue lives. 

It would easy say, ""hey, we're gonna lock 2 months inside. wear masks/protection/clean hands. 2 months isolation everyone past it, start opening stuff safety measures like masks, distancing, cleaning"". nah. Gotta make survival political. also depends ton school. lot Chicago schools overfilled crowded pandemic. 

I'm sure small schools safely open somewhere, case Chicago public schools. 

I knew kids sit floor bus crowded. Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine even sooner, they‚Äôre seeking approval November They're trying edgy calling America third world inference. incredibly selfish you. Yeah. going get back point except maybe little bit organized. fast. giving new year Eh, Europe generally lower virus transmission per capita throughout Summer USA did. Death rates USA also higher death rates EU time period too. 

Europe really ramped past weeks, though. I'm telling you, March, I'm this. I'm living one year lockdown. like British side. New Yorkers visit London (and still quarantine 14 days get back, like now), Brits can't visit NY. understanding one consider wave local cases country period time (a day least?). case U.S. line, considering poor U.S. response pandemic been. works works. they'll buy licenses someone else make it. hard make sorts vaccines they'll make one shit too. using numbers estimated loss would 39 million beyond normal death rate, unfortunately estimated IFR seem match official sources likely number higher take account extra deaths resulting overwhelmed hospitals, would raise death rate even higher since heart attacks could survived deadly State Australia gotta admit fully understand meant. actually said beds ""uncarable"" like can't cared for. also said one Germany going without ICU bed. must resource allocation. probably serve 30000 plus 10000 reserve beds high cost.

And new workers probably can't made one summer. think crisis they'll reconsider strategies. Right, Japan tested like 2% population knows. Regardless, unless massive hidden excess deaths Covid deaths least areas high Covid transmission. evangelicals Korea protesting COVID measures source multiple outbreaks specifically offshoot cult, namely Shincheonji Church Jesus. 300,000 members, .006% population. even close Belgium.

7 days average Belgium terms France population 78.000 cases 300 deaths per day.

France 34.500 (cases) 183 (deaths).

Data yesterday. Ah. talking five particular. (maybe all? Idk) US, numbers remain much higher dealt March/April. It‚Äôs wild see much people stopped caring. practice following protocol, okay. masks times unless child actively worked on, temps checked coming in, etc. 

oral health important, even pandemic. child pain even potential cavities aren‚Äôt painful, schedule appt dentist. 

can explain mean saying look bad? PM you‚Äôd like. combination American exceptionalism people loathe, hate despise America. Toss Trump hate brew mix up. US definitely handling things well think anyone would say otherwise. lot countries bad. 1st wave enough convince start ""prepping "". months enough food /supplies last 2 months without leaving house, also enough gear leave city need be. Damn. problem. Correct I‚Äôm wrong, isn‚Äôt US million tests day now? Wouldn‚Äôt enough catch 200,000 cases (not saying 200k cases good thing, trying wrap head around math) Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

You think people say ""I'll get vaccine I'll go care anymore"". ""tired"". selfish Oh starting too. NY already locking parts Brooklyn NJ already seeing second wave reporting 1K-2K cases daily going Europe's #1 close race. Italy thought might next biggest black horse ever comeback fucks sake...did polish government live rock last 6 months?

everybody knew happen autum winter, seems prepare all! buy that. face covering helps lowers viral load. manufacture non medical face coverings paper towels, bandanas. One make face sheild 2L coke bottle. clear message back then: ""Don't wear mask"" ""It necessary"".

It would much easier tell truth: ""Our healthcare workers need medical grade face masks, ample time prepare reason. shortage, still face covering helps"" Wear mask become available stores, wear non medical face covering. Add eye protection additional measure.

Why lie critical time widespread community transmission? Agreed, let frontline workers first. end August. Already every ~3rd person wearing mask grocery stores, staff included (were running around stores without mask). Nobody cared. left ASAP business finished glad back Germany. Lol we're topic asking Germany help. Could guys send army again. time it'll liberating mission. click ""Good News"" flair sub, couple good ones today: 

**Oxford vaccine 'will ready Christmas' says professor leading project** **Oxford COVID-19 vaccine prompts immune response among adults old young, AstraZeneca says** **Australia's COVID-19 epicentre reports zero daily cases first time four months** Healthcare allocation national level problem - way national government going allow EU that. Yeah MIL retirement like 1600 zt month. maybe pouring unlimited money vaccine trial leads fast results? Increase cases Massachusetts? that's Midwest South. Indeed. What? Right CDC recommending 10 days onset symptoms people less severe case, providing 24 hours fever (and need fever reducers) symptoms improved think it‚Äôs fair say close normal around springtime 

We‚Äôre weeks away vaccine

Regeneron treatment awaiting approval 

Don‚Äôt read sub much. LOT people want last long next year reason. It‚Äôs depressing sub. Dont think they‚Äôll it. oh good [post El Paso issuing stay home order due hospitals capacity?] found linked post. contact tracing shit. certain segment population listen rules kept huge indoor gatherings, tracing pick community transmission late. 

It come long way seems good.

Just last week, segment population listen rules, again, caused another outbreak, again. time 39 cases instead 20,000 dont ""shut down"" economy, certainly limit large gatherings, seating inside restaurants, close bars etc. Curbs birthday parties get togethers home. Also play dates involving multiple families. inside without masks. school least take precautions. Germany least. I‚Äôm far location article could different across border. think argument made two-fold: 

1) players safer virus team structure season? team structure they‚Äôre getting daily testing, distancing &amp; know need stay virus free order finish season. also don‚Äôt know Armstead contracted virus part team activities normal life summer. 

2) many said along football players want play. They‚Äôre strange breed already playing sport risking proven long-term health complications. love &amp; it‚Äôs job. Plus, cancelled football due outlier health concerns would cancelled long ago. People died playing, practicing, training - mention serious long-term injuries. pretty low list tbh 10 days symptoms begin least 24 hours fever-free CDC guidelines. That‚Äôs 56% increase

But sure, wanna take silver living, means lot Americans don‚Äôt care... lot us Oui lorrain. Les f√™tards passent au filtre de la s√©lection naturel ;) cela fit longtemps quon en pas eu ici :) Fais gaffe au gens trops sociables, ils semblerait que le covid comme d'autres peut manipuler lhumeur &amp; pousser plus de sociabilit√© pour se diffuser (si besoin je peux trouver la reference de recherche) Virus naming political, that's why. name changed like 4 times tried name multiple viruses SARS 2 want insult Asia. mixture school home possibility, keeping kids stay home home drastically cut spread. Yeah 700zt like half month income lots people Link it. logistics 70% alone might practical.

It works million doses administered per month.

I think they'd door-to-door campaign. many among us right mind days? üòú


jk: knows why: must involve money somehow Got source? I‚Äôve seen nothing suicides increasing. turns out, imaginary friends good crafting policy. percentage decreasing, even number deaths rises Maybe adults worn masks, followed social distancing worked home possible allow schools remain reopened. donated last week awaiting antibody test. true. barely enter thread anymore apart getting daily numbers. needs global mandate. masks, service. ignorance deal daily trumps America. country crumbling. could predicted unforeseeable turn events? /S right ridiculous even debate. Unfortunately many stupid people need babysitting 7 months it‚Äôs hard get tempted. I‚Äôm guilty this. 7 months basically stuck inside wife 2 year old, sounds like heaven go somewhere, ANYWHERE, couple hours fun. It‚Äôs hard get little laxed haven‚Äôt experienced consequences. Dumb?? Yes. Unusual tempted? No. Part really people cannot afford stop working. Especially approaching vast majority folks losing UI December. rent relief, utility relief, loan relief. Food banks incredibly long lines. Programs charities help people running dry guess what, people gotta work. cousin Staten Island wedding NJ Halloween night, apparently may still inside. It‚Äôs absurd given current climate haven‚Äôt postponed (again, supposed April). wife daughter won‚Äôt going. 

I‚Äôm NYC take seriously. reason dine small gatherings (outdoors course) work put early on. still insist wedding, it‚Äôs unconscionable me. there‚Äôs vaccine. wave wave. I‚Äôm thinking late 2021 early 2022 calms down. lack better words, put back wack? rehab restore it? first 18 months 2020 felt like forever, going survive next 35 years 2020s? feel really fucking bad el pasoans trying stay safe responsible fucking dumbshits like around still get infected. What's worse? SCOTUS going repeal ACA starting November 10th. Preexisting conditions protections? shit's gone.

This country fucking barbaric. ‚ÄúDid hear Texas?‚Äù right take - orange fuckface might suggest even loaded Republican congress change election day One family three clients. work daughter developmental issues afraid masks. mom developmental issue well can‚Äôt virtual visits. client agreed two visits month. 

The others live house. 

No ones perfect ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Texas Obama would tried appease Republicans ended weak national plan. 

Don't get wrong, nearly bad Trump's actual plan (that actively encouraged spread virus)... 

...but Obama administration's obsession (ridiculously terrible) *West Wing* ideal would led always did: start middle position end right negotiating Republicans.

Appeasement. work 80 years ago, work now. Trust me, make worse drinking even vodka.

It's better stop late never. Amen sermon let‚Äôs keep preaching! friend fallen pseudoscience bullshit instead taking time simple Wikipedia search. honestly don‚Äôt feel bad single one them. Peace wondering El Paso huge amount cases per capita compared rest state according articles Ciudad Ju√°rez (the border town next El Paso Mexico) surge couple weeks ago. know border process right (as come go proper ID like COVID turning people away) seems like surge spilling over. fair bit people work either side brought back/brought over. badass dude... grow want like you... Oh wait, grow yet. QLD also cases couple breakouts. 

Lockdown gets numbers down, Test Trace keeps down. contribute trump wins election. big club ain't it. number deaths increasing well. keep taking owning home like great accomplishment? I'm willing bet us homes, yet one oddly mentions every comment. special. Stay NY. Glad humanities side virus‚Äôs lockdown

What real lockdown?

Get shot walking outside? sure entirely free. ambulance ride hospital Ontario costs $45. sure helicopter transport would cost, can't imagine ""free"" Ohio probably building too. 

I've following Texas family there. least they're FINALLY starting *something*. I've also seen articles Utah Wisconsin. sad situation. I've never heard donate mono. can't active case fine recovered. war nazis different pandemic invisible enemy. become distrustful neighbors fellow Americans could harboring virus/enemy. enforceable help. nephew works fast food joint 10 people infected there, friend works restaurant 8 people infected there, lot friends work non essential jobs like work infected. So, unless actually shut non essential places wont matter Third wave? think US got first wave... Yeah there's those.

No astroturfing happening all... ‚ÄúWe rounding turn‚Äù

-Donald J Trump, Sep 3rd, 2020 countries general. stopped pointing earlier good resources allocation etc. Yeah whole point thread making that's enough. exactly calling ""locked down""? parents reckless stupid I'd never see again. time election someone explain logic? Ban hydroxy much. approve also much... Scientists saying helpful. approved? agree this. US HUGE, one small region getting hit really hard count wave country whole?

That said, definitely specific areas seeing legitimate 2nd wave. West Texas DFW come mind.  first transferred neonatal transfer team nicu nearby city, spent 3 weeks there. Never saw bill either need recovered it. can't people infected anyone get infected

*points finger head* Well that‚Äôs good work.

""Lockdown forever"" stategy.  late stop COVID-19, yes. late stop people voting key area Biden. never understand people say thought real. mean? thought virus didn‚Äôt exist? wasn‚Äôt dangerous? I'm betting connected dots someone wrestling logically sort hoax last 6 months. Lol. I'll drink that! Well done Victoria!

Tasmanian here. tough road poor bastards good see good coming it. How's Laredo doing? Mexico general? Stay safe ya'll. going finally admit spread virus masks social distancing, going try pick apart something obscure French culture anecdotes explain sudden rise?

Love 'oh French people kissing'. really splitting hairs now. Especially since conflicting anecdotes widespread is, whether evidence suggest reason spread. No. mistake thinking opponents rational. Last time El Paso, able tell bad area bars third floor windows even though balcony roof underneath.

It right near tram thing mountain, went looked city, rocks almost green one little park / cemetery (not sure).

We went hole wall Greek place basically like Grandpa opened kitchen would shame eating lots tell kids wanted premium juice baklava. like Greek grandpa expensive. Fantastic. got bill ambulance trip hospital child... $50 . likely methotrexate polls, almost like planned. yea change it, killing people sending there.

Just pointing angry someone already fixed issue others much get hate people don‚Äôt agree everything say need safe space talk without objected...

Uh... think projecting bit bro... sure sure Hillary 95% sure win 2016 then..... country longer one willingly suffered rationed showed temperance lifestyles short-term necessary WW1 WW2, secure long-term positive outcome. better outcome ourselves, families, friends, neighbors, country.

Fauci advises masks social distancing 2022 earliest estimation. That's next entire election cycle. I'm sure estimation tentative, unless vaccine really go beyond expectations, can't imagine 2022 estimation quickly turn 2023, 2024... Nutmeg holiday spice, I'm making joke said winter fun Phoenix still 5th populous city including Mesa, tempe, gilbert, glendale, etc. Phoenix seriously huge. Heyyyy nice see r/all. know r/austin lol. Thanks data always! great visualizations! 

An interesting (though likely overly busy) view would hospital beds/ICU beds active new cases overlayed. Seeing case numbers real time would likely serve bit predictor hospital ICU capacity numbers look like days/weeks later (as see new cases rise, see hospital beds ride days after. Since new cases record levels, could seeing ICU numbers reach limits soon.) Bloody hell. Take care everyone. least hope wake call anyone doubts legitimacy severity virus.  Definitely last city locking coming weeks. city live (Kansas City) really going lockdown prevent us becoming like El Paso. Metro hospitals already turn people away ICU capacity COVID patients. happen though...and get bad.. people non-COVID releated emergencies supposed go? widespread transmission best avoided.

Edit: Nevermind people need non-urgent procedures. Things going get done hospitals full things like COVID. knee operations hip replacements, even things like chemo impacted. Third wave? Feels like second best. So, deduced possible root causes yet? dealing anti-science arrogance? Unbelieving stubbornness? evidence making up? Ha, course were. didn‚Äôt think rando downplaying pandemic would giving facts. could've possibly seen coming... unfortunately mean much unless enforced fine basically doubling amount time spent lockdown?

Fuck that. Leave reddit fine socializing year half. stab foot though? Right, North Dakota densely populated.  ""In light El Paso's shut down, hereby banning El Paso voting, would disobey shut order.

Shits fucked. know.

There's reason can't figure something out. Children generally affected coronavirus. Less kids died since pandemic started die every year 4 months flu. think state Illinois, 7 people age 20 died, almost all, all, 15-20 range. serious pandemic, really children, largely less infected less prone getting sick serious infection. good news think focus week?

Also yikes test positivity rate. single digits long ago Got high hopes one. far public schools concerned paying prices decades underfunding. district fairly well even excuse. I‚Äôve got dominos speed dial. I‚Äôm part! Remote school (is) total shit show. Granted, somehow managed organize lot short time (is) far perfect. Total chaos terms online tools (lessons received email, Google Docs, special platforms), much material cover kids (or help parents, technically working remotely) uncertainty final exams (those idiots ministry education postponing decision whether hold move exams last moment). mention still many children vulnerable groups without sufficient resources even participate lessons.

But school year ended somehow, miraculously. government do? start preparations autumn new spike cases? come plan to, know, create single platform, train teachers, equip schools children? Nope. ""important"" topics agenda running hate campaign LGBTQ+ community. clear fucked every front, decided move public's attention something else. subject choice? Shitting women's rights. Again. neither. See recent example Australia Still fighting right wear masks forcing kids go school claiming covid hoax. disgusting. got 6 upvotes, post got equal number downvotes. 

Do hear flapping dickie? it‚Äôs not, severity average COVID-19 infection determines dangerous overall, that‚Äôs flu (which currently analogous COVID-19 may vaccine rollout) isn‚Äôt considered dangerous despite fact fully capable causing fatal complications. sounds like NYC back March. crazy we're back again. preventable. make worse drinking hand sanitizer 70% alcohol.... like giving power cleaning insides. won‚Äôt. lot hoax. President Orange openly stating it‚Äôll disappear Nov 4th. EU 'The United States Europe', meant be. (Although admittedly people want be) lucky! Sure. know children work üòâ think moment we, like everyone, make best situation, like miserable time (or always showing were). do, trying get kids school work day often working evenings/nights also work do. just, looking back now, realize couple things:

* School much learning excelling.

I would take youngest bed night nights would ask would going daycare next day (""No honey, still closed"") name friends much missed them. Hearing broke heart made realize there's certain things parent cannot give them. Kids need kids too! Closing world 9 months sure ruined lives. aren‚Äôt important, covid is, right?

Agreed! countries already widespread community transmission.

Did intentionally ignore part quote? 100% correct. Closing border nothing already transmission *within* community. 

The US closed borders back march april. #1 cases deaths. reiterate said again, demonstrably factual; closing borders **when already widespread community transmission** work. 

Go away now, clearly reading comments want strawman them. Neither us especially prone colds. Maybe every third year we'll get cough, stuffed nose, sore throat etc. day asleep usually sorts out.

This different. fatigue inability concentrate incredible. I've periods watching Netflix impossible. senses smell taste nonexistent. (It looks like husband's way well.) want jinx us, body aches headache seem less severe today temps around 100 (as opposed 101-102).

Seriously need perspective think taking friends crazy time! many places. Madrid April using ice skating hall store bodies. True, shaming conspiracy theorists pushes deeper conspiracy theories. pretty well Canada, actually, thanks.

When comes per capita deaths, Canada currently 38th worst world. 217 countries.

But guess think 189 countries better lying numbers.

Honestly, it‚Äôs skin ass want substitute jingoism reality. You‚Äôre one who‚Äôs deceived.

Doesn't sound wrong all.

I hope get vaccine spring, entire covid-winter get through. ""just"" need get May. 6 months. Especially halloween... mean definitely good know. 

But also, vaccine/reliable treatments like flu. Exactly. arguably safer, oh also love earn paycheck. Italy positive rate 21% considering number people tested, instead swabs used socialist.

Real glad drinks I‚Äôve ever liked I‚Äôve never one drugs. Wish could say friends ya, uptick common it‚Äôs basically joke long, funny one. think safe say, entirely know going on. work Air Medical industry, would surprised. We're governmental agency, perform 5,000 transports year.

We tax funder supported, instead rely purely revenue. charge middle road rates operate 10 bases 2 states. cover costs perform 5 million year charity care. also offer air medical membership covers bill insurance, required insurance get it.

The big costs are:

1. Aircraft; maintenance, pilots, safety training, modification interior support ICU equipment, fuel. Fixed Base Operation costs include hangar living quarters, medication storage, etc. forget Isolette beds neonates, LifePaks defibrillation, Hamilton ventilators ECMO circuits, list goes on.
2. Highly trained flight staff base make $100K\~ peak make \~$200K. going market rate, fact many staff take *cut* pay work us, could better ER ICU specialty NICU.
3. Running 24x7x365 shop means keep Communication Center, bases &amp; staff support personnel online day, every day, year. someone calls sick 24 hour shift, need fill it, might end paying double time so.

Finally, one one metric air medical transport:

Mileage.

Whether ventilate patient, run ECMO simply package interfacility one location another thing get paid mileage.

Finally, remember beholden problems people have: payer mix.

Commercial pays best, Medicare Medicaid mixed bag. receive balloon payment end-of-year governmental patients, diminished payer rates.

Ambulance Air Medical rates remained stagnant 20 years federal government tried shift cost onto states; unfortunately many programs state run end becoming privatized semi-privatized.

We advantage governmental still operate like non-profit.

It's say money - - complicated fixed costs quickly diminish reserves can't fly; example, year's wildfires wiped 2-3 months reserves put aside. year cash hand easy go right circumstances.

During covid-19 operations transport medium high risk payment scrub aircraft occur flight, crews spent 3 hours transit hour handing patient followed another hour charting pulled spend hour scrubbing aircraft. incredibly rewarding also incredibly exhausting work, can't wait put 2020 rearview mirror. Actually. Yea, right. swear even think like that. Valid point though Thank you, guess well. decided look USA/UK (plus individual states/countries) comparing right now, anyone interested. 

[From UK quite lot new cases past week, deaths same. 

The testing data less reliable, that, UK testing quite bit more. However, UK also higher positivity rating 1%, even adjusting testing UK still seeing cases. instructional comment pray nobody use. hope feeling better! &lt;3  Hahahahaha.

[http://www.epcounty.com/documents/Order-No-12.pdf](http://www.epcounty.com/documents/Order-No-12.pdf) Hey man. Thanks trying. notice April publish date, definitely caused raise eyebrow. I'm guessing studies covid-specific enough. know economy able go theatre see live music long 2030s. Swedish follow news directly Swedish sources, yes aware debate policys Swedish elderly care. also worked Swedish nursing homes five years (not corona though).

 hand confuse things. even get adequete medical care is. Yet make bold claims Sweden letting elderly die corona strategy. OC said: epidemiology coronaviruses change colder weather. Fall winter respiratory pathogens spread most. Good luck everyday medical problems. wonder we'll euthanize ones can't save instead sending anywhere, way Sweden alleged done. Nothing suspicious /s Letting spread control seemingly see health systems collapse.

These idiots obsessed herd immunity thru infection seem get hospitals cope masses people needing specialist care. depends country fuck there? Ridiculous numbers population size government stopped putting caps focus costs (or however it, know pricing whatever hospital wants charge, thought set standard prices); insurance companies may telling people get vaccine. allowed drop people refuse, even raise prices, least pressure them.

IMO, insurance companies able add extra charge people unvaccinated non-medical reasons. FDA absolutely infuriating dark ages. helps, FDA changed rules 3 months, 12 now... even that! Like oh, okay fuck monogamous gay relationship, right?

(Sorry stuff infuriates - temporarily disregard username) Ugh, many comments accusing Mexicans illegally immigrating America ""superior health care"".

No country wants come America health care. think even really testing flu much. code ERs see covid tests occasional strep test. Maybe still early flu season testing ramp coming months person comes flu like symptoms gets tested covid negative, think safe say missing flu cases. Mtl, Canada pretty sure hospitals always capacity lol guys alright  think lockdowns meant bring case numbers better managed extensive testing tracing. yeah, without second part, case numbers inevitably rise again. surprised people disregard curfew also generally compliance anti virus measures.

Every chance punish type people win book. FDA announced relaxing restrictions gay men allowed donate blood, light coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Instead 1 year, male sex another male, need wait 3 months donate There‚Äôs conspiracy here. locked down. quarantined. masked up. yet cases exploding. Care explain? many open spaces US, Canada another level entirely. larger land area one tenth population. Perhaps single digit low double digit new daily cases per country. US never even gotten close Couldn‚Äôt many ‚Äúnew‚Äù infections reinfections asymptomatic people ruled way? Another thing covered free Canada. heard before. Sure, college sports ingrained American culture, going change anytime soon.  Juarez one dangerous cities world highly doubt American expats would move Americans stupid? late? Yes

better waiting longer? also yes. Yeah really shocked one bdubs takeout whether asymptomatic not. everyone infect get ill, young, old, infirm, athletically healthy. Pay attention, matter. 

That's danger, that's problem. Selfish people like giving good god damn others fact kill someone (or likely cripple someone debilitating illnesses onset covid19 they're getting handle eight months later despite everything that's going on) selfish people want wear mask somehow become stupid ass political statement. 

Get think others. thing damn flu. People visit grandparents they're sick flu could give them. flu. even virus. coronavirus learned much affecting people based genetics, preexisting conditions environment. 

Just take look funeral home obituaries wherever live. Look back year. take look time frame past years. need go back far see pattern. Excess deaths roof. take word it, look yourself. 

Get think others. Hey man, party serving natty ice know right lol. US never got first wave, simmered spiked poor control.

If US ever gets first wave control bet real second wave would even worse  Yeah brought map El Paso surprised dense city is. whole area looks incredibly bleak that's coming someone lives Phoenix lmao Second hand smoke kills, drink driving kills, overloaded health system kills pricing people taking hospital resources. feel like going ""disappear"" one day measures place nationwide prevent post-election surge like happened Malaysia? People dying man. Give rest Wow showed me!

Trump wore mask! 0 deaths fault!


[Wait Whitmer changed policy many times since then, mean none deaths $17,000 family member run car ¬°¬°¬°AMERICA NUMERO UNO YESSS AMERICA AMERICA NUMERO UNOOO!!! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üéâüéâüéâüéâ Finally look like Cyrax Mortal Kombat. Sadly think people first foremost focus things affecting them. 

I'm WFH'ing I'll admit enjoy first. often think worst part crisis affects people totally unbalanced arbitrary ways. I'm sure I'm often thinking this, others too. understand must feel. wish best.  game change people keep playing. Third party way change anything. two parties never change current system ceding power. 

""But Trump literally apocalypse!""

Sure, vote out, taken opportunity change system. instead we've doubled ""Blue matter who"", we'll elect Biden world praising sun things back normal, completely forgetting ""normal"" disgraceful disregard human welfare societal improvement.

We'll right back teetering poverty, paying insurance one afford use, trillions student debt college system concerned sports funding tuition hikes kind lasting compounding exploration academics.

But got rid Trump, everyone welcome old story open arms. 8 years later boogeyman comes back fight reds again. cycle continue. fighting nothing change push passed partisan lies address class war.

There never opportune time vote third, enough people willing risk letting one sides win bring another party power tip scales. Within one year someone going leak videos Chinas plague pits/mass graves Beautiful Maybe underground tunnel alternatives? cases skyrocketing US couple months ago, several news stories Europeans smugly believing beaten back virus.

Now shoe foot again, I‚Äôm seeing Americans gloating. Let‚Äôs see US weeks. womb it‚Äôs got go. confuse 'flaunt' 'flout' often dictionary includes 'flout' second definition 'flaunt'.

Languages constantly evolving. widespread improper use word change definition word. assume language rules definitions rigid, right. they're rigid. see explanation, implication they're attributed covid-19 way even still downward trajectory. uptick. sure others. And, preempt misinformation spread, **economic downturns always hit urban working poor hardest, areas particularly hard hit.**

Look demographics. Minorities getting slammed everywhere proper elimination/eradication lock started August 2nd. Time wasted partial ""curve flattening"" measures. timer starts hard proper lock starts, partial measures make progress towards elimination. fact don‚Äôt cooperate contact tracer U.S. huge hurdle though.

The fact many people lying contact tracers seems like huge issue, think would bring major protest minority prefers freedom security situation.

I think majority country held hostage minority can't think beyond needs TBH. playing soccer. He's 5. fired guy refusing doctor numbers? get source this?

Taken fact though, that's hilarious considering numbers still terrible.

Edit: imagine downvoting asking question source coronavirus subreddit. lower death rate ""2nd wave"" certainly encouraging. think shows evidence doctors nurses learned lot point gotten much better treating keeping people alive long enough beat it.

But think ability keep death rate limited resources like hospital capacity, # beds, # doctors. Even they've gotten better handling it, # new cases per day gets 100,000 stays consistently winter, think we'll see death rate spike simply hospitals completely overwhelmed.

The secondary frightening consequence hospitals overwhelmed, we'll see lot people getting really sick dying preventable things get treated COVID patients.

Your context certainly important, I'm going optimistic see evidence us getting national plan get control... I'm holding breath. Drug resistant mean drug proof. compromised supply chain affects drugs. Guaranteed it‚Äôll 100k November. 200k January!? (after Christmas wave starts) look last two months, unemployment rate technically went down. However, New York unemployment rate still significantly higher Florida‚Äôs. swear god, u/nythro one hysterical spreaders misinformation entire Internet. Sweden: Incompetent guv, competent people.

East Asian nations + New Zealand: Competent guv, competent people.

Southern Europe: Competent guv, incompetent people.

Murica, Brazil: Incompetent guv, incompetent people.

At least Swedish people die poor pay treatment. Man people France dumb. cliff 18 months, it'll slow history guide Failure take significant measures early leads taking drastic ones late.

The virus puts many people hospital ""deal with"" ""live with."" medical system always buckles. gave blood got free antibody test. think pretty standard donations now. little extra perk donating. Yet Victoria still hundreds protesting lockdowns calling Daniel Andrews locked up. Absolutely shameful.

I one understand purpose lockdown thankfuk know countries optimistic stage, tell, worked! Okay think that, please go violating lockdowns pet conspiracy theories.

The rest us going trust data science tells us work intended purpose. Neither I. herd mentality 
/s We‚Äôll agree disagree. 

I think courts made clear government cannot call passive activity money exchanged commerce. 

I also disagree handing tickets wearing masks right important working human trafficking, counter-terrorism, serial killers, organized crime, cyber crime. Right on!

Campaign promise kept- heartily sick ‚Äúwinning‚Äù still requiring mask removal tongue temperature check( thermal scan entry.) Making people take masks breath face foot away red cross employee idiotic. held breath(and subsequently sent heart rate level almost give.)Without n95, recommend donating long stupid this. Also, snack area canteen precovd. God sake let people take cookies sit car instead eating drinking maskless room everyone. Spoiler: don‚Äôt third wave???

Safety goggles swimming goggles look silly offer great protection easily disinfected &lt;0.5% travellers Taiwan tested positive overseas (mostly Philippines Japan) since June. That's within margin error, false positive always possibility. Name country Asia/Oceania say for. say lockdowns might work, otherwise can‚Äôt rule different countries varying levels preexisting immunity real reason deaths low. 

If can‚Äôt maybe ask one specific region better rest. _maybe_ tourism, hurt West?

Export economies.

We export countries fucked. get virus sorted, they'll continue fucked sell less goods, hurting economies. Corona lock round 2 yeet yeet bang bang woot woot yay hooray oh fun joy Remind 6 weeks. - remind 3 months. Oh yeah, that‚Äôll fuck good. I‚Äôd probably done half litre. True, would still look bit funny us context. native speaker would likely write ""labs working 24/7"" expand ""labs working 24 hours day"".

Hope helps :) 120¬£ antigen test, validated asymptomatic carriers. worthless. sounds like effort vain... Arrivals seed infections. China still reports tens imported cases every day found quarantine borders. 12 months+ anyone know coughing lipids keep disease alone longer surfaces? *DO GIVE CHEESE?* places won‚Äôt need testing capabilities since don‚Äôt let deadly plagues world often. 

The national reporting system didn‚Äôt record cases 20th January. local governments. attempt isolate would require world full knowledge happening basically soon happens, days weeks later... also reporting reach officials country real report, retrofitting middle-kingdom narrative damage control. Imagina critical days events could canceled lunar new years. Instead, global pandemic result.   still lots movement lots business still open got aged care system thousands vulnerable people higher risk contracting average person. think revealing part corporate America look long-term.

You'd think major businesses would realize ""okay, hunker HARD, we'll take bad hit first month two, we'll rolling again,"" didn't. likely, couldn't. saw airlines, seems can't actually survive savings accounts.

With way things going, really terrible feeling end. new normal, people something immensely simple. Abbott probably block plans lock city too. apparently Texas Republicans longer give shit government rights...watching fight Judge Clay Jenkins Abbott exhausting earlier year. one could get 3 generations transmission without anyone showing symptoms. speculated due colder weather. 

The also one foreigner tested positive Taiwan Taiwan test fly back Europe. 
Taiwan far fewer tests, people still wearing masks speculated decrease viral likely community spread low symptons. Happy hear it‚Äôs low. sure strict then! gotta hope COVID start acting like Spanish Flu. really need say that? God time ago bleach ""piss up"" British drinking bros. top think two rural counties lifted mask requirements past month despite rising cases. It‚Äôs seriously concerning think he's optimistic. I'm skeptical whether knows logistics rolling vaccine work. Professors tend great R&amp;D, fall short everything else (not fault, one capacity everything). Considering daily cases 0-10, tell me? It‚Äôs worse flu, Bill Gates give everyone mark beast vaccine, masks lockdowns sign civil liberties systematically taken away, Trump good job country almost recovered covid already, etc. Occasionally it‚Äôs someone actually thinks covid doesn‚Äôt exist all, usually it‚Äôs combination previously mentioned items Sorry facts interrupted circle jerk. Lots places struggling right now. hand many island nations Europe could done that, like Malta, Ireland UK, Iceland another example island nation side world managed well.

It indeed freedom movement EU made pandemic worse, sucks say ""europeanist"" person. introduce spike protein don‚Äôt see that‚Äôs possible. concern inactivated virus type vaccine. Donated two weeks ago. Couldn‚Äôt easier safer; seeing get excited blood type worth trip (I‚Äôm ~1% population). yes, screen blood everything (incl. COVID), KNOW you‚Äôre good several levels. 

Side note: dude 211th donation: heroes don‚Äôt wear capes. immunity = lower R0 value. 80% would make spread managable.

It's 100% 0% biggest problem constitutional issue all. Since child local shops ""no shirt, shoes, service"" signs. need wear pants/shorts/dresses. must drive correct side road stop stop signs. Etc.

I think thing would constitutional issue would limiting state state travel, like guys did. long road effective steps could taken would help.

I dumbfounded are. like misinformation tribal thinking spread faster virus itself. really feel like people programed via social media.....I know sounds crazy.... swear people known decades completely flipped went insane. honestly feel like I'm ""pod people"" ""body snatcher"" type movie. SA one strictest lockdowns - mid March June? reopened due economy, cases jumped anyway?! bushfires Aus covid. spent month wearing full mask house (Full particulate). awful (the smoke+asthma). idea people tolerate bushfire smoke.

I batch disposables hand case happened covid started. Cuomo says overwhelmed. Make American Graves Abound Trump would surging polls.

If Trump would declared ""War COVID-19"" would American thing would war helped get reelected.

But corona campaign him:

Still go vote! Nothing decided moment, poll matters real vote. Well Europe didn‚Äôt lock overwhelmed opened back up. Guess getting high numbers again? yet seen heard aggressive lockdown measures. 

That‚Äôs biggest problem it, way truly prevent things stay little bubbles. cost long one knows. America, people listen force way ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù. culture one independence one tell us -despite fact inconvenience save lives. 

This half-in half-out nothing us. NB Canada handling decently. colour system, green yellow orange red. there's case two move stuff gets locked down. small outbreak, cranked orange (mask mandate, social gathering ban). businesses shut new cases days.

It's really difficult low-budget dollar store province handle it. think we've 300 cases province wide. high population province there's direct correlation policies cases dropping. Yes, know still community spread China (which tests)... cases make sense.

The cases Philippines strange... testing positive, yet Taiwan contacted 372 people tested 202, none signs tested positive? good free healthcare access best hospitals medical professionals. Well, I'm one Ohioans taking seriously. ""quaranteam"" parents, groceries curbside, masks, hand washing frequently, homeschooling pre-k (and probably kindergarten keeps up), etc. 

Yesterday made choice shelter-in-place. looking forward it, needs done foreseeable future. think thing going us long time. admit hospital unless mild severe. come in, test positive, show signs severe worsening symptoms tell go home self isolate. believe oral form remdes currently, hospitals least, given I.V insured. hope stay-at-home order followed helps turn dire situation around.

Salt Lake City same, especially squeezed lake mountains miles wide one long strip whole string cities making metro. Correct. one isn‚Äôt working, shown 0 intention change. There's usual group morons believe virus want wear masks (though mercifully compared US), holy shit I'm sick seeing opposition leaders face every day news bagging Andrews yet offering zero alternatives saying he'd differently, think state we've done well this, I'm really proud well. Sounds like there'll welcome relief businesses soon, state we've come together proved tough get result need.

I'm doubtful work US (I family I'm completely speaking foreigner) honestly sense entitlement charts, really ""all me"" (despite might like say contrary). People cling far tightly constitution (it written different time) rights, gladly sacrifice neighbours countrymen means get keep rights. That's one thing Australia well. We're far perfect, there's always sense togetherness looking part. can't find one? I'm Spain, glad we've mandatory masks public whole time, unlike France, Germany, Switzerland, others pretty la-di-dah resurgence. wife got new job Germany shocked weeks ago helping move blas√© people masks distancing comparison.

We're also getting bent gently caressed behind, hard, especially Madrid utter fuckwit right wing mayor's response jaw dropping disgrace, whole, masks prevented much worse. three neighbors working regional hospitals, seriously fear emotional physical well - round one, already looked like walking dead. Canada too. nothing work! 

Maybe listen experts time get bored again. got point Murdoch maggots attacking Premier without support Prime Minister. even imagine fucked we'd way? saying something like great way show people conveniently forget things like country pathetic disaster. entirely correct, I‚Äôm frustrated. hate I‚Äôm getting frustrated. many stories hear people saying ‚Äúoh, thought around people without masks would safe (insert reason here)‚Äù every one get tested positive. friends going crazy. coworkers going crazy.

Nice, finally! Someone actually knows.. Please tell cause I've trying find someone knows what's going minute.. mean idiots voted Trump idiots wear masks get sick virus?

*Pikachu face* Notably Texas without gerrymandering even semi-decent voter participation state blue be. That's allowed US. Yeah, absolutely insane waited capacity this. think would happen? everyone wore mask without exception public. 3 recorded nation wide returned travellers, currently quarantine. GO AUSTRALIA!! like reddit conveniently forgotten near-certainty everyone orangeman never going win way groceries Spain keep seeing groups people taking masks sitting bars, hear say ""You live virus."" Remember folks, going go away like miracle. wait.

The problem that: wear mask in, take inside. inside, nobody says anything all. 

Our store leadership bad; bad job general, also don‚Äôt care customers wearing masks apparently, management store lead follows suit all.. subservient want promotion. thought current plan burn resources fast possible? must point realize they've made mistake, they've conned right?

Maybe 500k dead?  1 million?  5 million?  30 million?

I mean number right? Right?  Oh shoot we're screwed we. many ""leftist governments"" worse outbreaks US? Give examples developed countries democratically elected left leaning governments lead US cases per capita, deaths per capita. poor people give En France je croix qu'il faut 3 mois apr√®s le dernier rapport entre homme pour donner ton sang. stay home voted. 10 months since I've seen family friends. someone taking seriously lives alone, sometimes stretches days time even use voice. bit breakdown start summer isolation managed get putting time focus bettering myself, exercising more, cooking, etc. sinking I'll spending birthday, thanksgiving Christmas alone hard fight depression that's creeping thoughts.  
 
Edit: appreciate concern advice I'm venting bit, definitely difficult times I'll fine! dubunked, please stop dedicated cultists believe hoax, yes. 

Seriously, google covid hoax. know US‚Äôs population is. Someone used 200M formula wrong. It‚Äôs 330M+. Sounds like guys ones need research.. straight dumb. Democrats collectivists give one sheet individual freedoms. used to, new ideology left big threat us all. Holy fuck guys dumb lmao Tbf, El Paso hardly votes. blue one ever turns El Paso valley. Phoenix ranked 10th largest size city limits United States. tiny all. ""Biggest one-day increase"" lost meaning me. basically everyday occurrence many countries now. Ontario, Canada, finally busted 4-digits, also first time ever.  Melburnian (capital Victoria), here's taken reduce daily count 0. smaller lockdown March til June (everyone must WFH, schools closed, guests over, restaurants bars closed etc) got 0 cases day. Things started

Then outbreak cases grew rapidly. restrictions since July:

&amp;#x200B;

* Mandatory masks outdoors
* Closing retail except supermarkets, grocers pharmacies
* Restaurants cafes take-away only. bars closed.
* Cannot go 5km home (was recently upgraded 25km)
* leave house 4 reasons: 1hr daily exercise, medical care, go grocery shopping care family member can't care themselves.
* one point bunch public housing towers (thousands people) complete lock down, unable leave apartments outbreak
* Cannot guests over, cannot meet groups people live with. outdoors 1 person live with.
* schools closed
* daycare closed
* work home, must work home
* Border strictly closed states
* Originally $2000 fine breaching conditions, upped $5000 fine recently

&amp;#x200B;

This meant pretty much anyone children, unless they're hospital worker, home work, try Zoom calls, etc. Grandparents etc can't come provide daycare either. people seen maybe one two people outside spouse roomates since March. could 2 people max back June, lasted 4 weeks back lockdown. Besides morning interaction barista get take-away coffee, that's pretty much it.

Pretty proud Victorian right now, massive shit slog year us. get watch instagram stories friends family states beach, pub etc, everyone protecting fellow Aussies coronavirus hard lockdown. That's gotta bullshit statistic. would imply person likely spreading like 20 others household/friend group already infected. took little bit horse abuse dickheads Gratz Didnt Democrats put sick people nursing homes? leadership Great State Texas failed us. may wrong majority seem still support Dan Andrews believe mostly right calls made. However, news media available Australia pushing Liberal/National agenda think opposite true. exactly apples apples there... appreciate much, nice get info. rite highly international nation REALLY chance act early China. CCP censorship really fucked world. virus becomes pandemic already late. half asses lock measures pointless, let burn self fule many experts say, including family member used epidemiologist CDC, basically minimize risk without going crazy. Always wear mask, socially distance possible, clean hand frequently, touch face. people lock away everyone wipe everything comes house set mail room 3 days, etc - can't event imagine mental strain required keep little benefit. Concentrate energies make difference, spend rest energy keeping sane. agree, tone makes sound like don‚Äôt agree. 

Do answer question? Yikes. Stalemate. think gonna last forever? already hundreds millions produced. it‚Äôs approved, it‚Äôs rolling right away. First frontline workers rest. assume we‚Äôll back normal spring 2021.  wish people would take seriously. Yes. sad also it‚Äôs infuriating. cousin Ohio refuses take seriously even knowing everything went NYC.

They excuse ignorance. They‚Äôve done themselves. compassion essential workers get sick others refuse basic, simple measures. Oooh yeah, that's good point, think that. would definitely put lot closer. think that's almost everywhere 2 types people world. 

1. extrapolate incomplete data. try hammering Staph broad spectrum antibiotics? That's terribly uncommon way acquire C. diff infection. Trump really unique individual ways. That's nicest thing say him. WA reporting. We're super, community transmission months.

We're providing medical care international shipping crew, numbers going up, covid ""in wild"" state. parents tested positive. Started showing symptoms two days ate dinner them, get tests three days later, received results two days that. Outsourced contact tracer called asked they'd contact since day took tests (which one they'd isolated point), even though parents clarified symptoms days prior that. 

Even though received negative result, still quarantined 14 days exposure shit joke. don‚Äôt understand people make comments. Like it‚Äôs groundbreaking information Canada universal healthcare lmao. helpful? think works way, I'm geologist. go deer hunting wells drilled, extremely rural area earthquake much damage. tweet saw earlier El Paso, TX stay home orders implemented again. since I‚Äôve heard one those. Genuine question: looked stats France hovering around 1k daily cases July. know Covid spread quickly changed blew numbers? Unless werent reporting correctly numbers first place. state Australia lockdown bit (full lockdown), state premiere cops fair bit flak people sick locked down, absolutely worked. 0 cases 0 deaths today first time months.

It's fun locked (after anyway), tough businesses sure, there's denying works. see you‚Äôre downvoted they‚Äôre wrong. Wow, need credit creating that! Wish knew community nursing research ungodly amount tabs open keep referencing back to. lol thanks work! people piped ‚Äúbut we‚Äôre even capacity!‚Äù It‚Äôs ‚Äúurging‚Äù Texas Republican governor Abbott outlawed anyone able issue lockdown him. restriction including masks enforceable Texas. didn‚Äôt rise top chance. locking appropriate would seem appropriate, fuck can‚Äôt find anything past 24 hours google? making fuck ton waves Twitter post Reddit post showing google. Well we're voting governments, now? think right. DeWine milquetoast, legislature required wear masks according DeWine. Nobody wants heath dept job Governor sat hands Acton family harassed threatened, chrissake--a new person would risking life. Meanwhile constituents dying left right. Sounds like knots berry farms train ride too. one went vote, looked everyone shoulder shoulder masks. Panicked ran out.

I woke panic. back, next day put absentee application mail. Good reminder! figured centralist in-between political parties literal meaning central middle. Sorry i'm omnipotent dictionary. cousin half black half white jokes thought he'd accepted whites blacks instead fit all. that's like moderate sides hate joining cult left rightism. Japan 15 years ago, people packed like sardines places. 

But notice one difference trains subs Japan. People wore masks casually. People even stood sub platform handed out. 

I asked someone people wore masks. I‚Äôm American‚Äîthat‚Äôs completely foreign idea me. told people wear don‚Äôt feel well prevent spreading disease.

First, would really know tipping point retroactively. Second, would depend plethora factors. longer deal pandemic, data gather country. Italy, control lost around 10k daily new cases.

Uhhhhhhhhh ya think!? Smh literally guy last week insist Trump zero responsibility far taking steps prevent spread Covid, like insisting 0 obligation anything everything related covid response 100% governors qnd federal government done anything. 



Of course would talk Coumo oh totally data manipulation. Like state current CFR 20-29 currently less .01% 24 deaths 26681 confirmed cases 40-49 .05% 130 22320 cases. supports statement ""we're going wearing masks 2022."" nice say thanks Poland ‚ù§ Basically FDA requires seeking approval put format like there's element beaurocracy (the 7 weeks mainly this).

The European British bodies moved flexible format data provided scientists run happy.

That's difference. Yeah feel you, tired Priktzer/ Madigan conspiracy narrative, deniers (numbers fake etc...) shit Chicago popular thing held Chicago's bs reality ones causing uptick state... clarify looks like release means analyzed blood trial participants saw vaccine illicited immune response looking for.

The phase 3 trial results waiting show whether immune response generated vaccine enough block covid infection/replication.

Once study fully enrolled trial subjects pass endpoint date, study unblinded data analyzed see many subjects infected covid, either placebo vaccine, see vaccine indeed prevented covid infection. family Poland actually really impressed things seemed handled spring. actually kind jealous well online school programs managed vs. things thrown together US. least, sounded like everyone wearing masks, government programs encourage people stay home. kind stuff now? globalized world CANNOT dog eat dog capitalistic bullshit recent history. lift everybody gets everybody trouble lessens chances trouble rear it‚Äôs head again.

See: Asia, basically words anymore. Good luck. That's fake news though. happened ""dems"" handled badly. post. yes, EU governments took plenty measures spring, measures quite successful. OTOH, soon got back people lying hospital corridors, ""economy important, need get back normal immediately"" became new mantra. Truly sorry hear that. hope local grocery store good people wearing masks. 
But upside, living less populated area means statistically less likely get infected anyway. loving president said I‚Äôm ok continue working factory line will! Gotta keep tolling away make overlords rich! I'm hopeful, whole ""RNA vaccine we've never extensively tested humans"" worried. I've gathered, actually cause body produce virus within, encouraging cells develop spike protein characteristic Coronavirus.

This notion modifying DNA cells way pretty freaked out. anyone knowledge matter explain bit skeptical safety technology used here? front stage tickets see Aerosmith. listening since kid, hope they'll stay healthy see them. think estimate conservative scientist studied subject decades worked decades makes expert it. I‚Äôm Pfizer trial initial side effects unpleasant severe. follow two years monitor long term side effects. No. Overall, hospitalizations former epicenters, obfuscates **spiking record-high hospitalization increases** across rest country.

Nobody seems want define thresholds. new favorite human. Polish government request German help German hospitals accept patient transfers Poland. Excuse me? justification detaining Uyghurs? phtalates nobody uses except J&amp;J. holidays via Zoom! kill parents/grandparents someone else's parents/grandparents! People give fuck. exclusive Poland, people thought September Corona everything could go back normal, even though quite obvious shit going go away atleast another year. I‚Äôm expert, pulmonologist thought might compromised actually vaccine (pneumonia) check! Basically wanted see well responded (in % of... antibodies?) conclude photographs people left hospital lobby floor.

Or whats considered norm Poland ?

Either way, people floor hospital havent got enough support and/or funding. still lot people could die. I'm saying need aim Covid zero, think absurd point many countries, need continue protect people death serious harm best possible. I've temporarily banned twice... happen. Paywalled Thanks tool. strange game. winning move play.

Oh wait, works really well thermonuclear war. Viral pandemics, much. another 12 months go. get paid tell lies, believe Positivity rate: 17.8% Yikes!

Has handshake replaced coughing directly others noses France?

How France completely lost control?  agree, either school starting again. 

But lifting restrictions fine summer. mean they're 70+. They've lived life die point sad really tragedy. Yes. another 9-12 months enough people vaccinated assuming safety data holds up. #**VAXX UP, BOYS!** Okay. Thanks. linked like article, start page summit.

Like going dmv example. already pain ass before, can't even get license drive tests, they're third party providers availability whole year. Also fact can't get back school keep messing paperwork. can't go campus turn everything need. know people really struggling, people sick, also feel like everything want accomplish reach. I'm trying feel grateful things already, so, hard. need authority help anyone. question isnt helping supposed 'Leading' Europe. trade also Australia resorted pretty draconian measures. Australian government literally place people house arrest, using armed police prevent people living entire apartment blocks leaving building. fact, Australia's lockdown cases even draconian China's lockdown. least China's lockdown, one person per family gets go buy groceries week, something like that. believe Chinese police sent prevent people leaving homes either. would argue people China right free people United States.

This joke statement. can‚Äôt afford casket you‚Äôll ‚Äúurn‚Äù it! province Ontario masks mandatory pretty much anywhere want go , cases rapidly increasing  know think anymore. Fits right ""kill grandma economy"". say stick beliefs cough other. country yours? numbers differ much worldmeters \+ another 1 tip long stupid spear bad decisions.

Lol. Even arent dealing covid patients directly, hospital ships obviously helpful preventing hospital becoming capacity pandemic, used offload non-covid patients primary hospitals. No. Smallpox virus ever eradicated took decades effort. reminder COVID-19‚Äôs ability overload hospital systems greatly diminished majority population vaccinated, therefore reevaluate precautions necessary virus won‚Äôt dangerous individual population level. I‚Äôm old don‚Äôt risk factors listed 1/4300 risk death 2 us cohort 10000 similar folks. pretty low nearly low risk guys! far know, major candidates target spike protein, one used gain entrance ACE2 expressing cells. immunodominant antigen primary target corona virus immunity. Although mostly target protein, quite something said delivery method vaccines might influence immunogenicity vaccine. u/hebrewchucknorris get immunological Astra/Zeneca vaccine, reason conclude get Janssen Moderna either. differently batches adenovirus carry genetic material (Janssen Astra) spike protein blatantly delivers material without virus (Moderna). Even use one might give different outcomes, boost might well induce wanted B cell responses. add list, imo everyone getting tested every days. robust testing people would know *immediately* got Covid, could contact trace much easily would account half people get infect others, symptoms. Every drug store America free testing required tested every days. Yes, WHO, CDC health officials messed big time right there. Ideally multiple successful vaccines, interest safety. Either state pulls license open, go bankrupt staying closed. Neither state federal government providing support, survive. approaching -900... way force people clout something Trump's lack covid planning. Starting hope drops much everyday get it, even ruins portfolio - consumer spending TSA passenger figures dropped nothing again. 

An control virus plans, shutdowns, bring economy down. 8 days election. bet mainstream media going report doom gloom ever had. subtext clear really question. ‚ÄúThe poor‚Äù context thing ‚Äúfirst time flyers.‚Äù Whether first time flyer fly every week like doing, get presentation. far pamphlet goes emergency instructions pamphlet behind every seat. think doing?

Make sense? I'm bit ootl European situation covid. Wtf happened number cases high now?? thought things getting better couple months ago????

Yes, situation getting worse day despite government propaganda. Everything missing, places hospitals running out. Ambulances sick people wait several hours admission. already fatal cases hospitals refused admit patient ...

Did get right? strongly disagree. People need admit response overreach, mistake. know that‚Äôs hard. cost damn high social, economic even mental health level. annual mask mandate unacceptable many people including myself. And? I'm tired, made mistake, admitted it, apologised. never misread something before? cold front moving in. know virus loves cold dry air indoors, optimal weather conditions time Abbott opened bars restaurants full capacity.

I agree much better government all, also think government handled much better US (hard to)

Still, think many people ignoring hard contain virus diverse countries.

Most countries successfully contained homogeneous race culture.

Those 2 subs depressing places Reddit There's difference snorting crack seeing Nana Thanksgiving. Amen brother.

Or, 'but okay kids, small number' excuse, though that's going make okay somehow family loses child. :( There's ""falling behind"" everyone affected way. 2020-2021 year considered write-off every student young school virtually, would really make much difference? They'd either skip grade next year graduate year later, one sane going hold 1 year delay graduating students well known delay once-in-a-lifetime, world-spanning crisis. said mask personal choice.

See, think personal choice whether people's virus particles breathed me. Damn, sad spot are. 428 total deaths H1N1. technically deadly younger people practice compared covid, infection rate much lower odds propagate enough reach vulnerable populations much get around more.

The problem covid really mortality rate since pretty low, problem infection rate. propagates MUCH easier lot viruses allows quickly reach vulnerable populations, something h1n1 do.

A virus 100% deadly trying catch actually catch FAR less dangerous virus kills less 1% time really high chance catching exposed...

You'd stupid think two viruses anywhere near level threat. busy fighting abortions care patients. mean realistically would mixture both. don‚Äôt care all, would take super seriously, would middle. get - meager pensions can't support promise additional money life saver. 

It's shame government can't handle crisis. Also, less old people. Unless somehow find drug instantly cures it, vaccine important bringing pandemic end. Even good therapeutics hospitalized patients still need days recovery, puts hospital capacity risk. Damn really showing ass thread. probably going sound weird, would nice people would think conversations offering invite something. I've hearing complaint often past couple weeks coworkers irritating too. 

It gets really old working COVID unit high risk area weeks everyone wants talk holiday plans invite Halloween party go bar casino whatever. plans, going out, shit is.

It's constant reminder everything missing fact there's decently high chance walking biological weapon could go time. even worse Belgium. Collapse hospitals already happening. tired can't even speak government more. government saying use fire extinguishing house fire. Meaning lame ignorant take drastic measures. friend told starting condition child gone back person idea may go back online, saddening her.

It's really sad that, know? Kids deserve go suffering, especially young too. hope pandemic officially dust settles, learn that.

And no, ""just keep schools closed"" viable solution either. Maybe every student, students need go school learn optimal learning conditions. IEP accommodations, WiFi home, parents work need place stay safe...

Fortunately, school close again. tempting fate saying that? Wake up. them, we're China. give crap. People talking absolute numbers. Belgium never reach total  person asked VOO VT 12% since last Nov Poe's Law. part

Nope. That's called confirmation bias basing people talked to.  Lmao can't believe comments like one. immature naive believe stopping infectious disease simple ""everyone stop seeing anyone else bit""? like asking 9 year old stop common cold spreading. something requires teamwork succeed, fittest team wins. Lol zombies amiright? xD Great news, vaccines cannot come soon enough. dilemma, allow liberties suspended temporarily greater good, showing manipulated/controlled?

No. showing civility toward others. Oxford's September deadline never realistic begin with. Probably Christmas deadline too. like ""two weeks"" beginning. General problem ""cure"" time symptoms, virus already done damage. ""all hospitals capacity"" late order means two weeks peak. Well done. lol forgot China cancelled Chinese New Year. Also Korea cancelled Chuseok. That's horrifying, hope things get better soon. comes per capita deaths, Canada currently 38th worst world. 217 countries. 

The vast majority cases/deaths two provinces headed (what country agrees on) incompetent premiers. rest country fairing quite well, areas single digit average cases still safely unaffected. rough go, especially densely populated regions, never said otherwise.  guess think 189 countries better lying numbers.

I never said anything country China. Honestly, it‚Äôs skin ass want substitute jingoism reality. You‚Äôre one who‚Äôs deceived. 

Hyperbolic much? I'm calling spade spade. China currently Uighur Muslims, much leg stand terms defending them. defend consider bastion hope world's future fight climate change, [despite kind air quality regular perhaps discuss [China holding two Canadian citizens hostage charges arrest Chinese tech giant. let's ask people Hong Kong much love China... Ah pizza parties, ultimate cheap corporate reward Canadians would never. Funny story though. Everyone different, relief expectation safe Christmas new years. think 30% CPS students get Fs? Come on. That's 30% checked all. count checked part time almost none.

There's little evidence long term health impacts younger people. 

Schools reopen proper precautions. Schools Illinois already done safely 2 months. ones Brazil, even president ministers, least conquisted LGBT rights remains untouched... yet exactly pullback healthy. Another 10% probably would healthy, too. discussion started blanket statement saying border controls work. false. apparently ability comprehend simple fact. Border controls work combined appropriate measures mitigate virus within said country. part understand? 

To make simple you: following steps needed suppress virus given country:

1. Preventing travel to/from places widespread community transmission.
2. Implementation mask wearing, social distancing, etc.

Take away #1, people bringing virus home them. country prime example this.

I'm tired repeating myself. keep saying ""closing borders already widespread community transmission work"", **WHICH TRUE**. ignores happening within country. country taking active measures mitigate virus, closing borders problem countries absolutely necessary, otherwise work taking place within country goes waste.

You seem assuming point border restrictions automatically suppress virus. Yet already acknowledged earlier statement said ""Now country question good job mitigating spread COVID, border controls probably make much difference"". unable comprehend basic logic, also seem poor reading comprehension. Social isolation?

It‚Äôs never social isolation. It‚Äôs ‚Äúsocial‚Äù distancing. It‚Äôs trying keep physical distance.

You physically distanced socialize. text, talk phone, video chat, engage social media, write emails/letters too. Things definitely still hard, freaking social isolation.

Maybe meant feel isolated. think lot people struggling now. think pandemic it‚Äôs poorly handled‚Äîon many levels‚Äîis eroding sense community us had. find hard. one forcing anyone true social isolation, especially ‚Äúmonths‚Äù.

I‚Äôm referring say this, wonder many extroverts venting truly extroverts. I‚Äôm introvert able see communicate lot friends (while following guidelines). extroverts don‚Äôt many strong friendships? missing collective energy huge groups people? extroverts know IRL coping well thanks extensive social networks.

I hope you, personally, anyone reading dealing feeling isolated. are, hope find comfort. Yeah working hard working together important bit. Much world neither. track-and-trace systems use would accepted west. 

So, common sense. This. live U.S. entire family France Spain.

A friend Paris area sharing anti-lockdown memes laughing virus owns gym can't open.

A friend who's well known right wing columnist mocking regulations forcing bars restaurants dial activities shut early.

My mother - 70s hospitalized multiple times pneumonia - doubting scale pandemic spouting bullshit hear here, like ""I'm sure counting lot people Covid deaths actually die it"", ""I want live fear"".

My incredibly intelligent friend attending concerts yet canceled going bars friends (his area yet red zone).

I could go on. French people experiencing major pandemic fatigue point many want ignore virus pretend power living life usual. going take close friends relatives die wake up. think depends city neighborhood. Generally, would agree, neighbors pretty neighborly. help out. say money talks. reality people pay insurance premiums get vaccine first. google globo, guess Brezil.

I'm Denmark pretty far away, media much here, even though several independant outlets. copy mostly. problem even countries lot precautions, there's conspicuous match second wave suddenly flared in-person schools started opening. really think opening schools countries truly ready almost singlehandedly sent Europe similar countries seemingly virus beaten disaster zones within month.

I really think worth grades early virtually, lot learning actually happens school year we're going frank. knew plenty kids elementary school skipped grades absolutely problem, basically next nothing single year. Taking 2020-2021 year supplemental home schooling distance learning material perfectly doable pretty much major educational loss. 

Also, even school year completely lost, find worrying students ""falling behind"" year kind strange well known around world we're facing worst international crisis lifetime, nearly everyone going affected way. one future going like ""Nah, we're going hire cause coronavirus made graduate year later"". Ahh people spreading holiday joy &amp; virus, visiting families Christmas Eve, old people spending Christmas families..... Yeeppp. doomed.  remember people brought argument back March screamed evidence this. shit evidence, one ever stupid enough try something like before. Georgia guide stones!!! Haven‚Äôt thought years. read latest submission, think otherwise.

This sub flip-flops around. kinda complicated, infuriating. like stick around, spread positivity such, knowing without people like it'd probably even worse :/ market 30-50%, even close wife immunocompromised I'm generally healthy. risk/reward worth me. I'll get back donating COVID 6+ months. Sorry, take care family first. Nice username btw. That's good one.

I'm school board. Masks norm cold season number Asian countries nailed Covid. Singapore Taiwan come mind Well know making come back....Common Sense! 
You need health official tell us that. gave mis-information US government follow worlds news agenda. Funny thing mirrors what's ACTUALLY happening states. I'm Florida Governor Death Sentence Common Sense common means. 
Interestingly enough, governor states ""everything fine open state"". know still open? 
The tours governors mansion. Due Covid-19.
That tell something...... yet assume socialise every single flu season, despite knowing hundreds thousands people hospital due catching virus could unknowingly spreading socialising. shut every winter prevent that? get free pass make people victims right?

I'd suggest getting high horse, realising sacrifice much going parties. Thank pointing out. live Korea yes, see sooo many people claiming Korea's superior handling obviously much better US Europe, really things westerners may assume.

This complete horseshit. live BC exact polar opposite Sweden. start, province people proactive cautious dealing virus. ""sustained spread"" summer. Sweden going life nothing amiss, BC shut taking shit seriously. fact BC able cautiously open back summer due strong efforts flatten initial curve spring, warm weather allowing everyone get outside socializing, fact people kept taking seriously even summer.

So now, even expected seasonal increase, worst province been, we're 200 cases/day 5 million people. rate would cause celebration state USA.

But let's compare Sweden:

BC, date: 12,500 total cases, 254 deaths, pop. 5 million.

Sweden: 110,000 cases, nearly 6,000 deaths, population 10 million.

So, population roughly double BC's, Sweden managed 8x cases 20x deaths. Or, put otherwise: would Sweden's death rate, we'd 10x deaths we've - approximately 2,750 people alive right would dead. 

And Sweden achieve loss life? sitting better place BC is? Fuck no.

The ""open up"" crowd cannot fucking point BC's relative success claim theirs. highly doubt that's even table.

When social distancing go away, masks come off. etc going fucking kill myself. anymore. one actually gives shit either. hint new ones: one wants hear mental health issues. actually care.

**See easy is, everyone?** layperson's experience, feels (and looks non-technical eyes) like three USA.

But... *isn't* layperson's experience. I'm NYC thus far experienced ONE wave. peaked April, rapid drop-off though beginning summer, kept numbers low recently.

Someone Florida would experienced low numbers April, peak early summer, drop.

Someone North Dakota would experienced low numbers fall, finally hit peak.

All watch one time-lapse maps show virus hotspots time becomes obvious: single wave started areas propagated around country. Like ripple pond. ""Waves"" exist time space, fact think lot people missing.

Pretending like conditions New York way reflective conditions Florida conditions North Dakota silly. huge country. also silly *the entire freaking country* locked hard New York got hit. States virus yet present managed inflame reactionaries lockdown fatigue even cases. third country convinced pandemic hoax refuse alter behavior, virus finally hitting communities.

We really screwed up. Europeans don‚Äôt wear masks outside Ok.... see. somehow piece plastic suspended front face frame that's direct contact nose ears, going filter virus particles aerosol mist human mucous? 

Wow! That's pretty amazing! 
If glasses totally protect eyes virus, maybe someone made large piece transparent material could cover whole face like shield?
Oh wait... those. work. 
Hmm.... go figure. Yes. virus easy control population follows directions. Authoritarianism one way guarantee success. Africa better Europe US, population used following public health directions since Ebola. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  got vacinne Sars? coz that's covid 19 is, strain Sars. vacinne 17 years.  documented cases still rare. appreciate hearing experience, I‚Äôll still need wait evidence know common. 

But vaccination unlikely provide significantly prolonged protection vulnerable reinfection soon, reinfection common would open new worms fight virus. breathing CO2.

I love one. know small cavity mouth mask hold UNTOLD amounts CO2. disagree.

The rate people dying isnt changing. know that. bodies count. dont know real numbers infection. makes zero sense see known number 88k confirm tested turn around say 0.3% mortality. would 264 people dead, whereas real number dead 88k likely 2,688; 2.6%.

You switch units like that. creates scenario factually tested positive virus, would think 2% chance living .3%?

That's statistics work. can't take average outcome general population apply single individual. I'm mid 30s, I'm healthy, I'm risk. risk drying Covid-19 isnt 2%, even 0.3%, far lower. one joke arguments comedians make point audience sitting concert hall that, ""statistically speaking, handful going die next weeks ruin Christmas everybody.""

But start gathering data getting representative sample size American population whole, start see trend. trend this: people test, average, 2.6% tested die. fact, much correct. says nothing age. says nothing underlying health conditions. says nothing got infected.

The true death rate completely unknown. I've seen anywhere 0.00% 1.65%. 0.3% dubious best, far I'm concerned, pulled magic hat. COURSE true rate lower many healthy people get infected never realize it. fact matter people still dying, rate daily CONFIRMED change seeing, means we'll seeing, average, dead American every 50 seconds. fever well-known symptom COVID. It‚Äôs universal it‚Äôs symptom that‚Äôs easy detect.

Why allow anyone profit pandemic? people don‚Äôt even vote US despite make hard citizens vote. election they‚Äôll break record bit sixty million votes. Germans good, Scandinavians bad Idk, would take grain salt, Oxford stated mid september 18k people vaccinated 30k.


I dont think even reached original target, whereas Pfizer blown vaccinations almost 40k people vaccinated goal 30k increase 44k increased 47k 12-18 year olds. dont think Oxford beat pfizer Authorization unless way vaccine participants stated. Obedience? Got say common sense common here. Yes, getting response, without terrible side effects, challenge. multiple vaccines 2-6 months away, disagree. stop it, much suppress spread long enough get vaccine play. Letting thing burn population mere months vaccine deployed insanity. one asking people give social lives eternity, need another 3-6 months difference could well tens thousands hundreds thousands lives. Yes, physical separation hard. dealing that. knowing infected love one died months vaccine approved gonna haunt forever - should. things important leave computers. Voting one things. 

Yes, *in theory*, secure voting platform able built. issue auditability trust. centralized compute platform juicy target, easily influenced. 

Paper ballots perfect (especially counting machines also good point attack), inherently distributed, difficult single small set actors fake, generally audited hand required.

Voting sucks - electronic voting would definitely raise voter participation - huge potential risk. Cybersecurity researchers universally say ""electronic voting bad idea."" experts field say something bad idea, listen. economy. Freedom value well put back trying pour gas generator lights 4 days. finished PT 2 days ago better helping anymore. ya, f@&amp;k derecho. Yeah, politics affect vaccination precisely point. people didn‚Äôt get polio vaccine here, probably would polio outbreaks here. one huge worries Covid vaccine. That's works. cool Church holy drive movie theater dude behavior advocating comments **is** sociopathic.

Still banking magical pre-existing immunity garbage ignoring fact NYC seeing spikes communities 40-50% seroprevalence coming September, eh?

Yeah, no, EU even close. Even Italy behind significantly. site linked aggregate infection estimates Europe well. 

As said, completely disordered argue solution people missing screening overrun hospitals. no. That's insane.

Wierd whine ad hominem exactly that. Complete hypocrisy. give drivers licenses literally anyone, tbh. grandfather could barely see drove dangerously like 10 years passes God people give ‚Äúwholesome‚Äù award? opposite wholesome. /S c'mon Worst numbers world, why? Czechia way cases reported. know personally two people sick right know close contact positive people, want get tested unless to. know one family four got sick time three weeks ago (that never happened before) right symptoms. Never tested. ministry health estimates currently 500k infected people (5 % population). That's counting people already it. getting though? second time outbreak happens there?

It comes Kazakhstan/Kyrgyzstan, control (even though governments cover best abilities), what? unicorns farts bullshit. can't cure flu, still working vacinne Sars 17 years ago, there's gonna cure covid 19. I'm asking heard last spring. *You‚Äôre* welcome. initial thought maskless Black Friday stampedes gave heart palpitations.

But thankfully Home Depot spreading deal entire month instead usual one day cant believe patient reporters, amazing effort.

Those press conferences....every single day...never heard anything like really good everyone, even didnt say give away much helped kept population engaged, least. vastly overblown. I've hospital influenza H1N1 fighting dear life 25, pre-existing conditions.


Covid-19 10x mortality rate 3 5 times infectiousness (R value) disease caused ""fight dear life"" hospital.


If body handle something mild swine flu, want covid. people go there, *all* want buy clothes. They'll stay home like they're supposed to. apparently odd rules made people selfish fucking stupid. fact get means type person necessitates making rules. Fair enough, personally think $60 donation might help alleviate shortages. donate plasma banners thanking donors place fine, money go get nice lunch afterwards means lot me. maybe that‚Äôs me. No, lockdown effects causing severe drop cancer diagnoses among population. specifically relevant children, effect lockdown nonetheless want go rock concert football game. movies. see EU getting serious herd immunity thingy. people keep dropping excited awards posts!? Seeing lot recently think California instance restaurant restrictions already, think ""lockdown light""... forbidden leave home land restaurant. ""heavy lockdown"" forbidden leave EXCEPT grocery store necessity trip. Since lockdown isnt technical term, guess depends look it. ""I'd surprised thing [the pandemic] clearly way late spring, least country"" Fuck. sooo smart. Every one else stop contributing, guy single handedly defeated me. reprehensible recommend masks everybody right said needed. Yes, would likely double extra major havoc already fucked PPE supply situation. acknowledge good solution time. decision Fauci rest us live Why? disagrees claim. Nope earlier that... tough, really really tough. still sour taste mouth issues transpired May/June (fundamentally reintroduction virus) really glad able control government, despite qualms them, seem genuinely care controlling situation. Things definitely looking up. Anyway, three groups people want wear masks:

* olfactory experience world

* legitimate fear Trojan horse (digital) totalitarianism

* mix both

And compaint. statement fact. Also, wear mask times prescribed. put disclaimer *The Downvoting Army* came along... almost multiple people sub different opinions :O Jesus 18K month!?!? type fast, take much time feed trolls.  Good hear. state wasn‚Äôt, actually US stay home orders probably tougher restrictions. end day costs freedom irresponsible approach. people don‚Äôt worry losing lives, losing employment, losing family friends, disabled virus. I‚Äôll take short term pain long term gain avoiding second scenario comes longterm costs freedom potentially come long term ramifications. I‚Äôm counting lucky stars experience many people aren‚Äôt moment. Hmm right Trumps big parties I'm baffled.  country? dont think Australian politician history much camera time direct voters. Dans man! Drop dime health dept report ass. Depends see it, masks arent 100% proof mass usage works. Depend criterias scientists using determine effectiveness lives completely changed, there's way next 2 years places like NYC, California, Florida, Texas, etc look remotely like used to. Calling pedantic mention missing pieces picture painting seem gloss whole idea 'returning normal'. everyone one US thinks going vanish completely long prez Trump gets voted back going stay around. guess cure everyone vote trump.....wtf... Yup live Marquette spread community now. went 10 cases max per day year 50 per day last couple weeks. isnt even counting prisoners. blame college well timing goes along college kids arriving country. quite well even tourist season everyone masked soon college kids came dorm life really infected entire town. prisoners seemed catch employees gather. shame infect little rural area full elderly folks one college prison want keep income going. mean yeah try ""free"" China. terms religion, politics, basic history lessons.

I doubt second Western world would significantly different year people willing work towards common good.

But pretend Asian countries live actual dictatorship (which makes easier force people distance, wear masks get tested) would quite naive. Yup, are. grown ass adults act like ? Keep mom safe. grown ass adult don‚Äôt care braindead cult members think hold lowest possible regard. continue believing science, common sense. joy flowing r/CoronavirusDownunder tonight. Neither matters, point Went home depot yesterday, everyone mask on.
Was slightly amazed Got first half mean, see mean crying, mad. much could've prevented yeah spent much time debating useless politics? sure place went outlier, donated back May nurse person donating room wearing masks beneath noses. Yeah, can't again. 

In case anyone wondering, FL. Yeah, problem people. two times 20 years ago, idea eaten beforehand what. give another try really important.  Foot meets mouthüòé Apparently so. 6000 hospital population 8.5 million crazy. fact polls accurately predicted popular vote show example state initiated lockdown made illegal people go state orders. Long short process dying, prohibited going hospital
Also..
*The ban resulted backlog uncompleted procedures scheduled three-month period, well dynamic backlog surgeries continue delayed health system experiences diminished capacity. problem ‚Äúelective‚Äù elective surgery largely misnomer, serving distinguish emergent care non-emergent care. ‚Äúelective‚Äù implies optional, elective surgical cases fall somewhere vital preventative measures (e.g. screening colonoscopy) essential surgery (e.g. cataract removal). Ample literature across surgical specialties demonstrates worse patient outcomes higher costs treatments Medical facilities shut down, many places discouraging disallowing elective medical procedures need resources COVID patients.

And many hospitals equipped handle COVID equipped handle elective procedures designed handle shut down. think minimum 30% Americans already hobbits, so...yeah ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è live university town &amp; see less half students wearing masks. gotta 9 year old that's gone nearly year without normal kid interaction now, according school community, I'm paranoid weirdo this.

I'd say harm kid making paranoid something effect them, unless living someone risk home. that's case... might better find safer place be.

My kids normal interactions since June. another comment: 

(I think we'll mostly done it). Deaths drop drastically at-risk people essential workers vaccinated. point threat pandemic severely reduced. Plus, treatments. came animals first place. Yet Victoria's economy badly US Europe.  Because, yanno, uncontrolled pandemic fucks economy. disagrees bot kids lived that‚Äôd true. Unfortunately they‚Äôre little happy super spreading machines. Pulling little guy preschool sucked still sucks. lost summer (one reasons live city) gotta part. death rate low. based You, people, think U.S. understating Covid infections deaths? ü§î Well that's certainly image they're selling... Thanks. Yeah, definitely could better that, could help lot, bet. Exactly! Governments forced make rules they'd rather make people stupid think themselves. opinion make government's fault, see do. But, example: March, chose attend pub poker night, lockdown announced, obvious 20 people sitting around tables, touching cards nono. game go ahead (because one *forced* to) place far poker played even now. sell food particular club, so, long everyone puts mask get table, ""allowed"". allowed, it, even though fucking obvious one person place unknowingly caring virus, they're going get it. Situations like this, World, real problem. listen whining lockdown again. vaccine COVID-19‚Äôs impact society comparable now, meaning could analogous bad flu strain Poland 38 mill people? That's bit worse Norway, even factor Norway 5 mill people. Brother, ain't even started. third wave actual hoax!

We never left first. Lmfao Strategy seem successful...?! valleys peak still high can't say we've ever exited initial ""wave"" 

You can't look country monolith. 

In northeast, got hit early hard April, back testing, PPE diverted away, advice wash hands often. 
Meanwhile virtually cases current hotspots: Wisconsin, Texas, Arizona, etc. 

The northeast right things flattened curve new case numbers fell dramatically. 
Now new cases rising northeast probably beginning 2nd wave there. Interesting. assumed reason many Americans anti-mask low quality education many areas presumably covering basic biology/chemistry, allowing students pass without well courses. know many anti-maskers elsewhere, too.


As former med student, lost count many times I've seen doctors wrong treating me, treating loved ones, teaching med students. called many attendings day teach things know (about medicine) mind boggling time. I'd bet there's single living human earth knows every single thing know medicine. 


To antimaskers say masks anything, I'd wonder they'd choose told coughed maskless covid+ patient, either masked unmasked. 



I, too, wish idiots would move one island together. natural selection ran course, we'd island back time. Technically US also first wave... Damn sounds really bad. 70% effective vaccine mean 30% people absolutely zero immune response? doesn‚Äôt sound right. Can't speak rest world, new York City (where work medical provider), use ""at capacity"" ICU beds full, forcing us divert critical patients hospitals availability. yes, peak, stated capacity, that's means, resources needed care critical patient available, that's including temporary ICU wards ER space. hospital wants go diversion, sends bad image. make sense us declare capacity beds available specifically answer comment sentiment general: People pretend EU like government without one. No, European Union doesn‚Äôt anything sense, one wanted give EU power past states deal pandemic themselves, coordinating wish. anything EU helped coordination cross-border assistance, imagine would played EU. would much worse would much less mutual assistance. Lol tag. can't make baseless unscientific assumptions. bad unscientific statement. Good see you‚Äôre serious guess Sorry hear answering question there‚Äôs push reopen schools. reading thread like this, anyone believe ‚Äòofficial‚Äô mortality rate. Globally, bet least 5 million died thus far. curiosity, right wing parties reacted like overblown liberal hoax like US? not?

They closed public buildings, lockdown, people still go out, work office home, etc.

There new news article almost daily asking lockdown Baesweiler even though numbers higher Bavarian district. could lucky year medical students. get board certified 1 year early ;) least, get residency applications approved due emergency. damn turkey lobby bullshit First I‚Äôve tough I‚Äôd travel summer, next lets focus Q3 Q4, I‚Äôm noo worth it, let‚Äôs 2021 like wanted 2020 be. even sure never made claims probably close that.  
DeSantis even said want testing done. 
Florida: 40K tests per day. 4.8k cases per day. Positivity rate 12%. tests NY average 120K day, get 14k new infections Florida. 
Arizona: 20k tests per day 1200 cases per day positivity rate 6%. NY testing capacity, they'd 7200 daily. 
Texas: 50k tests per day 4500 daily cases average. Positivity rate 8.9%. math NY's testing capacity, 10.8K daily cases.

You 3 states cummulative case 10.5k cases combined. 
If testing rate NY's testing capacity, 32k daily cases. 


But make things fair, lets take account states similar # population: NY &amp; Florida testing capacity.

With roughly similar population testing capacity, we'd 14k daily cases 12% positivity rate vs 1440 daily cases 1.2% positivity rate.

France testing 250k per day positivity rate 15%. bad Florida theyre catching people covid. 
France 6 times population Florida. Downscaling Florida's number, roughly same. 


Both Florida France can't anything anymore point. playing herd immunty card. Obesity sometimes correlate poverty. still obese people living shanty towns extremely poor countries.

You left biggest factor: age  Mondays historically low reporting days cases France. think we'd get lucky curfew meaningful impact yet... Yeah no. barely year people already saying ""fuck it"" think they'll 2?


Sorry, happening Wat No. finding shows immune system reacts vaccine, looks similar reaction real virus. 

If provides immunity still unknown. Unfortunately. soon, Phase III trial results come in. infuriating. Countries summer think decent strategy second wave, instead people insisted Corona over.  located? despite well funded, fairly well public district included everyone bag came closings. children like daughter IEp gened forget getting exclusion even more. Honestly, definitely localized waves spikes, different areas waves different times, there's really much value discussing wave country unless manage seriously reduce cases across whole country comes back later, something done.  last 72H, 311 deaths 35,611 new infections according official wish USA could get board this.

And Even Bay Area, ""essential"" offices open employees seated 10 feet away 8 hours unmasked. 

I thought bay area safest place rn. Everyone N95s people used wearing fires. friend lives SF told everyone required wear mask indoors outdoors, assumed required everywhere. guess wrong. depends much power want EU - authority delegated national governments act, there's nothing do. healthcare workers suffers government general public right thing?

These doctors walk away. big 10 sucks ‚ÄúI look elongated ‚Äî exacerbation ‚Äî original first wave,‚Äù Mr Fauci said Yahoo! Finance's Markets Summit.

This event that's happening today (Monday). Here's another source: Almost covid deaths come people 80 years old. Get rid part population, problem. Well beyond that. Vaccines supplement masking NPIs, replacement. bright side, it‚Äôs probably mostly anti-science conservatives testing positive. Maybe finally wake up. Read headline; first thought surprised this. Crazy times. Murica! screwed. I‚Äôve basically become numb feeling boredom, became new normal. Going honestly kinda weird, also extremely exciting get back somewhat normal life. fucken hardware stores

I hardware store stayed open amount thanks got back early days amazing. best one got ""man guys werent open id shitting lawn.""

Some stuff ridiculous. H1N1 terrible many young people, knew guy high school died close friend hospitalized almost week it. took seriously younger asthma, somehow lucked catching got vaccine, despite attending college time.

Part reason H1N1 hurt young people disproportionately H1N1 antibodies, 1/3rd adults did, due exposure older H1N1 viruses (of 1918 flu pandemic H1N1 lets compare numbers. CDC estimate 2009 H1N1's numbers, follows:

""From April 12, 2009 April 10, 2010, CDC estimated 60.8 million cases (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) United States due (H1N1)pdm09 virus.""

Source: still even year Coronavirus since first case hit US, already 223,000+ confirmed deaths 461,0000 2x hospitalization count, 10x deaths (even take high number estimation 18,000).

So taking numbers account, least 5x worse H1N1 flu hospitalized you, number still taking account next 5 months come year since first reported death Coronavirus (Feb 29, 2020), increase.

And that's mitigation efforts. even try mitigate H1N1 2009, mandate mask wearing anything. remember best ever saw done college installing hand sanitizer stations.

If done absolutely nothing year, numbers would lot, lot worse.

And throw ""well numbers like H1N1 like flus"", still isn't, least unless go back way 1918, hundred years ago.

CDC website estimated (not confirmed, estimated, inflated numbers) numbers past flu seasons going back 2010, past 10 years, worst flu season past 10 years resulted estimated 61,000 deaths US. We're already coming pretty close 4x number, still year look worst flu pandemics US (excluding 1918 flu, terror), two come anywhere close, 1957 H2N2 ""Asian Flu"" virus killed estimated (not confirmed) 116,000 US 1968 H3N2 virus killed estimated 100,000 people time gotten anywhere close bad flu (yet still less half bad) 60 years ago, actually worse 100 years ago. Medicine treatments changed quite bit since then. doubt would significantly worse zero mitigation without modern medicine (of ventilators one things). seems like were. seems like guys indeed careless They're pointing Covid somewhat robust, live outside host prolonged period time. They're asking characteristic Covid impact vaccine's effectiveness?

NOTE: idea answer is, I'm restating question. Overall, biggest problem inconsistency plan, also messaging. awful. Even countries like Sweden, different plan - still able cogently deliver it. Instead, US crap shoot. ray sunshine you're, imagine depressed hell come pass europe.


wonder depressed hell?

considering europe *worse* America year, right. /s.   Gift horses jazz Batch ten time. ""no old normal"" predictions go either way. really say quite ambiguous best, highly dependent context given (for instance, see BoJo's ""build better Britain"" speech, really little pandemic). worry *governments* ones getting way normalcy, think *people* themselves.  much cold since retiring disabled office job.

Also secondary objectives would control rate infection death rate. achieved, second generation vaccines, majority pre-clinical trial start human trials help prevent infection spread.

Yes, agree COVID far deadly flu, reason infecting people **novel coronavirus**, meaning 0% population residual antibodies previous infections working vaccine treatment start. true, Brazil, one worst countries Latin America sewage water system, second country world worst number deaths (150k).
This article stupid already Restrictions months end end sight would cause fatigue? knew! /s Fauci say whatever wants till he's blue face, can't stop inevitable reversal public perception vaccines rolled en masse, he's hard enough time stopping even without vaccine.

Who think politicians listen to, lobbyists constituents rebelling social distancing measures Fauci? Yes rhetorical question. Personally, I‚Äôd rather take little longer endure trial done properly. There‚Äôs reason not,slot takes two years drug study. couple months isn‚Äôt enough see long lasts long term side effects. China, South Korea New Zealand mostly open months lol, isolated areas lockdowns even long. using China example already lost ""government"" problem, trump problem. ""Government"" plan would helped, trump threw away refunded office Anyone else trying date pandemic? far I've good luck hanging patios, lousy weather moving general fatigue dinner dates anyway I'm loss moving forward. I'd love go bowling something... People even completely isolated lock down. Masks, crowds, indoor restaurants/bars, stay home sick, wash/sanitize. That's IT! could control thing. people go bars crowded events. Can't help themselves... China robust lockdown monitoring seems impossible implement country resistant wearing masks... may tempting say approach taken NYC, purely application hindsight. Without testing, little reason say NYC merited type intervention major cities US not.

The failing Trump admin testing cannot understated, need point places like Wuhan demonstrate better way. early March, Canada performed larger number tests US had, despite US obviously considerably resources available obviously 10x higher population manage (see link source). initial decision allow CDC perform tests hard see anything effort control information flow, consistent admin's approach treating covid political risk, public health risk. course started late, fucked initial test authorized state/local/private entities run tests far late catch early signals.

NY state announced general lockdown within week first death. argue places like NYC locked sooner, talking days... time already late. testing available, would much different situation. CDC guidelines feb early March allowed people travel history China exposure confirmed case qualify test regardless symptoms unless hospitalized. meant people travelling Europe exhibited symptoms, need hospitalization, refused tests. know exactly type cases led spread NYC, course Cuomo even Di Blasio speaking feds refusal approve local  care public health, replying worst mental health event recent history saying ""get yourself"" way prove it.

If care covid mental health, actually care public health, looking find victim. Look carefully people like Dr Fauci word statements. encourage, blame. point towards endgame, coming soon. give realistic timelines, act like high school bully.

Absolutely. live college town put 2 week stay home order undergrads people 18-22 make 70% cases county right now. course none following though! WTF? People try cloth grocery store? concern whether many high risk people advised get vaccinated. Many high risk due immunocompromised sometimes can‚Äôt get vaccines. Pregnant people either first line advised get due lack tests pregnant people. I‚Äôm also curious kids vaccinated anytime soon, due lack current research safety vaccine kids. I‚Äôm trying pessimistic, curious work kids know many people want-to-be-vaccinated-but-unsure-if-medically-safe boat. one blame ourselves. got fucking comfortable nearly nonexistent stats June July people gave up. state government blindly adamant getting kids physically schools, ongoing false narrative ""parties"" causing problems. new case 7 day average gone 500 925 less month, becoming increasingly bullshit blame 6k+ cases week ""parties"". 

Our Governor went TV weeks ago told everyone rise cases predicted, hospitals equipped it. also said would consider rolling back reopening phases hit 7 day average 5.0% tests conducted, given day would mean 3000+ new cases day. think he's drastically underestimating population density fast get point anything pump brakes. sad thing is, people actually believe this. see hospitals truckloads bodies can't bothered take precautions one hand, bothers idiots. hand, view watching darwin action. danger releasing vaccine work harmful FAR outweigh benefit getting functional vaccine couple months early. platitudes going feel empty coming years look spaces family gathering missing people, friends go specific friend missing picture , look phones matter many times certain person calls answer.  


These assholes letting people love die actively encouraging live way kills them. Well, young person Switzerland:

The people, least interact with, want government finaly something. radicaly.

But, heaven capitalism government trying anything ""muh econumy!!1!¬°1!!""

Its messed fuck Pedialyte McDonald's hashbrowns at.

I've got 15 days sobriety I'm hoping keep it. broke long streak (555 days) weeks ago hard get back track. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll give personal opinion: Isn‚Äôt cheaper easier invest cure rather vaccine?‚Äù 

and personal means uninformed Well partner waiting test result, he‚Äòs sick, awful, yet mom called said mask personal choice. C19 nothing like flu, except it‚Äôs like flu. Wait... Agreed - 'ready' mean mass-produced distributed health care personnel place administer. Still ... progress progress.   "" dont waste time speaking w/ ""

disingenuous people like seen barley phase 3 seems kinda reckless make claims. Maybe maybe trying give people hope.  point makes sense. So...you think hits threshold momentum, runs wild? re-state theory ratio instead number cases, fraction would guess tipping point? dime, government money. Pandemic fatigue started first day ‚Äúlockdowns.‚Äù It‚Äôs made worse don‚Äôt follow regulations (and lack leadership too) wish best, colleague. also work hcs still hunt hats rdr2 ... since February! bad weeks. problem is, government wont tell people ‚Äòtry better time!‚Äô, population stopped caring. that‚Äôs true, but:
- one forced make statements clue. Admitting early say things would smarter choice
- knew February least highly contagious quite risky respiratory virus. lockdown new science, known millennia. clear strategy communicating impossible. sure...it‚Äôs college students  Texas one vocal opponents lockdowns masks?

What wrong guy running place? I'm Chinese feel sorry Americans follow advice scientists can, I'm feeling guilty whatsoever. virus first broke Wuhan, see single kind message social media westerners wishing wellbeing Chinese people. single one. Instead got sorts racism media back february march busy writing opinion pieces gloating saying [""Democracies better fighting nerve complain Chinese people wuhan celebrating went all. 

So, guilty? Fuck no, I'm barely managing tell get caught schadenfreude all. World War One supposed Christmas 1914. get something don‚Äôt believe exists? Considering devastating covid across life responses it, really wish open least discussing approach early on.

When signing vaccine registry US (so far didnt qualify needed demographic group called), assumed would likely include intention exposure, least group. 

Obviously testing approach worked around people reach unintended exposure I‚Äôd gladly accept direct risk reduce others really get something like normal back faster. sounds like awesome system. worry secure there's vulnerabilities could expose personal info. try change conversation -- said people pay high taxes state provide support, Illinois pay high taxes. problem Illinois providing support. state said ""you're allowed work, we're going help you"". point, option people have? point doesn‚Äôt become people‚Äôs fault becomes fault never mounting effective response.

You can‚Äôt ask people give year lives. part plan... Yes, prefabs still significantly better equipped average field hospital. even many deaths.

I would think rest world would've somewhat learned deal respiratory disease like SARS without deal directly. Maybe much faith. watched video yesterday 7:23 asks trump supporting nurse. tell pauses knows truth, decides care anyway. says herd mentality, immunity you‚Äôre placing deadly items products doesn‚Äôt matter frequently it, matters know capable right circumstances.  see community spread drop almost zero take mine off.  Yeah obviously difficult. means impossible, say anxiety issue and/or friends relationship insane. It‚Äôs like lack virus containment detrimental stocks (and economy) long term! nations leaders take advice scientists advisement... That's spirit! People think IFR set - varies lot, skyrockets virus smashed health system down. governments power offer massive testing masks recommendations beginning. Instead chose nothing. eastern provinces higher population densities rest country isolated like sort island seem presume. 

You try dismiss want ways manage virus successfully implemented eastern provinces thus far. Stonk man happy about?

If there's vaccine announced tomorrow science looks good, I'm it.

I'm saying announcement happens election, automatically allay many suspicions politically-driven, rather scientifically-driven, announcement. US may good job spread out. wait see. really matter early hard it. Lockdowns postpone inevitable. lockdown eventually ends, cases going rise again. 

We've seen places like Taiwan New Zealand... case, virus find way back even shorter time, Mizoram island. *The entire South blushes*

Throw ""We're Americans God help us defeat it"", slap guy ballot 2024 confusing buzzword mean thousands different things depending scientists talks too. 'the science' close restaurants keep things (grocery stores, schools etc) thousands infections happen, open?

Science vague, confusing buzzword. look research, methods data established scientists field spend careers specific topics say. Following Science listening musings unqualified person TV show. looking people specific field study seeing people done research and/or people everyone listens great research produces data vetted reproduced labs scientists field. confusing vague. can't bullshit way good science work. 

What do, left people understand virus spread tell us spread rate this, thing. leadership country sits decides that, amount people get sick weight public policy realism implementing policy.

There balance everything justify everything science, understanding balanced public policy. Not, ""fuck it, keep everything open hope kill half million people!"" that, china built 2 1,000 bed hospital shelters 2 weeks. point trying shut reopen like wack mole game going work, need build hospitals...everyone running re-election saying spending billions infrastructure make millions jobs, now? 9 months build hospital built 0. Like said, must difficult simple go life taking everything perfectly literally. again, person handwaving ""anxiety"" you. might want get checked since seem obsessively fixated concept. well near blast radius. NZ share border china.

Neither Australia...

But, set record straight, 400,000 Chinese nationals visited New Zealand 2019. That's average 1,000 per day. Practically would entered country largest city, Auckland. much chance COVID arriving anywhere else... did.

The difference handled arrived, got here.

By way, never said anything bad Vietnam Hong Kong handled virus. indeed best world (if best). fact, Australia.

I pointed seems strange exclude New Zealand list countries handled second wave well, using excuse never proper second wave stopped could happen. virus don‚Äôt believe exists??? I've left wire hanger home. Eh, work strategy major bank know Covid thinking. aren‚Äôt catastrophic. 

The worse Corona cases now, bigger stimulus, puts floor. cities states likely targeted 2-4 shutdowns instead happened March. location hasn‚Äôt really hit twice waves, either. It‚Äôs generally different cities regions. Colorado. They're starting switch fully remote schools larger cities. seems totally irrelevant. Unless deflect examining going now. different infection rates vectors, made political football given on. that, china built 2 1,000 bed hospital shelters 2 weeks. point trying shut reopen like wack mole game going work, need build hospitals...everyone running re-election saying spending billions infrastructure make millions jobs, now? 9 months build hospital built 0. thinking this, too. already sweeping upwards US fear get worse &amp; worse. Especially holidays coming up. thinking this, much news genune "" good news"" much news make stock Market happy ? 


there really can't profitable announcement ' "" cure way "" right ? Restaurants shouldn‚Äôt open person dining right now. We‚Äôve taken half assed approach. That‚Äôs happens there‚Äôs virus containment Agreed. minimum, foresee standard practice cold flu season. imagine many people would find mentally difficult stay house 7 months? That's motto whole year tbh. much easy get bogged unending misery. try check privilege time time remember home, covid proof job, food case can't get internet connection. everyone lucky I'm eternally greatful shoes, even though I'm high risk working healthcare! US enough testing that. Anxiety? Eh we'll prescribe depression meds Epic insight, get rekt humans. links provided

Right. don‚Äôt owe links *your own* questions goalposts. choose sate *your own* curiosity [or cordially invite source/cite here. Perhaps I‚Äôll even discuss you. :) So, anything say, desperate respond could insult me? Exactly... found site tells 4 000 ICU almost 30 000 hospital peak: One thing also helps wearing mask outside norm covid. Vietnamese lives US travels vietnam 2-3x year (we 2 business wife‚Äôs family there), honestly baffles dumb Americans are. Like wearing mask isn‚Äôt going kill you, fact wearing mask would kill you. ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù important. 

In vietnam, everyone wears mask. still freedom. best part people aren‚Äôt dropping like flies left right. ""hospital truthers"" now? understand there's spike Poland. Strict testing guidelines screwed Europe already spring. Anything covid-19. Abso-fucking-lutely. disagree lot friends handle pandemic agree needed fucking consistency, transparency, higher-quality messages. 

The approach US start pandemic scattered, hard follow understand science behind it. seemed like pick side stick it, discourse allowed. Fuckin weird US effectively island nation moment. waited Nov 3rd get tested. Mondays last 98 days used check stimulus news every day, even bother bc know coming anytime soon. I‚Äôm introvert. means need alone tine social stuff recharge. really miss social stuff. wanna go metal gig drink beer pals. 

I think I‚Äôve enough quiet time year rest natural life isn‚Äôt. comment removed. value stocks getting decimated today. Could really forgive died trip? they'll say inevitable anyways gotta live it

They've already said that. 

Remember Katrina gutted New Orleans nation refused help let half city rot disappear?

Everyone know saying ""well fault choosing live there"".

Americans absolutely, entirely selfish. resturants! can't believe stupid people Also, rushed hospitals like even good, especially doctors nurses staff them. basically glorified hotels quarantine sick people in.  took said literally completely missed point. YES. Friends left London 10/1 sister left Brussels 10/13. said, laws left Mexico. convinced people likely losing touch reality.

But nobody said people same? people that, close 100k new cases day. OP said ""many people"" same, totally agree. Many people know taking pandemic seriously staying home. Yes bring on. Need stay good spirits. Yikes..... always found tv show hangovers exaggerated, hell guys drink make worse that? drink ton water bed passed wake two hours! cases HK imported China.

In fact, HK exported cases China. Hoot hoot flew locations US past month?  Ah, yes, virus knows Christmas. Yeah might dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever seen someone say Covid it‚Äôs top ten. clearly Trump's fault. Sucks ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù couple weeks enjoying near zero requirements month - right back enjoying almost zero guidelines. masks, indoor dining, schools fully open, minuscule risk vulnerable.

I‚Äôd rather lockdown every couple months couple weeks go back normal months end instead bullshit rest world experiencing.  joke, exactly Texas rep wears eye patch said night interviewed. Well suggest hmmmm? Ok tied worst.... joining downvotes! :) scary know share king soopers. people orbits make sad me. many people went store threw fit mask? Fucking infants. come Poland short money said got 'huge financial support' ?

Getting money back isnt 'huge financial support' whats going wrong EU allegedly supporting yet dire ? No, likelihood vaccine provide sterilizing immunity, meaning able avoid becoming infected virus gets system. happen immune system primed deal it, vaccine prevent severe illness, likely even make mild it‚Äôs asymptomatic. virus could still spread case, you‚Äôll need keep masking distancing least public health authorities longer advise so. think first batch vaccines gets released public, whether first responders vulnerable, society drop covid guidelines whole. Even though it‚Äôs right thing do, word gets spread manipulated gets passed around Even went intense lockdown modeled Victoria's?   think ELI5 place:
They decide gets chance fight lives ICU left die. apply anyone needing ICU care, COVID cases. I'm done feeling sorry people. Good riddance. do, however, feel incredibly terrible people circles right things caught anyway fucking chunguses decided needed jitterbug. Fuck die yourselves, losers. nurse northeastern US. looking forward saying goodbye family/girlfriend staying hotel (paid employer) awhile. looking forward longer hours increased number shifts. looking forward trauma, suffering, death hospital staff patients family members experience again.   Depends it‚Äôs probably accurate look age distribution population. Nigeria (just using example) 55% population age 20. median age years 17.8. 

Germany another example 17.9% population aged 20. median age years 45.5. 

If die COVID likely age 65. Using CDC numbers early October, deaths 24 younger accounted 0.22% COVID related deaths US. Yes US rest world *some limited* info countries still unprepared - why? China still telling airborne contagious well March!

China good job taking care themselves, really cares censorship lies screwed rest world? I'm States, judging old comedy movies, kids sit Santa's lap talk good presents stuff, they?

If so, would one heck vaccine efficacy test. Exactly. Let us use Ireland guideline one worst globally managed this. Remember, hoax virus fake... /s article literally says, ""Professor Hill, founder director University Oxford√≠s Jenner Institute, admitted timing tight begin vaccinations Christmas √± insisted indeed possible."" article leads someone believe Christmas real possibility, even likely, article clarifies total confirmation. Furthermore, later goes suggest early 2021 even spring 2021 it'll roll out. Additionally, look articles story, one, goals optimist ones scientists. 

I'm trying negative, want vaccine ASAP, I'm pointing misleading articles vaccine articles have, ironically later clarify elaborate text.  discuss fighting virus, ""oh Democrats politicized it"" would think places visited places already popular, also happen full people don‚Äôt believe pandemic real big deal. could see many places would surging without him. city one place, visited Friday, full antimaskers people think it‚Äôs somehow democrat hoax.  US like 8 million cases. too! Come August! might stupidest thing I‚Äôve ever read. Fuck it. I‚Äôm gonna die get vaccine. I‚Äôm gonna die don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôm gonna die get coronavirus, maybe won‚Äôt kill me, something else will. COVID vaccine can‚Äôt nearly dangerous driving lunatics I95 MA, fuck it, put body.

We‚Äôre sacks meat got accident waiting *something* come along fucking murk us.

I guess slightly intelligent take yeah, it‚Äôs hard little anxious this. gotta read science data see seems safe.

I tell wouldn‚Äôt getting one Russian COVID vaccines. 

But good chance get one US approved ones. That‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm tired snitching shaming that‚Äôs taken place pandemic. people bad ones go huge parties without masks. Bonus info: knowing bad is, government decided go human rights banned abortion - prenatal test shows pregnant CronenbergBaby? Well, shit happens, gonna bring world see suffers.

Edit: suprise suprise! caused massive protests arround country. pandemic. pensioner part mean? Could worked states option close borders. Worked states anyways. Congrats 0 daily count. happens cases spike again? continue again? genuinely stopped believing karma year, I‚Äôm wondering delayed bit. remain skeptical, happens deny reality. Imagine actually listening Bolsonaro regards covid home country, mask wearing norm mostly protect air pollution sun damage. convenient preventing Covid huge issue infections transmitted respiratory droplets. Right wing countries getting absolutely fucked covid, name iconic duo. It‚Äôs kind really company. J&amp;Js pharmaceutical company actually known Janssen pharmaceutical purchased Belgian pharmaceutical company name Janssen. It‚Äôs operated almost entirely independently people consumer products. Fuck. Wigilia going doom country. There‚Äôs way they‚Äôre going keep people churches mass gatherings holidays üòê Feels wrong upvote record setting numbers I'll leave comment instead. wish best neighbors across sound. Keep good work virus stay safe! going US next 4 weeks so.

Anyplace that's lagging behind going get fucked Thanksgiving unless something massive changes US.

Get flu shot, get ready long winter. luckily saw last year Roterdam would tank another 5000 kind stimulus election. we‚Äôre honest though... obesity major co-morbidity coronavirus.

Forcing people eat less would certainly reduce death rate coronavirus. Ignorant thing say bury head sand. likely going bad winter. Prepare able to. 

Also, nice assume want lots death something disagree. I‚Äôve heard take solid 9-12 months get good access/coverage vaccine. Stay cozy folks. Why? Mid-2022 perfectly reasonable estimate. lot people love fact could patriotic duty save lives sitting home, watching Netflix, browsing sub dreading return normal rejoin world. Good job soldiers! source seems wrong then. never 9k per day, average can't high.

Or mean 9k per week? would also wrong low. first concert back tour two hours away i'm planning reserving tickets

only dude could make cry CDC guidelines B- I'm going donate double unit 2 weeks I'm eligible again. ""flattening curve"" messaging short-sighted resulted moving goalposts, anyone logical sense could see endgame we're seeing results.

The goal hold hospitals good, goal became wait till there's therapeutic treat it, wait vaccine. western world individualistic compared Asia, jive voluntarily restricting life year+. gonna entire world rate except lucky countries 41,000 people currently hospital US (link below). Previous highs April July 70,000. Facts facts, US hospitalization currently down.  few, definitely. state rep one them. He's fucking awesome remarkably intelligent. opposite effect. makes efforts seem futile. fuck supposed mean. *Experiencing now*, ftfy both... ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I mean... lol

How this? time, ever gets results first first get implemented. Italian give clear example idiotic attitude: 

Back June (or May, time gets confusing year) Greece planning allowing tourists European countries come without quarantining. Italy originally included list countries allowed. Italian foreign minister (who IQ armchair, that‚Äôs beside point) started complain this, even went Athens ask lifted. Italy eventually added safe travel list.

Flash forward August, people started blame youngsters going abroad holiday recent spike cases.  newly pregnant. able get covid vaccine comes out? know high risk pregnancy wasn‚Äôt sure even give vaccine it. Stay home, Miners! sure exact number he's done 100 back back daily press conferences.

I idea daily throughout. thought weekdaily sure, that's insane. Guess required everyone lockdown.

Meanwhile Fauci US coronavirus taskforce concerns online week, president attend... (sorry topic, blows mind putting context world leaders).  hoping go 10k range entrance hall hospital...waiting MRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) extremely easy mass-produce scalable. adenovirus-vector ones J&amp;J Oxford/AstraZeneca harder mass-produce. use logic: possible situation would even worse without earlier lockdowns.

just wear winter coat still feel cold mean go outside naked snow Dude, get it, people disregarding safety public using freedoms excuse. don‚Äôt talk shit people want rights, may seem trivial many, many people died trying make sure guaranteed us.  assuming past everyone caring all. That's wholly untrue, back government much stricter less fussed freedom human rights, thus better getting people follow orders. two days ago, sick, got tested, called, talking partner said things like president should‚Äòve done better job, started defend him. could guessed grammar police well.

I‚Äôm guessing doesn‚Äôt leave bedroom, neck beard spectrum arent even *close* US numbers. 52k cases France equivalent **263k** cases US adjusted population differences.

France getting walloped right Forgot 19th century philosopher's name suggested grind babies poor common folks high protein meal feed working masses. proposed becuase upper echelon debating pass policies manage growing poor classes commoners came dozens comments indicating poor drain society taxes etc. grinding babies poor sustainence mathematically would bevome net positive society instead drain.

Maybe everyone 30 read proposal zap afterwards? Millennials rise we've enough articles telling us ruining everything buying avocado toast truckloads. hope Anti-vaxers small enough spread-out group factor since virus doe snot seem mutate much least heard changing much, maybe, maybe reduce cases much first 5 years really issue that. knows change time. Yeah, agreed. really looking metric. 

Not timeline. Mate, purview. GMP lab, handed pipeline product complete. produced GMP environment, could end contaminants (e.g. cyanide, dust, bacteria, etc.). I'm real sure contributing society much is... sure downvoted. first vaccine gets approved mean pandemic over. effective vaccine? long effective for? enough people decide get vaccine uncontrolled community spread stopped? Vaccine approval significant milestone, finish line. RemindMe! 5 months ""How's Australia looking, since control well, sirfirehydrant?"" true Americans French too. I'm French, people still making effort limit spread. even understand government thinking anymore, basically nothing. 6-8% Italy hosptials broke. awful. Don‚Äôt worry people doing. Focus need keep safe. Right, family don‚Äôt go anywhere quarantined since February 29th. time go mask. can‚Äôt spread can‚Äôt catch it, treat outside world like it‚Äôs contaminated.
 
But I‚Äôve seen suggest, cover exhaust mask too. No, tend pretty compliant populations. government tells something generally it. even read said? said need take measures *right now,* next year widespread distribution vaccines complete hospitalizations deaths virtually non existent, absolutely reason keep masks distancing. want time comes, means, please. won‚Äôt stop you. forcing people after, key word AFTER, in, end pandemic virus becomes endemic, absolutely ludicrous basis reality. missed part anywhere America contact tracing 30% compliance rate, exactly people knowing exactly got virus doesn‚Äôt present symptoms days.

That's many people leery vaccine. Depends define Age. Someone who‚Äôs 17 see differently someone who‚Äôs 65. Yeah I'm asshole. probably one whiners calling people stupid complaining can't go Chili's. Spain never called Hoax. There's nothing authoritarian enforcing public health measures. different locking murders, exactly violators public health measures are.  Bruh tasty burger gone? want go every rock concert playing area 3 months. Lately want night watch old concerts pretend still exist I'm going.

It‚Äôs flu

A respiratory illness isn‚Äôt airborne

It‚Äôs seasonal (I think reasoning Southern Hemisphere wasn‚Äôt getting slammed, Southern Hemisphere much warmer lower population, mention still spreading) Dude. live here. non-essential businesses closed went on. Non essential retail closed. recommendations wfh possible. nephews work construction didnt miss day work. hcs. misinformed. would assume would reverted first next sensible president, either days away 4 years + days away. Yeah, one predicated like causal chain firmly established 8 months! Mouth breathers finally get pay day due Spain reporting weirdly:

On Monday reports cases Friday, Saturday Sunday.

But reported cases need dates, Spain consider ""case date"" date diagnosis made, reported.

In words: comparing Spanish cases huge mess.

Worldometer tries keep track everything clear mess data comparable countries. case Spain needs keep updating old data getting correct 

This worldometer states:

""Data provisional subject change. Data Oct. 16 reflects latest release official ""Historical Series Cases Autonomous Community"" dataset Ministry Health [source]. Oct. 17 onward, values daily new cases based analysis newly reported cases. weekly case figures, previous revisions provided Ministry Health. Since validation process takes time complete, cases expected revised retroactively weekly historical dataset published Ministry Health Thursday, Oct. 29.¬†""

And Spain reported 52K cases today Worldometer data extraction reflects 45K last 3 days. rest past days.

EDIT: actually guess. knows sure. I'm wondering why, source worldometer data ministry, worldometer 58K cases Spain official data... dinner place usual 3 friends like every week. One already corona 3 us live alone. Well day one fever, gets tested surely enough corona. wait 5 days get tested, negative. 10 days since wondering either asymptomatic spread much less likely may immunity already somehow. fake, also manufactured Chinese lab.

Saying otherwise wrongthink.

edit: /s Yeah nah mate that‚Äôs works.

Besides restrictions eased, never lost freedoms first place. kids 14 smart work, MUST smart work.

While agree, way enforce this. companies shuffle job descriptions shit like make look like can't work home least always. Italian companies evil handle case parents working chance smart work? way handle parent kid quarantined less 14. Stay home paid.

Stay home paid months again? 200% debt lot unemployment right hard find someone.

Sure, pick random people state spend money (2 billions) bars restaurants would much better invest money prevent exploding.

No matter many times repeat mantra schools, occasions spreading virus disappear. would spend money *both*, closing schools keeping restaurants full August change invest money training teachers

Neither time money would enough. Who's going PCs, help families one computer per kid

They could opportunity make school better, teachers better prepared comes technology.

Not months, managed many paid tables wheels

Meme argument fools, new furniture also makes schools better unless think they're going burn two years over, neither anything could done small amount money would made lasting difference, multiple years whole State balance take improved schools, right Italy's economy steps collapse. Mitch McConnel green new deal desk title scribbled red ink ‚ÄúCoronavirus stimulus‚Äù written below. 

To act though Nancy passed wasn‚Äôt poison pill disingenuous. naive prepare winter, given almost pattern spanish flu waves.

People constantly repeating ""this like flu"", ""the virus novel"", summer rather glorious lockdowns brought infection levels down.

If something cannot blame governments counting likely possibility virus seasonal like every coronavirus circulation way many experts, ""mathematical modellers"", hobby epidemologists, loud mouths press smart arses general telling to. Trying hard guys know saying 6 months now? waiting broken clock right? Chur bro. hope able fly NZ real soon say gidday flat white pie. Actually easier fight deadly viruses since easy isolate infected people - simply get worse die quite quickly (that's sad part). modern healthcare significantly easier contain. Covid-19 pandemic infectious acute people, spread easily got shit together. worlds happiest place atm. Research shows 75% people asymptomatic Covid passport proxy. Netherlands airlifting patients Germany yesterday. guess also space problems. Get dog mask right? LOL!!! Got ya  Tricky wording let clear, saying average lower likelihood player contract coronavirus team structure accountable themself, yes.

Also, no, get paid either way. get paid play minus $150,000 opt check. Yeah it‚Äôs hard keep attention children also hard parents done shit help kids act like somehow teachers magic wand inside classroom. Parents kids most; 30+. 

I tell last year school, literally put pencils kid‚Äôs hands much learned helplessness due parents. seeing Zoom majority kids act classroom y‚Äôall *seeing* first time, instead pushing school building whining us don‚Äôt A‚Äôs. even want know extensively accommodate, *coddle death* average students American schools‚Äî giving buckets chances parents lacked teaching children lick self-sufficiency expectation trying go school. know, poor kids Title I, understand talking point used wealthier people open schools. large far it‚Äôs mediocre suburban kids shitting bed parents haven‚Äôt seen it‚Äôs shoved faces.

If want teachers frontline workers, pay risk. Pay subs risk. bedridden months you, eventually recover. Look cancer survivors bounced back chemo example.

And got every one case like that, hundreds even thousands 20-somethings got sick fine shortness breath couple months. 

It's rational fear getting COVID stuck hospital months way rational fear getting car accident. scary happens, fear let control life.  Yeah, BNO back covering daily updates. That‚Äôs typically ‚Äúyikes‚Äù territory feared enough people Guess thats gonna change foreseeable time come !-) Damn, hoping see reinfections Jan/Feb 2021. wanted least year post infection immunity. /u/tb0x I'm sooooo convinced now. XD Thanks, feel quite proud ourselves. I‚Äôm sorry, regardless NEED another national level Slow Spread action. Downvote want. I‚Äôm sure what‚Äôs happened sub it‚Äôs conservative bots striking mention anything US lockdowns OMG everyone wants get nasty. don‚Äôt get reddit sometimes. Anyway. Like said need another type major mitigation effort. It‚Äôs late despite I‚Äôve read ignorantly told threads. Italy second wave, US still first wave.  that's problem. People giving help stop.

I go grocery store 6 people there. 2 masks, 2 masks chin, 2 without masks. We're getting shit control like that. state ban apply U.S. citizens, covid19 passport.  exercise local park 9am 5pm anymore? Question is: going star inevitable movie Drug Trial? I‚Äôm guessing Benedict Cumberbun play leading scientist. Hopefully not. Australia proved free country. Actually thankful corona exposing shitholes

Me vibing Sydney every aspect life untouched pandemic also making livable wage working supermarket. üíÉüíÉüíÉ Surely wearing masks plane? Yeah somehow think every country world teamed Dems killed tons people everybody wanted president Whitehouse calling would go way beginning, typical governments take inch, mile, instead honest start. support 6+ months shit know it. Including Trump. Although generally eyes actively sucking aerosol mist, unlike nose mouth, shield generally away face glasses lenses great comparison... Victoria? Actually, haven‚Äôt working since September 2019 since last contract ended, living savings, debt govt aid interim.

Do want swap places pretentious ass? Whataboutism. prohibiting chewing gum obviously nothing good public health system. EU states also systems exploit foreigners screw people poor countries.

Invoking humanism democracy excuses incompetence doesnt favour.
Its Western arrogance. Precisely got us mess. dumb.. course death rate going lower expected half people taking seriously wearing masks limiting social interactions. Anywhere take virus seriously (churches, weddings, rallies, bars, etc) spikes cases hospitalizations. Anybody saying exaggerated need go back normal needs mental health intelligence checked out. think happening yesterday. I'm subscribed many forget. I've seen variety places sophisticated makes think think troll farms may involved. guarantee businesses make they're open vs they're closed Conservative Evangelists make 20% South Koreans. think us act self interest continue follow (much looser) rules. COVID safe rules pubs. Guess article wrong? [hospitals could reach limit 15 never thought hear, Poland asking Germany liberate.

FIFY relatives (not mainlanders) work China self-isolated virus first broke out. would order food/groceries rarely left house. Officials would come asking get tested refused saying never left house wouldn‚Äôt risk so. 

The officials left haven‚Äôt returned since. almost full year ago. 

I guess it‚Äôs good general purpose testing containing virus, never went compromise others‚Äô health (or own) definitely weren‚Äôt punished. wear mask even inside home, including sleep. greatest fear someone would break house middle night kill wife children, might infected COVID process. message link broken. wasnt attacking you. 

I told returned normal every pandemic history. Thats indisputable. require sort argument debate. pretty darn strong ""argument"" fact. made silly remark never alive pandemic before. argumentative get go. responded accordingly saying ridiculous.

You good day well.  nice job I‚Äôm San Diego. behavior hasn‚Äôt changed since February. 

Wear mask. Social distance (6‚Äô ish). Wash/sanitize hands often. three together. 

Avoid large groups. Stay home can. 
(Keep taking C daily) ever try make 8 year old socially distance friends wearing mask washing hands time? Kids dont that, touch things, dont want dumb piece cloth face, dont want stay away friends. things dont make sense them. First time since early March. That‚Äôs awesome. still think realize stake here. Again, ask you, willing risk kids inherit life time disability order keep status quo? 

This novel virus finding new complications arising every month, might lifetime disabilities. 

Your American entitlement shining here. children world lot less fortunate kids even schools attend.

 5 days later like ""shit..."" google get lily pads pond: I‚Äôm sure believe anymore. Reddit telling years much superior socialized healthcare system compared US‚Äôs system. would think European countries would stopped virus contained government programs now. come none happened? come Europeans never took lockdown seriously seeing higher infection rates compared Americans? flip side, Reddit also saying back March/April number infections US would hit 75 million+ Americans 5 million would die COVID... also happen.... even close lol

Quite literally everything Redditors said much better Europe handle pandemic come true whatsoever quite literally every doomsday scenario spewed Redditors US come true either. starting realize trust Redditors biased ignorant viewpoints anymore... Ill believe see it. 


Meanwhile 6 months year available general public per deployment plans getting put place... fun miami vice cosplay. live El Paso. Good people also stupid people. started quarantine (staying home) two whole months February 27. meant gf, friends, classes, exceptions.

It's amazing.

In college town least people wearing masks next town nose breathers little half plastic face shields.

This going get much much worse.  article Polish scroll bit animated diagram. great September government relaxed restrictions, covidiots started ignoring remaining precautions, schools opened. Oh, flu season started course. like NYC area April. Ambulances parked front hospitals covid patients hours, sometimes days waiting someone inside die get better. government started turning large indoor areas (sports arenas such) field hospitals. done three months ago. desperate shortage medical staff (both doctors nurses) wages low leave work countries. going dumbass anti-maskers pandemic deniers still it. worked Louisiana would fared lot better. interesting goes show you‚Äôre relatively young healthy risks bad outcome small. problem lot people relatively young healthy.

We'd rather give bailout money major airlines bought back stock. last American presidential debate, mentioned '21 would masks distancing '22 sunset. However, also news. here's hoping. economy relies heavily

hmmmm. dunno. Maybe try way:

""when economic system(s) result severely skewed distribution wealth, matters fuckall else economy relies heavily on.""

there, that's better Never listen man named Hillary lol. Must rough childhood lol Absolutely. Inconsistency hard people keep even harder watch someone far away told it‚Äôs ok / safe enough something can‚Äôt, especially numbers better are. True indeed! sides that. America leading world testing, resulting identifying asymptomatic cases, resulting leading world infections. Death per capita better measure. don‚Äôt think huge percentages men, possibly vast majority becoming unable reproduce would bad thing? don‚Äôt need less people country, need steady population. cant build new hospital shelter? election talk investing billions infrastructure? need it? Yep IV fluids Benzos. violent reaction Ativan hospital DTs. I‚Äôm way violent person. went hospital shaking remember injecting HUGE dose Ativan. like three days later came naked hospital bed strapped down. mom told tried fight staff. Fucking nuts. Part would like think Trump inside knowledge effective vaccine really right around corner. vote him, anyone, I'm American It‚Äôs also something open secret phase III trials going swimmingly. Hence rolling review, actual approval involves examining spreadsheet that‚Äôs basically like one they‚Äôve already seen, enough rows pass high statistical threshold. marketing approval formally sought imagine it‚Äôll turned around within week, maybe even 24h clear looking range countries there, relative responses current situations, imho clear people deserving blame areas largest outbreaks relevant national governments. 

For example, APAC nations took seriously, almost fine. Likewise Europe see different outcomes based responses. countries first impacted (hence arguably less able respond), three standout performing poorly initial wave -- Belgium, UK Sweden. notably two tried remain open approach (although UK pivoted).  Imagine distinction continue 2nd wave... legal abortion even safer natural birth [link suspect OP means cell piles actual human. Good thing government focused removing women's rights dealing public health crisis. Sorry voice reason try like full year. average person see anything till late 2021 best said nauseating extent. trying get stock market excited holidays. fundamental part it's.so.hard treat rest civilized world takes damn serious. get better covid. president put show because.hes cunt late help force counties same.... depressing see first places human mind goes state distress.

I'll interested see effect COVID EU project. Back April saw pretense European unity disappear everyone looked nation state solve problems. Borders closed, PPE exports held - suddenly one felt European. 

If Germany manages keep things control, whilst COVID runs rampant elsewhere requiring even bigger bailouts stricken economies agreed summer it'll interesting see German electorate responds. could end hook financially mistakes made countries avoided themselves. 

I suspect we'll find European Germans feel coming years. Speaking BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Fauci added vaccination ""substantial proportion population"" could ""significant impact dynamics outbreak"" may possible second third quarter 2021.

""What foresee successful vaccine continuation form public health measures, go progress months 2021, getting towards third fourth quarter, see considerable approach towards form normality,"" Fauci told Marr.

So experts right around 2022. wonder people thinking happening sooner misinformed purposely spreading misinformation. Crazy times live in. I'm big believer herd immunity strategy, basically surrender (without vaccine).

If mean - achieve herd immunity environment like prison cruise ship, everyone breathing same, recirculated air even private setting maskless? That's basically challenge trial, no: overshoot guaranteed.

But R rate low enough (by mean &lt;5), average/typical setting ‚Äî yes, get herd immunity transmission gets difficult, people immune. Potentially reason high rates infection localised general tendency quasi-herd immunity people modify behaviours, behave differently first place transmission lower.

It fair say threshold herd immunity reached different ""herds"" undermine whole concept. Either way, still long, long way herd immunity, part actively depressed transmission far. pandemic? Yes. Covid? No. happen know found info fauci recommending masks 2022? morons life need see that. *sad indonesian voice * Yeah that‚Äôs true eventually, first instant gratification. sub hard-on victim blaming ignoring privledge. Anyone ever goes outside literally Satan, say working comfort home tech company authorized WFH next August least.

The fact matter (the US) social safety net small businesses, one individuals joke. paid everyone's expenses lockdowns, we'd theoretically outbreak 2-4 weeks. Instead we'd rather give bailouts major corporations, maybe give individuals one-time check. Oh, we'll also offer pay wages small businesses we'll zero oversight money also go major corporations. Thanks pointing out. No, I‚Äôm not. ever heard Thalidomide? Look it. That's prime example company releasing medication prematurely.

Since scandal everyone wants super careful release new drugs avoid another situation like this. would rather wait vaccine takes longer work kinks take premature vaccine something nasty side effect. Dec 30, 2019, Li Wenliang sent message group fellow doctors warning possible outbreak illness resembled severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Wuhan, Hubei province, China, worked.

Days later, summoned Public Security Bureau Wuhan made sign statement accused making false statements disturbed public sent warning fellow medics 30 December police told stop ""making false later called police station, reprimanded spreading rumors online, forced to¬†sign statement¬†acknowledging ""misdemeanor"" allowed leave.

Yeah, sure thing bud. Yes, El Paso, Tx cold wave 84F night... I'm sure critical countries getting fucked right now. ""did right way"" make excuses them, doubt. thought Sweden, Netherlands. Congrats one joke  curfew help prevent overnight accidents, help hospitals bit. ICU bed useless cot staff operate it. hospital bed. life support unit highly trained staff keep people alive artificially would die without intervention. 1,000 ICU beds, enough staff operate 100 them, *100* ICU beds.

As pandemic spikes country, hospitalizations increase, staff operate beds become thinly spread, burned out, get sick, ultimately able help much needed.  Combination increased indoor gatherings, schools time high testing capacity Someone clearly hasnt ever Spain. College students college students. Stop cheek kissing. Deaths follow infections generally 2-4 weeks.

RemindMe! one month Great. 

You get car accident get flown ABQ, doesn‚Äôt work well. get reply comment made claimed I‚Äôve never France? Let‚Äôs work issues one one bad state ranging far left far right politically, urban farm land, thats wrapped rather hot summer state one lowest solo households largest population spots.

Snowy areas Northeast following rules since April/May earlier areas. Here, winter issues come homelessness rent moratorium lifted folks can't pay rent now, back work. think added end people inclined something dangerous like go without mask, feared backlash e-gang destroy reddit rep. 337, click link like trust data coming state first place. wouldn't.

Many homes also keep emergency oxygen site.

I cant help feeling would understand lot better wasnt Sweden. people gone forever, perhaps best news we've heard far. Imagine half wore right (pressing nose piece tight, covering nose), handled right (wadding pocket, touching over, pulling talk, cough sneeze) wore right material (not thin single layer gaitiers, scarf, mesh.) I'd say percentage actually ""masking"" 50% ""see"" something face. even worse  logarithmic starts look exponential... sense efficacy vaccines terms % people benefit prior trials ending? greatest concern successful vaccine found help 50-60% take it

We sense, complete picture vaccine first approved. follows efficacy determined.

Suppose 1000 people trial getting vaccine 1000 getting placebo. release 2000 back wild find 2 people control group infected. none vaccine group. 

How effective vaccine? Na√Øvely, could say 100%, vaccine group infection rate reduced 100% compared control group. However, there's significant chance observed outcome due pure chance. Even vaccine 0% effective observed outcome would still fairly probable. sample small say anything meaningful.

Now lets assume groups 10x bigger find 20 people control group infected 0 vaccine group. already say bit more. point, unlikely vaccine completely ineffective outcome reached purely chance. effective vaccine really? can't say high degree certainty 100% effective, vaccine somewhat lower efficacy would've still pretty good chance producing observed outcome. say fair amount certainty vaccine least 50% effective though.

There statistical methods use compute certain specific levels effectiveness, given observed outcome. example, allow make statements like ""with observed results, there's 95% likelihood vaccine least 70% effective"".

And statements researchers making. side table regulators asking vaccine high likelihood least certain efficacy. believe FDA asking least 50% efficacy (but know likelihood require that).

But vaccine meets standard, there's good chance vaccine considerably effective threshold efficacy. However, enough data available say sufficient level confidence.

Once data comes (the trial participants still monitored approval, although handle control group complicated issue), better estimates efficacy made. even get cold ever Miami lol, thought lows winter still like 75, wrong lol  get criticized much countries fucking exact similar ways. get why, it‚Äôs they‚Äôre powerful country west, I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt deserve it, saying French people smarter certain is, ironically, pretty stupid, considering recent history xenophobia mishandling virus. think enough precedent pandemics preparing second wave arrive. countries eradicate already instituting new things protect again. 

It's locking forever narrative trying push, safe effective controls targeted measures necessary. Australia South Korea come mind excellent examples problem arising they'd lock get numbers essentially eliminated.

Even stated lockdowns measure get plan back track, means completely eliminate it. part layered defense strategy. goal get 328 million Americans infected untenable. I'm guessing take much fill hospitals Anchorage, Fairbanks Juneau. Would canada accept patients would fly excess patients way Washington State. y‚Äôall stay inside working. I‚Äôve quarantining since March breaks üôÉ However defined feel like people dont really understanding them. live UT basically nobody wears masks :( Seriously, there‚Äôs tons game changer. Still seems like people still waiting days get results regular old PCT tests.

When rapid stuff going widely available??? saying Candida Auris resistant drugs likes hang around Corona? Sounds like fun guy doubt parents saw. still you, right? friends decide kids (or fewer kids) people street said? suspect even young people heard still went ahead many kids wanted could afford. young people '70s could afford much before. (Which guess ties back OP article.)

It's like Hare Krishnas trying recruit people chanting street corners airports around time. media lot people familiar them, much percentage population actually joined based talking street.

I doubt closed elementary schools area either. I'm impression areas overbuilt schools based idea Baby Boom-style growth would continue indefinitely. areas definitely also lost population overall '70s due declines manufacturing (e.g. see numbers childhood split Sun Belt PNW -- parents able follow jobs -- closed elementary schools lived. fact, every school went second grade portables kids buildings built for.

Colleges Washington hurting kids born mid-'70s. dorms UW mid-'90s capacity enough knew couple people ""super single"" rooms (one person living double room), still reasonably full university still turning away plenty applicants. (And starting 2000, students ""temporarily"" living shared lounges somehow seen wave kids coming junior high high school. think started building new dorms peak Millenials actually passed. Way go, guys!)

BTW, mean pick this. interesting subject pretty cool get talk Gen X once. :) house. issue living I‚Äôm NYC? remember 800 record please post easy verification?

All could find this:  Well French idea new lockdown talked medias seems ineluctable really need learn use search engine. We‚Äôve got one group arguing whatever want another arguing anything horrible. Then, depending state you‚Äôre even county within it, different restrictions what‚Äôs acceptable gathering together.

For example, Social bubbles sound great live, would still rules along indoor gathering matter piss half family half asked included. 

So ya, seems pretty clear people don‚Äôt get it, especially people don‚Äôt follow community Covid. Without reasonable semi-uniform standard, everyone justifying think right shaming think wrong. Ugh. state hardest hit Coronavirus Australia.

It's worth noting every American state done worse Victoria terms cases per capita.

I'm Aussie I'm happy living Australia. understanding saying. federal government power make laws subjects set forth section 8 Constitution (their enumerated implied powers). 10th amendment clearly spells areas governance left states. Masks defense, treaties, money, duties, taxes, interstate commerce. Therefore, falls states. live there‚Äôs definitely fatigue. people wear masks public, part, unless trying belligerent. tired burnt out! Friday lab received 200 covid swabs one nursing home. include covid tests inpatients, clinics daily basis 24/7. Today another 115 swabs expected arrive another nursing home. losing people due burnt out. hard people mask up? Even safety mandates live, please know virus highly contagious!!! god! mandatory philosophy courses school. place premium teaching students think themselves. Check people's FaceBook Twitter posts. least sending people bills. post hoax/anti-mask/it's-just-the-flu propaganda? so, get full bill insurance coverage it. worries. found it. It‚Äôs theory it‚Äôs interesting. Kind like testing sewage locate outbreaks Covid infection early. maybe someone somewhere use point. epidemiology coronaviruses change colder weather. Fall winter respiratory pathogens spread most. Yeah, thinking it.

Venezuela countries americas handled outbreak well, mean government literally calls quarantine plan ""radical quarantine"".

You could streets 8 1 pm best part year. Masks mandated everywhere hand sanitation, social distancing temperature checks every establishment.

Some places even added booth showered desinfectant going inside. I'm serious.  believe case study CDC.    (Or pay subscription, since 10 free articles / month bit meh) acceptable measure opinion bash places controlled saying they're faking numbers weird culture, sounds like top minds reddit really case. Trump also president France Argentina? People sub love shame Sweden response--and yes, made mistakes early like enough testing--but pandemic fatigue one thing see Sweden. silly people still follow simple Swedish guidelines? Sure, overall people compliant public health agency consistent long measures would last. true successful Asian countries, they're long haul delusions COVID gone summer. I'm middle aged risk factors, still reassuring see statistical chances dying 1 59k. That's 2x risk factors, still really really low. Outdoor dining low transmission probability actually idiot making fun people trying keep businesses open. bad take literally like a. 0004 chance take proper precautions. Stop shaming this, morons. Stay home thats fine people comfortable microscopic risk fine well, way risky behavior happening. It‚Äôs going dark winter everyone, best prepare yourselfs. funny people say regulated capitalism best path, asking ""if muzzle beast start, beast?"" I'm little pessimistic smoothly anything transitioned. Trump team completely disinterested transitioning _in_ smoothly. can't imagine shits they're going give way door. thought thing. I'm nowhere near well versed science can't say much can't help feeling iffy J&amp;J We‚Äôve week 1000+ cases day. People cook outs families reunions. Mayor says stores hot-spots. Haha fair enough!  Makes sense. plasma industry get around that? know test blood HIV Hepatitis. Patients told hospital blood tested HIV Hepatitis. case? high-risk people tested weekly, find clues potential outbreak. always feel like projection.  life full fear.  think said well here. think rub comes masks singled advertised single reason reduced spread. not. significantly reduce large particle transmission efficacy aerosolized particles proven.

It's opinion public health organizations pushing physical distancing reducing time exposure harder masks. proverbial game tag someone walks tags infected. equation protecting time + distance. Limit time high risk situations keep distance. Everyone needs wear mask precaution. means nothing, wont results till end year. provide least 50% immunity, wont approved. even approved Jan probably first goes health providers, take full year probably distribute enough ppl make difference. 

And vaccines wonder long term effects, studies quick determine early December think  able template normal people follow.

Yes is. Watch clip ""Our Deepest Fear"" Coach really valued individual freedom, would everything get back soon possible without infringing individual freedom (i.e. right life health) others.

What ""we"" rather quite people societies value individual freedom, i.e. freedom whatever fuck want, without regard affects people. But.. but.. Trump's guy said impossible stop it!  Right?! Poland's constitutional court decided nowhere criminalize abortion cases days ago. posted elsewhere feel necessary here, too:

**I math. US positive testing percentage per population, we'd equivalent 258,000 cases per day.**

What I'm trying say this: France dire condition. blessing would death rate much lower due promising treatments beginning. world going need billions doses. see happening span single year. We'll likely wearing masks 2022. *Frankfurter Allgemein* article go read wish USA could get board this. Even Bay Area, ""essential"" offices open employees seated 10 feet away 8 hours unmasked. People unmasked indoors conversations ""magic 6 foot rule"" think okay. USA screwed. ""bUT rIgHtS"" reason confirmed cases influence local officicals' kpi (they may fired arrested malpractice many cases) asymptomatic ones not. people showed symptoms till now, labelled asymptomatics cases. 75%. decades development people dying home never getting tested. eyes fully enclosed... say? ? oo shit! go. point small government going start imposing stay home orders mask mandates circumvent state federal government. good thing unemployment still going, going back lockdowns may go back job till 2022. anyone else read title Portland? No, me? Yes another global problem. also leads affordable housing, that's another problem together. differentiate colleges rest.  Poland order covid test prescribed doctor need have, least say have, four symptoms (no taste smell, fever, cough, fatigue). depends doctor guidelines. situation terrible surprising. yet president continues play still people go juarez (live there) it‚Äôs boggling mind  

Y'all desperate whatever thought normal was, it'd hilarious pandemic people dying. 

It ain't ever coming back way sooner everyone realizes it, sooner actually go combating instead SAVE US VACCINES THING WORK WITHOUT ANYTHING. 

We wasted summer people whined, ""I gotta summer"" instead effectively planning fall winter. People defaulted well vaccine fix everything like fucking tuberculosis still exsist even though there's vaccine it. 

Covid new tuberculosis wasted entire year think vaccine fix everything, gonna disappointed badly cost sanity still trying explain social distancing mask wearing people 7 months shit. It‚Äôs infuriating. Thank you. Isn‚Äôt flu vaccine like 40-50 percent effective? banned abortion due fetal defects. Almost abortion already banned, women carry term children short horrible lives stillbirths. 6 people allowed table, lol. I'd heard place full anxiousbois still amazing see myself. Damn beat it! Key questions need answered:

1. capacity Covid patients?
2. criteria admit?
3. number patients considered critical, ventilator.
4. number patients non-US Citizens.

Hospitals filling bed$ people would otherwise send home, people streaming across border catastrophe Mexican socialism free healthcare serious public health problem rest US.  Ding ding ding 

Exactly happening now. Imagine job security have! blog piece junk 1) Yes, everyone vested interest blood bank stocked. Everyone also vested interest blood bank stocked SAFE products.

2) I'm medical doctor specialized board-certified Anatomic Clinical Pathology. trained blood donor screening, blood donation, blood banking transfusion medicine. yes, pretty qualified arena.

3) Yep. medical laboratory training basic understanding blood banking, epidemiology infectious diseases, no, qualified judging validity blood donation rules. sub literally Coronavirus branch r/collapse Yeah I‚Äôm gonna line specific vaccine. would rather wait oxford mocking Get lmao. multiple companies phase 3 efficacy trials taking time things book. 3-4 months stage trial absolutely line normal vaccine testing process. 

Moderna hasn‚Äôt brought vaccine market yet relatively young company. cytomegalovirus mRNA vaccine verge approval prior COVID could absolute game changer world. Like ‚Äúthis type vaccine could cure AIDS‚Äù game changer.

The person you‚Äôre replying dead right.

We‚Äôve never developed vaccine thus fast simply we‚Äôve never to. entire world throwing much money possible get done, money ever spent vaccine, kidding it‚Äôs going fast. Surgical masks much better cloth masks feel justified wearing even though go trash 1 use People going vacations summer, August. Schools opening explains it, due vacations. Due vacations, crowded beaches etc got 400-500 day. got 13k schools. Bet Correct, county level. sub-national level, Xinjiang designated Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous wrong think part American culture. Americans natural contrarians. honestly think that's greatest strength worst weakness. following around trying instigate? live here, shit show. happy saying that? all, I'd love US get shit together seems like we're incapable right now. Stop reitareting island crap. live age mass air travel. RoK never barred incoming flights China. American much horrified countries response COVID, felt countries either helpfully empathetic smug fuck.

**I math. US positive testing percentage per population, we'd equivalent 258,000 cases per day.**

What I'm trying say this: France dire condition. blessing would death rate much lower due promising treatments beginning. guess that‚Äôs crux abortion debate. believe people, that‚Äôs think it‚Äôs wrong. Thanks comment aren‚Äôt fans stadium OSU (aside family, etc) danger tailgates house parties ‚Äúunofficial‚Äù stuff goes along football season university control over. People gonna people football season always good excuse act dumb. get thing 2021 works well hope it‚Äôll one greatest achievements human history lockdown fully next week, reach April levels. 

They already 500 dead day pretty much locked current trajectory, goal avoid another doubling. Oh rest world known long time. political thing. thing true flu before. what. I‚Äôm sorry last comment removed! kind hateful. shame. could wanted. S'Pore also lot migrant workers. test quarantine instead ignoring problem.

 incredibly naive flattening curve months years cost less. Guy know cop. buddies voting Trump Trump ""supports cops"" Biden wants cut funding. Even though Biden stated wants increase properly train cops. General population smart. honestly people inner circle even researched presidential candidates. I'm 30, know people PhDs also relatively successful. quite sad, many know little voting for. think shows evidence doctors nurses learned lot point 

Maybe. bigger factor unquestionably fact majority people first wave covid tested therefore show case numbers. 

Actual cases April much higher July, regardless graphs say. 

Of course ratio deaths cases going different number use cases 10 100 times lower actual case number. Bad means: uncontrolled community spreading 2 3 times worse first wave, lack medical assistance serious illnesses accidents, impaired covid medical treatment due hospital overload, causing double triple deaths (still unkown) serious long term symptoms. Also massive inevitably connected rupture work, production (right everybody know 1 2 work colleagues medical leave), economic depression hear history books. first, depends Presidential Election. State directives mirror CDC guidelines (or lack one). addition, progressive states risk-averse keep masking &amp; distancing restrictions place advisory panels suggest outbreaks localized spreading across counties. contain cluster specific town region use targeted measures instead going full-on draconian state-wide. Dr. Fauci others warned we'll continue outbreaks localized areas throughout 2022 even vaccines, takes years convince everyone get immunization. Remember, still measles outbreaks limited areas strong cohort anti-vaxxers. Well guess calculate risk compare in. 1% chance die vaccine compared 1% chance dying covid. dunno gonna happen. People aren‚Äôt going give another spring summer this. believe pandemic fatigue, believe soft never enforced jail sentences.

First offense, get 1 day jail.

Second offense, get 1 week jail.

Who wants try 3rd 4th? Anyone El Paso know person schooling got extended stick Sep 8th? Seems like + Flu season kicking Honestly: Thank sign togetherness. need sub, lot less Pandelympics.  ""CNN bad."" Looks like kool-aid drinker here. Good comment. Yeah, one frustrating parts response length shutdowns, long (for one goal) short (for another), describe. wish stuck original plan lockdowns -- long enough relieve stress hospitals, longer. suspect would given governments West enough rope go back lockdown later (i.e. now) needed to, briefly. somehow goal shifted spreading cases misguided attempt eliminate virus return normal. chances succeeding highly dependent culture trying in, willing completely isolate society. West playbook. Hah lucky would really surprised given EUA‚Äôs they‚Äôve handing like Halloween candy. Hard tell FDA stops Trump admin begins say someone spent many years following FDA professional capacity. live long. much deniers brush off. winter going hell.  really neat light displays walk starting Thanksgiving. zoos great ones too. Stay safe. wonder many cases would recorded early months testing capacity now. feel like numbers wouldn‚Äôt crazy. 

There NYC antibody study estimated good portion city exposed. would bet millions cases went undiagnosed early months. 

Yes. It‚Äôs bad rural areas getting worst it, think confirmed cases numbers accurate first half this. guess I‚Äôm opining bad would right compare first half outbreak accurate data. would never happen US. hide bodies shipping containers. There's even cure flu. Sure crunch numbers want, people done complying compliance clearly falling (and people becoming less tolerable towards added restrictions). happening US EU.

Now talk difference social ending pandemic actual end. operating level certainty think unwarranted. Mid-2022 *pessimistic* estimate, sure. within bounds possibility. think fair dismiss person troll Hope you‚Äôre better! Happy didn‚Äôt perform surgery guy hallway!  Yeah buy much daily fluctuations. pattern emerges start worrying cost cutting policies like layoffs, benefit cuts, etc. Yeah, everyone. Well America going see Coventry :( analogy pointing right things, people around still behaving like irresponsible yahoos, still danger. whole thing never going completely over. virus always us. waiting wasting life. Yeah, think I'd lean towards Taiwan both. interesting poorly Western countries done general.  Americans (a relevant portion) individualistic mentality anything poses small inconvenience last long (I mean smth simple mask) rejected either right away believe lead whole ""moving goal"" strategy even end worse.
No matter good bad want look Sweden, Swedish people actions/responses 2-3 weeks late. months. China knows stupid people didn‚Äôt give chance. Welded apartment go!

I... uh.... support China one. actually mean 12 months understand? Plasma get paid donate given directly hospital transfusion use. Research laboratory reagents huge use, sometimes vaccines shots, even get iffy since go back patient.

Many vaccines don‚Äôt work elderly immune systems weakened. mean disrespect. know Americans like assume December dead winter, July dead summer. something keep mind evaluating well lockdown worked (better worse). fair, agree this. Thanks take. 7th highest Europe, 17th world. Worldwide less instructive excess death numbers many Latin American countries, South Africa Iran absolutely chain compared official numbers. Excess deaths Europe closer official rates, insignificant. Sweden seems counted deaths Clovis pretty fully. Sweden definitely upper tier (so far) death rates far developed nations go. Disagree. Look pretty much capital city Australia. Specifically Melbourne. Yeah, global warming won‚Äôt problem another 100+ years.

You can‚Äôt count. 224,000/8,540,000=2.62. that‚Äôs start. Take back Russian handlers. Wow what‚Äôs like place shit together. Asking American Wisconsin could learn thing two that. GOP still trying overturn mask mandate. overblown though statement even make sense? fact America wear masks thus virus spreads alarming rate? hope show up, need spread message ignorance - Covid-19. Maybe coming fulfillment Albert Pikes alleged words... magically disappear, Right Dumbo Donald? wearing KF94 masks Nope. flare causes minor regional lockdown that‚Äôs dealt 2 weeks locking region. even occurs. maintain bubble get life (restaurants full capacity, bars open, stadiums open) back normal. humanity doesnt deserve move on. see party party party, people dont care. instagram full party meeting friends every single days since months. Nonsense. People get infected *outside* household, bring infect others *within* households. breaking transmission *between* households, reduce spread. leaving hopes seen. Tell people you‚Äôve contact you‚Äôve tested positive. Don‚Äôt rely contact tracers. 

I tested positive 10/19. Gave names numbers health department came contact with. knew going notify myself, wanted see process. 

Not one received call.

All tested positive informed them. 

Stay safe there. He‚Äôs referring G substitution (or missense) mutation, became predominant Italy beginning believe predominant ‚Äústrain‚Äù today. don‚Äôt remember position amino acid exist.

Edit: one. ‚Äúflattening curve‚Äù supposed do, COVID least - slow spread enough hospitals wouldn‚Äôt choke. think phrase distorted, however; ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù made people feel though disease flattened (squashed) therefore, dealt with. got granola bars....guess yalls fancy. China able test, isolate contact tracing since 1 dozen 1-200 cases deal recent outbreaks.  built massive testing capacity; citizens trust government- despite knowing initial response early Jan bad. 
US currently community infections rate 5-20 %...so becomes impossible isolate contact tracing number cases. Unfortunately, much except go back lockdowns reduce community infection rate; ride til Vaccines reach regular folks- take 6 mon 3-400k lives. Airlines need ban together share list Get well soon - sorry hear symbolic gesture

Pure political posturing give first wave never dipped like hard say. know pandemic following similar deadly trends past pandemics Oct/Nov time frames see highest infection rates...this means many many many people die. really know anything you? even fault know I'm woman man. Shit, might said child, WAY KNOWING. except pro-democracy protests, marches, riots Hong Kong Thailand. marches Thailand completely filled streets.

your comment completely inaccurate.  I've heard hypothesis cleaner houses less exposure dirt pathogens might cause Polio epidemic 1950s. many kids would exposed multiple pathogens found less hygienic environments would develop immunity.

Africa certainly crowded, people spend lot time outside live sanitized conditions see Europe North America. 

I recall hospital Kenya work in. reeked disinfectant, people seemed mopping every corridor, yet reddish brown stain tracked mud everywhere. I'd hypothesize exposure exercises immune system (if kill first). here? happened live, hospitals still empty be. http://en.letters.kremlin.ru/ know.

edit: Oh, FoxNews CEO said passengers board, going quarantine, tested positive. flight already apparently, probably also brought Nashville. Makes everything. trip Vegas birthday May looking likely, day day. hope recover soon. Btw, stroke side effect covid-19, maybe get antibody test point. lived Japan pretty much leave stuff Mcdonald restaurant worry losing things. dropped house keys tram thought gone forever. Gave call local police station, someone turned in. safe. war war everyone. Consider lucky write this. personal life? know 15 people unemployed depressed one trying go parties, people want stability back. imagine masks social distancing remain popular amongst people even vaccine release... think fear response keep masks large number people years least say like US highest number people incarcerated. Great news indeed, remember, ready ready closest injection site lot different. 
 
But safe effective great way kick 2021. like herpes swingers club. That's cool, world overpopulated anyways probably correct - federal reserve pumping billions top actions already today. mention relief majority failed, yet we're still supporting rich? donate millions agent orange. thanks. Lowe‚Äôs money goes. 100 % agree. Although live work different part Germany - capacities send over. course going help neighbors friends long can. Look countries rational response. ones going back normal.

There nothing normal creating millions COVID Cripples.

There nothing normal hospitals overrun.

There nothing normal attending 3 funerals month.

There nothing normal watching kids get permanently sick, lung transplant lists exploding, young people stroking permanently wheelchair bound.

But yeah, gotta get back watch football bar. REALLY important Americans. Increasing demand decreasing supplies two different things.

We know. Covid increase blood demand plain simple. 

It has, literal fact, impacted availability, supply demand. Read title post. align quoted? 

Yes. expands length. again, numbers sources? even evaluate credibility read internet?

You asked gave sources ‚Äî literal, actual, IRL agencies handle track this. direct line agencies *right front you.* lmao

Insisting somehow *owe you* explanation counterproductive. You‚Äôre welcome source substantiate answers *your own* questions claims. Unfortunately, nobody else work you. :(

e: spells lot anyone know happened people welded apartments? It‚Äôs bothering awhile. eventually let left die? Opening save business, unfortunately. Look Iowa, businesses stayed open, market spoke anyways. People feel safe, business open mean find adequate enough customer base survive. people believe virus, opening small business nothing let people know willing get employees sick modest return. extra frustrating people look 'what supposed do?' pick absolute worst option thing do. girlfriend walking beach Montauk one around us, pointed wearing N95 mask. Bay Area mentality, good suppressing virus, really fucks psyche bit. see comments like these, makes wonder people saying think first pandemic ever seen. 

It isn't. 

And things went back normal every one. go back normal one, too. Im concerned additional 8k+ plus age group died something Covid. Essentially lockdown deaths. So, people flight Nashville-New York going quarantine yesterday, tested positive ??? 

The news one passenger tested negative flight, positive flight, returning presidential debate. 

That one guy infected several guys Nashville, infected third person Nashville, one guy were/was already infected departing Nashville.  Fun stuff.  early days, remember seeing videos China roadblocks could check people forcibly detain quarantine showed symptoms. think also forcibly locking people houses. 
I figured that‚Äôs takes, we‚Äôre going trouble. problem different regions country. happen gradually, night. hard number easily point to. Agree. Average people need ignore portfolios bit. Germans come Blitz. Haha confusing overloaded terms weird idea mathematics apply different ways different fields. Oceanographers another meaning ""wave"" neither exludes mathematical one redefines analysis. That's mad. really struggle believe US positive rate 6.3% higher, that's we've got go far, I'll believe it, although goes pile 'things believe probable' China COVID outbreak Trump potentially re-elected. :) Yeah, helicopter air ambulance bills outrageously expensive. last checked, median cost one $36,000 2017.

So find hysterical, shaking-with-irrational-indignation responses scientist‚Äôs post pretty guy (Carl Bergstrom) hardly one renegade oxford/Harvard/Stanford types advocating evil things like cost benefit analysis. He‚Äôs pretty firmly side prolonged lockdowns. 

But plenty evidence going back almost year risks posed person learning grade school students. I‚Äôm obviously heartbroken children suffering selfishness/neurosis adults. there‚Äôs something extremely fucking funny self-proclaimed believers science behaving like folks tried kill Galileo.
 
Oh no! someone ‚Äúdownvoted‚Äù post without substantive reply! Omg sorry I‚Äôve changed mind now. I‚Äôm ashamed :( lot photos videos life normal China. think government would allow [this Wuhan cases anywhere near bad westerners like build be. China controlled virus, whether want believe not.  worry. US win race.  Maybe well-educated people figure way increase Canada's testing capacity. Canada much celebrated healthcare system managed 254 tests per 1,000 residents. US much criticized healthcare system done 401 tests per 1,000 residents. 

Perhaps, improve patient outcomes well. Canada, 5.2% confirmed cases resulted death. US, 3.8% confirmed cases resulted death. Lol [Deaths since strict lockdown Victoria Australia currently 3.8 Daily case fortnightly average today we've 0 cases. absolutely idea guys better fix shit out. Yay part statistic get 0.5%, knows guy doing. 

US CFR ongoingly well 1% recent months - including last week. first lockdown Canada mid March. 9 months later would mid December. normal seeing higher births; isolated 9 months ago. Hey too! 6 six years ago, memory still pretty clear. mine midwife clinic receptionist delivered midwife time meet there. mean, nearly parking lot. Spoiler alert, don‚Äôt need eradication end. Vaccines, treatments, controlled outbreaks effectively end won‚Äôt much worry general population. He‚Äôs saying, won‚Äôt control pandemic. Negligent homicide! ""might"" sarcastic guess get it. course ppl wearing masks social distancing. Staying indoors recirculated air, schools session, covid fatigue general. Jesus, past three days alone seen clearly accelerating increase admissions.

Also useful hospitalization-tracking resource I‚Äôll referring ‚Äî thank you! look ways increase capacity, instead rationing care. People appearing advanced stages cancer, due delayed cancer screenings.  cancer caught earlier, would treated earlier.

They may want offload patients field hospitals faster free main hospital. going bumpy ride then. I'm worried even vaccine becomes available going take long time general population comfortable flying again, point we're going broke spend money travel. took years airlines recover 2008 recession. get rid virus even think economic recovery. I'm normally optimistic surprise airlines struggling next decade. What's that? Sure. Can't help feelings sometimes. Hard optimistic time. Serious question: cases detected due better testing, actually increase spread? We‚Äôve 3 spikes. first, lockdowns implemented everywhere. second, hot spots increased restrictions. third (now), one anything except opening things. Obviously worst waves/spikes (whatever want call them) Taiwan, New Zealand, Singapore, Cuba, Japan, Australia, Norway...?

I could list countries reverse ""Deaths Per Million"" order interested easily find numbers. USA currently number 10 top amount deaths per million list countries President said China infected. Yeah, also says never let country become socialist.

Also, he's glad finally gets collect social security covered medicare soon.

Can't make shit up. going sound like lot places US. love waited post deleted posting shite Bullshit. Cold War fear nukes went long, long time. People get ""cold war fatigue"". people London shut lights airraids criminal offense people punished law neighbors.

Nobody fatigued. People lazy lack compassion empathy. 

People mobilized 9/11 day almost 20 years ago. messaging people made care felt attacked personally individually wanted help country.

Nowadays someone attacked New York would seen Liberal's Problem Keeping People Safe. People mobilize way. Penalties lower profit become price business. joins fun sometimes. Like ran story week election last time anonymous sources saying HC's email server breached retract next day, nighttime shows instilled memory public repeatedly.

I whole lot respect him. bet anti-maskers question mortality disease slink off, infections rising predicted hospitalizations start increase, followed ICU capacity becoming scarce rounding rear....an increase mortality healthcare systems struggle cope. Ding ding ding. 

People across board taking social distancing less seriously. Everyone acts like long wear mask Walmart work home, allowed hang friends family private can't infect you. 

Rather admit cases rising unsustainable plan contain virus, everyone jumped easiest scapegoats: Anti-maskers, bar patrons, college students, etc. Nobody acknowledge weekend wine club meetings Disney World vacations might tied rise cases things ""acceptable"". aaaand getting downvoted. Lol everyone sub hate rationality common sense Removed rule 4 rule 5. Please make topic political comments spread misinformation. But, but...THINK PROFITS!

I say former lockdown supporter, thought virus gonna kill 100 million people around globe, could never case. Risk dying incredibly low. issue contagious Hey everyone, focus people *didn't* get bombed air raid last night? I'm tired always talking bombing deaths. Pic reminiscent heartbreaking hospital images Italy worst Well, guess could go bankrupt carrying private insurance go there...

Try paying taxes US see happens, too.

Or die lack affordable healthcare. That's cheaper jail either. Excellent alternative. Chicago Public schools overcrowded even pandemic. 

Maybe tiny small schools remote areas open, CPS? likely. What's ignorant it? He's pointed finger trump locking down. That's fact trump open mean? think we‚Äôre managing keep lid moment. We‚Äôre certainly long way overloaded hospitals. thanks conspiracy theorists. Finally. took while. Nice see endless insults stopped though, cute.

On topic comparisons, unfortunate situation real world complicated, comparisons done laymen always matter comparing apples I‚Äôll leave nothing out, contrary constant skipping arguments questions. 


I responded everything, simply ignored let people die would lived gotten care gotten. fear overloading system caused many die. want sources that? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve sent already. 

Triage collapse, mean.
You sent sources, show example mine. field hospital built accommodate corona patients, never needed later demolished numbers improved. Swedish economy suffered immensely, virtually zero difference rest Scandinavia, less countries rely tourism Sweden does. 


Of course *suffered*, *crash*. export-oriented economy always suffer times crisis collapse prevented. sum up, again: Ten times many deaths Norway Finland, damage economy. still try defend it.

I think comparison valid, not. difficult understand?

If want criticise Sweden use actual figures, ~6000 deaths. last months around 2 day average. Majority deaths 80+, less thousand total 70. tickets see Squarepusher LA. Would first time seeing him. stoked... :( 1) ""I would hardly say doctor training laboratory medicine knows anything disease prevention.""

Am expert preventive medicine? Clearly not. expert anatomic pathology, laboratory medicine blood banking, stick things expertise in. You, hand, getting lane suddenly calling blood donor restrictions ""homophobic"" even though basic understanding blood banking transfusion medicine.

2) ""Doctors treat""

Not do. Radiologists Pathologists (like myself) work mostly diagnostics.

3) ""Stop acting like know anything prevention lab doctor.""

LOL irony üòÇ Junior, stick talking things trained in. You, hand, rambling ranting something zero experience training in. even accused homophobic bigot stating facts statistics. stay lane focus preventing transmission community instead whining imaginary homophobia blood donations. let‚Äôs say Joe Rogan lives Poland Joe accidentally cuts something super bad ass healthy, woah - needs emergency assistance asap else he‚Äôll bleed death. Now, Joe die hospitals overcrowded COVID-19 patients.

Don‚Äôt fucking idiot, Joe Rogan. people refuse masks comply minimal public health orders. aren‚Äôt innocent. dog home 4 infected adults doesn‚Äôt choice, unlike mask scolds. think yes. restrictions maybe, basically normal. curfew universities still opened. bus take morning evening PACKED students. Sure masks we're literally touching 20min ride uni. bus stops, crowded people allowed take mask smoke. get shut universities. Daytime rules changed yet. Yet still time hate gays country mine, works triage regular basis. said biological chronological frequent 18 years old better health condition 80 years old. course, sides exceptions, rare. 
Germany lot icu beds, neighbor countries confront severe triage much earlier germany. Dude, virtually **all** East Southeast Asia similar, complete virus control conditions.

I listed half dozen nations exact sort numbers. getting idea China ""cooking books"".

Based what? hear this? get data suggests are? coming this, aside pulling thin air? I'm sorry hear this. can't even imagine position especially lack even State mandated mask law. mean, would 100% resolve issue would give better shot returning normalized business keep staff safer. 

The congress needs lass stimulus. point fuck head McConnell wanting concede anything (even Trump wanting cut deal). wish first deal targeted small business owners like less major companies. sorely need another keep guys afloat safest course action unfortunately shut bars lesser extent restaurants (I'm sure 30% capacity exactly breaking even).  No, avoid influx people outside. it‚Äôs model would work Europe America think. yet deaths continue blamed Trump. coronavirus happening around globe. gonna sound really stupid im outpatient MRI tech speak behalf entire healthcare system would totally awesome everyone showed 10 minutes early medical appointments. youre getting xray, CT, MRI, need see Dr get cough checked out, going dentist, please please please show time mins early appointment.


Personally, SWAMPED work day long right schedule packed point im getting 20 minute time slots 30 minute protocols. show half hour late exam find way wedge im probably gonna go home late result it.

Please time. easy takes minimal effort went thermometer little disposable slip two inches long slipped mask bottom. made fully remove yours??? üò≥ never listen Yep. Sweden country world absolute majority households consist 1 person. right, similar causes, came due antifungal use agriculture think Texas people smart know better. Take world #1 always ü§£ü§£üòúüòúüòú probably not, they're saying antibodies last somewhere 4-6 months would probably seeing explosion reinfections already gonna one mean hey I‚Äôll take either way No, comment replied explicitly said border controls work already spread within community. false statement US would #1 cases deaths. *You* apparently can't read past set amount words lose interest. travel to/from places widespread community transmission.

How many times going ignore fact literally every country closed borders right now, yet despite almost dealing covid outbreaks *within fucking borders*. Right main issue countries stopping spread *within* country. dealing problem borders fucking irrelevant, besides **they already closed**. keep saying ""closing borders already widespread community transmission work"", TRUE.

Then US worst hit despite closing borders spring? Tell me. know answer. issue cases coming abroad, massive spread within country. try explain closing borders prevents spread within country? Please. would really interested closing German border prevents Germans spreading Germans. **IT FUCKING country question good job mitigating spread COVID, border controls probably make much difference"".

That's literally person replied said! said quote ""even though there's evidence working countries **which already widespread community transmission.** "" That's fucking ""not good job mitigating spread covid. Yet honed first part ignoring rest sitting pretending border closures effective. aren't. would **WHEN EVERY FUCKING COUNTRY CLOSED BORDERS**.

Literally time closing borders even remotely relevant cases trying prevent entering country. main concern prevent spread *within* country. several ways, none involve closing border **Because fucking citizens live within border**. 

The places closing border effective places without covid. place covid fighting borders closed, already fucking closed help spread within country. 

Sweet fucking jesus dude. countries question worried spread within country saying ""well close border"". entire fucking thread started people suggesting places close borders like magical fucking solution. countries getting 10K new cases day people within country borders least concerns. 

I saying one other. closing borders. Obviously want borders closed manage get things control like NZ avenue covid border. getting thousands new cases fucking day, borders already closed, seeing people comment ""just close borders"" solve everything infuriating. said closing borders nothing, talking explicitly spread within country, dealing spread within country, closing borders *doesn't fucking thing*. 

There certain person US naming get comment auto deleted. liked claim closed border EU China early on. that's great. US still worst hit country. despite border closed absolutely nothing prevent spread within country. Closed borders stop New York, Texas, California, Florida every fucking state getting absolutely *slammed* covid. 

Talking border closures issue hand community spread red herring. unable see simply distracts actual measures need taken, like mask wearing lockdowns. many people think border closure need, people like coming attacking others saying border closures prevent spread within country fucking piss off. 1) ""You seem think knowing blood banking way relevant this.""

Uhh, yes is? angry particular practice blood banking, therefore, blood banking topic? ü§∑

2) ""Idk ever thought managing blood banks.""

Because argument whether one donor deferral rules valid not. Implementing donor eligibility criteria job Blood Bank doctor staff there. know else job Blood Bank? Making sure patients receive blood catch anything infectious blood products. God, proving completely ignorant topic.

3) ""I see terribly confused along.""

LOL irony lost you, again. fair, .... Different time.... Polish grandfather hating Germans for....not reallys nationalistic racist sentiment more....uh....well... 5 hour old account sowing lockdown dissent? would've thought it. Im saying shouldnt sacrifice BUT:

With clear strategy yet US, Canada EU -how long expect carry ? Compliance works clear end goal. goal constant ""we never go back normal"" ever parroted media expect young people even take seriously? **My point owe nothing arent made scarifice lives clear end goal sight.**

This parties-This basic human contact. Something important young even old actually. sure lot words let know I'm right. Certain states FAR better others though. need broad scale analysis, also need understand state emulate precautions 50 states. 144 posts metacanada problem creates large overlaps circles interaction. Given way spreads, sitting breathing room someone long time, everyone circle interaction likely get one it.

Examples circles interaction single family home. group workers working one office. one classroom (and school setting... one cafeteria).

This outbreak school workplace response shut whole thing down. limits spread within circle, earlier stage illness.

Now virus spreads communities circles interaction overlap. get work along everyone else, take home give everyone there, someone home takes circle interaction, repeat another set families.

With no-child married couple basically three circles interaction, two adults home, spouse 1s workplace, spouse 2s workplace.

If add school, another circle, one broad reach. classes 30 students it, larger typical workgroup, make worse, things like shared eating single cafeteria basically make whole school single circle interaction, ends large reach across entire community. children certain age within community required go school. spread ratio much higher. students likely get one does, take home circles (which guaranteed exist, parents), take there‚Äôs.

School massive accelerant.  Time reopen then.  One Australia's states. lockdown sucked fucking arse fuck worth double days 0 incredible change way develop vaccines future. remember beginning pandemic people skeptical developing vaccines within year past vaccines taken 3-5 years develop average. people ignore many vaccines developed decades ago science far less advanced really need recent years develop vaccine. Modern science showing power incredible force be. It‚Äôs almost like people sub retarded. insulting kind retarded, actual kind. People literally mentally handicapped. list. Last time flu thought going die. Lying bed sweating like pig freezing time. Try make across bedroom bathroom fall back bed feeling like I'd run 10k marathon. finally felt pretty much better shake hacking cough lasted month. Well, one debunked soon enough. suspect it'll morph either 

1. Trump wins - ""Well obviously they're going keep now, probably another 4 years""

2. Biden wins - ""We meant it'll go away January 21st, course drop Trump still office"" pretend never said November 4th. i'd willing bet scientists US looking vaccines ensure trojan horse kind. doubt enough innoculate many people would least want know whether fucked someone buys black market I‚Äôm proud hell all! You‚Äôve achieved places Earth able do. Ding ding ding! people give fuck. ""care,"" 100% convenience. Poison whom? think sane people aware transfer Covid people without intercourse. put partner risk potentially people. Possibly LOT people. 

Taking personal responsibility unprotected sex one thing, risking people's lives hook different women barely know borderline sociopathic. 

So even Aids least prompt people careful, would insane assume, AIDS would've infectious COVID, would even bigger impact did. Enormous resources diluted equally enormous population; IMO excuse China big really excuse. Especially since much smaller South Korea pretty much exactly same.

That is, west really good excuse TBH. I'm mostly looking country, Canada atm - seem track Europe weeks. guys know saying 6 months now? waiting broken clock right? love sudden concern-trolling ""poor kids minorities"" people guarantee give two shakes 2020.

As see, China reported disease pretty early on. sure myth first report Jan 20/1 comes from. I've seen repeated several times already. Yeah... way, they'd never set foot classroom ever (because oh-so-scary-and-novel COVID virus!), still get paid full. Victoria? even know country existed. üòÖ I'm American, school system failed me. overestimate people‚Äôs ability process this. anyone familiar Dunbar's number, basically posits modern human brains truly maintain 150 relationships (on average) time: relatives, friends, classmates, co-workers, business partners, neighbors, etc.

I feel like take least one person among everyone's Dunbar number circle die actually take pandemic seriously.

In U.S., population 327M, would require 2.18M people die (we're little 10% number moment). course, that's also complete bullshit, dumb math assumes group 150 individuals overlap others, fact obviously do. number actually lower. much lower? know. Maybe half that. Right lot people still know anyone among 150 relationships maintain died it. know people got sick it, friends, relatives, co-workers, people would invite wedding regularly hang with? Plenty people count Covid fatalities among those.

So fucking know. guess we're going need lot dead people. thread hypothetical 5,000 point drop would largest ever. Man, able take girl local music show would mean world me. Welp. I'm mostly annoyed people know think going trip Mexico good idea. Thanks reassurance! I'll continue cautious coursw helps ease mind. Lol forget also force nature spread people even realise yet. 

I think line thinking comes seeing media pictures big crowds, imagining there's lot people one place must main cause virus spread. much harder conceptualise millions social interactions occur every day, earth would keep society functioning stop those. temporary ban isn‚Äôt ban. It‚Äôs suspension. vaccine press release battle going strong three main vaccine companies. USA discount. Halloween special. mean, gotta laugh cry Yesterday saw 1 locally acquired case whole country (small number cases found quarantined international travelers). literally every country China... think uproar education hilarious given anti-intellectual, anti-education large swaths country are. feels quite disingenuous me, honestly. slogan amended 'wear mask, socially distance, kill everything wearing mask' :p .   way. 

Dems them. Turns dont whole lot places go days. Well, past 9 months since 2 businesses non-profits put hold. And, course kids distance learning. husband still works, lucky that. shopping stop way home. 

But cool get go places show mask wearing contribution. not? It‚Äôs doable everywhere perseverance IMO think we‚Äôre second. 
A lot friends nurses know lot emt‚Äôs attend ems training loca volley dept all
Of preparing second wave. Well we‚Äôre actually moment.  kind willful mismanagement criminal. charge need rounded tried criminals handful almost 50 million confirmed cases definition rare President beyond incompetent, stupid crazy. Somehow results good this, even close. article ‚ÄúExperimental studies field work indicate dogs likely shed virus short period time manage eliminate within days week, added.‚Äú 

I can‚Äôt find anything definitive says dogs shed virus. 

[This 9/30 says following: new scientific report confirms cats dogs infected novel coronavirus, neither animal likely get sick. Cats, however, develop strong, protective immune response, may make worth studying comes human still evidence suggest pets passed virus humans, although cats shed virus infect dogs new study didn‚Äôt produce virus upper respiratory tracts didn‚Äôt shed all, although studies found different results. Neither cats dogs study showed illness.

Personally, main concern dogs infected person petting dog owner petting snuggling dog later. I‚Äôm also scientist doctor... article make clear: theft, above-the-table dealings unorthodox agency charge? Reading lines, seems latter, but, well, Mossad. USA paid billion dollars vaccine getting 400 million doses works. clear three vaccines furthest along stage three trials one could approved first. blessed best brightest may break historical vaccine record? novel virus may getting vaccinated year discovery amazing. policy failures misery brought year around globe, nothing fills hope knowing smart people slaving away tirelessly, benefit world. beautiful really. There‚Äôs way even 40 percent adults would willing get anyway. literally waves space time, like real waves. See US giant pond corona set waves propagating pond. point peak one wave one state, moves away intensity temporarily slows another wave, previously active another part country, reaches state.

 I'm Europe speaking waves makes sense countries(and particular country) small. talking larger geographic areas makes less less sense talk definitive 'waves'. That‚Äôs seems I‚Äôm reading. heart aches world. find public record lists names people died covid-19? I'm sick friends family members saying ""it's bad""; every time on, want next text list 200k names people died, tell talk read list.  stop acting like people kids inconvenienced whole thing?

And yep, turns there's global emergency people responsible kids. THIS! It‚Äôs unavoidable, can‚Äôt lock forever, virus spread even surface goods. common happen eventually now.

Closer great fizzle every day ... know one looked it. summer much safer. Wapo tracker US around 61K-62K today, 3,000 jump last Monday

hopefully start plateau little bit holidays fuck everything funny government's fault matter what. People wearing masks small gatherings? Apparently that's government's fault. People getting tired wearing masks stop wearing them? Also government's fault. government simultaneously much *and* enough, guess. need government tell wear masks even small gatherings.

This thread largely blaming ""the government"" every bad thing happens coronavirus. guess comes interpret data people trust. Fauci says still riding first wave I'd inclined believe intimately knows models statistic related. believe cousin facebook medical experience. No, 60% minimum threshold approval, aiming for. aiming 100% even though never happen. Realistically somewhere those. options. Give families teachers choices. Survey first see numbers teacher/student ratio work out. many want stay home, go virtual, go hybrid. Move w/ logistics. 

Cohorts: half person students go M/W 
Other half T/TH. opposite days Fridays stay virtual. Teachers choose go back teach week. Teachers teach virtual students. 

Masks, temp checks necessary, hand sanitizer, spaced eating. Even reduced hours necessary. Older students teachers switch classrooms, instead kids switching? 

I dont know ideas. trying think solutions besides ‚Äújust stay fuck home‚Äù option‚Äîwhich causes host horrible problems.  People eating done eating pulling masks speak. Sometimes without proper distancing. dont agree him. Hes absurd. actual disingenuous thing pretending issue like stance. Pretending exist doesnt make wrong. Yeah... that... continues throughout week -.-

Remember 52K last week?

Not good, good (poor Europe, France) Siege Liege, reminds Northern Italy's worst days last Spring, lower death rate time forget everyone retirement fund way broker need sth money. alot money. one trying spin 20% begin trying spin saying 50% masks? idea got either from. fighting windmill. Positivity 3% death excess, testing sake testing would mean much. hope medical issues resolve soon, good luck point going get fat donuts Yes we're comparison China US, mentioned original comment population ""free"". Bad wording part, I‚Äôm referring anti mask people, religious cults kids checked school either, statistically visible. straight F students always existed, school babysitting day. systemic changes made generally meet needs, hope advocate Covid over. mean time district provide access via hot spots something (that's district does). 

Just children die mean vectors spreading home community.
And death symptom Covid. Long term effects examined. 

Schools reopen understand contain this, before. Yeah makes sense. 

Either open make shut down. 

Pretending COVID works 9-5 dumb. may appropriate place ask able go vacation abroad? think next summer? 

I'm really itching go Japan olympics summer I'm looking forward wearing mask keeping distance, I'd rather go another year things normal. really enough vaccinations Canada Japan get rid restrictions July/August, start thinking able go vacation summer?? mean damn
Why even let get point
We got gasmasks kinds equipment, still stick flimsy masks? love trolls suddenly concerned stuff like universal broadband childcare. Huh. Apparently fall 1B group thanks job. Damn wonder it‚Äôs overwhelming Poland countries foe hospitals think someone made deal Orange. Same. everything right beginning - stayed inside, wiped everything, see anyone except roommate MONTHS. Meanwhile come May-July I'm still barely venturing outside except run meet delivery guy I'm watching friends fly visit friends seen since airfare still low, coworkers taking week+ go beach, friends dating around...people living lives. one know got COVID, mostly second third hand stories someone whose friend someone. I'm extrovert studied public health really hard feel like I'm missing trying flatten curve America everyone else enjoying consequences. resentment was/is real! I've started seeing friends safe-ish ways (outdoor hikes, vineyard, drives masks) winter gonna real risk-reward hell activities. took seriously, still continue decline things like big wedding invites nights bar, even resolve weakened substantially lol. Bollocks. Sure, disingenuous coming people currently arguing it. basically concern-trolling point. Berlin (the closest major city Poland Germany) ICU capacity taken Covid patients went 7.8% 9% overnight.  beds 63% occupied non COVID patients. means margin 28% available ICU beds. exponential growth currently experiencing, end next week probably run out.

Source: top chart R rate. 
Middle new infections per 100k trailing last 7 days. 
Bottom ICU beds (green Covid, grey unused, blue non-COVID.) Apparently UAB beds. Friend wife's Facebook account relative transferred Shelby virus. People Asia need bike locks. california actually OK. look stats ""per capita"". california bigger population poland Maybe, New Zealand got lucky locked community spread still low, added benefit island easy control international travel country. Land borders leaky work, community spread probably big Europe/North America us realistically able achieve result NZ. Look Czech Republic really well spring among worst afflicted countries Europe. instead people like pressured schools focus reopening hybrid programs instead. 

You answer question actually. Saying spring concentrate solution, doesnt actually explain concentrate solution.

I expect happen week. harms reduced significantly.

You realize opening schools also can't fixed week, economical led increased cases hospitals capacity like Poland, Belgium, Netherlands, Utah, more. can't open school within week socially distanced, consistently masked either. problem internet can't fixed unreasonable time frame?

As parents capacity supervise children, beneficial solution would paying child care centers taxes, less exposure.

So prioritizing schools, led overwhelmed hospitals, increased cases, social networks would keep people safer benefit society? still lame nowadays think 6 months year without sex another man so... Thank you. Erm, wtf? single part paragraph would place mad max. first film anyway don‚Äôt miss shooter drills States chance someone barged shoot school. 

Wait what? joke serious? Asking Australia... care is. 4th largest distributed rag US.

People like you...attitudes like yours, fuel conspiracies.  shame can't see it.

Conspiracies never die attitudes like Lessons 1-100: remote island. Sorry, know worked hard, too. bit leg there. Wow brave hero :^ ) Who's locked up? live CA go often want 95% want do. wear mask carry hand sanitizer. countries cultural norms government policies supporting public mask-wearing, per-capita coronavirus mortality increased average 16.2% week, compared 61.9% week remaining countries. Societal norms government policies supporting wearing masks public, well international travel controls, independently associated lower per-capita mortality COVID-19.

There‚Äôs lot findings study one bigger impacts found (nicely shown Figure 1). Also [direct link full - interestingly used Worldometers mortality data. wish also took account excess deaths, many countries vastly exceeded official death toll. US, flu shot forced want keep job? They‚Äôre highly effective keeping direct/close-range aerosol sprays hitting wearer‚Äôs face - considering eyes another key entry point virus that‚Äôs small thing. Combined proper mask use, face shields help drastically reduce infections among essential workers. Going Gym bad indoor dining. Schools can‚Äôt even keep lice out. expect keep invisible virus? would like also point climate change, plastic waste, etc disappeared spotlight corona public dumb worry two things once. 

Lockdowns set back climate change fight immensely feel like fatigue hope? Well one, people free wear masks get bashed China. west it‚Äôs pretty sizable

In America, Australia, lot countries West, cult influence growing nowhere near big US. really need go Poland experimental brain cancer treatment, great timing. Trump says everything opposite though saying something like great way show people idea talking joke, thing Canadians hate health care system gotta pay parking. Although private insurance usually covered. Yes call it‚Äôs name. Covered people. really weird.

From tell, American right lies universal healthcare socialist order make universal healthcare sound bad.

The American left lies universal healthcare socialist order make socialism sound good.

The reality European countries another public service paid taxes, within economy respects property rights allows private enterprise. may agree disagree it, socialist. Publicly-funded schools socialist, publicly-funded law-enforcement socialist, publicly-funded fire services socialist, publicly-funded armed forces socialist (except support socialism) publicly-funded healthcare socialist. house force air heat make much harder isolate patient. patient needs wear mask ALWAYS.

A Reddit comment actually saves lives something special. one them. happen company west coast starting M, would it? context number positive Coronavirus results would amplitude, wavelength would time series, date first positive result now. Based worldwide numbers positive results date, apparent trough, resting period crests, hence we're still first wave. 6th grade concepts need help with? realize mean guaranteed win, yeah? win hand blackjack go means must streak? love good ‚Äúdemand‚Äù librul hoax.... Wow would pissed coworker like that. You‚Äôre lucky didn‚Äôt get test positive quite initial positive. Research shows bearing contagiousness long isolation completed entirety (10 days fever improvement symptoms final 24 hours). Lol. I‚Äôm far-right racist terrorist that‚Äôs you‚Äôre asking. people died BLM riots boog boi murders put together. condone violence anti-government. don‚Äôt like authoritarian fuckheads. fact. People living fantasy world virus.

Edit: Thank making case downvoting comment make feel better reality. little, late. think vaccine silver bullet like flipping light switch everything suddenly better. First all, vaccine 100% effective many people going refuse get virus still circulating. going gradual process returning kind normal probably still need wear masks socially distance while. google it, lot articles go depth. Reportedly Idaho talks air lifting patients Washington.

They fuck right IMO. Keep trump virus, antimask shits. made bed lie it. I'm 25 I'm scared long term side effects dying. I've seen patients 40 previous conditions spend months ICU wake able hold spoon. yeah shit. cases slight dipped everyone treated war. look whats happening. honestly still first big wave due shit response. Yesterday: get beers 
Today: stay beers! getting hand. people need stop nonsense attempt make Donald Trump look bad.  /s

edit - adding /s can‚Äôt tell joke. Things never thought hear, Poland asking Germany invade. Bankers wrong lot remember 2008? keeps surging point threat hospital systems overwhelmed finally comes pass broad basis.

Let's not, eh? ""Some degree public health measures..."" 


I love people come pointless soundbites literally mean anything want to. Meanwhile Helsinki cancels orders ventilators needed. Strange second wave strong many places.  agree. seems like reasonable assumption. Well, least took care biggest issue jeopardizing safety citizens, banning abortion.

Politics aside, horrible hope everyone staying safe possible."
