she epidemiologist. Well, partly true.

As far know AZ vaccines (\~1 mill) exported EU UK UK components them.

The lipid Biontech (20mill doses UK) comes several sources, one UK. \*Biontech Marburg plant uses UK Lipids

The domestically sourced vaccines UK around 15 mill. US &amp; India obviously meant global manufacturers. factories larger ones EU. block export experience issues future investment.

Also UK blocked exports. None Poland vaccinated teachers 99% women aged 20-67.   lot people vaccinated two months. what, everyone locked countries on? becoming insane. tell though Texan policy changed nothing de facto. Masks still order day big cities suburbs see testing fallen similar rates. course cases going go much testing. understand that. However, we're stage matter weeks everyone vaccinated choose majority 65+ already vaccinated. much different state. Everyone seeing case drops valley rn regardless mask mandate not. I've seen covid passports mentioned context international travel. discussed part everyday life? agree, sounds like horrible idea. (And record 100% behind mask mandates vaccine encouragement, strongly dislike sort data gathering gatekeeping) There‚Äôs massive difference people getting sick hurricane/flood/snowstorm. Umm, maybe heard, COVID deaths even carrying virus, give compromised gets sick and/or die it. Unless kids live bubble, problem. doubt herd immunity 5 weeks. pace isn‚Äôt fast enough there‚Äôs lag time immunity kicking vaccination completed, plus pace unfortunately slow every ‚Äúenthusiastic‚Äù recipient vaccinated slog ambivalent, hesitant, resistant (and need take ever want herd immunity). 

That said, definitely almost this. Apparently Bhutan aiming vaccinate entire eligible population (533,558) around week, they've currently got 550,000 AZ doses use. Good them! know solution, get vaccine. article paywalled. However, ONS Survey tracking people working, want working. 

We're never going go everyone WFH UK, expect flexible WFH become increasingly common.

I've looking current numbers AZ distribution Germany able find much terms concrete numbers. would really grateful:) UK two reasons:
1) factories new. never part manufacturers global plans. Bet though. 
2) UK blocked exports.

It problem India, though What?? Yes, certainly confounding factor, doubt ratio population disproportional, 2 vs 29 (of course number cases small kind statistics easily wrong). Plus, said another comment, would consistent fact seems mimic Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, apparently women also risk suffering. Heavy projection. one people talking understand majority people lockdown stuff. gone outside lately noticed people going living lives. Vaccines here, 2020 lockdown world over. Trespassing laws books since concept private property invented. 

There's need reinvent wheel here. Actually data, world, shows exactly opposite. point arguing you, completely ignore article.

Add 0 vaccines left UK, versus 20 mill EU UK. So...believe science it‚Äôs convenient believe anymore? Yea, effectiveness wrong word, meant ask ratio people infections. know vaccines work, handful people 2,000+ vaccinated group got infected. masks social distancing, would number 100s, placebo group may multiples higher well? make sense? know vaccine numbers would ~90% better control, wonder vaccine good enough keep infection rate super low. certainly did. 2.7 million doses AZ administered Germany.

Still, think cases could justfy excluding younger women least now. 
There still enough people high risk groups vaccinated AZ enough alternatives women 55 65. eat plants stuff, yes.

Also, dogs eat them, die. local schools Los Angeles county it‚Äôs still open!?. Kids really suffering it‚Äôs sad see. many kids school died coronavirus????? Every country pple likel siad
Unfortunately iran No, food basic human right. reason approval done company, EMA, FDA, etc exist

Funny enough, AZ particular sold cost (supposedly, definitely cheaper mrna ones), really reason rush (and definitely producing top speed...) AstraZeneca making profit vaccine. Except one critical components vaccine one 4 sites, 2 EU 2 US. good build global capacity. ""Potentially"" good enough reason opinion. Get conclusive data make decision. vaccine approved, stop fucking around get peoples arms. significant issue find scrap indefinitely. Stop dilly dallying fucking lives people need vaccines get back normal.

There many drugs side effects cause death. Hell, every time someone general anaesthetic 1 100,000 chance dying. I've 5 one even mentions risks unless research it. 

People allowed weigh risk tolerance something fucked lives much already. personal opinion though. turn nothing, like every dramatic claim AZ. right! I‚Äôm dealing expected post-jab flu-like symptoms atm (fatigue, muscle ache, light fever, etc) thankfully nothing ordinary. I‚Äôll definitely keeping close eye emerging symptoms coming days weeks! that‚Äôs you. 
meanwhile, fell depression start seeing therapist can‚Äôt stop worrying what‚Äôs going kill - virus dreaded six letter word. Charit√© publish cost-benefit analysis somewhere likelihood long COVID, hospitalization death unvaccinated people vs. likelihood outcomes blood clots? say ""respect authoritah!!!"" made decision guise reputation?

Anyone capable basic math would quickly figure halting vaccinations makes sense primary goal save lives prevent long COVID. hell even mean? article really undersells effectiveness. It‚Äôs positioned piece boosting confidence vaccine, beginning noting coronavirus vaccine skepticism often rooted person‚Äôs belief prevents serious illness infection spread. instead driving home, say, findings yesterday‚Äôs newly released study, hedges: vaccine *may* move ‚Äúladder‚Äù ‚Äòserious illness/death‚Äô ‚Äòjust mild asymptomatic case‚Äô. *know* that. 

Good lord missed opportunity.  post would excellent research note IB ""why office buildings fucked"" - spot commentary.  bad idea use heat print paper lot number/ date stickers laminated heat machines makes whole sticker turn black.  Where? I‚Äôm right outside Philly. think way people every business still mask mandates translated financial terms: office owners screwed. market priced growing demand shit hit, bottom way, way down. report new SARS-CoV-2 Spike mutation T478K, risen frequency Mexico North America since January 2021. located amino acid 478, within interaction domain human protein ACE2. also detected small number cases European countries. yet found co-occurrence ACE2-interacting domain mutations, e.g. N501Y. pretty much UK

We've exported 70m vaccines, 20m UK believe that's mainly UK? world forced rely EU's production regions vaccine nationalism.

You argue want whether EU owns doses we've ordered hundreds millions block export delivered EU stolen anymore UK commandeered every dose produced UK.

Before start prattle contracts, [why explain come AZ mention UK factories take payment EU plants suddenly decide they'll give exclusivity away block export them? third wave seems hitting everyone really hard.

People tired many relaxed attitude toward virus, even though new strains contagious deadly. Schools open many places offices still closed tho. Every single word truth. goalposts constantly moving ever since ""2 weeks flatten curve."" kind crazy people cant understand people shit. Except kids. surge last summer? oh...you aware decided post highly valuable thoughts topic regardless. EU bought vaccines produced ik UK, according contract AZ.

Apparently it‚Äôs rules thee me. Life feels pretty normal NZ, frequently forget there's pandemic going there. No, true all. GQP want economy strong Biden all, hence zero votes covid relief.

Great - really help available readily, FUCKING NEVER Given timing bit late, likely donated needed booster shots. yet geniuses feel qualified chime variants assorted topics sorta mouth words to...if go slowly less one percent infectious fatality rate (.3%) sure doozy choosing vaccinated. Brits, assume. Always come something cutesy. vaccine produced UK? same. UK going donate vaccines bought delivered surplus. EU considering blocking exports UK (and pretty much UK) bought manufacturer wants deliver use instead.

The EU vaccines considering blocking exports on, UK it‚Äôs choosing donate time. would massive failure part government implement travel restrictions people choose vaccinated. would effectively make vaccine mandatory, would consider massive breach bodily autonomy. say, people want take vaccine whatever reason already infected, exactly would point punishing skipping vaccine already immunity contributes towards herd immunity? Thanks. News me. people vaccinated quickly possible. less transmits less mutates. Vaccine skepticism potentially going make never go away. Media built UK-strain-threat without convincing data

Excuse me? virus spreads better seems lead severe illness unvcaccinated people.

If mean UK-stain-*vaccine-resistance*-threat, that's important distinction here, virus threat real, ""vaccine help"" threat not. Good us. make perfect sense? think tbf, concerned increased risk younger people.

However, least UK, European countries suspending vaccine seen political decision. Whether that's true left seen ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø influx Covid deniers skeptics coming certain political circles since inauguration vaccine rollout. feel that. say Daily Thread sub people gang call ""introvert"", ""anti-social shut-in"" also ""wants pandemic last forever"". 

I know can't accept fact everyone relies solely co-workers socialization like them, also everyone wants WFH hates socializing. us like WFH would rather socialize people actually like socializing with, people we're forced socialize despite sharing nothing common besides working company. Lol. country putting pause vaccine? 

I know believe anymore honest lol moot point, country vaccinated 99% population mutations come 1%. Every unvaccinated person possible mutation matter are. Normal range CSVT two five people per million per year, 15.7/m/yr one Australian study. Current rate based German reports around 10 per million, average 40 per million per year. 

German scientists already ID'd trigger event viable treatment CSVT patients Yea, Norway leading way huge EU conspiracy.. almost died reading comments lol Right. permanent lockdown crowd, new focus ""cases"" rather deaths hospitalizations, need new ammo. 1) would natural changes virus similarly achieved gain-of-function manipulation? obvious signs manipulation virologists epidemiologists?

The mechanism used modify virus gain function experiments evolution. way 2011 scientists made H5N1 airborne (bat coronaviruses airborne difficult cross humans) infecting ferrets, cultivating viruses nasal tracts, putting newly infected ferrets uninfected ferrets repeating process select variations transmitted efficiently. subset animals typically used this. COVID infects many ways suggest could used intermediary animals (particularly ferrets tree 2) get 80 year gap from?

I ran somewhere estimate long 3-4% difference COVID19 RaTG13 would take emerge naturally. percentage difference really matters though -- 3-4% gap phenological record. Natural origin would imply virus evolved in-the-wild ""missing links"" floating wild. Lab-origin would mean opposite. one things would expect find intermediary candidates databases and/or floating wild essentially waiting discovery.

China closing access coronavirus databases makes hard look this. deliberate destruction early samples state edict also black mark hinders anyone's ability find out. I've read COVID variants trace back single ancestor (more consistent lab leak hypothesis), multiple variants would consistent zoonotic transfer (spread range similar viruses rather one particular leaked 3) official sources 

Like actual research papers published scientists WIV? literally collecting viruses bat caves Yunnan, importing Wuhan conducting various experiments including GoF experiments. find papers online. 

None secret. Funding research came part ten-year, $200 million international program called PREDICT. Peter Daszak also involved EcoHealth Alliance disinterested party. news broken mainstream Newsweek (of sources) Spring 2020.

Why reported January 4) would ridiculous take Dzsalak face value? 

Because pushing Huashan market narrative January 2020 already known many cases preceded first infection market. pushing narrative known false? passes concerns Chinese colleagues. science.

Strike two? active attempts corral Lancet statements condemning idea lab leak conspiracy theory, despite fact sort research denying (deliberate human-piecing-together-of-multiple-existing-known-virii) hardly way would come about, especially since effective way aerosolizing bat coronaviruses quite literally directed evolution. may thing natural origins, fuck Daszak deliberate obfuscation.

Even today Daszak's deliberate obfuscation -- amplified journals like NYT even bother ask GoF research (his actual research lab fcs) means people still think ""lab-made"" implies someone manually arranging molecules instead simply infecting animals seeing bad could make things.

His investigatory work also farce, getting point everyone see it. solution stop virus mutation even presented yet? UK EU regulatory bodies ruled vaccine safe. found rate thromboembolic events actually lower expected general population nothing common coworkers wouldn‚Äôt feel anything never see again. say people assume I‚Äôm misanthrope. No, I‚Äôm interested socializing bunch middle aged women. many people downvoting truthful statements can't handle facts. LoL. handling? freaking disaster. Also second doser 5th!! Agreed.

The virus Israeli apartheid still going strong Palestinians West Bank suffer greatest, Let's honest. treaty replace responsible governments. many scientists raised alarm threat novel coronavirus (the signs world see) governments nothing stop it. planning ... mass-shooting? :D Yep. Shame virus Israeli apartheid still going strong. enough vaccines vaccinate 300 Americans! basically bad headline bad article essentially nwes.  Yet EU ‚Äòbad‚Äô considering same. Odd Similar BioNTech/Pfizer: BioNTech's focus COVID actually individualized cancer medicine. also worked mRNA influenza vaccinations, repurposed adapted COVID vaccination.  really has. type seems caused vaccine easily treated. problems that, rarely, give clots combination low platelet count. Normally would treat clots kind blood thinning agent, since platelet count low treatment might unusual cases kill patient. people alarmed.

Then, course, almost certainly case benefits outweighs risks, still complicated administer drugs give type severe side effects. Alright whose idea call ""jab""  surprised see firm (also bank) mentioning new normal post 2021, 30 percent reduction office usage. reckon banks copy other.

Interesting hear might plans accept people revenue generator roles local areas. know certain European bank started near shoring UK years back, really struggled hire senior people new office. increase pay senior people commute London. also strong culture London attitudes 'people office incompetent, clue business like'. graduate, much difficult get role London compared near shore office.  Well promising. Fingers crossed. there's alot shadow values every questionaire, guess. a) APA ask random people people psychological problems, b) big asked people number, c) 42% said gained + 18% said lost + 40% (!) said nothing big changed.

Headline could instead: asked 2,000 patients 42% gained weight. something like that. nay. 

I read article according website: ""Our European visitors important us."" aka available. \^\^ exactly? EU far allowed exports, UK said still wont so.

So EU might copy UK‚Äôs dick move, yet EU ‚Äúbad‚Äù ones?  Exactly - ""sequencing"" word looking for, cheers agree. probability mutation evades vaccines survive directly proportional infections level. also directly proportional number vaccinated people, new strain could jump prosper. much seems dick move, think vaccinating discreet areas quickly eliminate coronavirus locally ASAP less risky option. Provided vaccinated folk stay home over, go full tourist visiting areas high infection rates. UK government one duty protect UK citizens. companies exporting vaccines (AZ moment, Novavax near future). companies prioritized UK contracts. ""Well EU could signed similar contract"". Well no, makes sense definition word priority mind. totally unrelated point. said media making danger variants drive clicks. pointed even country media real fear Covid drive clicks vaccines, still hear govt sources variants major threat problem. 

That indicate media US alarmist, since even NZ govt worried. Ironic. could sanitize others Well UK opened current level vaccinations cases would also cause increase cases could lead mutations. countries export vaccines, UK among them, however EU shipped half vaccines countries, 21m UK included. likely wouldnt big difference EU import UK, could nice reciprocal gesture them. put perceptive , 356 978 week ago. weeks 2,134 3,783. Welp, take pretty strong indication approved anytime soon then. FDA might considered bending rules little definitely fly. tragic learning hard way came form... Choose leaders carefully next time.

If there's silver lining pandemic knew competent isn't.

May vaccine production ramp may stay safe there. Blood clots also generally easily treated, rarely fatal, seem like events indicative chronic clotting. really speaking safe social distance, state, teachers moved threshold elderly high risk line vaccination. receiving them, teachers teachers union still battled stay home hybrid learning. point say it‚Äôs safe? You‚Äôre vaccinated, younger population already proven rare threat severe infection. need seriously start thinking long term psychological effects it‚Äôs kids. Add fact plenty sectors work continued work covid restrictions done fine. (somewhat ignorant) opinion best approach would mass produce factories promising covid vaccine candidates year ago whole thing started. done properly, could saved lives, time money. mindblowing much time build everything need yet little done. disagree here, maybe clear : lockdown effectively decrease spread, without vaccination (cf UK beginning vaccins). Lockdown adverse effects, sure, strain ""un-controllable"" like implied several media. fact control strain vaccin, without vaccin (in emergency, short term) Yes agree completely.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* EU process ordering 100 million doses Novavax, Novavax delaying signing they're issues sourcing raw materials. Mutations tend happen stress.

Most mutations happen immun-compromised people. virus able finish patient hospitals giving oxygen, steriods, anti-body treatments etc. patient able kill virus either they're weak. months stand-off virus starts mutate response treatments given (and evade treatments).

Given that, way avoid mutations UK currently - vaccinate like mad lockdown. lockdown prevents spread (and hence also prevents transmission immuno-compromised people). vaccinations also prevent transmission well boosting antibodies better chance killing virus encounter it.

The combination start suppress cases practically nothing. re-open, must keep borders shut import mutations elsewhere. ""The [American Psychological Association reports 61% adults experienced weight loss weight gain, unintentionally, last year.""

""According APA, 42% report gaining weight intended, 18% said lost weight wanted. average amount weight gained 29 pounds. average amount weight lost 26 pounds.""

So looks like headline included people weight gains ignoring people weight losses. I'll assume another ""clickbait"" headline? And? countries don‚Äôt enough vaccines create mutations render vaccines useless. 
Just look effectiveness Astrazeneca South African variant. 

Being selfish like won‚Äôt help anyone long run. certainly strange. Many people 40s 50s died COVID-infection left Long COVID. We‚Äôve also seen P1 B117 deadly affect young people more. 1/100k rare benefits clearly outweigh risks. there. 10-12 days 1st dose. Even 2x times tested negative. caugh little bit throat pain. worked 1918 flu pandemic. work too. 1 year lockdowns, time go back normal. vaccine good enough, it. think that's true. unvaccinated population, infection rates vary age due effects aging resistance infection. Vaccines produce anything all. bone marrow produces immune cells, either kill produce antibodies.

Vaccines induce production high number antibodies spike protein.

Infection induces production low number antibodies parts virus infected cells.


Makrophages killer cells depend age, genetics health condition.

Thus, moderate chance virus acquire partial full resistance vaccine-induced immunity; high chance acquire partial resistence low chance acquire full resistence infection-induced immunty; low chance acquire resistance cellular immunity viruses, working. Here, not.  Typically UK trials meet 30K minimum participants level, even get starting blocks UK trial 15K, enough UK. half way enrolling 30K US sometime January, so, yep - second half year. course current vaccine rollout squishes Covid quickly, could longer (speculation truly) vast majority vulnerable old population vaccinated young people also process vaccinated. new cases young people little danger virus begin with. far variant proven significantly dangerous resistant 3 main vaccines. CDC‚Äôs fault insisting it‚Äôs safe reopen schools stating 3 feet enough social distance classroom instead 6 feet, Yet scared 4th wave?! Can‚Äôt ways! Maybe like French? IE arm Yes colleagues AZ one thankfully experienced this. lived East Texas city 100k January 2020-August 2020 (well, too, that's irrelevant). Mask compliance high even even back *You'd literally end killing thousands healthy young people globally.*

Let young people know 1 100k chance deaths keep pumping vaccine them. I'd take heartbeat right now. risk way every time get highway car. Even passport international travel last forever üôÑ much less likely infected much less likely infect others chance either much less likely significant symptoms....to things public messaging hammering home. feel like places require things like going less fun expensive extra things provide people feel safe. Things wide open live right don‚Äôt see anywhere shifting making people show vaccinated. way find : like previous politician charge US promoting maskless rallies TV optics, stating tests idiotic masks stupid.

ok let's see : politician charge RAN get vaccine tried hide it. many experts"" spreading ""feelings"" vaccines data backup everything.., I'd LOVE know many RAN get vaccine.

see? simple easy test see full s... are. I'm wondering vaccine blood disorder. Sorry mind still wrapping around ins outs. told make sure get AZ offered. moment I‚Äôm sure. One running theories either complications birth control meds, elevated estrogen levels. I‚Äôm knowledgeable specifics gender reassignment hormones used, end might matter far know cis trans women effectively hold similar estrogen levels. it‚Äôs birth control related it‚Äôs simply matter someone prescribed. Sucks. teachers specifically got vaccinated early agreement would put back classroom. soon got theirs, goal posts moved. source first bit? tried google it, found things stating contrary. 20 million+ people UK/EEA it, they've found 7 cases blood clots multiple vessels. sound like lot I'm medically educated so.

Texan here. anyone trying rationalize headline... don‚Äôt equate Abbott lifting mandate everyone running around without masks. Businesses still requiring masks, people still complying. Business ticked still comparable pre-COVID levels.

The people governing despite governor idiot. deliberately obtuse. understand highly infectious disease impacts health others, need educate basics viral diseases vaccinations.

Furthermore, point situations, situation trying falsely equate vaccines actually happening US. hope put much fervor opposing falsely believe same. half risk Texans immunized. Definitely time lift mask requirements. businesses debatable peoples livelihoods, absolutely cruel idiotic remove mask requirements vulnerable people essential workers vaccinated. need 75 vulnerable. please realize dying one thing, risk (likely) permanent damage body, even survive.

as far understood (but really stay date) blood clot brain AZ necessarily death sentence prepared. implication was...just coincidental that, circumstances, vaccinated group significantly lower rates infection? Charit√© political tool. Anti-EU hysteria uncommon guys either, maybe sides edge rn.

X dead x dead. Take vaccines. Yeah fact happening 52% fully vaccinated encouraging Took 3 hours pounding NY site getting 3 appointments closer closer finally landed one tomorrow. Fuckin pumped per capita basis, US trails Israel 60 days. 60 days ends end May. it‚Äôs really two months equivalent case numbers. assume given fact issues UK Germans injecting AZ vaccine incorrectly. avoidance doubt point end one enter arm.

Maybe would trial longer :/ October new deadline. manages actually go effect, seriously doubt, taken almost 16 years. Lol even talking about, want bodily autonomy every circumstance listed. understand challenge trials incredibly unethical circumstances? said, data speaks itself. vaccines effective. Stop spreading misinformation. Norway seen deaths 55 due AZ vax covid. 4 deaths vs 3 covid deaths. Ah quintessential conservative American. Sticking noses everywhere proclaiming grateful must everything result charity mercy. number people see social media posting first dose growing fast everyday. doubt many qualify yet. honestly, good them. feel great anytime see new person post first shot. Every single person vaccinated breaks potential transmission chain.

I know controversial, older people plenty time get vaccinated. younger populations 18-45 deal worst ratio damage caused restrictions vs personal risk, time let start getting life back. can't keep telling young people stay home key vector transmission offer chance stop vector. That‚Äôs works. Half vaccines distributed today 2nd doses. reality, net new vaccinations day right round 1.2-1.5 million. New variants popping people taking pandemic even less seriously back forth. Read history book. Makes sense me. Thoroughly vaccinating population moving next provides best secondary protection via herd immunity makes disease harder spread overall. things important know here:

A) Reading actual studies involved would answer questions regarding whether challenged, numbers represent, whether clusters included. encourage research reading.

In grocery department stores visited would say like 95%+ people wearing mask.

With order lifted definitely see people wearing it, still gotta like 75-80% wearing still.

Hopefully vaccination process continues ramp already many variants continue variants Covid - that‚Äôs nature viruses.  

This virus around many years.  Unless variant emerges causes massive increase deaths, shouldn‚Äôt setting policy drive variants. would never ‚Äúwin‚Äù battle people get exhausted continued focus doom gloom. Thanks advice. numbers way. statistics vaccines young healthy people dying blood clots low platelet counts (ie run mill common DVT clots) would love see it. Yawn. Booster shots coming September earlier. Next? Grocery store workers important yes, risk flight attendants, bus drivers, subway workers, construction workers, restaurant servers, HVAC/plumbing, manufacturing, electricians, military...?


All jobs require lot interaction others work tight spaces, oftentimes people's homes. know became hyper-focused one tiny part essential worker category ignoring everyone else. 

I mean hell boss made us come work entire time mess, exposing 25 people every day long, sustained periods time arguably pose bigger threat briefly walking someone grocery aisle. 

Viral load via exposure time proven important factor transmission Could share data? far, variants I've seen tested vaccines proven effective them. variants vaccines effective on? personal assesment: Biontech Moderna pretty much race. AZ well, guess still unknowns need ruled out. J&amp;J squeezed finish line. Sputnik looks promising used.

STD won't, require shoes clothing sanitary reasons well. reading, EUA Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine shows *slightly* higher efficacy rate range Moderna‚Äôs age group. However, father‚Äôs 65+ research said Moderna effective age group. wanted (and got) Pfizer, got Moderna. admit virus spreads regardless restrictions things like weather/wealth/etc. real factors impact spread death rates. Yeah, government conveniently get data sold la Facebook Google it'll huge scandal everyone act surprised.

CDC still storing record vaccinated either way tho. doctor. choose share with. general question - got COVID. Anyone else gotten too, lose appetite following sick? I‚Äôve really eaten twice day sometimes can‚Äôt even finish full meal. It‚Äôs weird.

Edit: going add, symptoms fever anymore.

I saw one earlier 'over 3800 cases' title - misleading, suggested lowest rate ages terrible.

Also saw one last year compared COVID flu, something along lines 'flu deadly coronavirus, warn scientists'  rate we're getting vaccines out, yeah month two seems reasonable. need everyone get vaccine rates decrease people get it. Kent variant beaten sure, accounts cases there. many younger cohort though. seen number UK. figures released Sunday showed 2,274 cases U.K. variant B.1.1.7 Florida, along 42 cases Brazil variant P.1 14 cases South Africa variant B.1.351.

B117 likely easily beat current vaccines. B1351... we'll see, least spread much. Nobody said regular occurrence, though forgiven thinking given regularly threatened.

If UK made change vaccines finished EU like supposed to, what's odds they've come back without issue? they've managed despite on-going trade embargo.

I remember last week people complaining Cuomo postponing announcements vaccine availability expansion could reap popularity points waiting could announce ""there's really good news real soon!!"" Yeah. lock hard, take variants die much quicker B.1.1.7.

If lock hard, take grows much faster variants.

If lock bit, combination both. variants slowly die out, B.1.1.7 grows.

The environment B.1.1.7 take large parts population already immune B.1.1.7 e.g. prior Covid infection, variant like B.1.351 go around immunity. B.1.351 (or P.1, whichever is) take over. Though government Israel provided 2,000 vaccine doses Palestinian health workers reportedly started vaccinating 130,000 Palestinians entering Israel settlements work, represents tiny proportion population effective control occupying statistics back purely conjecture taken seriously, based CDC's projections vaccination large scale case spikes, assuming current restrictions behaviours since January remain place. spiking right may indication cases abnormally low compared national average, simply one outliers CDC projection.

One thing would note CDC projection assumed 1 million doses administered day. Last looked statistic close met back January, tripled, projection outlook better CDC projection, assuming restrictions behaviours remain same.

[The projection incredible amount people sub give flat wrong answers ignore science modelling (also known idiots). B117 models looked at, including one accurate.

Oh waaaay omfg üòÇüòÇüòÇ always knew would blow back extreme hype AZ vaccine early on, negative non-existent hype competing vaccines, bordering odd.

They also travelled barnard castle 25 mile detour test eyesight (whether choose believe you) must stop fuel point exposed someone covid days met prime minister tested positive

When found done held press conference basically tried justify (quite poorly) said journey Barnard Castle test eyesight. thus national meme born putting Barnard Castle map! AZ also. lot people *never* cared. Absolutely hate here, especially trades currently, less 1/3 health care providers taken vaccine.  That's done UK. wasting time caring gets vaccine, local surgeries vaccine centers get whatever available active filtering individuals groups one vaccine other. even contract NovaVax yet, lol. also even approving April. EU reason block doses. 

Also, many doses UK EU blocked already? making statements, acting it, fond critical supplies Pfizer doses made EU cut off. 

And also really help NovaVax situation UK, EU really wants mean, block exports Matrix-M adjuvant, critical component made US EU, drug-substance production UK (and also critical supplies make critical component made EU US). Anyone older 16 get vaccine starting April 15th state think probably evidence lab escape theory. 

Then read things like Southern China see rural populations 2% exposed bat corona viruses. multiple outbreaks bat viruses. Like Ebola Hendra virus. course SARS-Covid1. also small clusters corona virus infections China.

What really take issue people pushing lab escape thoery act certain primary evidence.  spring break it‚Äôs going get worse already state databases. Currently vaccines administered California required uploaded CAIR database. I‚Äôm sure states require well. It‚Äôs called IIAS system. 

If mention post quote do. posted wall text nothing show it. asked show stats show anything less 100% effectiveness vaccines preventing hospitalization death, even variants? 

You shown that. make easier. find single case someone fully vaccinated hospitalised died. millions people fully vaccinated, many areas multiple variants. severe cases placebo group either. mean placebos effective reducing severe cases hospitalizations? 

No. honestly central valley bad all, especially outside summer. explored lot year. Shit..I must trained read bad news missed ""no"" headline

Turns good news üëç confusing, confusing, even though uncertainty. Deaths *are* people got ill weeks earlier, lag one thing. Another targeted vaccinations prevent deaths disproportionately: new cases average lower risk populations.

So deaths bounce back too, much cases. much less know yet. even bother using vaccine

Deflection! health experts scientists would get last word efficacy vaccine

Was past prologue not, they'll muzzled, they'll suppressed, sidelined

Was answer.

Pretty reasonable considering donald's history. 

Now part bring example donald let health experts scientists last word. could show VP Harris speaking disingenuously give point merit. crowd stupid. main takeaway whole thing. Lol make low effot comments across multiple subs basically trolling reactions. low effort comments need invalidating. yourself. Lmao listen one second. vaccines aren‚Äôt stopping surge American population feel confident vaccine ANYTHING get weird pseudo-living hellscape?  know accept it‚Äôs true. vaccines open people hopefully see modest rise followed steady decline Again, anti social hating this. Enjoy Texas spike comes along laxxed rules. I'll see two weeks there‚Äôs indication going end, comply? It‚Äôs like people seen complying directly benefit them, getting Covid isn‚Äôt really much reward. goal get people wear masks, distance themselves, etc etc, add incentive. know actual situation disease going improve vastly coming months. point matters whether means get act like restrictions never stop. similar chance, tiny chance getting vaccine still much worth prevent passing covid family.

Of course I'd prefer effective vaccine, want return asap normal, enough Pfizer everybody. today I'm halfway there

Whooaaoaaaa livin prayer (or science case) Get vaccine change anything you. Sounds great. Reddit? one shocked! I'm antisocial fucking hate this

Everyone part going prolong shit

I like I'm fucking hell

If people wear masks, continue social distance, follow guidelines absolutely see 20 years. CDC county lookup page. look Atlanta, realize must misremembered looking actually even worse Hey need get one friend. Couple questions you. opening 4/6 correct? friend works NY lives NJ eligible get NY right? start applying appointments 4/6 wait 4/6 apply? CVS release NY appointments midnight? make sure vaccines. still basically Hunger Games Chicago trying get one. people fall it. 100% scripted ‚Äúemotional‚Äù plea. Same. sick end February 2020. 2 flu swabs, negative. first said well, we‚Äôre going treat like flu. second one developed pneumonia said ‚Äúit‚Äôs kind virus.‚Äù gravely ill 3 weeks. think lot people tired come tell people stop complaining reopen. Coupled fact mask wearing covid guidelines politicized. made LOL talking someone know weeks ago going. well....needless say think going get better anytime soon. yes. good thing. pfizer-1 walgreens super nice. shot 15minutes wait look right come empty handed. bought eye drops band-aids walgreens brand 

It (like case) right thing do. believe research showing reduced efficacy vaccines like super significant remember hasn‚Äôt confirmed covid vaccines particular. worse. said every person got vaccinated deserved die something... Remember! Anything Europe = good! Anything American = baaaaad! 15m+ AZ doses UK 5 cases serious blood clots 1 death, causal link vaccine.

India given 25m+ AZ doses significant side effects kind arising. say Vaccines bad, like saying? feel marriages solid ground begin with. Reports say vaccine prevents infections therefore stops spread. Even cure vaccine adds enough protection people shot spread easily. makes sense ok. Mentioned rising numbers last week sub downvoted hard, screamed even louder need open right away. 


The people downvoting post don‚Äôt want true. Crazy hivemind works. bats large commonly eaten.  effective one shot 16 days? 

Asking lol even though may look like common sense now, figuring spike protein best target easy all. knew people researching vaccines SARS MERS years see worked best, even viruses disappeared. shows important fund basic research immediate applications: never know useful may become later.  Glad help! That's happens somehow pick city even worse Fresno. gotta say, though, helped laugh think laughing possible. Reddit saved mental health times. What? :) problem ""any covid death preventable death"" stuff may legitimate now, answer honestly: vaccine available change tune here?

Because like said, we're roughly 6 weeks away Mass vaccination available....I guarantee I'm going see posts comments ""any covid death preventable"" point ridiculous emotional plea force us keep restrictions up.

We're dangerously close ""if save one person worth it"" territory, yes get right since vaccine available all....but know goalposts move vaccine available? assurances? we're going live restrictions post vaccine, what's point listening slow down? Pfizer day :) Unfortunately, might still take months get shot based supply. hope double supply soon. That's vaccines work. bombshell?

I'd love hear part upsets you.  spend whole year reddit really shapes certain view world reason thing could focus fact said ""I'm going go script"" continued appear reading script. stupid caught attention, like R backwards Toys R Us. can't help notice. Absolutely true. 

I think know experts given subject, indeed really irritated people do. No, saw YouTube video Swedish guy living bunker suddenly make expert epidemiology. I'm convinced damaging words English language are, ""I read day that..."" 

That said, tend trust believe anything 100% help it. I'm conspiracy nut job anything, rather never know *anything* sure, I'd rather close new evidence information becomes available. 

I'm sorry said anything offensive otherwise rude, polite certainly deserve that. Dumbest sub group ever. open everyone. üòë wife felt sick night number 2 getting Pfizer.

My Moderna dose 2 definitely hit harder though. ? Check top comment thread dude Save money get credit score nobody stopping buying house find city level stat? Georgia like 11% overall, sure Atlanta fits that. article posted 9 hours ago, data whether vaccines stopped asymptomatic infection transmission. do. got mine checking CVS around 4am EST. Looks like added quite \~3:50 \~4:10  getting downvoted??? Got it, meant you‚Äôre eligible sooner?  Total hospitalizations metric. 

They wrong metric gauge we're heading. use metric really shows complete total ignorance. picking data keep perpetual state fear/lockdowns isn‚Äôt healthy.

You're person cherry picking data here, kid. simply understand talking surprising. large wave subsides people start leaving hospital en masse, get large drop hospitalizations. We've seen first wave low information individuals confidently incorrect claiming pandemic total hospitalizations dropping. new hospitalizations started rising, total hospitalizations still dropped due many people hospital once. another wave followed shortly thereafter. 

Now, hospitalizations increasing places hit incredibly hard winter including South Dakota new hospitalizations 100% past two weeks.  

It amazes see ignorance people like yourself. Cherry picking data. understanding data. understanding disease spread works year going already. vaccine best given case counts low, increasing...when hospital counts low, increasing... setup perfect opportunity vaccinate entire population downward trajectory cases hospitalizations (which still quite low wanted see due ignorance state governors wanted open everything back low information individuals like support decisions based lack understanding science basic epidemiology). increasing case count, risk selective pressure generate escape mutants vaccine we're back square one crap. Supposedly slightly higher cell response Pfizer/Biontech. like different cell response, since create one.

Efficacy two similar hard even come ways compare them.

Moderna team USA, experience mRNA world. phase 1 clinical trial data humans mRNA flu vaccine 2019. That's pretty cool. That's crazy, 30 minutes. site also close public transit too. Obviously location dependant, spots filling we're still 75+ another week. literally long term effects health result getting vaccine. I‚Äôd recommend deleting Facebook. people don‚Äôt think risk death even caught COVID.

Well they'd correct. people risk death catch covid. Well, case could made death could avoided via vaccine delaying infection could also prevented. I'm pretty sure still request second shot. moving goalposts now? know conservatives used losing expect give ground easily. 

The burden proof provide quotes, bombshells ready go son. 

[Here's fun  you‚Äôre saying non-vaxxed people restricted. agree! I‚Äôm talkin bout vaccines bro I've also decent success explaining vaccines able produced quickly *decade* research done coronaviruses like SARS MERS. I‚Äôm you, think it‚Äôs technicalities vaccines trialed approved EUA, case regulators taking conservative approach approve what‚Äôs tested known double blind peer reviewed studies opposed observational studies. 

That said think done first doses earlier US, point I‚Äôm sure change process would worth effort hits messaging uptake. guys really polite, thought going say Fuck First confirmed key... Washington one places looking Thank you. Like one said Michigan daily high winter surge age 25 hospital admissions day....statewide...in state 10 million. favorite based testing roughly 1/5 even covid tested positive there.


Oh article hospitalizations 800%! Seems terrifying! (until find 800% corresponds single digit increase) That's sense. study really shows way like I've seen individual studies vaccines. case AstraZeneca case J&amp;J seems take vaccines really get going terms antibodies. 4 6 weeks second dose case AZ 4 6 weeks initial dose J&amp;J even longer. I'll try look specific evidence this. Nah started administering second doses, going real fast. 200k per day past week. think non-profit / for-profit culture likely something study came today yesterday US Healthcare workers found 90% protection even asymptomatic infection. question mostly answered

B1.1.7 concern next month two immune evasion main concern point is....just idiot another month two. Practice basic precautions. Wear mask least. surge means higher risk new variant. risk vaccine resistant variant. happens then? happen fumble ball one yard line grueling year this?

Hang idiot. another month two. hard? get shot. It‚Äôs big deal.  EMA said last statement already link could confirmed *excluded* (referring blood clots, rare ones also include thrombocytopenia, rarely associated blood clots) Appreciate understand feel way. reality building plane flying also dealing expressly anti science administration. like think face hostile presidency concerned optics telling truth we‚Äôd stand up. sad reality done would‚Äôve replaced toadies like Scott ‚Äúnatural herd immunity‚Äù Atlas. It‚Äôs easy Monday morning quarterback truth CDC agencies have, part, unmuzzled Biden administration evidenced Fauci essentially saying so. ignore peril. That's happened me. First shot Moderna made dead tired 24 hours, got weird tinnitus first night. extra tired days arm felt like got slugged heavyweight boxer.

Dose two got tinnitus fatigue within hours. next morning woke sore fever chills. broke 101 degrees took tylenol. Peaked 101.9 even Tylenol. Went bed slept next morning took day time use up. could've pushed need be, nice rest allowed skip Tylenol.I still ended 99.5 evening. Day three felt pretty much day 4 everything normal. Happens yearly evidence came saying masks useless pseudoscience? know studies came said lockdowns good trade damaging economy vs reduced spread, obvious less people interacting public places, less spread. Everytime lockdown Ontario, cases dropped substantially, everytime open up, go back up.

Source study masks? Quite frankly, CDC probably trying scare people getting vaccine. ends community spread minimal. 

Vaccines get way there, pretty soon. Masks top get us even sooner. Mid 2019 LOL. sorry covid define efficacy though.....

in parameters, JJ good.

I think point clear mass vaccination safe effective Orange Island could hired dot com douchbag remove vowels use first syllables:
- CVDVX
- CoNiVax real concern based preclinical studies vaccines preventing symptoms stopping viral replication oral nasal mucosa. true, would see number vaccinated people testing positive unvaccinated (though obviously would expect vaccinated asymptomatic). fact vaccine causing large reduction number *all* cases means isn‚Äôt masking symptoms. rest world remember $14 billion dollars US invested vaccine technology led vaccines even existing. They‚Äôll remember us purchasing almost every one companies would go production getting approval we‚Äôd stock hand did. hope remember $4billion dropped COVAX bucket purchase vaccines developing countries. isn‚Äôt fear mongering, truth. hell scared of? Mild flu-like symptoms? Get grip.  50/50 Pfizer AstraZeneca moment. getting Moderna point soon. outside...relying dude pull mud bitched spoke maskless? r/covid19 would probably better place get better answer short multiple pieces data including large scale studies US Israel indicate vaccines dramatically reduce ability get infected detectable level thus spread disease. Safest least safest:

Pfizer

Moderna

J&amp;J

AZ really amazing see read. hurt head too. get wrong. mean look facts opinions. Hell wish news stations facts let form opinion. always people like fall line whatever whoever charge tells I'm 30s AZ UK... know least 8 friends 40 partner received AZ. Due timings, cohort 3 would high risk medical conditions cohort 6 also medium risk medical conditions appear mostly AZ... belive since mid Feb AZ used Pfizer initially made bulk vaccinations 70s Yes do. That‚Äôs silly. Every day every parent taking level risk raise kids. 

What I‚Äôm going is, person replying suggesting, assume COVID big deal kids probably won‚Äôt die. 

That means continuing manage risk, keeping masks working seems reasonable either get vaccinated community spread drops near zero. believe correct adjective would ""irredeemably idiotic""

It's even alliterative. talking shots boner pills? 

We need screaming rooftops Nothing whether 1/10 get covid pass not? Here's thing. Even though state Florida mandating masks, lot cities counties still are. got back spending 4 days Orlando area number people saw wearing masks almost high WA state from. big difference restrictions capacity places like restaurants.

I saw people wearing masks outside. Inside I'd say saw close 95% people wearing mask. No, sarcasm. really happened pissed off, since I‚Äôve cautious. Right pushing 100% eligible get vaccinated. start giving thresholds reopen make people think don‚Äôt need vaccine let country meet threshold. considering mad people gotten scientists inconsistent update guidance based recent data would stupid risk setting low threshold change it. Actually...it's quite fluid. 10 20 weeks ago, Dems like Biden Harris...Cuomo telling us vaccine might bad.

Hopefully get censored mods time. trying political. Fortunately live Ohio anyone face eligible. dose 2 Pfizer last Thursday. article absolutely right. gives us something positive hopeful talk about. I‚Äôm ready people.  Personally I'd consider Moderna's best one, I'm biased since live Massachusetts know people work them. probably using [actual data AstraZeneca Covid saw decrease viral shedding monkeys. Yeah I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre right haha did, didn't, believe true. authoritative source SF cases: Cool sticker, got one, useful ""I voted"" stickers.  science shown schools aren‚Äôt cause superspreading. long teachers vaccinated, open Haven‚Äôt already vaccines? Beat it. Absolutely! I'm optimistic similar studies showing result come UK US soon. result went way, negative news would now. one gets 2 dose vaccines gets hit significant side effects times get wanting get jabbed twice. Exactly. see change also ""windsock"" politicians like Lindsey Graham, whose split Trump January 6th event lasted five minutes. GOP Murdoch media may riding beast, certainly controlling it. less like herding cattle like running front bulls. That‚Äôs article about. drive community spread, THAT'S time change behavior. 

More so, mean. already gradually opening things up. weren‚Äôt dealing absence evidence though. dealing presence evidence least one leading vaccine candidates [did lower levels virus nasal secretions non-human It‚Äôs great didn‚Äôt work way humans, it‚Äôs pretty ignorant think never reason concerned.

Seriously, overtaken MAGATs middle night something? I've never seen subreddit go reasonable fucking batshit conservative whining short amount time. Fauci talking matter factly people months, year people complained clinical. don‚Äôt understand people want sometimes. Thats literally true. Wear mask forever, don‚Äôt take off! yet still flu deaths. still covid deaths year now. covid death preventable death, flu death preventable death also.  Oh yeah, boosters variants present helpful. large portion global population vaccinated though, transmissions decrease hopefully mutations rare enough need new booster every year.

Plus, current vaccines actually pretty decent SA variant (Pfizer 70% effective).

Do think talking like Fantastic Four villain shocked people ignore best solution? think making kind effort whatsoever job finding agreeable compromise safety concerns public? sure hell don't. think talking dramatic hyperbolic terms possible, ignoring every single voter blindly trust administration's inconsistent decisions, utterly *flabbergasted* states reopen instead waiting kind federal answer questions they've asking months. Would give public speech international audience without notes front you? actually watched video, know specifically calls fact talking points needs hit pivots (she literally says ""I'm going put away script now"" something like that) speaks second half video personal capacity community member/mother/etc. People can't win, they? people live city option often leave moment get enough money so.

I'm going smart request following day work next time. less confirms speculation COVID-19 around for, say, seventy-plus years got point everyone started mashing OH SHIT button. saying, variants part conspiracy keep people wearing masks? possible end?

I'm saying media's number one priority entire pandemic cultivate panic clicks views news sooner nearly everyone predicted fulfill bottom line. We've hearing variants since December NZ

The American vaccine rollout began December. Would anyone like help decide vaccine get? I'm Serbia get choose vaccine wanna get. options are: Pfizer-BioNTech, Sputnik V, AstraZeneca Sinopharm. genuinely believe they're great wanna discourage anyone getting vaccines. However, possibility choosing one wanna get feel need use it. open arguments, matter efficacy, safety political considerations. eager discussion open-minded ready hear everyone out. 

Sorry spam. understand needs removed. Trump actually directly clearly stated several times everyone get vaccine. wouldn‚Äôt call ‚Äústrongly urging‚Äù totally consistent it, he‚Äôs ever said ‚Äúyes, get shot‚Äù. believe problem case almost entirely Fox News. go gym around time tucker Carlson airs it‚Äôs always TVs, I‚Äôve seen run like 10 different anti-vaccine segments reason. fully vaccinated, anything. Sure tens cases millions vaccines effectively zero cases. mine couple weeks ago reasoning im registered carer, caring someone chronic copd right lured carrot free donuts krispy kreme goodies. FDA approves later summer (pfizer filing approval april) carrots turn sticks.  subset people never say anything good certain party power. goes ways btw. Yeah urgency definitely reduced compared adults. may moral question richer counties ponder - whether willing send excess vaccines poorer countries vaccinating children.

Although even COVID really ""just flu"" children still give 60%+ kids yearly flu vaccine eventually going happen. is, said quiet part loud.  cake baker business able turn away gay couples requests business right? Oh lord. Agree disagree. Thats fantastic news. located may ask? unfortunately anti-vaxxers edge cases. 47% voted Trump say they're getting it, addition 10% voted can‚Äôt get it. Every time go it‚Äôs like total frozen fear even though know doesn‚Äôt hurt.

you look exercises before, shot. facts getting shots time pain/bad comes it, need work someone getting stigma has! ittttttt Thanks! I‚Äôm sorry frustration. Broomfield. I‚Äôve seen posts neighborhood app people asking help finding vaccines, they‚Äôre essential workers pre-existing conditions older folks well. I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs going smoothly counties, still folks difficult time neck woods. Like said, I‚Äôve looking many websites can‚Äôt find appointments week next week. Wasn‚Äôt vaccine people 65? healthy. Office productivity seriously suffered WFH climate. something spontaneous discussions result creative atmospheres people forced together.  I'm anyone's victim, fuck nutt. Behind paywall. Anyone got full text? think medication available certain EU countries others. UK, far know east Europe doesn‚Äôt cases well. Bro think missed memo. Anyone want wear masks vaccinated mandates lifted required verbally harass assault anyone wears mask. orientation packet. lol Great news! keep us covered case AZ ends needing discontinued altogether.

I think need give serious round applause BioNTech continuing operate far beyond ever needed to; continue increasing targets year everyone going benefit it. easier ways get shot qualify.

BMI smoking pretty easy ins 100%. WFH would much different if:  

‚Ä¢We could safely normal routines ""clocking out"" day

‚Ä¢Kids fully back school  

‚Ä¢We could go work shared workspace, coffeeshop, library, etc occasion get change scenery  

‚Ä¢Workplaces could still hold volunteer/social events, workshops, speakers, happy hours, etc coworkers maintain social work connection

I'm minority never want return office (even hybrid model) would neccesary remain WFH. PR spin EU coming political issue, hence politics play.

And UK - yep, cannot comment anything public.

But given data we've seen point, may may urgent (depending aforementioned question spread) given kids 16 shown almost non-existent mortality COVID. controversial, watch news channels rhyme box? Seems talking point folks I've know that's relationship thought process. right said going ask stupid question. lockdown since May last year, I'm Auckland. husband work normal, children school sports, birthday parties etc etc. worn masks whole time would happily required. abnormal part life occasionally we've level 2 means drop children outside gate school instead going socialise buy coffee, occasional event/concert postponed standing bit away people line. Austria, Commission.  I've never screamed anyone, fuck nutt. I'm glad got vaccine program right hope people remember things getting wrong. Getting one thing right make things done wrong ok. Mississippi Someone posted stats another comment, according twice many women vaccinated. glad reached point morons like regularly downvoted Tbh never understood government include Bayer early talks begin with. biggest pharma company Germany even though vaccines thing, I'm sure see benefits (financial among others) joining good fight production side. mean Merck helping BioNTech already, more? says [book site **have condition puts higher risk (clinically vulnerable)**. Top me, means Asthma, previously define **clinically extremely vulnerable** severe asthma.

However, go system, asks carer, answering says can't use service. never involved reporting deaths. lot questionable elements behind whole story.

In case, compare numbers states numbers easily. much different. ok. Thanks Given lived New York *years*, yes would call least little unethical legally permissible - would attesting penalty perjury lives NY note would require involving someone else lie it, blatantly law. However, would absolutely *get away* question there's going anyone following check, frankly personally care much people behaving unethically get vaccines long everyone gets one eventually, guess? people act like masks torture? really bad you? swear people must live charmed lives wearing face mask ruins day words percentage wise EU exported more?

Or maybe per capita, wait EU exported per capita.

Uhhhh, wait got it. Amount vaccines imported, go UK's finally won. Extra points importing underdeveloped country Asia that's struggling horrific wave Coronavirus. Seems EU's modus operandi comes vaccine fiasco. break habit lifetime. really care faked residency get vaccine, live? pretty easy get vaccine pretty soon matter what.

Most states also give shot smokers, long we're unethical claim smoker sign there? Sorry hear. trying supportive. Sorry come across way. üé∂""If wanna get down, ground, Covid"" üéµ Oh mean like Health Canada halted 55s yesterday?

Or would FDA approve US shipping Canada Mexico? Well, call PR spin - suspect one, might well suspect UK trying protect reputation vaccine large part vaccination program relying on. again; don‚Äôt think are. much blood hands death rate per capita even surpassing all-time peak Germany, despite younger.

They might even overtake Czechia's peak month so. That's point. I'm vaccinated ""wait things re-open without needing proof vaccination"".

I've done part. lost job due COVID. found new one. wore mask, social distancing. stayed home could. sought vaccine got it.

I've done part. time others get vaccinated. job protect them. Absolutely nothing. want people avoid safety, keep wearing mask mandates lifted everyone vaccinated. desire associate people like you, want avoid people general. mask seems mutually beneficial. try paint victim. are, mostly case needed. Based seeing Israel variants currently exist aren‚Äôt causing lot trouble vaccines used western countries. Chile issues one Chinese vaccines using protecting well variants people got one may need boosters sooner. agree stopping right thing do.

Just find nunbers odd. might die get infection goverment cant make minds Im able get not.

Of course thats stressing article front page CNN suggesting yesterday. people government might saying seem catching fire media narrative   pointed out, ""There plenty cogent arguments supporting increased WFH"" organizations opportunistically looking implement changes convenient.

Good!

I'm genuinely trying derail, think lumping ""WFH"" introvert profile suggesting ""it's healthy/not people"" bit misleading. Hell, even know generalizing ""most people"" desires appropriate, that's whole kettle fish. Maybe go walk I‚Äôm sorry. It‚Äôs hard see successes places you‚Äôre hard time. didn't! Thanks! I‚Äôm J&amp;J trial. said back Feb would unblinking us giving vaccine placebo group. Still haven‚Äôt heard anything talked last week. Pfizer vaccine scheduled Thursday I‚Äôm worried taking I‚Äôve already J&amp;J. also 4 months, maybe that‚Äôs long enough. One one hundred people Canada maybe Success variation depends on

(1) number antigens presented

(2) actual geomtric / spatial variation antigen sequence

(3) number variants adjuvant (adjacent) lipids, phopholipids, carbohydrates.

I seen evidence mRNA vaccines insertional virus vectors cover well inactivated live virus vaccines. Oh, that's really true üòÑ Globalization refers economic model. Global cooperation decision haha. Countries employ different economic models decide cooperate another country. saying I'm globalization, felt like it'd wrong equate two, idk. real estate companies post millions upon millions profit? Give break. Exactly lol. ""everything free"" people get it. study completely destroys notion vaccinated individuals spreaders. cannot spreader without asymptomatic infection. fully vaccinated person could spend entire day licking used test kits spitting elderly, still spread COVID.

Logistical issues knowing vaccinated aside, zero scientific justification taking precautions vaccinated. conspiracy PR spin.

I know seem think misread journal made incorrect conclusion revised. point incorrectly pulled info total deaths daily quote... I'm going attempt pulling per capita rates. I'm tired listening anti-vaxxx idiots justify selfishness. I'm tired stop life childrens' lives anti-vaxxxers refuse right thing.

We need government step start forcing right thing. government rightly forces people pay taxes what's good society. government rightly forces fathers pay child support that's what's good society. government needs start forcing vaccines people what's right society world.

I.

Am.

Tired. Lol yea negotiated good. Great vaccines there. Mexico gonna better shape EU soon. That‚Äôs 30 women. Possible it‚Äôs gone undetected? chaos pandemic overwhelmed medical system, especially considering clotting seems world due covid? low?  USA seems like vaccine distribution pretty amazing, things considered. Especially compared countries (looking canada). money could buy us vaccines right now... far know mild moderate Asthma deemed especially high priority provided control.

It confuses well, Asthma younger sister. first dose Vaccine, haven't. Lol fuck Worst government remember. Ok. you. frustrating part sanitation theater bullshit *never* goes away. People brag much love ""listening science"" actually care science. care feeling safety.

The science said, [Since last temperature screening ineffective. Yet many employers hospitals still requiring it?

[We've known since last surface transmission unlikely. many retail stores still wiping checkout lanes shopping carts *every single use*?

And pretty soon, we'll know vaccination levels high enough point masks, COVID testing, proof vaccinations necessary contain spread pandemic. There's bone body doubts things dragged too. different post-9/11 security theater deal today. That's like saying bought BMW EU. 

""The EU M3 favorite car"" No...the mass executions spot analogy  need get people vaccinated safe go back normal, need boosters every 3-4 months like suggest. Maybe annually, far vaccines administered 3 months, nearly year since formulas finalized testing started developed resistant strain. question need boosters often likely going driven far long vaccine induced immunity lasts variants getting around vaccines. Estrogen levels equivalent, yes would apply both.

Some birth controls often similar types Hormones may take. may also relevant. post-arm pain flu shot year first covid vaccine shot. YMMV, think worth benefit, 100%. Fortunately her, she'll probably never find COVID kill since many people around getting vaccine presumably, risk contracting virus reduced every day passes. OMG amazing me. Never even considered prior this. essence here,‚Äù Balcezak added. ‚ÄúAnything slows vaccine distribution going cause excess mortality.‚Äù

Kind sums up. Thanks. work city capacity? thanks do!! parents were, biobank NHS one things I'm truly proud UK, best thing going politician ever said anything dismantling it, id like think would burned alive live CA, expensive part. Cases started uptick already.  realistic important, avoiding confirmation bias.  many people bad objective. I'm betting state reporting ill-gotten gains either. Nothing new. 18 year old, vaccine harder get ps5 lmao. sick, yes. healthy scared getting sick, sure. healthy worried getting sick, no. people vaccinated Biontech/Pfizer. rapid tests 70% accurate symptomatic patients. still cough. think actual figure around 45% first dose. direct supply, currently people Republic able get vaccinated Northern Ireland. Right fairly limited set people I'd expect criteria loosen things progress risk getting blood clots COVID significantly higher risk getting blood clot vaccine. hospitalized COVID patients getting antithrombotic injections every day risk thrombosis COVID high.

These 31 cases vaccinated people got blood clots. say related way. WHO, EMA AstraZeneca stated unlikely vaccine causing blood clots. Blood clots common population, especially older people, people unhealthy diets smokers.

Also, take grain salt, people close vaccine development/research know think vaccines based adenoviral vector cause blood clots.

I think definitely take vaccine. worried, take Aspirin. Aspirin effective preventing blood clots frequently taken people cardiovascular issues prevent conditions. I‚Äôm anti-mask. make difficult breathe. complaining still wear one I‚Äôm supposed to. receive second Pfizer dose April 19th. 30 days that, allowed walk around mask free. one? Politics? really petition, starting debate looking political discourse effectiveness elected representatives. 

I sign it, seeing like think go one great achievements modern medicine. Incredible. told March 20 90%+ effective vaccine would go scratch FDA approval year, I'd called nuts. According Center Disease Control Prevention, Michigan 361.5 new cases per 100,000 people last seven days, ranking second behind New York City 366.5 cases per 100,000 people. number Michigan residents hospitals confirmed cases COVID-19 increasing faster rate fall Gov. Gretchen Whitmer shuttered indoor dining suspended in-person high school classes. percentage COVID-19 tests bringing positive results rising five weeks Cases among kids ages 10 19 risen 133% last four weeks, faster age group outbreaks continue rise schools youth ""Our progress COVID-19 fragile,"" Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said last ‚ÄúWhile we're making great progress vaccination efforts, seeing concerning data shows going wrong direction."" exactly? 

Pfizer accepted zero funding operation warp speed development manufacturing vaccine. CA cases 5% peak vaccinating 1% population days. rest US similar. really want 4th wave bad go spend time country vaccines one got best vax shut 55. think point grudgingly accept wrong. could accepted right time 3 months ago could say ""there data before"". another exit ""I wanted see macro infection rates"". Soon they'll deny pandemic tough.

As Israeli, loads people thought government would botch badly lockdowns throughout last year. took bet paid even anti-vaxxer friends admit done brilliantly. Sorry hear it. 102 fever two days. better get them. get much stronger longer lasting protection Actually, looks like city shipments come today. We‚Äôre back 161k first doses available. So, could drop later today. Doesn‚Äôt hurt try tomorrow probably likely. Looking positive headlines german makes completely jealous. It‚Äôs difficult believe, technically, yes. Lol anyone humor him? think problem understand word efficacy means context. say efficacy talking ability prevent infection,

This exactly using term entire time. never taken position studies demonstrate vaccines prevent severe disease. taken position extent prevent severe disease demonstrated cases new strains like B.1.351. Johnsons clinical trial done South Africa variant dominant... links say much. Again, hospitalizations deaths clinical trial among vaccinated group.

That correct. hospitalizations deaths trial I'm interpreting correctly study basically told us vaccine performed around levels placebo group terms preventing moderate mild infection. tell us enough would fair preventing severe disease, something study says pretty directly feel: ""The clinical relevance lower neutralization activity either mild severe Covid-19 perfect quote sum argument, link.

I notice glossed part supported I've saying far. seem crossed point yet never point. point yet known vaccines fair long run vs variants like B.1.351. 

I reiterate since seems we've talking past eachother; point fully understand vaccines wil fully impacted variants, especially newer ones. said would never make absolute irresponsible claim ""the variants major impact USA."" something rather admit fallen back position ""show one case someone vaccinated died due variant."" wondering I'll higher risk lung cancer years due covid twice long hauler. covid vaccine, one definitely likely unforeseen long term consequences. Sadly, you‚Äôd likely breathe droplets elevator could put mask on. ‚ÄúCould‚Äù - could mean really low possibility happening high possibility happening. one it? lmfao. Covid test negative, covid symptoms, medical professional said followups. So... read theyd 1 dose adults june. idk thats true Either Rochelle Walensky knows something don‚Äôt she‚Äôs purely hyperbolic.

Covid needs taken seriously everyone needs stick till end. I‚Äôm fan people important public health positions making amounts opinionated statements. Rochelle Walsesnky entrusted observation disease, mitigate it, make sure people protected. time yes, US case increasing vaccinations also increasing, messaging comes disconnected

If go doctor tell cancer, want tell options are, prognosis is, medical opinion, etc. don‚Äôt want get teary eyed tell horrors aunt experienced undergoing chemotherapy. Maybe I‚Äôm callous, Rochelle Walensky stating interpreting facts data, song dance routine want say amazing figured give instructions BODY still control 100% understanding of.   Would prudent get tommorow around noon keep trying today/ tonight? uhhh looking put charge DOJ,FCC,DOE,EPA,postmaster etc etc.... Thats perfectly reasonable concern.

The guy lied incessantly hired yes men. would anyone trust government? definitely plan continuing wear mask crowded places definitely plan wearing airports flights. I've lost count many times I've gotten sick flying. American here: really scared Covid, wary people ever. Virus never politicized discriminated got sick died; people did. stupidly holding motorcycle festivals (SD), hard lockdowns even mostly remote places (CA), spouting bs truth suppression (FL), uniform response pandemic. bunch finger pointing, soapboxing dumbfuckery lead half million people losing lives.

Wear fucking mask avoid other. want eat out, order take out. stopped thing 6 months ago, Americans tripped fucking legs. risk getting blood clots COVID significantly higher risk getting blood clot vaccine. hospitalized COVID patients getting antithrombotic injections every day risk thrombosis COVID high.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know probably dumb question, but:

Are unused units lying around somewhere? 

Also, I'd imagine signing treatment would similar like receive vaccine: disaster (in US, course).  think misunderstood comment. think I‚Äôm biased live Texas, right fine even though government restrictions. places restrictions anymore aren‚Äôt well. also places restrictions worse, better.

It's hard say absence information. Especially since lockdowns West tend pretty... hole-ridden IMO.

Lockdowns really force people distance away can't voluntarily (like know...). useful rarely see Western countries implementing one never go all-in it.

If general populace good adhering social distancing, sanitary practices, PPE usage, absence lockdown big deal - take Japan example. massive population density, really locked much, big outbreak compared place like Texas data goes lockdown narrative though, people say different reasons like weather. logic places warmer weather low population density open no?

Also, would suggest also look ""Excess death"" numbers bit. official case count measure true infection rate.

It's 100% this. idea push releasing news couple months overwhelming majority high-risk people vaccinated, people lie status less impact. also think cautious move part lift mask mandates pretty much one going listen try reinstate them, get one shot walking back want many people possible dosed do.

My understanding mostly return normalcy (with hand washing masks) we're fully vaccinated though, cases drop here, issues acting normal year. Biden supposedly sort ""vaccine passport"" thing businesses opt into, possible patronize safer places US.

But mostly looking forward like 3-5 months we've hopefully got COVID control. Where, Idaho? summer festivals still getting cancelled Seattle. J+J worse efficacy, based standards, AZ - surely worse vaccine (going logic).

Vaccines judged real world, clinical trials. Oxford/AZ's vaccine distributed global vaccine - impact across world calming pandemic other.

And said, T-Cell response completely unaffected prime dosing regiment, significant level neutralisation occurs - small study intended show effectiveness variant nowhere near enough evidence categorically state vaccine work variant. see could hard lot people.

EU set international vaccination production hub lobbied companies produce vaccine within EU. UK infrastructure like that, produced 15m vaccines total since September last year. makes sense EU get thousand vaccines week UK nice, would cost money help anyone. 

A UK funded university created vaccine gave IP away free EU could produce it, that's probably nice gesture UK could make. I'm town halfway Atlanta Charlotte. People want live crime-ridden Atlanta e-commute mountains.

Yeah, that's sort meaning discrete populations. connections populations needs considered. example, UK France, much road transport trade cannot considered particularly discrete, UK Brazil far so. however slice think logic favours targeting populations rather sharing vaccines globally (I waiting weakness logic exposed, epidemiologist).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* U.K. planning export Ireland.  Yet we're still stringent lockdown- even considering outdoor pubs/restaurants hairdressers reopen two weeks.

Surely timeline brought forward? Deaths incredibly low hospitalizations across UK around 3k believe - 90% reduction January peak. 

It's time get lockdown start living  thing last June let restrictions Florida got slammed. like attitude all. they're sitting large stockpile vaccines finishing vaccination campaign? global crisis becomes clear supply outpaces demand, start exporting. think that's joke.

As EU resident I'm really pissed it, although wonder simply always going end people waiting ages vaccines simply enough production capacity.

They could funded though obvious since March last year would need massive vaccine production paying ""penny wise, pound foolish"" given extreme expense lockdowns. Took different post: 

‚ÄúA previously healthy 49-year-old nurse received first dose AZD1222 vaccine (AstraZeneca) mid-February 2021 (day 0). minor complaints (fatigue, myalgia, headache) next days. Beginning day 5, developed chills, fever, nausea epigastric discomfort, admitted local hospital day 10. ‚Äú died day 11.

I think problem recognizing what's going time. problem. complaints uncommon vaccination. mean, anyone w brain even rudimentary understanding vaccines *been* knowing model-driven vax, working well, exceedingly likely driven good model and, accordingly, getting vaxxed significantly protect others. 

There's little real medical question here.

The big question different sort transmission: social contagion relaxining safety protocols.

If tell everyone vax thing pretty much highly effective vaccinations (i.e., protects receiver extremely large degree spend time transmission), get people vaxxed demasking.

And make *super* hard get everyone else keep masking, etc.

There's real epidemiological problem here. seems like something known rolling entire population. here. depressing. they‚Äôre likely believe magical sky daddy protect fucking virus vaccines science dangerous. hope they‚Äôre minority enough people get vaxxed end Cool, Israel could stop settler colonial ethno-nationalist apartheid state would great. Haha knew would get said it‚Äôs point made bad faith.

No AZ exported 20 million UK. Almost vaccines Pfizer made UK meeting exceeding EU contract. Unvaccinated people contribute herd immunity via infection subsequent immunity. dont know getting at. Businesses already right. 'How government using GPS track people' LOL

Also, remember Facebook selling user data? Google? can't look shit up? friends, point they‚Äôll probably get it. don‚Äôt want scramble first. taking nothing else account. risk already immunized, 15% texans natural immunity now. brand new point. Thanks bringing data! week got implemented Ohio little brother got exposed COVID kid sitting right next him, 3 feet away. Doesn‚Äôt seem like contracted though. we're giving businesses green light refuse service based medical tests?

They've always able that. deny service people provide forms vaccination records daily updated STD test every time enter store?

But they're asking those. They're requiring pass generated middleman already given consent take peek order generate said pass. capitalist coercion honest government shit. Texas lifted mask mandate cases dropping. Stop fear mongering. go back conspiracy subreddits someone cares. Exactly. bunch panic nothing. rare side effects consequences literally everything. blown risks way proportion people seem largely forgotten weigh risks vs. benefits. one talking Government, private business. 

Please show example claim...

The GPS would fun see..how government using GPS system track people. bad news public Texas largely shut due power outages restrictions lifted. can't help think would depress case numbers, though I'm sure effect would last 3 weeks. sounds like they're checking paperwork. checking batches chemicaly make sure correct amount active ingredients? that's MHRA does. know, government passports travel figured long time without happening. Maybe that's implement similar system individual businesses really happen. long last conspiracy theorists believe spreads means different people's air silenced! said literally zero health impacting others, want businesses right choose engage based requested medical information. That's said, again, hope works precedent abused. hope support they're Alabama, huge hypocrite. AZ signalled pretty early commitments met. J&amp;J far, they've talked initial delays April.

AZ cut delivery target 70% 2 weeks deliveries meant start, making noise production issues, say serious were. cases going still anywhere? frankly disingenuous. don‚Äôt think lifting mask mandates stuff spared uptick. go back office? Isn‚Äôt show over? making another season? Travel schools definitely make sense entertainment restrictions going bit far. 

I feel like point, at-risk people need take individual action protect themselves. 

If think still large chance dying Covid getting long haul symptoms post-vaccination, willing choose precautions want take accept consequences something goes wrong, avoid businesses accord. said we'd live forever like this

I'm dem I'm moving florida Texas. consequences Canada Germany use AZ vaccine, probably another 6 weeks herd immunity, another 4 weeks restrictions. 1 100,000 women 55 get troublesome blood clot 40 % women die ( 4 per million) deaths young women emotional impact death care homes. first World countries might take economic hit staying restricted rather try win argument greater good.

Also, cases among younger people part. think Texas fine. understood too. since vaccination guarantee 100% infected, get seriously ill die covid, theoreteically could number people could carriers overt symptoms themselves. evidence vaccine prevents carriers spreading it? mean situation?

Oh, doctor shares information every business go to? times? often? Ok. No, aren't? Keeping continued lockdowns / strict restrictions year impatient all. already talking looming cancer crisis due lack treatment checkups, many lifestyle diseases neglected also.

And there's lot people think battle - believe since vaccines, within weeks back normal. really hope variants run steam thing dies thousand deaths. want play board games friends go wife too! still hurdles - B117 process creating new surge, new variants cropping everyday. need mindful things worries see people writing things fear mongering whatever.

I sorry tone earlier harsh. Lol, long passport last exactly? want app scan go H&amp;M forever something? relief, worried even though got mine, varriant would walk righ Newsflash: think doctor stores information?

Furthermore, vaccination record held database CDC. piece paper think off. Actually people act way negates lockdowns anyways, actions tell need know. people more, accept small loss life order majority happy again. 

It's nothing new.

I hope good news coming U.S. vaccines administered start offering extra doses Canada really soon.

Norway press conference today, still assume AstraZeneca part vaccination program, unable continue vaccination AZ mean one week delay vaccination program tsunami Pfizer J&amp;J vaccine coming June July. bad news public old aunt uncle? study Israel last week found incredible efficacy Pfizer, noted efficacy people 80 yrs old much reduced.

That combined people moving around though pandemic over, states basically haphazardly opening up, etc. even though Federal government pouring money hand fist, etc. makes worried people die **needlessly reason all.** good news: early second half year, companies able offer ready-to-use formulation vaccine could stored refrigerator Also works freeze-dried formulation, require clinical trial ensure it‚Äôs safe works well original. study start U.S. April, BioNTech said, data third quarter. freeze-dried version vaccine could stockpiled governments shipped stored even easily.

I still frustrated think statistical bias play right now. don‚Äôt disagree fall last wave it‚Äôs climbing again. frustrated believe author attempting make story bigger cherry picking percentages hard numbers. goal scare people stay safe little longer. I‚Äôd personally rather treated adult told facts straight. Ya know? NY's daily case count gone completely radar seems. They've hovering around 7-9k daily cases since JANUARY Without addressing risk mutations, article seems suggest west deliberately pursuing policy vaccine we've learned, viruses care borders. vaccinate many people possible, everywhere world, quickly possible. wait watch instead getting ahead this?‚Äù

I understand allegation west deliberately standing by: clearly, western countries pursuing herd immunity home distributing vaccine globally, spreading vaccines thinly might save lives (in protect world's vulnerable sooner) significantly reduce spread disease, virus would continue spread nearly unabated absence NPIs.

If abundance vaccine, west need give away poorer countries reduce spread; right now, problem hoarding simply making enough. It‚Äôs ultimately wrong question. reinfected Covid classic, albeit low rate. It‚Äôs clear certain variants evade antibodies level, it‚Äôs still unclear impact has, evidence, despite reduced neutralization titers pseudoparticle studies, variants evade immunity generated mRNA vaccines whatsoever. like article conveniently ignores Israel withholding vaccinations Palestinian population. That's pretty big deal &amp; pretty effed them, course they're allowed get away murder (literally &amp; metaphorically) time &amp; girl bang Sad Guy? Actually Dr F. said exactly anything masks make things worse. Yes Chinese cities going lockdown time time COVID inevitably gets reintroduced occasionally, especially border towns. Australia New Zealand. Chinese citizens cannot travel countries freely tourism face hardcore 14 day lockdown upon returning. imagine 3-4 years, would absolutely insane. Honestly experts saying actually happen rooting apocalypse. Israel's 7 day average lowest since june 2020. Yeah, well that's live poll people suffering emotional reasoning (also great way prune toxic little shits acquaintances), ""if feel it, real; factual evidence means nothing me"".

I listen healthcare workers actually know they're talking about, say new variants bringing people 30s 40s ICU. lockdown seems mor reasonable me.

Also, believe they‚Äôve documented cases ‚Äúconvergence,‚Äù one individual infected different strains, perhaps simultaneously, resulting community transmission kind viral hybrid. recall, documented Oregon within last month so. count women 18-55, guess 1:10.000 even (incidence, deaths). data back up, feeling.

It‚Äôs quote article. 13 kg. that‚Äôs quite lot Since pathophysiologic mechanism completely published, hard tell. team german scientists postulates hit mimicry disorder (heparin induced thrombopenia without heparin). never heard seen life before. german hospitals universities stopped vaccinating az 18-55 female population growing number cases. run google news search, u want see yourself. Correct, 10 weeks two doses. UK government trying get many first jabs done possible moving second jabs. idea give partial protection larger number people, rather full protection smaller group. Let's forget USA blocked Brazil's access Sputnik V ones Italy destined Covax, UK.

And really whether ""need"" more: paid them, made vaccine, we're keeping them.

The problem EU leaders, UK. One damp little island reason got jab. Weird suggests ordinary, threats common last month people top.

The people make decisions explicitly stated ""nothing table"" reference export bans. much Pfizer came warning it. Post downvoted ‚Äòopen-up‚Äô cult flooded sub recently, people know Moderna vaccine patented literally days COVID's genome sequenced Jan 2020. ongoing mrna research prior outbreak we'd relying solely traditional vaccines like J&amp;J ‚Äúpretty much accepted‚Äù mean? work antibodies often see bind targets ~40% homology target. assume variants far homology this, although it‚Äôs difficult find numbers. well known exposure coronaviruses (which presumably much lower homology variants) could provide pre-existing immunity. Really? That's amazing! 5 UK cases 19-59 1 50?  We're single digits double doses. We've done double doses EU average. know, sarcasm :) think happening GP level. surgeries gonna way lists, many older adults, capacity jab fast would like etc.

It'll even out! worry it. told FEMA site person administered vaccine Tylenol/acetaminophen okay take sore afterwards, specifically Advil/ibuprofen tell avoid. says 90% effective preventing illness, nothing transmission 100% protection severe cases may true, dealt dose causes blood clots death, worth it? Well considering 1 case reported 50, statistically irrelevant. Yes. Absolutely.

More time sleep, commutes. socialize co-workers. time due lack commute socialize see friends, ie people actually like socialize spend time unlike co-workers. 

It's easy win. lucky American. family UK vaccinated already, mainland Europe complete disaster, though vaccines never existed. exactly would prevent though? takes 1 (literally one) mutated COVID case re-infect whole country. They'd forced go hardcore lockdown even single case COVID detected, would hard quickly figure vaccine-resistant not. they'd live constant fear least 3-4 years, going lockdowns. think UK makes much vaccine comparatively, make lot ingredients go vaccine. Vaccinefinder.org CDC back website find locations. ton pharmacies now. think it'll difficult. quickly going turn need find people wanting get vaccinated. scheduled AZ delivery. Meanwhile getting double amount Pfizer Moderna next two weeks million. Pfizer week that. based promised doses? Seems like one getting ordered full. Yes, vaccine trials South Africa showed this. actual numbers disputed due faulty tests relatively low number participants, phenomenon seems pretty much accepted virologists clinicians. everyone,but tried already skip Season 1. much happens, worst season besides last 1-2 (those bad Steve Carrell left). Season 1 tonally far different rest series low transmission rate still, might hold months vaccine update ramps up. Otherwise, rip without mandatory testing. I'll see point lol CVS confirm eligibility. weeks, CVS's website said appointments fully booked. scheduled appointment last week. multiple openings several days, several nearby CVS pharmacies. indicates fall Virginia's eligibility tiers want vaccine gotten least fist dose. Overall, vaccinations state appear tapering off. think due lack demand. state continuing drag feet open vaccinations adults. Besides, harping we're race time, shots arms better. shame one kid's teammates opponents covid, gave kid, child permanent lung impairment?

Now don‚Äôt agree coach, hyperbole. likelihood college aged athlete getting permanent lung damage covid low would never even consider possibility virus. College sports reported thousands covid cases, single one involves ‚Äúpermanent lung damage‚Äù want go back either. WFH great. commute office, sleep able sleep in. also like socializing co-workers great well get avoid that. 

Now get called ""shut-in"" introvert liking working office liking socializing co-workers, look many friends outside work I'd rather spend time socializing with. anything common co-workers outside fact work place. 

Working home normal times would fantastic. office drama politics. socialize co-workers want socialize spend time with. lack commute would allow able find easier stuff hang friends, ie people actually like socialize spend time with. It'd perfect normal times.

People daily thread get defensive someone talks WFH enjoyable good, like get people like working office also people rely solely co-workers social stimuli, reasons people also like WFH anti-social shut-in liking WFH. Im pretty sure meant culturally speaking, 40 yo considered old people nearly nearly twice lethal 30-40 year old cohort. according r/badunitedkingdom  hope means longer society's responsibility protect people. anti-vaxxers made choice, able cough right consequences. Slight exaggeration, get vaccine want catch covid idiot, problem. edge cases ideally extremely minimal (people specific health issues allergies something) there's lot beyond getting vaccines reduce transmission much possible. children never really risk, they're far damaged shutdowns disease itself. Right information contradictory unclear. might young women birth control experienced side effects countries could well people received vaccine countries healthcare workers, least country predominantly young women.

The interesting question countries (e.g., UK) report cases (perhaps within statistically expected range matter people take vaccine not) countries higher number deaths far fewer doses administered.

Im one! think significant point missing article counterbalances.

Immunity population non linear vaccinations, one vaccination gives one person immunity 65% might give 100% protection (numbers example only).

So goal reduce total infection count globally, vaccinate discrete populations rapidly get herd immunity effect use leverage. move next discrete population. obviously purely discrete populations big difference lines transmission say London-Manchester London-Sao Paulo.

Distributing vaccines broadly would slow number populations entering leveraged area vaccination curve would therefore result infections.

What got wrong concept? That's good hear! read spike protein mutated two variants concern would vaccines work those. Hoping sure data soon. Thank help. thoughts exactly. pandemic taught anything, like species whole. want it, us can't even get one. Yep, UK strain seems problem : UK overall number cases death decreasing pretty fast. likely due combination vaccin lockdown. data Israel goes direction. Media built UK-strain-threat without convincing data us felt story aside less active (also gyms closed), people eat home. people eat feel good especially they're lonely. 

For many people, social keeps accountable weight. Think people often get fitter summer people see body more.  making new habits take time hard, especially whole life drastically changing. many people used getting exercise sports, gym job may lost due pandemic. they‚Äôre forced work study home. rates depression likely increased well many results weight gain even bigger difficulties creating new, healthy habits. many live densley populated areas going walk means exposing risks, too. lots reasons.

Hope enjoying it!  ""impending doom"" this? impending doom nothing variants efficacy vaccines. fact everyone vaccinated yet especially younger cohorts seeing serious disease higher transmissibility variants. Nobody arguing vaccines working. actual FDA filing side effects Moderna clinical trials. Anecdotally I've seen worse side effects Moderna. Lastly lack CD8+ cells produced Moderna shot could potentially less long term immunity. GlaxoSmithKline UK company, making UK doses Novavax UK. compliments Novavax production US, diverts it.   realize ""I want able get shot right now"" ""I want drive hour+ rural counties get shot"" contradictory statements, right?

There people live cities get shot right now. Hence people wait. way changes getting supply getting people vaccinated reduce demand. Making people eligible increase demand.  zero clue rentals come country.

You need afraid. need context. risk vaccine now. next group (essential workers) never stopped working, already vaccine.

R 1.01 everyone get eventually, unless immune. really hope that's case... i've taking quarantine extreme i've def wondering happen i'm back around people regularly US government massive 'advertising' campaign promoting showing vaccines work every variant be. Really? getting vaccinated week lol Apparently new variant since discovered parts Europe Mais les chercheurs de l'institut de virologie du CHU de Strasbourg n'ont jamais parl√© de variant ""alsacien"" insiste Samira Fafi-Kremer, directrice de l'institut. D'autant plus que la base de donn√©es internationales du CNR montr√© que ce variant circule d√©j√† dans d'autres r√©gions du monde, en Europe mais aussi aux Etats-Unis. UK 46%, germany 10%. scientists first develop one (and yes americans, german scientists developed it, US financed it) I'm sure believe data coming Florida. vaccine card write patient number - write myself? No, unprotected sex infect people literally go jail. Sadly one cannot ""delegate"" ""I trust experts"" without also thinking oneself ask inner ""common sense"", losing credibility fast... think misunderstand said. say shipped AZ vaccine EU UK EU EU. meant general AZ send UK EU. Total production. Highly recommend site checks multiple pharmacy chains Congrats! Lol okay...

1. FEMA funding assistance states assist rollout vaccine. included Fed assistance multiple levels last mile rollout.  note, ZERO planning last mile distribution prior admin.

2. previous administration actual plans past getting nursing homes. plans exist, can't find there.

3. Reworking distribution.  Part initial slow rollout getting vaccines states fast enough fill demand. Biden came backlog, ordered additional missing doses ensured last mile planning involved.

4. mention zero last mile planning distribution?  continuation ""I accept responsibility"" letting states deal however wanted.

5. zero plan J&amp;J rollout, Biden admin thing.

6. Addional congressional funds allotted purely vaccine disbursement. Zero republicans voted this, safe assume prior administration pushed it.

7. FEMA run vaccination centers states. part previous admin's plan.

Beyond that, messaging drastically changed (It'll gone easter!) absolutely encourages people take doses.

So ya go. expect nothing back besides bad faith answer though whatever. source CDC Covid tracker daily trend chart.

Currently think happening states seeing demand drop opening people stimulate demand. open everyone shortages states surplus others.

I sure people cross state lines travel get shot still shots pile unused. curious see that. hormonal birth control, would explain almost exclusively women. mean UK hard lockdowns masks resturants shut massive testing testing send communities, none unenforced masking states?

You mean UK **""overall England vaccinated 87% aged 50 above""**

 UK? fucking love medical science!!!! Fox News Hero Week live LA think even pessimistic people knew half US wasnt going die this. Also Canada well equipped distribute vaccines thar require cold storage well. birth control? 

Im pretty curious cases female-skewed, maybe coincidence Healthcare workers likely female Germany. coincidence, maybe birth control could involved?

I‚Äôm sure getting shot symptoms develop, flu vaccine, example, it‚Äôs likely *mild* illness (not talking covid) wouldn‚Äôt affect efficacy vaccine. Might covid. However, CDC recommends vaccinated believe covid order protect people giving vaccines others you‚Äôd come contact with. 

As going night shot, won‚Äôt meaningful protection less 24 hours shot. want go out, use precautions you‚Äôd use hadn‚Äôt vaccinated all. single known strain undermined vaccination effort. Even strain bypasses immunity, preexisting vaccines likely effective enough keep hospitalizations deaths low new vaccine issued. 

People becoming lax see writing wall: third country definitely immune half country probably immune. Literal doomsaying sounds absolutely ridiculous they'll stop caring. need roughly 50-60% entire population vaccinated infection rates start slowing, assuming full lockdown supply constraints vaccines months

Supply already outstrip demand US whole. messaging terrible, they're acting vaccines daily administration rate 3 million average. Cases drop soon anyway, US 35% first shot number increases every day. R0 can't stay high natural immunity vaccines.  agree all, sounded like want team forfeit exposure Wait til breaks free golf ball People dying. least 1,000 people day US. wait see means US terms younger people dying. Eww thing? 

This sub overrun psychos seldom seen voted posts. good. looks like vaccines thing help world fight disease. Pfizer announced launch testing orally administered anti-covid-19 drug, help protect severe course would enough take tablet twice day five days, used beginning outbreak. ""As virus mutates, starting look like important access treatment options future,"" Pfizer's chief scientific officer Mikael Dolsten said official him, vaccines alone may enough long run. ""Combating Covid-19 pandemic requires vaccine prevention targeted treatment infected virus,"" added.

‚Ä¶ Block 20 see quickly changes. I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs people many different threads. uncle Brazil died last week mom‚Äôs good friend too. much death Denmark country like Norway pausing vaccine political reasons. high vaccine acceptance trust government authorities, know look thorough gather analyse data giving recommendations. countries worry ""impending doom"" comment. Unless US is. MANY antivaxxers antimaskers here, I'm going pleasantly surprised genuinely shocked fourth wave variants. think it'll nearly bad winter surge, think it'll cake walk either. seems like everyone thinks we're end stopped social distancing, staying home, masking up, etc. statement made effort get people care experiencing covid fatigue snap back reality understand see finish line approaching, reached yet. Let's hope antivaxxers screw us put us loop 2020. Probably like 170M infections added (and overlaps taken out). That's half Americans.

By end april that's 200M getting damn close herd immunity. Memorial day... Lit. men, moreso women person likes interacting people? two black eyes. Maybe get kind vaccine.The roll pathetic. elderly almost completely vaccinated youth less susceptible serious illness Covid. probably putting health risk opening everything right now, probably one age 45+ residents state still can't get appointment vaccine may latent health issue would complicate treatment seriously ill. People *are* still dying Covid, rates higher influenza worst years. Maybe hold horses another month half end US good. continuously mutating strains + people becoming increasingly lax. Go surgery Cuba then. from, center? city still enforcing mandate. 

I see around chin wearers last year, though. mind anymore. assume they're vaccinated now.  ‚ÄúBitching‚Äù verb. Maybe misjudged would said male name, know experience usually goes. 
I got bullied Reddit constantly female username people would quickly default sexist names even littlest arguments think accidental lab leak.

But there's 0.01% sure accidental part. gaming out. 

Let's say developed highly contagious coronavirus deadly enough cause fear harm, deadly enough completely shut world cause anarchy. nice R 3ish, IFR 0.5ish sweet spot. Nicely dialed in. 

Say wanted start global outbreak it. Well, know coronavirus bat origin, world knows bats live. can't go dropping thing Kansas City. look credible, infect people first, allow local party officials citizens paint airwaves (and signals intelligence) confusion, dramatically clamp stop it. also want make sure outbreak sufficiently international city. Wuhan seafood market subway line airport. Easy escape Europe city shutdown, go. 

Here's clever part. Wuhan virus lab makes lab accident theory Great Conspiracy. ""Oh they're trying hide accident, like Chernobyl."" Acting shady lab, coming alternative theories...all part diversion op. 

China knows west contain airborn coronavirus R 3. authoritarian moves required happen. It'll burn long time China moved on. 

Meanwhile, last 12 months China has:
-Scored huge PR win Xi Chinese system (internally) due virus triumph compared western systems 
-Squashed Hong Kong's protest movement effectively ended pretenses anything complete CCP control
-Ratcheted tensions Taiwan
-Watched US blast debt/GDP past WW2 levels response virus, making future (wartime?) fiscal needs harder fund. 

China benefited lot, despite started. Anyway, fun. bummer thing AZ vaccine gets suspended say months, majority vaccinated till December given rate we're going. CBS News media? cant wait hear they're reactions proven disproven OP mentioned media, reddit. That‚Äôs dumbest fucking question I‚Äôve ever read. shocked ask anything. Also appeared one oldest guys I'm 39. Rangers raised eyebrows opening 40,300 seats Globe Life Field Monday‚Äôs exhibition. 12,911 fans showed up. third country vaccinated. We'll probably hit half vaccinated end April states beginning open adults. 

What ""impending doom"" mind, Joe? likely low first week. 7-14 day range immunity starts ramp reach 80% around/after 2 week mark. Human body produce antibodies generally take 7 days longer, protection first week low. ramp gradually 7-14 day range. New York going call remaining wfh workers say open business. Masks even required, half ass rules staying six feet apart refs vaccinated? Everybody clubhouse staff? TV crews? Hotel staff? Bus drivers?

They test protect 20 year old players, jackass can‚Äôt tell sarcasm Texas always gonna Texas; immunity, fuck players, parents, team.

I would give time figure E484K variants, Kent Indian variants found making grand statemtents vaccine resistance. 

I mean, could case right now, simply know. think U.S. start fourth wave? thought you‚Äôd given instead decided repeat points I‚Äôve already answered instead?

No, EU bought vaccines could produced UK could also produced EU. AZ behind UK contract EU contract wonder think prioritise EU one completely? 

Actually don‚Äôt wonder don‚Äôt expect anything worth reading point. vaccine weeks still banned DK. that's true.. earlier interview German minister included saying they'd usually expect 50 cases blood disorder per year entire German population. 

If that's true yes, way higher It‚Äôs also first time 7 day moving average dropped 500 since June loved London office. another commenter noted, work culture far better US, even high pressure jobs like finance. 

To point, can‚Äôt wait get back office I‚Äôm sick working makeshift setup apartment (NYC) hate reading numbers city. Please stay safe praying relief comes soon country. LOCKDOWNs kinda right. masks....no help LOT slow spread. denying that. You‚Äôre place. Yes, said one justify except rich people... yet you‚Äôve mentioned justifications poor people living reason can‚Äôt fathom middle class folks move city due anything besides closeness job...

Just let go, man. personally hate cities. You‚Äôre biased that‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôre living another world think there‚Äôs going drain people suburbs... went ‚Äòburbs due cheap housing, GI benefits areas racism studies mixing vaccines

The [UK mixing vaccines. making conclusion from? can‚Äôt see anywhere data all. 15% young people revived Covid vaccine haven‚Äôt seen issues. signals sure would stopped. Believe UK health authorities business killing population $14billion barely measurable didn‚Äôt EU invest much vaccine development production wouldn‚Äôt mess?  be

There already was, man. time last year I'd say 75% people spending time worried, looking information, comfort others told, 25% looking say big deal, going told do, masks dumb, etc.

That 25% nearly 100% moved on. look post history half witted comment find (and hard find) realize absolutely dealing ring-wing conspiracy crowd. deflecting hard here, answering point. US UK paid significantly more. India exported significantly. deliberately misleading. That's mean. abusing word export mean something doesn't.

You're also ignoring point components, focusing finishing process only, also misleading. also ignore nearly early UK vaccine Pfizer, due factories exports/imports ordered earlier. Also misleading focus argument AZ also delivered source spent claim. UK almost much entire EU. Per person, 6-7 times more. US, even more.

To pay little (and later date matters much) risky strategy, one pay off. UK ordered 5x needed, EU 1-2x cheaper sources. People group 6 precisely group 6 clinically vulnerable, meaning natural immune response affected one way other. expect immune overreaction cases concern among them. younger people got vaccine UK healthcare workers, mainly received Pfizer. yet country trying peddle AZ like help things say right Especially group refuses many people already caught covid risky behavior. keep getting reinfected. Still pretty sure single shot still protect enough, least prevent lot disease ie. spreading got sick. still good go. 

Some normal flu vaccines 50%, probably already that.

That combined everyone else getting vaccinated i'm sure single shot going count vaccinated. That's funny, majority scientific studies read topic (I read least 30 different parts world) showed efficacy lockdowns masking reducing infections deaths. effective masking, social distancing, reduction travel, still effective. way part ""layered"" approach combating spread, approach may effective combined measured effective. 

The studies stated NMIs ineffective also admitted text conclusions likely baised based type study did/data had, really seen good study agrees statement. show study/data says otherwise?

Next, well documented Texas (and Florida) deliberately under-reporting cases deaths. know firsthand part data collection effort (/r/covidmapping) tracked available infection/spread data January 2020 throughout pandemic, covered Texas (my home) well states, seeing trends happening real time. pulled data directly heath departments, data reported state match cities/counties.
 many articles studies proving manipulation numbers showing true impact state still determined. found article (not sure I'm allowed post links I'd including reports articles I'm referencing).

""The Region 7 office Texas Department State Health Services, oversees large swath Central Texas, advised area county officials last week underreported number COVID-19 cases past several months.""

With things mind, think hard definitively state Texas Florida fine compared states. deliberately manipulating data support reopening reducing NMIs advice medical scientific professionals. drop measures, cases area spiked, supporting data preventative measures effective.  point like keeping medical information myself. 

And keeping yourself. pass display green pass red pass business scan/turn away.  Congress pass law giving power? Yes no. Yes could, won't.

I disagree legal standpoint. power force states create laws given federal government therefore reserved states.

Think like alcohol age limit. federal government force states individually adopt age 21 tying interstate funding. could something similarly here, state would create law individually. Well germany federation, states lot authority, US example    Brilliant üòÇ I'd sure I'd agree 'incredibly unusual', although make good point. advice experiencing side affect four (or so) days vaccine, go get checked. small peice HIPPA protected medical history non-medical organizations demand makes uncomfortable.

lol get wave law like magic totem. CLEAR health pass ""passports"" developed explicitly legal one provides proof vaccine status app linking mychart state vaccinations database. J&amp;J vaccines viral-vector novel well. mRNA JnJ vaccines work almost identical manners - difference delivery mechanism different.

The mRNA vaccines encode spike protein mRNA encase designer lipids. lipids designed sneak past cell membrane (also lipids) ""dissolve"" cell, leaving mRNA directly taken ribosomes start producing spike protein. 

The viral vector vaccines use adenovirus enter cell injects genetic material cell. There's hand-waving ultimately genetic material gets converted mRNA picked ribosomes produce spike protein. 

The genetic coding spike protein effectively identical two mRNA vaccines JnJ vaccine (with slight differences non-coding ""caps"" mRNA). AZ vaccine similar except use stabilized spike protein. 

Truly traditional vaccines like Novavax vaccine. Novavax vaccine essentially bunch spike proteins (no genetic material, spike protein) gets injected body. cells make protein - already vaccine. 

Even Novavax modern form ""traditional"" vaccines. Traditional vaccines much complicated used either weakend viruses (which leads question.. weakend enough? even compromised immune systems?) dead vaccines (which leads question.. create strong enough immune response? sheer number proteins dead virus make immune system target wrong one? even worse, one trigger auto-immune issue?). 

It's ironic mRNA vaccines safe *because* work. cleaner, effective, inherently safer vaccine delivery method created. Viral vector based vaccines (e.g. J&amp;J, AZ) mRNA vaccines complicated delivery mechanisms. Oh okay, thanks spelling correction. HIPAA. Baltimore least, different groups assigned different brands. waiting 15 minutes first shot, overheard nurses saying Baltimore residents getting Moderna, employees university getting Pfizer, students getting Moderna. coincided got I‚Äôm inclined believe it, obviously take internet stranger says grain salt. Florida open of....the warm weather. Oh boy. CDC Biden tell warm states open up? asking Florida shutdown mandate masks again? EU bought vaccines produced UK. getting exported tho, wonder why. say that? Polling 2019 (before vaccine) Democrats 13 points likely think vaccinating children important (92) Republicans (79). evidence ever bigger problem Left Right? discussions wait see crowd seems amorphous. dine really know waiting ‚Äúsee‚Äù. can‚Äôt get many straight answers. ambiguous ‚Äúrushed, EUA, long term side effects‚Äù. seems like dualing perspectives friends family bobbing around middle. Isn¬¥t general rule absolutely every injection, supposed go blood vessel? year yes.no.yes.no, yes. talked vaccines half year arm even received it. now, talk highly effective, causing deadly side effects (astrazenca) sparse expensive rivaled is. companies producing fluid constantly telling countries (paying customers) deliver promised amount, hey, new companies not-approved vaccines countries order millions again. so, main concern studies companies selling fluid reliable. cant give 10 people vaccine 8 never contact infected person claim 90% effective. already enter college, send kids school, travel many countries. doesn‚Äôt involve HIPAA all!!! 

Again...HIPAA!!!!! one P!! I'm sure will, they're small portion posts made subreddit, delayed effects presumably likely post subreddit conventional side effects. 

You could search Reddit posts relating anything, says nothing prevalence among general population. Ohh, that‚Äôs easy explain why.

Most AZ doses given elderly. soon average age drops, incidence clinical events also drops. Except case, raises.

But go ahead, ignore signals. enough people invested so... aren't. You‚Äôve never outside states you? feel bit dystopian add figure article give people context point. Thank Aha, like Texas deliberately chooses school shootings kill students. Got it! say 'impacted' HIPPA. point like keeping medical information myself. general cultural belief medical info private level control passed around, used stored. Giving random airlines, restaurants (although doubt would actually happen), etc makes uncomfortable. Related covid facts per JHU recorded data;

Texas' 14 day moving average daily covid-19 cases peaked January 17th 22,802 cases per day. currently sits 3,893/day.

Texas' 14 day moving average daily covid-19 deaths peaked 354/day Jan 30. currently sits 115/day. 

Reporting irregularities prevent reliable single day peak numbers deaths cases. past year Mondays Tuesdays pretty much states' numbers reliably half rest week. Charts looked like saw blades. I'd also wager person also disabled child depends face-to-face schooling essential services. general, arguing continuous lockdown insulated many effects rest us feel. Well supposedly J&amp;J also going start delivering huge batches... supposedly. They‚Äôve already missed first mark Denmark Norway. actually asking mom, India AZ indigenous one cases yet 60 million people vaccinated far including parents got AZ vaccine. spikes follow months behind European waves. Like clockwork. pay attention Europe. it‚Äôs good. point potential loss life becomes acceptable you¬¥re throwing away happy life years 99% Sure - another refitting redditor posted sub last week it. 

Probably cleanest way verify death numbers fudged look total excess deaths - year year vs. COVID deaths can't (easily) hide dead bodies, even accurately classified.

The NY Times solid data topic another article at: Florida shows 35,000 excess deaths vs. 30,000 reported COVID-19 deaths. roughly line national data (556k vs. 484k), I'm sure much death hiding states (ahem - Kentucky, Oklahoma, California, WV - showing least 30-50% fewer COVID deaths total increased year year deaths). point, starting wonder issue UK's monitoring / statistics collection... Yes know, it‚Äôs alluded honest trust MHRA much random Redditor comes make statistical inferences population incidences disease. even doubting could issue, pointing bare facts really hasn‚Äôt issue UK would expect [around 50 cases per 

In Germany. extremely rare syndrome doubt connected vaccine. scheduled doses friend first day phase 3 opens state! exciting!! need 100% people get vaccine. even need 90%. would we? Unless first virus provide immunity infection, know isn't, hundred million Americans already least partial immunity. one critical components vaccine one 4 sites, 2 EU 2 US. good build global capacity.

Components fine, key stuff comes uk Pfizer too. looks like want finished vaccines going EU UK, like eu moves j&amp;j fill finish plants. Women usually higher risk blood clots due birth control.  Possible, none large scale test like AZ has, cannot discarded. stand corrected then. what's endgame? Let's say child vaccination trials favorable results. let's say good messaging campaign manages get 70-80% country vaccinated (there always non-participants; is). Finally, let's imagine scenario active cases get 10K range minimal hospitalization virtually deaths.

**Nothing stated implausible, btw.**

Back perspective... really saying possible (but yet unseen) evasive strain thoroughly defeats existing immunity see hospitalization/death scale Spring 2020? based speculation, *we need close perpetuity*? seems really, really foolish. 

Unless, course, one accelerationist agenda focused system collapse workers seize means production collectivist utopia follows (because that's realistic happened repeatedly systems collapse). Also, Moderna Pfizer shown recipe year ago still works well mutations ofter year full-on pandemic. thankfully, politics set dangerous precedent. It‚Äôs quite disincentive companies follow footsteps manufacture cost follow high ethical criteria (in case set Oxford). 

Something PR win bit poisoned chalice I‚Äôd argue (sadly), trickle effect future vaccine development worries me. Using analogy Christmas July specifically designed get aid people need yes, case schools risk low need high ring bells open schools 3 feet numbers there, distinctively so.

You either look don‚Äôt.

See Dr. Walensky's point even though vaccine's highly effective, less 1 6 Americans completed regimine, currently enough stop another surge people abandon precautions. true odds blood clots insanely low comparison. It‚Äôs nowhere near 1%. feel like need ""I'm Vaccinated"" flair sub way r/politics ""I voted"" flair. take-over cult here. Report send message see anything suspicious. Also, voting good quality posts comments counteract alleged brigading. Two things true once: vaccines miracle quite possibly effective ones mankind ever developed, cases spiking parts country along hospitalizations. Neither things contradictory Yeah particular strain going Africa (possible?) new strain that‚Äôs going Brazil killing younger people expected. Good question - want know long need keep slighly concerned for! still managed kill""

deliberate policy choices led large numbers avoidable deaths - else would phrase it? Airborne virus difficult evade specially close contact, literally one becomes Sort ticking biological factory. assume they've got doses way week two, plan make sense all... Agreed good point childish rhetoric, used kind rhetoric anything else would called crazy UK vaccinated millions people 50. We've vaccinated 15% people 16-49, since clinical vulnerabilities. largely part cohort healthcare providers high risk exposure comparable permanent damage thrombosis death.  takers we'll starting hearing excess supply vaccines? I'm guessing late May/early-June hear stock sitting shelves, people stopped booking appointments.

It's going take stronger PR push get vaccine hesitant folks get poke, get done. 'go ahead everything like', happens, open door exactly said. stupid want begin without acknowleding consequences, idea giving businesses ability check medical information providing service.

And thank speaking behalf, woman state abortion hotly contested issue friends drive state get one done. know me, expect to, women totally fine life COVID passports means pressuring vaccine skeptical people one. Again, consequences conceived head. since taken obvious contempt examples completely missed point large swath pro-choice, anti-voter ID people get irony, idk discussion nitpicking small choice words end. confirm, family Pfizer vaccinations. fucking retarted? yeah, but, would see x amount people wasnt infected vaccine? challenge them, area high infection rates, unvaccinated vaccinated people work together day day? 

i questioning anyone could say ""this guy infected shot"" guy exposed virus time. would infected without vaccine? no. never challenged/exposed. think big chain businesses dependent in-person operations (restaurants, bars, movie theaters, arcades, bowling alleys, theme parks, even hotels airlines, etc.) seriously consider offering COVID vaccine incentives, discounts, deals, etc.

A lot people don‚Äôt want get vaccinated don‚Äôt care get others sick also usually people don‚Äôt want stay home, wear mask, social distance, etc. Many still want go fun. offering even $1 discount types places would add quickly someone wants time, could powerful motivator someone vaccinated. didn‚Äôt publish cost benefit analysis. Got it. determined population level normal. think MHRA would flag significant risk/deviation normal - well regarded regulator worldwide. reports serious CVST issues flagged Germany etc significantly higher baseline expected values. What's current uptake?  Yeah there‚Äôs also risk long Covid, estimated around 1-5%. According Moderna‚Äôs business dedicated mRNA. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre great, would make sense people think Pfizer superior. said, anecdotally I‚Äôm hearing Pfizer less side effects (and dose smaller). Please civil respectful. Insulting users, encouraging harm, racism, low effort toxicity allowed comments posts. Yes...good point. infectious disease experts believe highly effective vaccine help lower risk spread COVID-19 you‚Äôre immunized, they‚Äôre still trying determine impact looks like case numbers. Concrete data hasn‚Äôt released yet whether vaccines offer what‚Äôs known sterilizing immunity, means vaccinated can‚Äôt contract pass virus all.

‚ÄúWe expect level risk transmissibility greatly diminished, eliminated,‚Äù says Stanley H. Weiss, M.D., epidemiologist professor Rutgers New Jersey Medical School Department Biostatistics &amp; Epidemiology Rutgers School Public regards still able spread virus vaccine.

Also yes I'm worried opened everything fast going create variants vaccine less effective against. Please civil respectful. Insulting users, encouraging harm, racism, low effort toxicity allowed comments posts. Oh mRNA faster? I‚Äôve trying find chart compares time luck far. Yeah, there's obviously plenty story. Probably mix eu wanting made 100% there, novavax wanting caught az style shitstorm. think one factor you‚Äôre ignoring/negating reliance public transportation. People cities like Manhattan spend upto 45 minutes longer sometimes commute way work. 

45 minutes way per day closed ‚Äúbox‚Äù would affect spread way driving work matter far distance would. 

It‚Äôs population density thing, even transportation density needs looked at. Typhoid Patriots ""When asked Bash whether thought public health experts scientists would get last word efficacy vaccine, Harris predicted not.
""If past prologue not, they'll muzzled, they'll suppressed, sidelined,"" Harris said. ""Because he's looking election coming less 60 days he's grasping get whatever pretend leader issue not.""


Ringing endorsement! Trump evil omnipotent science go dark never know vaccine safe!  That's explanation they're giving EU, yes. Meanwhile they're signing contracts everyone else. math way off. new hospitalizations cases come 18-40 vaccinated yet. benefit people vaccinated. Vaccines available while, point open all. care who's getting vaccinated. want needles arms. stop horseshit article?

Back winter high 25 new hospitalizations day.....in entire state...well oh God entire system going come crashing down! Depends live guess. state still trending down. think, done, work mental health need begin earnest. Since seem NYC, imagine seen experienced. side effects 1st shot next way ever covid. post-viral reaction virus (heart issues possibly another coronavirus) knows. tend get weird inflammatory responses. friend friend tested positive COVID-19. decided daily Vlog experience. Relatively healthy Caucasian male, 40-ish, storm chaser secluding hotel Plus, deaths lagging indicator. Cases rise, weeks month later, deaths rise. People don‚Äôt drop dead instant show symptoms become case, hospital quite time pass. would surprised get vaccine 3 weeks. PA hella slow groups going through.. 65+ comorbidities right now. would actually argue can‚Äôt explain well, may possess encyclopedic knowledge lack deep understanding subject. fine we've vaccinated 75% 75 older population state, somewhere around 55% folks 60 least one dose. Since populations (my math may off) roughly 80+% hospitalizations/deaths occur, assume case fatality rate case hospitalization rate going plummet... right? 70-80% population vaccinated really would like 'the bad flu' idiots claiming along first confirmed Covid case US, going us... Experts also predicted last winter would brutal flu season overwhelming health services already stretched covid. truth nobody knows.

The suggestion year without flu mean comes back harder strikes weak one. around 10% people catch flu year; one year without tiny bit herd immunity going make big difference.

But importantly, nobody idea flu variants need vaccinated next winter. There's data make decision on, takes 6 months produce vaccine particular variant. Next flu season's vaccine shot dark they've picked right one. even manufacturing there's far pressing virus dealt with? Got 2nd shot 1045, 2100 feeling little head hurt tiny bit. next morning, sore EVERYWHERE felt like sickness really starts. 1700 night fine, made dinner, moved life. advice PA: got mine (pre-existing condition) month ago scheduling Rite Aid's website 11:45 PM appointments become available next day. go far, every night happen.

Don't make claims prepared back up.

I'm waiting. Depends live also far you‚Äôre willing drive. rural areas lower demand might easier get appt Cool beans. Thanks filling in. mean spreading virus getting deathly ill insanely unlikely vaccinated. I'm worried right now. I'm worried much contagious variant like less 40% pop immune. likely group spread barely vaccinated Huh, TIL. said, Canada recorded cases rare blood clots far I'm aware, they've largely contained Europe. there's evidence plenty against.

But bigger reason people trouble distinguishing ""originated lab"" ""created lab"". first unlikely possible. latter scientifically disproven dangerous allegation. early 30s good health, thought would wait longer eligible get time get it, herd immunity would achieved. Holy hell man look mirror seeing cases rise type this.

Context matters looking numbers. I'm sorry unclear, re-reading comments definitely come across way.

Allow reiterate. 

Masks absolutely work. Experts 100% correct that, listened to. I'm antimasker, virus denier, horrible label super duper careful branded with.

I'm little miffed inconsistent people (mostly Fauci) been, see people would lose faith say they've demonstrably lied before. 

That's it. Sorry came across way. shit Well, it‚Äôs 5 days. Texas case trend line climbing drop deaths stopped plateau.

North Carolina cases remain flat, decrease stopped. Deaths trending up.

Not good, science predicted. Yep. Philly operates independently this. They're county state thing That‚Äôs awful, hope recover! covid? Debbie Downerville.   Well that's positive perspective!

Specifically, 60 million uk order. rest, probably export, still fill finished Germany.

This literally uk avoiding eu orders. Say smoke. Drive bit county surplus appointments. cutting line can't fill allotted slots. know Novavax high efficacy UK South Africa variants, right? trials Pfizer Moderna show much reduced effectiveness South Africa variant?

You also realise Novavax potentially huge production capacity since compete supplies raw ingredients mRNA vaccines, meaning produced without reducing other's production? many businesses implementing ‚ÄúExcelsior only‚Äù require tremendous capital - Excelsior‚Äôs platform may free hiring additional staff/security personnel + associated technologies seem quite steep; especially COVID-era margins/profitability god's work üòÇüòÇ‚ù§ No, can't keep blaming everything people. single country earth back normal. even ones went would liked, ones went extreme tyrannical measures. know critical Matrix-M adjuvant vaccine produced four places, right? 2 EU (Sweden Denmark) 2 US.

Only actual drug-substance (anti-gen component) fill finish happen UK. things company also multiple factories EU, US Canada. absolutely zero credibility though Right, dominant strain B117, doesn‚Äôt affect vaccine effectiveness all. Unless B.1.351 and/or P1 lineages become dominant among variants, every indication vaccinate ourself problem. Even then, US vaccines shown prevent severe disease circulating variants. It‚Äôll ok, even things get bad while. every time say, little longer, people decide means it‚Äôs right start breaking rules, adds little longer onto wait cycle keeps repeating. Dr. Fauci set arbitrary number fun it

You sure? lot. Blah blah blah Wuhan lab, blah blah blah, eating bat pangolin blah blah blah together blah blah blah noted begun experiencing ‚Äúrecurring‚Äù feeling ‚Äúimpending doom.‚Äù

50 mg day Zoloft help that, Director. We‚Äôre fine.  Greece UK variant counts 97%. Given enough time takes wherever  Lmaooo  Ehhh, Cali pretty bad regarding spread. Man got done reading Facebook comment sections beyond disappointed general American view covid vaccines. spouting takes, literally every comment uses exact arguments number ""99.9% survival"" ""this vaccine gene therapy"". amount disinformation ridiculous Working home amazing. get done. deal drama. pretend internet connection bad log Zoom. see downside interacting coworkers person daily basis. Everyone phones anyway real world, really much different. üòÄ year people saying ""Just little longer"", every time someone sees light end tunnel, build onto it. course people done waiting.  There‚Äôs mod takeover. I‚Äôll probably banned mentioning /r/SubredditDrama info. administer vaccines keep accurate records slowing us down?

During fall &amp; winter season Trump president, perhaps? unfathomable idea you? like unable think outside box.

Should truck driver waited every stop, get written authority delivered packages? batches expire, many chains authorization need go fixed edited? Wheres power tripping mod Oh, listen CDC. got second shot today. Wife got first. mom got second 4 days ago. Feels good Hospitalizations rising places substantial new cases. know whether deaths follow, little bit regardless. definitely good news places.

This USA's next wave though; far geographically varied. Much country still severe decline. really feels like targeted vaccinations cities seeing surges could help. I‚Äôm sure mean. article discusses. Yeah, sorry, one going listen plea. Within last year seen stories people crying losing loved one please learn sadly one learn. How‚Äôs different? demonstrate claim. read studies linked would see mentioned much. Please homework come back solid response. Maybe I'm wrong know extent vaccines mitigate severe disease hospitalization. even interpret quote spoon-fed correctly. 42 cases Covid-19 graded mild (15 vaccine recipients 17 placebo recipients) moderate (4 vaccine recipients 6 placebo recipients); cases severe disease hospitalization either group.

There severe cases placebo group either. mean placebos effective reducing severe cases hospitalizations? could get mono. Fla. ‚Äî spreading across Florida two months, variant B.1.1.7 -- originally found United Kingdom -- become dominant 50-60 percent isolates tested variant. come contact person who's got this, 50% likely infected. also probably maybe 30 40% lethal,"" said Dr. Tom Unnasch USF Public Health.

 ‚Ä¶ Mao seemed able abolish landlords without factoring ""MuH TiEd VaLuE""... Gee, would could, almost parasitic landlords raised property values unaffordable. Repairs shit would cheaper rent could get foot door. think cases go rate last couple days April 12th they'll start going again. Whether define wave small splash you. call wave. third time seeing comment (so far), appears copy &amp; paste time. People replied copy &amp; paste comment; one asked whether aunt uncle part trial early recieved vaccine (noting could recieved placebo). Another explained could still gotten sick, explained extremely rare. far responded anyone's comments. curious seeing replies? ‚Äúvaccines reduced risk infection 80 percent one shot. Protection increased 90 percent following second dose.‚Äù

Why isn‚Äôt US delaying folks second shots vaccinate people first dose quicker? would save lives return us normal sooner. agree. disheartening seeing people absoluely fail fellow humans, never view humanity way again. talking friend day feel happy able look mirror day knowing I've made sacrifices required time betterment world. I've done part: wore mask, stayed home much possible, socially distanced. minor sacrifices me, stop think fucking freedom infringed upon. took global challenge confronted team heroes (like Avengers!). thought sacrifices grandparents made realized easy comparison. Life go new COVID world, trust people shattered. turned older too. 

I go starting thursday!!!! received first Moderna shot (yay!) Saturday afternoon. Snagged bubble tea way home celebrate. hours later felt kind spacey little it. rested eyes porch swing. 

Few hours later arm started get sore. watched old movies night. Felt heavy lazy like didn‚Äôt really want move much. Couldn‚Äôt sleep though reason. Tired hell next day arm way sore, like hit bat. Felt little emotional weepy; exhausted body felt heavy tired, plus painful move arm. little bit hot/cold times, never took temp. 

Slept bunch Sunday night today I‚Äôm feeling much better, I‚Äôd say 90% back normal. 31 y/o (to knowledge) never covid Except landlords buying raising property values! country California larger population ten states. got first shot last week. whole process completely smooth. read article, refer report

 far, studies suggest vaccines currently use recognize emerging variants ‚Äî don‚Äôt provide much protection new strains. variant South Africa, example, reduced Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs antibody protection two-thirds, according February study. Moderna‚Äôs neutralizing antibodies dropped six-fold South Africa variant. Cry river. tried become part ruling class backfired. Isn‚Äôt blanket ban US exports covid vaccines? Vaccine distribution still going slow. I‚Äôm probably going go get shot several months bc this. Judging username, think I'll roll dice advice scientists instead. really add up. assume US vaccinate 220 million (current rate) 270 million (4 million per day) doses 6 weeks level Israel 1,5 months ago.

At moment Israel around 150,000 175,000 cases relative US. consider Israel dropping cases since month already dropping ever since. point Israel started declining (18th January) cases, vaccinated amount US 20 days ago.

But contrary Israel, US decline cases flatlined since US reached level vaccinations Israel started significantly dropping cases. worse thing US showing clear upward trend past weeks.

Why difference, might? Well, Israel extremely strict lockdown started letting go first restrictions 2 weeks vaccinated rate US currently vaccinated. slowly let go restrictions even now, quite strict rules people vaccinated recently tested. Compare US state also consider Israel heavily influenced variants concern time US currently is, start understand huge difference (also speed Israel vaccinated far greater US doing). tech use make it? Even amazingly, rate decline still accelerating.  today surely 0.55. technically statement false! Glad hear that. I‚Äôm getting J&amp;J Thursday. like one done option. grateful I‚Äôve able dodge bullet last year. well everyone! vaccinated mean go start living like normal. 

Yes can. Sorry makes upset. Actually, I‚Äôm sorry. Suck it. Clearly recent surge cases shows immunity American population still high enough open completely. get people disappointed - CDC Biden say? US see better times within weeks, covid still huge concern. Ministry Health announced daily coronavirus table 29 March 2021. According last 24 hours, 154 people lost lives Turkey, 32 thousand 404 new cases detected.  

According data Ministry Health, total loss life 31 thousand 230; total number cases increased 3 million 240 thousand 577. 

According Ministry Health data, balance sheet last 24 hours follows: ‚ñ∫225 thousand 511 tests carried out, ‚ñ∫32 thousand 404 people added total number cases, ‚ñ∫1325 people added total number patients, ‚ñ∫154 people lost lives, ‚ñ∫18 thousand 15 people recovered. weekly data follows: ‚ñ∫The rate pneumonia patients 3.6 percent ‚ñ∫ Bed occupancy rate 54.2 percent ‚ñ∫The adult intensive care occupancy rate 63.2 percent ‚ñ∫ Ventilator occupancy rate 27.1 percent Average contact detection time 9 hours ‚ñ∫Filming rate 99.9 percent Like already didn‚Äôt know that. asked 10-year-old far apart desks class. said two desks pushed together next two desks feet away. teacher plastic sheeting one side desk, told kids go side desk talk. teacher already Covid. said kids aren‚Äôt separated lunch, kinda odd since grade lunch different time plenty tables don‚Äôt get used all. recess, allowed play kids class. said many kids, especially kindergartners first graders, pull mask sneeze wear wrong. son doesn‚Äôt mind mask all. 

There approximately 8,000 students corporation 8 elementary schools, 2 middle, one high school. went back August 2 days week. late September, started 4 days week Wednesday distance learning. mid-October, went full distance learning multiple weeks 900 students week quarantine. Christmas break, elementary went back 4 days week. Middle high 2 days. schools back 4 days. We‚Äôve holding steady 100 students week asked quarantine. whole lot since that‚Äôs throughout schools. student tests positive elementary, students nearby desks quarantine. makes sense considering crammed together lunch cramming together playground equipment recess. sons teacher tested positive, none students quarantine. far, students son‚Äôs class caught it.

Nothing makes sense. son allergies, sniffles sneezing, school makes keep home 2 weeks test test. teacher, close every single student tested positive, nobody stay home. school says they‚Äôre everything keep kids safe, son tells different. Despite that, I‚Äôm honestly worried. brother closed business 3 months, went store like week, still managed catch it. Yet sick bed days, one taking care him, taking temp, bringing food never got it. It‚Äôs damn unpredictable. I‚Äôm stay home mom could easily full distance learning son. wanted go back I‚Äôm kinda keeping fingers crossed doesn‚Äôt get sick. Education certainly help engagement compliance. would lot easier accept certain rules populace understands concept behind implemented, doesn‚Äôt need take experts' word face value.

I fortunate live country education seems work, everyone actually knows shit viruses. little resistance (if all) government actions, already acting even stricter government mandates first place. sheer number people protesting covid restrictions eyes failure education, something first world countries excuse lacking. vaccinated mean go start living like normal. mutations new strains. number IDIOTS still refusing get vaccine, entirely possible could see another surge.

What need enforce mandatory vaccinations EVERY person. Every 4 months every person given vaccine updated latest strains. get vaccine? allowed travel, allowed inside business, allowed purchase food/water. way idiots get thick skulls. take vaccine, die one way another. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

We don‚Äôt even need money we‚Äôre living rent-free heads pathologically obsessed inexplicably angry Europeans. 

And yeah I‚Äôve country. I‚Äôve Europe too. What‚Äôs you? Planning trip? I'm reading everything correctly, seems case vaccines varying efficacy among variants. 

Yes, study ability vaccines prevent mild moderate covid. said vaccines prevent hospitalisation death due covid 42 cases Covid-19 graded mild (15 vaccine recipients 17 placebo recipients) moderate (4 vaccine recipients 6 placebo recipients); **there cases severe disease hospitalization either group.**

and cases hospitalization severe Covid-19 observed study.

Who cares people get sick. important thing preventing SEVERE illness DEATH. Literally shits happening year ago, cases drop bit normies think ok go back normal. National emergency half million dead hello where's patriotism. Yeah California definitely compliant masks AZ  lold read use, ton - bought $15 per dose. government already paid funding first COVID relief bill, sites asking bring insurance information get shot, free everybody whether insurance not. primary thinks too. Funny back afraid say anything ‚Äúsome kind virus!‚Äù  release control slowly possible. CDC apparently gets complete control areas government. government able except power us citizens.

That said; change start people government. strong sentiment government overreach; start lose control people‚Äôs actions. Disagree, least short run. think businesses depend gathering large crowds--bars, restaurants, movie theatres, etc.--will use passport technology selling point lure people back might hesitant. 

For instance, I'm haircutter many clients currently fearful visiting shop. could guarantee everyone (both employees customers) fully vaxxed, think would game-changer terms making feel comfortable. spike protein virus certain shape fuses target cell.

Pre-fusion spike stabilization modifying spike protein structure produce vaccine hold pre-fusion shape.

Doing allows body produce antibodies able target spike proteins live virus pre-fused state, targetting virus able bind target cell.

Source: owe America 100k+ doses

100m, right? Novavax best results phase 1 (antibody counts, cells good too), best results phase 3 versus ClassicStrain/B.1 (96%). best safety profile (okay there's high variation here, side effects lower since using cells generate protein). cheap make easy store (they claim). uses prefusion-stabilized spike form, also used Moderna, BNT/Pfizer, Janssen/J&amp;J believed substantially better unstabilized.

But also use cells generate protein, that's entire class cells could missing. concerned *low* efficacy B.1.351: ~50% South African population, lower J&amp;J despite Novavax far effective classic strain. trials directly compare, difference dropoff quite stark.

This vaccine uses entirely different method generating antibodies mRNA vector vaccines. yet proven cross-react well, probably get data time. variants blocked vaccines. Next story.  Fuck eh. cdc director, clearly doesnt know shit. Instead im placing faith fkmyfacecunt clearly youre expert extensive expertise world class data disposal. fairness. said 3ft fine back Jan. 2020. doubled it. Objectively safer distance like 30ft. can't run society way, 6ft settled on. Aww, sure dude. think life quality money.

You answer me, ever traveled parts US posted link about?

Or feel comfortable mother's basement? Stupid. Still pretty low. states closed non-essential services that's it. People still party that. 5 cities real lockdown (UK model).

Araraquara, one first cities Manaus outbreak, real lockdown 10 days. result 60% cases reduction, 40% death reduction. map onto anything scenario. ground? falling speed? political. Nothing else.

The leaders EU countries tracking behind optically looks bad them, particularly brexit especially cases rising again.

If create narrative somebody else's fault leaders affected less politically.

The reality months difference grand scheme things big deal.

One thing I've learnt life narrative important reality.... Unfortunately. give super straight answer. 
1. Florida behavior California. Average Joe California Central Valley worse COVID behavior someone Miami

2. control comparison region complete compliance locked another one none. Let‚Äôs compare San Francisco South Dakota. former long strict lockdown, latter nothing. South Dakota 5 times many deaths SF, despite rural state 

3. states similar. don‚Äôt know counter factual. example, CA especially vulnerable large agricultural population, large Hispanic population living congregate housing large families. counter factual happen CA South Dakota type approach. know answer. DISASTER

Hope helps. Data stats tough interpret 76% efficacy 1 dose still really good vaccine. also proven reduce spread incidences severe cases hospitalisations, well cheapest produce easiest store  Probably not. short term. mean, Bolsonaro voted in. really serious problem poverty, violence crazy corruption. Call Elizabeth Holmes. weird kind announcements come Pfizer/ Moderna doses available. Oh throngs drunken spring break revellers prancing streets global pandemic thing still afoot bad idea? Jaysus, Mary &amp; Joseph give wee moment find surprised face impending doom? jackasses taken sub care another 100,000 human souls lost. them, another night drinking friends. Lol bet midtown Manhattan panhandler makes money you. think anywhere near revolutionary mRNA. There's already flu shot called Flublok that's influenza proteins made insect cells--I actually got flu shot last year. Better uninsured, unemployed, homeless living police state. Yes, Novavax likely get approved US usage, FDA want consider UK data, could [""the second half simple: mRNA vaccines use adenovirus vector. 

Instead use new technology, messenger RNA (mRNA). akin putting weakened inactivated germ bodies teaches cells make protein‚Äîor even piece protein‚Äîthat triggers immune response inside bodies. immune response, produces antibodies, protects us getting infected real virus enters Yeah expected nothing second shot, prepared, actually knocked ass, I'm fully back 72 hours later. Hard blame wanting stay away EU behaved past months. like whole country shut down. Look city/region individually see people taken hit repeatedly. Brisbane's second snap lockdown, suck them. like they've lockdown year. fair thay don't. think that's stupid, support general idea. We‚Äôre lot white people Tuskegee experiments? awful lot white folk getting exact shots offered black folks. Yeah ok, I‚Äôll hospital using bandana PPE need me... CDC said acceptable too... FFS vaccine work bunch people die get sick get shots (or get shot). worse virus spreads faster intermediate time. Stop acting like binary thing. complicated understand. 17-19 million. 11% increase nationwide cases week better circumstances. scientist yourself? got vaccine, care? Scientists tend want wait peer reviewed reports fine. require Moderna(in OWS) regularly test asymptomatic cases trial. even quick trial back January.

Like would think knowing transmit virus would one biggest factors first giving limited vaccines. serious comment checkout challenges federal court. Several judges ruled this.

If troll comment, impressed number comments got. ""They need dump COVID testing. shame keep COVID testing got kids test positive something get play Final Four? need forget COVID tests get four teams playing Final Four go battle out."" 

Wouldn't shame one kid's teammates opponents covid, gave kid, child permanent lung impairment? **your** child covid screws lives kids? 


What unbelievably selfish train thought. don‚Äôt really care teachers unions think. 

I won‚Äôt take medical advice teachers unions. 

If virology experts say 3-feet fine, inclined believe them. like seeing coworkers every day. commute 15 minute come home lunch even take shit home base. I‚Äôm grateful can‚Äôt work home  Yes, quite good news natural disasters live?

Just last week massive flooding near house (Sydney), friends stay us four nights go visit parents, go beyond basic neighbourhood, get work etc due road closures. strange week, mean live normal life. one week!

Same Covid. week lockdown actually less intrusive flood. still go work, visit vulnerable, exercise outdoors, on. working kids still go school, keep home start term break 2 days early. start wear masks. week later life continues. health conditions

But list health conditions keeps changing Vaccine Question:

Okay, getting vaccine Wednesday, tomorrow. go roommates tonight outdoor dining (while trying safe possible) caught covid, would prevent getting vaccine? like get vaccine covid? Could go roommates night vaccinated? also tested J&amp;J vaccine Trump left office. also review workplace safety. what, exactly, point? trying contend vaccines bad? also said covid airborne(which per NZ contact tracing efforts) say 3ft vs 6ft fine schools. really schools can't fit everyone classroom rule 3 feet. 

The messaging place. leading lagging indicators.  - worry variants coming medical community alarmed many acting like pandemic tired it. average casss across world again. people cases = chance future variant get around vaccines. It‚Äôs simple that. sounding alarm variants also pro-vaccine.  zero scientific evidence base snow birds coming back Florida people traveling lot spring break/etc. least what's happening area Michigan. Plus, still cold people getting together indoor dining (which opened 50% nobody adhering to) sports watching(highschool, professional college). spreading lot highschools here. face bad too.  Imagine could achieve criminal sanctions. really matter. Entirely 1 shot vs 2 shots IMO.

I'm scheduled Moderna, wish J&amp;J would've one less trip Kroger. meanwhile philippines, govt authorized private companies buy vaccines. comment aged poorly. Pfizer prevented hospitalizations trial. 30k people trial, plenty measure effectiveness. However; it‚Äôs possible millions getting shot still land hospital. long time. you‚Äôre able get country access dollars you‚Äôre good shape. regular system often runs short basics black market picks slack. Doctors unfortunately paid shit Israel 80% UK strain dominant right Biden's target nearly back normal July 4th looking realistic day Continue vaccinating push it, enough fear mongering headlines already. states open adults week, thats goal post.

Im sorry, healthcare professional CDC minimally helpful whole pandemic. Also probably 25% shots arms, that's necessarily 25% full immunity takes time mean...duh. Boston‚Äôs pretty young town terms demographic let‚Äôs say Boston wasn‚Äôt city question: 

Do want eliminate pop commute, shit bathroom, able work without underwear getting paid same? 

Outside kids, there‚Äôs almost downside work home 

(FWIW Childless WFH) guess healthcare tourism big future business Cuba. Yeah I'm expecting July we'll see mask mandate dropped. restrictions gone June. would say know people lie say vaccinated aren't. 

Seems like June people getting two shots + 2 weeks later would put end June. answer question need two reasons. 
1. protect legitimate medical read can‚Äôt vaccinated including young children currently vaccine authorized them. 
2. minimize community spread give fewer opportunities vaccine resistant strain develop. 

It likely could go away cases drop zero.

For thought hypocritical voter ID, would hypocritical voter ID free. Also since J&amp;J vaccine approved governments actively going homeless communities making sure chance vaccinated.

Read /r/OutOfTheLoop thread powermods Eh they‚Äôll extend two months I‚Äôm sure says? narrow, meaning keeps vaccinated person getting sick virus? I'm looking data show vaccinated also prevents *spreading* virus others, even asymptomatic. exist? would fully support military enforced lockdowns that‚Äôs takes make children behave. shame literally story repeat slowly spreading around world every new place thinks somehow magically skip :( money tied property able invested places.

Seasonality like biggest engine covid due people going indoors cold/hot weather outdoors spring/fall weather.

In retrospect probably given extra vaccine colder states target youth would spreading it. let normal allocation target vulnerable. Michigans wave think mainly due indoor youth sports spectators. 

Florida/Texas likely convince republicans get vaccinated. indoor months till like June/July/August. raw numbers. pretty much scare-mongering. It‚Äôs frustrating type over-the-top dramatics gives Covid-deniers fuel actual conspiracy theories. Reddit full cancel culture addicts. got Pfizer vaccine today. First shot. 

My arm hurts. terribly bad anything, I‚Äôd like take Advil. 

I remember seeing article awhile ago painkillers *might* reduce antibody response vaccine. case, won‚Äôt take Advil, it‚Äôs unbearable. Anyone know current thinking this? mom took shots horribly fever, chills, described feeling ""her skin peeling off"". mild sore arm times it. kinda luck hownu feel hell ya get ur donut! political increasing cases, hospitalizations, deaths? That‚Äôs exactly thinking. vaccine available entire population, would vaccine passports need thing? you‚Äôre concerned COVID want mitigate risk infected, get vaccine. Otherwise, don‚Äôt.

Whatever serious complication hasn‚Äôt yet heard best 1 several million odds else would heard it. may completely evade it, possible could situation new variant significantly reduces efficacy vaccines (which think likely one escapes alltogether). example, situation new highly infectious variant Modern / Pfizer ~30% efficacy (give take, idea hypothetical situation variant makes vaccines much less effective) , think would call booster shots takes hold. don‚Äôt know I‚Äôm math wrong isn‚Äôt 80%? .19 people 1000 1 dose tested positive, 1.38 1000 doses tested positive. Doesn‚Äôt mean .19/1.38=13.77% likely test positive one dose? Compared people 2 doses .04 1000, meaning .04/1.38=3% likely test positive? Meaning it‚Äôs 87% 97% effective one two doses respectively. wrong? don‚Äôt know news articles saying 80% 90% good tips also, plenty people little reaction vaccine! Take precautions safe, lots people sore arm nothing else. expecting commission 2nd shot really felt little tired sore muscles arm, within day totally normal. probably going happen since seem trying open everything rapid speed. People already give fuck. Chile used Chinese vaccine, correct? Dr. Fauci set arbitrary number fun it. I'm sure Americans going whatever want entire pandemic. fact states south Midwest sacrifice much anything outside minor inconveniences. 

For example, Tennessee Governor implement mask mandate safety regulations. Instead putting hard work difficult decisions corporations local governments. happened entire cluster fuck. schools opened full capacity shut multiple times switch hybrid mid way through. sports seasons constantly stopped players infected getting others sick. local economy also worse Food industry workers made significantly less money barely making ends meet before. Retail workers employed hours cut bits. economy worse people dead pandemic before.

I expect Americans wait till 85% herd immunity going achieve one way another. 70% herd immunity going constant opening closing schools, switches hybrid schooling, partial reopenings business prevents workers receiving level pay received pre-pandemic. create death, longterm headaches stress, hurt economy, well increasing likelihood variants. We'll figure 5 cases many doses given? Meh. least Pfizer Moderna it‚Äôs one vaccine applied twice. fancy separate second dose. Means long get company don‚Äôt need change logistics. try find article, something like 5-6 hospitalizations. There‚Äôs reason didn‚Äôt report raw number.  unbelievable one poorest countries world healthcare system matches cases outperform healthcare richest countries world. Broke: Requiring ID vote racist!

Woke: need require digitally cryptographic proof allow go grocery shopping here, nervous tho. don‚Äôt like getting sick plus it‚Äôs days AP exam People understandably hyping MRNA vaccines probably pre-fusion spike stabilization really coming clutch here. J&amp;J also spike well. Thank you! Little soreness injection site...and that‚Äôs it! That‚Äôs said, hear night/day second shot doozy, since already gave appointment date I‚Äôm gonna ask day off. 

At worst, feel crappy relax, best feel fine celebrate free free Krispy kreme donut. something lose brain? vaccine prevents transmission cdc knows too. I'm inconveniencing needlessly people like understand science. Sure way evaluating good bad

The Canadian authority said blood clot rate 10x AZ. also way verify claim true false.

So, I'm gonna trust authority. people pissed news cause supposed ""getting better"" ""rounding corner"" illness. reality, states stopped putting rules stop limit spread covid. amount spring breakers going partying entire month horrible clue american mindset currently. people also crying wealth inequality demanding small businesses shut everyone order Amazon *Word*  always idiots feel need beat chests one tell do.  That‚Äôs unfortunate. Hope eventually comes around realize schools open months now? Even Dr. Atlas? Early studies show asymptomatic protection 1 shot low 60s%; 90% 2 shots.

You know, governing principal behind health professions. never vaccine passports US, simply record keeping setup efficiently first place. There's central database everyone COVID vaccine CDC paper get vaccination site flimsy easy fake. Israel much better central database vaccinations, linked personal identity card. Let's abuse Occam's Razor here, dude. Extra steps make ""affront logic"". makes less likely cause.

I'm confused non-virologist strong opinion origin right now. usually takes years sort sort thing out. hear bad things covid... user dividing percentages infections respective groups, numbers account differently sized groups. numbers really suggest 99% reduction infections, beyond unbelievable. That‚Äôs first hours bam felt side effects coming on. lasted week. great question actually. Bye! missed. That's interesting thought. Presumably, course action could taken would kept deaths zero.

Suppose first time ever learned COVID-19 existed, completely closed nation. one allowed allowed leave. instituted military style lockdowns. military deliver rations full hazmat suits. Anyone outside homes immediately neutralized. Could kept coronavirus ever infecting single person inside borders USA?

I see not. course would require complete hindsight, total forfeiture personal liberties, utter destruction economy. would completely safe COVID.

You can't proper cost benefit analysis focus cost benefit. Ultimately, tradeoffs needed made. managed save million lives still live dystopia nightmare, shoot, I'll take it. China everything change facts....wuhan first report cases fact. Well, think see winter surge, but, something equivalent second wave? Sure, terms cases. worth noting dealing variant 50% transmissible. saying mean? feel points fairly clear, least reddit sub. I'll admit I'm spending much time proofreading. clarify anything you? U.S. could soon go way Europe, burgeoning resurgence coronavirus, states loosen restrictions contagious variants become increasingly prominent, nation‚Äôs top public health official warned.

U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said feeling ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù amid new wave infections even number Americans vaccinated continues rise. Scientists nationwide calling dangers loosening state measures like mask mandates capacity restrictions.

While U.S. races vaccinate population -- almost 29% received least one dose -- virus could still push ahead, experts said. time infects new person, possibility increases additional mutants could spread faster evade vaccines. Good boy! 90% cases UK variant. 1-2% cases SA variant. negligible amounts variants too. Sounds right.

For initial surge, absolutely hands deck, now? people refuse even wear masks grocery stores? Heck no. plotted data. Maybe age breakdown can't extrapolate 10 days worth data, seems like growth slowing much yet. rna vaccines slightly different. think matters one get. would suggest protection 1351 although really think enough cases tell sure states rushing reopen give enough vaccines make safe. one last surge could avoided.

I got sore sinus deep nostril swabbed. 

Thanks. Seek help. clinically insane aunt uncle got shots December. believe Pfizer shots. Now, really sick, one hopsital oxygen keeps going like 70%, oxygen. fully vaccinated got REALLY sick, one severe. common this? thought vaccine completely prevented serious illness, completely protecting infection.

EDIT: Washington state, sure variants circling around there.  Urging caution impending doom two different things though. Im urging caution. clearly different. midnight CVS releases appointment every day. Worst case I'd imagine people relatively close one walk sites. aunt uncle got shots December. believe Pfizer shots. Now, really sick, one hopsital oxygen keeps going like 70%, oxygen. fully vaccinated got REALLY sick, one severe. common this? thought vaccine completely prevented serious illness, completely protecting infection.

EDIT: Washington state, sure variants circling around there. really annoys people getting J&amp;J brag getting one done. Like no, one dose Pfizer/Moderna effective one dose J&amp;J (80% vs 66%), two doses significantly effective (95% vs 66%) study happened done using two doses opposed one... chances anti vac people plagiarizing cards selfish use?

Instead moving forward save American lives vaccine developed, busy undermining country stop ""steal"". I'm assuming selfish coward, that's all. Even mask-compliant corner country, lot folks clearly decided going let anything minor common sense get way.

IMO shots arms nice weather hope preventing one last surge. Still jerking Trump Train see.

EDIT: Washington state, sure variants circling around there. know followed one group Facebook complaining things closed. made chuckle dumb were. Fox started cover election told results. started complaining fit narrative wanted. conversation became could find worldview wanted. try find facts. Find ""news"" agree with. pretty fascinating. Former US Centers Disease Control Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta personal opinion virus released lab.
The report says ""extremely unlikely."" ""**There record viruses closely related SARS-CoV-2 laboratory December 2019, genomes combination could provide SARS-CoV-2 genome**,"" reads. ""In view above, laboratory origin pandemic considered extremely unlikely.""

Lol, what? reads like PR cleanse 2005, group including researchers Wuhan Institute Virology published research origin SARS coronavirus, finding China's horseshoe bats natural reservoirs SARS-like coronaviruses.[9] Continuing work period years, researchers institute sampled thousands horseshoe bats locations across China, isolating 300 bat coronavirus 2015, international team including two scientists institute published successful research whether bat coronavirus could made infect HeLa. team engineered hybrid virus, combining bat coronavirus SARS virus adapted grow mice mimic human disease. hybrid virus able infect human 2017, team institute announced coronaviruses found horseshoe bats cave Yunnan contain genetic pieces SARS virus, hypothesized direct progenitor human virus originated cave. team, spent five years sampling bats cave, noted presence village kilometer away, warned ""the risk spillover people emergence disease similar 2018, another paper team institute reported results serological study sample villagers residing near bat caves (near Xiyang Township Â§ïÈò≥‰π° Jinning District Yunnan).

Whatever say! Please civil respectful. Insulting users, encouraging harm, racism, low effort toxicity allowed comments posts. big deal =/= zero burden lmao.

Im current wearing glasses mask working out. genuinely big deal. Bananas moon, say?  Vaccines may give symptom immunity (which means get sick still carry disease infect others) sterilising immunity (where can't get infected all). yet know certain level sterilising immunity conferred vaccines since test first studies. Walensky warning us impending doom? There's optimism actual data evidence people whose job put context. CDC study came today vaccines prevent ninety percent symptomatic even asymptomatic infection, unbelievably fantastic news think lot us expecting, head organization decided important took time today tell us scared ""doom."" Think word. *doom.*

Is little confusing you? mixed messaging rub wrong way? personally I'm offended disregard potential American faith public health organizations. others current administration seem attitude say whatever want, wrong misleading however often want, rely others apologizing mental gymnastics them. one biggest reasons we're seeing less less people care every day. elected officials stretched faith thin we're seeing consequences. click provided links previously cancer, nothing definitive find. Nothing links says cancer past, COVID would worse you, yet CDC lists risk. Yes, transmissible variants ravage smaller amount available hosts, well, starting higher number cases cases increase.

Theres dumb dichotomy whereby people think urging caution must understand amazing effective vaccines are. moon them, can't believe quickly rolling out. see end point. year wait weeks approaching herd immunity, rather sacrifice tens thousands way. still removing shoes airport 20 years later. Forget media, people can't handle nuance. There's much binary thinking there. People say care science, retrospective evidence comes saying lockdowns masks largely useless, start making excuses like ""variants"" ""fake numbers"" ""incoming surge"" justify irrational fear. 

A civilised intelligent person would instead reflect accept wrong think affect future decisions, rather making random claims peddle status quo

I accept wrong bit. first couple months like many others considered anyone following assholes ruining everyone else, eventually went back realised silly line thought Let‚Äôs honest real reasons need wear masks social. It‚Äôs difficult distinguish vaccinated versus vaccinated comes enforcement. people vaccinated go around wearing masks, gives unvaccinated people coverage wear theirs. top that, doesn‚Äôt feel fair unvaccinated live rules others to, makes likely disregard masking rules. Finally, people want feel comfortable going public strangers, masks allow that.

Just honest people public health officials. People understand nuance. weird people get this. 

If 3 choices eating (all free mind you):
Dumpster 
Fast Food
Fine Dining 

Of course fast food rather eating trash, also surprised people would prefer fine dining. It‚Äôs even people always dramatic literally don‚Äôt want anyone eat read drink alcohol ever, way would live isolated plastic bubbles E nutrient paste never go anything remotely dangerous hey live 106 that‚Äôs matters news kind apocalyptic doom news well received. Thank posting this. Yeah well CoVID I‚Äôm pretty sure late 2018 around New Years. Spreading misinformation giving information they‚Äôve investigated further? Really? damned damned don‚Äôt. might issues filling spots due hesitancy. Especially people close age cut off. Chronological age body counts, cellular age different different people would skeptical. Wow, saw clip referring to. quite surprising badly people want us continue live fear hold 'just little longer'. Google it. I'm sure find something. UK*   see not. would leadership US possibly gain that. NZ eliminated virus fact quickly drop restrictions. masks, social distancing, capacity limits anywhere. virus comes back lockdown, within days, soon contained, restrictions dropped again.  

I see reason liberal democracies thing herd immunity reached. I‚Äôm planning going every sporting event concert get summer fall I‚Äôm gonna feel bad slightest UK variant isn‚Äôt raging UK? Confidently incorrect! good asking how. give pause believe make better inference data set expert. know enough know cases rise, states loosening restrictions, variants spreading alarming rates across globe. Variants seem vaccine-resistant, transmissible, cases lethal. expert would never make claim uptick cases translate another large surge. would take time seriously consider experts saying matter. Yeah, yet. 

We approaching fast think would give people resolve kick hard finish line. bullshit conspiracy theory doomerism. sun move noob earth
Checkmate fake study US: Haha vaccine machine go brrrrrr 


In seriousness, unlikely sort scenario come pass US. know, vaccines likely extremely effective P1 B.1427/B.1429. B1.351 even greater immune escape strains, measured neutralizing antibody binding. J&amp;J phase 3 trial, amounted symptomatic efficacy dropping 72% US 95%+ cases OG COVID, 64% SA 95%+ cases B.1.351.  


Given efficacy vaccines, US' current vaccination levels (\~25% adults least one-shot), level 'natural immunity' US (15-33% depending estimate look at), US' projections vaccinations next months, would-be next wave fighting uphill battle, hill gets steeper time goes on: already diminished portion population without immunity rapidly shrinking. CDC, vaccines hardly make difference

That false. said highly effective preventing infections prevent spreading others, small difference.  Well rna vaccine vector inactive virus vaccine.. old people kookier side US say quid. wasting time two doses? need math person slap leaders around facts. 80% single dose better suppressing virus 100% double dose. That‚Äôs mentioned people infection ratio. Since handful people got infected 2000 fully vaccinated, expectation masks aren‚Äôt worn may be, say, couple hundred infections per 2000? Sixfold reduction neutralizing antibody titer ***not*** mean six-fold reduction efficacy. There's cartoon post /r/france (the first guy saying, lowest point highest)[ ""plateau rising...it's control...Oh god! exponential curve!"" scientist says ""exponential curve...exponential curve...exponential Ya well there's proof stop spreading there's herd immunity. Baduk!? classic strategy game. NY NJ aren‚Äôt lockdown. Capacities aren‚Äôt 100%, that‚Äôs pretty much it. April. way enough people won‚Äôt vaccinated mid April R drop 1 something goes wrong vaccine manufacturing. 

That‚Äôs sort point we‚Äôre making. cannot scientifically become wave. Yet many people claiming it‚Äôs start new wave. 50 states means 50 different ways handling distribution - main downside country made bunch largely autonomous, often different, mini countries.

For longest time, lack doses holding things back, we're starting see results underlying distribution infrastructure, seeing states best might help drive best practices mass vaccination future. American, saw number thought ""wow that's pretty high.""

We partisan divide everything, people's views world oftentimes flip quickly election inauguration day. 

For perspective, 50% approval rating President US normally sign almost-guaranteed reelection 4 years later. typically need 44% approval rating lose, that's even given. group people cant agree completely anything. poll could kicking puppies getting 1000 dollars/ makes happier. 30% would choose kick puppies American, please try contradict people saying something NO? try state point, might convincing. Serious question, worried future planet decide bring children world? Pfizer/Biontech AZ two totally different vaccines. One mRNA based vector vaccine. nothing other. 

Several countries reported similar issues, like Norway, France Denmark instance. countries even stopped using AZ Germany did. 

Bad reporting issue either. already established rare blood clots (cerebral venous thrombosis) likely caused autoimmune reaction. It‚Äôs spectrum. Cost/benefit. cost wearing mask basically nothing. know lung ultrasound imaging thing, right? seems bit knee jerk reaction me. People careful short term, overall things going trend downward based data emerging moment. 

I think kind unmeasured reaction short term problems many think public health discourse largely hyperbolic.

Edit: although say it‚Äôs fucking dumb state removing mask mandates. going cause lot harm vaccines rolled out. wish till May 31st so!? *Dr. Osterholm enters chat* Exactly! ""Cultured"" Alina Chan's diagram ""originated lab"", possible. ""Genetic engineered"" ""created lab"", highly unlikely. fade quickly. can‚Äôt please everybody, vaccinate (if they‚Äôll let you) No, don‚Äôt vote political party, still think it‚Äôs valid point.

Teacher‚Äôs lives aren‚Äôt worth people‚Äôs lives.  Without lockdown, new variants R around 5, starting current levels community spread, there's doubt infections deaths would rise rapidly. indeed see happening America Europe they're encountering UK variant. indeed happened UK September.

Places like New Zealand could end lockdown able prevent disease getting grip. ship sailed UK. Pick whatever available.. don‚Äôt care ask u get there.. get appointment Tracing efforts? year in? isn‚Äôt 2020 President Biden top health officials Monday urged impatient public remain vigilant coronavirus, daily case counts continued rise, younger people replaced seniors U.S. hospitals, United States moved beyond milestone 30 million cases since outbreak Even nation‚Äôs immunization program continued pick speed new research showed coronavirus vaccines highly effective real-world conditions, Biden said states suspend reopening plans governors rescinded mask mandates reinstate ‚ÄúPlease, politics,‚Äù Biden said. ‚ÄúReinstate mandate let down, businesses require masks well. failure take virus seriously ‚Äî precisely got us mess first place ‚Äî risks cases deaths.‚Äù Troubling signals abounded Monday. Daily case counts continued trend wrong direction. seven-day rolling average infections, considered reliable measure daily case counts, rose seventh consecutive day, finishing 64,000, according reports state health departments analyzed Washington Post. ‚ÄúYounger people aren‚Äôt vaccinated,‚Äù said Tom Balcezak, chief medical officer Yale New Haven, 30 percent people covid-19 tested positive new variant originated United Kingdom. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre exposed, ‚Äî blasted, will,‚Äù result, need intensive care earlier parts pandemic. ‚ÄúLast week admitted intubated 21-year-old. That‚Äôs really unusual us,‚Äù ‚ÄúSpeed essence here,‚Äù Balcezak added. ‚ÄúAnything slows vaccine distribution going cause excess mortality.‚Äù 1. decades. months. 

2. concern mainly long-term effects kids. 

3. didn‚Äôt address point. Variants could theory wreck vaccine response. PA definitely seeing another wave, sucks.

we saw 5000 new cases first time long time. Wait kind need get common cold stay healthy? I'm already worried I'm going year sniffles. wish could agree see helps without social distancing/school closings/other behavior modifications. so, makes argument continued masking flu season quite bit stronger, I'm illusions ever getting strong enough data draw conclusions. I'll keep getting flu shots, keep minor behavior modifications flu season, keep wearing masks must go sick flu season (we actually already stash surgical masks pandemic hit bevause already occasional mask wearers kids came flu). Please stop spewing vapid talking point RWM meaningful argument getting vaccinated. Fair point particular article. guess you‚Äôre looking concrete evidence reinfections occurring, might worth checking case study published Lancet last October: Abstract: ‚ÄúThe patient two positive tests SARS-CoV-2, first April 18, 2020, second June 5, 2020, separated two negative tests done follow-up May, 2020. Genomic analysis SARS-CoV-2 showed genetically significant differences variant associated instance infection. second infection symptomatically severe first.‚Äù quote Drill Sargant Full Metal Jacket ""The war time get Private Pile"".  
By time thing gets approved problem getting appointment probably state. hope Canada enjoys leftovers. What? Pfizer AZ two completely different vaccines. Moderna Pfizer similar they're mRNA based. AZ not. hospitalizations close 2 million people amazing.


Now yell people back! Even vaccines, seems probable. Look tourist destinations around country. People beginning come large numbers. 

Btw, thought John‚Äôs Hopkins doctor said would April? makes think I'm relaxed?  need ramp 1st shots, quickly. We're way behind UK first shot distribution. want beat 4th wave, need get pedal metal. Weird situation employee mine. 

She suffering described like cold-like symptoms asthma flaring up. thought COVID tested rapid COVID Test two days onset. fever anything. tested negative attending doctor order followups, said needed one day rest felt better.

Should get retested? 2? 60:40. Past 7 days 80:20 split. probably swing back little 2nd doses pick up. 27 women younger 30 years (77 &lt;40 years) died covid Germany far.

There ~510000 infections women &lt; 35 years Germany. 

Unfortunately can't quickly find dataset matching age groups, even conservative estimate (deaths amongst women &lt;40yo, infections &lt;35 yo) get 

77/510000=.00015

Data:   Note assumes behaving way (in terms distancing, mask wearing, etc) getting vaccine. decide go hang around giant crowds without mask, risk obviously go - still significantly lower risk people vaccinated. Voluntary masking I'm totally OK with. cold, sniffles, 100 percent, even sinus/allergy problems infectious, mask situations makes total sense me.

Compulsory masking non-pandemic situations? one can't accept. lot shots went NY/NJ residents

A lot NY shots gone PA/NJ residents well. huge number state people work here. Yeah cost treatment linked cost capital acquisition. I'm scientist helped medical technology get market, I'm routinely bringing advanced imaging systems like MRI PET months time. example let's say currently CT unit on-site ain't cheap; cost charge $3,000/scan make profit. rent IVIS imaging system, costs tenth much, charge $250 make profit. 

So capital expense ultrasound particularly daunting, compared many advanced technologies see clinic. pay skilled operator, idea would entail kind therapy good ultrasound tech cardiac experience runs around $200/hour. think going treating dozen patients week, cover initial costs pretty quickly even charge hundred bucks treatment. Pretty sure every state counted deaths, question really is: governors covering deaths purpose Voluntarily crowded indoor places Yeah I'm sure timescale issue become apparent is, might UK already safe, would good get confirmation effects people group 6. prefer tell us it‚Äôll Easter 20m vaccinated January? LOL New York expanded vaccines 30 (which includes me) vaccine finder site fills ups second vaccine made available.

So guess life trying vain secure vaccine.... lot entitlement among educators, though. don‚Äôt see it, aren‚Äôt paying attention. 

Their lives aren‚Äôt worth lives grocery store workers. used domestically US. you‚Äôll end supporting it. really know relationship remember EU pushing deadline brexit several occasions based UK request. I'm expert matter think, least immediate neighbors, accepted compromise vulnerable UK people vaccinated course. Antibodies already starting fade quite rapidly elderly. looks like little less 12 weeks. Probably much longer true infection. Interesting graphic, worth noting things:

South America significantly skewed Brazil. rest continent (so far) relatively well.

Numbers Africa highly suspect. countries Africa even maintaining counts. True numbers likely much, much worse implied here.

For North America, keep eye Mexico. numbers likely significantly higher reported. recently confessed excess deaths last year 60% reported.

No region homogenous. dramatic variations within regions across demographics. region vaccinated anywhere near enough genuinely hope herd immunity. Except millions missing doses prior administration refusing order 100m given chance. I‚Äôm sadly 40 now, wasn‚Äôt paying much attention teenager tories back then, frankly don‚Äôt need to. look ever growing horror direction country going since fateful night June 2016. cannot see voting conservative future, current government utterly shameful, I‚Äôm glad least say tried voted them. Sadly older lot like parents rabid Tory voters, they‚Äôre demographic goes votes. Every young person needs get 2024 ABT. realize much supply chain own. feel bad many countries falling behind rich countries working population first exporting ramping exports. better developed countries manufacture vaccines better everyone else. know quite lot people participating studies, bf sending blood samples every month long time. 0.03% them.  Shocking one. accounting pandemic, researchers found 15.5% increase excess deaths, works 19,000 additional deaths. 14,000 additional deaths believed directly COVID-19. conclusion reached paper's abstract ""Total deaths significantly higher historical trends Florida even accounting COVID-19‚Äìrelated deaths,"" researchers wrote. ""The impact COVID-19 mortality significantly greater official COVID-19 data suggest."" 

Here‚Äôs link actual study: That‚Äôs false. chance without covid vaccine... sound like anti vaxxer now. It‚Äôs public communication trust administration. public trust goes goals set gov achieved. Michigan literally state experiencing anything like that. NY NJ modest increases. states flat slightly up. Even Michigan like 4 counties northern ""Thumb"" region account almost cases. That's well. I'm anti-lockdown, skeptic. many times tell half-ass lockdowns ""work"" evidence clearly show that. know scares people much discuss analyze it.

That said, also scheduled vaccine appointment second eligible. Im Canadian US centric opinion. Canada vaccine supply huge issue 

It‚Äôs tough conversations countries might near future accept perhaps using vaccine (for variety reasons mentioned, starting major production issues it‚Äôs having) isn‚Äôt best idea, much like South Africa (which people like seem conveniently forget sub)

The way communicate bullshit approach. someone responds countering opinion supported data, simply state incorrect. Data isn‚Äôt friendly article swedish newspaper, name Ali Harandi. can‚Äôt get many straight answers really explanation

This incredibly frustrating. I'm vaccinated, living grandparents vaccinated, Gen X parents cannot quite verbalize they're scared vaccine. 

Things got pretty contentious conversation mother recently could get trust ""the government"" Dr. Fauci, tried assure nothing development vaccine. woman works doctor's office, could vaccinated whole time. 

She 50s, obese, seems think could shake COVID happened get it, whereas vaccine seems much present threat her, even though cannot way articulate things thinks might her. assured seen plenty ""facts"" online agrees with. recall single one conversation. EU claiming supposed get didn't. Therefore, they're seizing ones going places, order get ones already paid for. Please US give money continue work CCP. results good almost impossible find statistics. Congrats UK! learned president count numbers bad. progress faster-spreading virus admirable impressive enough came virus resistant vaccines. know world without you. statistics No. slowing though. Serum Institute India problems scaling production can't get raw materials US. fill finish J&amp;J european orders relocated EU US would guarantee exports, delaying deliveries. 

It also slows roll-out. Currently lot AZ doses going unused US. would horrible? They're looking health customers employees. Besides, majority Americans either planning getting vaccine big deal 20%-25% can't come -- expect number anti-vaxxers drop rapidly can't get planes, stores, etc. self-righteous protests evaporate they're inconvenienced. stands reason they'd get ordered since ordered later they'd get later. However, EU saying they're missing dates specified contract. underestimate emerging technology. hard happens medical system forced deal overwhelming number patients

Triage. ""This week take patients age 70"" society come literal collapse modern medical provision

Ok what? Would society collapse? Probably not. people working productive (aka essential) jobs good health require hospitalization COVID. Anyone essential job definition required society keep running. vaccines those? super interesting hopefully means practically get thing vaccinating 60-80% adults keeping social distancing / masks measures (which roughly situation Israel right now). may still pockets covid, economy, education hospital capacity back normal-ish kids vaccinated. Washingtion Post: keep mind food shortages appear next decade, choosr keep crops. EU right demand vaccines made UK contract AZ says. pretty sure mention EU right vaccines made oxford. Specifically oxford. specifically, mention four european factories, oxford one  I'd definitely happy compromise 1 please, send russia, please Stating facts ""low quality content""? Interesting approach moderation. people said masks ineffective, needed many months. Yeah yeah.. menopause means older women much estrogen bodies. That's inaccurate statement say top politicians trust vaccine. got first moderna vaccine shot Philadelphia, yesterday realized heart condition makes eligible phase 1b, sure messed got earlier, Phase 1b pretty extreme examples listed conditions. Turns even ask showed today (occupation, priority group, specific heart condition).

Is known body would react violently second shot vs first one ? Good decision making includes risk management. risk ""gamble"" paying incredibly low definitely good decision making. I'm bit cynical comes public speech, emotional appeal feels contrived. oddly way comforting scientist gives facts. Okay Adolf, good fucking luck live academic journal. live world language loaded, must pick words carefully. use word ""worse"", people believe vaccine useless. Even hypotehtically worst performing vaccine, mean useless. efficacy still strong, working well UK. vaccine good get person's arm. Thus UK worthless even begin comparing vaccines since supply limited.. know nationality, seems irrelevant US-centric argument debate vaccine best. 

When say ""there's tough discussion people want have"", basically bragging people tough, since want discussion. science may accurate, taking account contexts supply, way communicate seems designed self-praise rather careful intelligent thoughts. I‚Äôm going guess starts plateau vaccine uptake, change attitude get vaxxed, loose mask. recent acknowledgement CDC transmission alludes this. possible go vein needle, causing bleeding unlikely would injected vein hard hit veins deep inside you. today, Worldometeres reports 2,800,000 coronavirus deaths, 2020 alone likely lower.

That number include claims Mexico, Russia, countries actually two three times many deaths they're reporting. vaccinated person could spend entire day licking used test kits spitting elderly

I'm sure two weeks numbers spike like case numbers now, pretend surprised new studies saying 1 shot Pfizer/Moderna 80% protective 2 shots 90% protective getting covid-19 mean exactly? Obviously doesn‚Äôt mean 20% 10% chance getting COVID-19, what‚Äôs true percentage? US Citizen here. US AZ Phase III trial got vaccine, 28F. I've following closely - vaccinated since January well beyond 4-20 day time point I'm really interested. read published papers enrolling trial wanted much information could noted nearly 50% participants AZ Vaccine group experienced transient neutropenia one person reported developing haemolytic anemia compared control group MenACWY administration.

1. Ignore China isnt cooperating external investigators prohibiting researchers surveying caves animal populations

2. Ignore lab specialised coronavirus gain function research nearest population bats harboring closest genetic relative Sars-Cov2 1000+ kilometres away

3. Ignore china clamped origin research studies academic industries silenced disappeared researchers

4. Ignore china vested interest proving spillover event failed produce evidence appearing wild anywhere near Wuhan

5. Ignore China perpetuates false origin stories blaming countries falsely saying imported frozen foods elsewhere

6. Ignore diplomatic cables reports US officials 2017 expressing alarm lack training inadequate number staff lab.

7. Ignore China reputation poor safety standards area history actual lab leaks

It‚Äôs still really hard New York, dude. Sweet, hospitalizations still dropping deaths 13% fully vaccinated  Yeah, probably one easiest things day. Problem 1000x easier wear one lol  Im likely die lighting covid age fact already mildly sick. would required vaccination proof? logic applied Biden ride easy second term. far aware. MHRA gave emergency licence Pfizer AZ, manually check batch quality. think happening EU. (MHRA 1,200 staff, EMA 790 staff dealing greater volume vaccines, opted standard licence (no batch checking) rather emergency licence).

This false, [know Stop spreading lies.

[EMA approval, **each batch** COVID-19 vaccine approved via EMA tested: 
‚Ä¢Before vaccines used immunisation programmes 
‚Ä¢Independently done official medicines control laboratory

Batch testing done national competent authorities. fact, every single batch vaccine (non-COVID) tested used EU. point, yet flies head, that's job.

We get it, concept cost benefit analysis freshman class think discovered hottest shit ever. Calm it. Yeah, anyone know blood clots EU mostly occur first second dose? experience, ready tomorrow. fine day second Pfizer. Next day ass day. Perfectly fine back normal day after. Congrats vax!

Not surprise case. Keep chugging along usual, long hospitals overwhelmed. often healthcare practitioners make recommendations like data back recommendation place? [Big words: no. Lockdowns always course action.

There time supposed desperate emergency measure prevent mass death overwhelming healthcare system. Unfortunately, dad isn‚Äôt one changed minds Unless recommendations acknowledge reality Covid 19 isn‚Äôt dangerous people 50

Must terrify masses die leave houses Yes last two days big jump. Something watch. again, travelled multiple different states pandemic NJ far displayed compliance state public health guidance states I've seen (NJ, NY, CT, PA). 13% Texans vaccinated, surprising public health experts knew cases would go keep smoking cr4k dude, thank response. succinct informative. I'll read J&amp;J AZ vaccines work. got Moderna stuff I've read Moderna Pfizer. tell satire/trolling not, response made clear. LOL. future know true devastation rushed vaccines. one wont get vaccinated till least 3-5 years. There's pandemic? make claim, burden proof you. simple.  Churches packed Easter! realise pharmaceutical companies national/supranational governments like EU exporting vaccines?

The vaccines exported property EU. vaccines contractually obliged sent UK. happen made within EU borders. Buddy mine got hit car 1 day getting AZ vaccine, must link! vaccine may option much developing world right now

I agree. Let Africa, Europe Asia one. U.S. need vaccine bad reputation. vaccine give anti-vaxxers ammo. Recommendations changed undeniable data Water wet. Water wet lol Yea, BMI stuff interesting. I'm 185 lbs 5'11. workout hour per day eat healthy. I'm classified overweight BMI scale. also overstated. unknown whether myocarditis covid serious health issue temporary consequence general viral infection. data literature suggests ladder. People UK 40 routinely BCG vaccine. done schools. sure stopped yeah practically mandatory here.

Surely there's basis randomly choosing BCG reason? Germany social market economy, means state jumps market failure, formation monopolies secures social benefits citizens, like healthcare, education workers' rights.

Yeah, sounds really really good haha. like Serbia. aspects lives subject markets (like healthcare). idea private property low taxes definitely must. high taxes there? Cumulatively.

Why would elderly, higher risk blood clots, vaccine that's approved 55+ ""has potential"" cause blood clots?

Either deliberate *very* poor judgment government. seriously doubt point speculation.
Perhaps feel risks outweigh benefits? Either way, lied saying ""was safe"" public. antibodies don‚Äôt need vaccine correct? yellow fever epidemic New Orleans, issued ‚Äúimmunity cards‚Äù. Guess what, useless widen existing inequalities prejudices lower class folk risk. thing happen here. Also, lot rural areas state don‚Äôt even access vaccinations. supposed do, shopping what? Crazy many people like lockdown lifestyle. Must shut ins never leave house enjoy socializing / meetings others.

However, UK invest Halix plant AZ even involved EU blocking exports reverse definitely true.

Yes new export rules aimed mainly UK, that‚Äôs made clear various EU officials wording it.

No it‚Äôs EU UK don‚Äôt delivered. Also EUs ‚Äòclaim‚Äô even tenuous case Pfizer meeting exceeding delivery schedule yet EUs threats limited AZ.

No point replying detail you‚Äôve made clear don‚Äôt actually care ignore say. course is? 50 percent vaccines used UK produced domestically. vaccines used UK produced using materials sourced England. Nobody taking trash, regardless age, much safer options available. Brazil United Kingdom continue suspended except repatriation flights.

Excluding UK specifically, versus EU countries, seems insane ignore politics behind it.

The UK rate \~55/100k/week, UK variant dominant variant throughout EU, meaning almost random person European mainland likely infected person Britain. yet UK people fully RTO fully WFH [even growing. last summer's anything go by, continental Europeans even eager return office.

I guess different got big American houses WFH from, unlike tiny flats we've got Europe. Plus commutes lot shorter kids transmit would matter, do, actually transmitting ever new variants. Unvaccinated population including 16 prevent pandemic ending/herd immunity. Sinovac? Unfortunately government bought likely, we'll getting. He's American president, addressing American people America certainly never happened. fearmongering. holding captive? need help? 500k people dead still people like you.  stop. embarrassing.

Africa continent referred such. dictate language. dictate words people use. dictatorial.

If want refer Africa Africa, will. use word like. try dictate words people use.

Have ever even Africa? have. people Africans. like referred African. like people continent Europe Europeans.

Stop trying find issue one focus Real issues. person responding isnt making nuanced point. point literally boils ""vaccines =/= over."" ‚ÄúNormal‚Äù isn‚Äôt milestone. ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt losing 1000 people day‚Äù? 400k people didn‚Äôt US died people wouldn‚Äôt wear masks. else would blame this? EU said block Pfizer Moderna vaccines, since fulfilled contract. Would interesting see somecone could actually calculate likelihood. layman assume spike protein mutate way unrecognizable vaccinated immune system yet still able use ACE2 receptor enter cell. many fitting combinations be?

The amount mutations extremely high infections counted hundreds millions already body virus attacks billions cells infected cell produces N copies virus, replications produce new variant - ""fail correctly"" still keep virus functional. bet there's thousands millions times utter failures see variants.

It's obvious can't model every possible protein combination smart statisticians might able figure methods calculate anyways e.g. Monte Carlo fashion otherwise smartly reducing set size. vaccine effectiveness full immunization (‚â•14 days second dose) 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless symptom status; vaccine effectiveness partial immunization (‚â•14 days first dose second dose) 80%.""

Would interesting see first dose immunity (in absence second dose) 28 days 42 days. IOW, much increase 80%-90% actually due second dose vs additional time.  Well Republican governors sure acting different. need economy strong need get reelected respective states. goes Republican state representatives state senators. want states economy healthy. 

The obvious point vaccine real works even Republicans behind it. Getting Republicans board vaccine past would nonstarter. One city Germany restricted AZ vaccine women used aged try use primarily men. idiotic governors lifting mask mandates safety protocols. 

The case death rate Texas steadily declining since Abbot made move.... desire fine, it‚Äôs risky choice. parents know want kids back schools talk circles make sound like fine. hope is, it‚Äôs still risky.  Felt nothing. times. everyone else know got it. didn‚Äôt. bought vaccines AZ it‚Äôs AZ come 4 potential factories. claim true EU would able claim AZ vaccines UK, UK would also able demand EU produced ones exported UK. 

Also you‚Äôre unsurprisingly wilfully ignorant. difference manufacturer delivering UK UK choosing whether donate compared manufacturer trying deliver EU stopping exporting taking vaccines itself. can‚Äôt understand pretty huge difference won‚Äôt waste time further. ‚Äúautonomy‚Äù include getting disease could kill guy seat next thinks it‚Äôs hoax? goal lockdowns prevent hospitals overwhelmed, rather prevent ""positive cases"" among low risk populations...oh wait...we seem backwards Sneezing symptom covid-19. someone explain like im 5 years old? mean? just... pretty much normal distance people stand other? (Unless they're *close talkers*...ugh). Amazing reading lots references  dont think really need worry ten year old. Statistically speaking, he's got much higher chance bad complications flu coronavirus, perspective. ""He""? must really follow topic closely. Thanks valuable input. Feel free go look plethora information available internet using ask go get like kind fucking maid lmao.

There's plenty well respected immunologists people scientific community point reasons seems engineered. know enough determine what's right wrong highly doubt anyone else does.

But say thought MAY created pathetic person making claim blatantly scope understanding really determine that, actually pathetic. 3 million vaccinations past 3 days USA. pandemic ending despite lockdown fetishists deepest desires. anecdotes I‚Äôll add mine: entire family (20+ people varying ages) got Pfizer Moderna. single person felt anything sore arm. British website inoculations 'jabs' forever. uptake friendly kind word roots early 20th century morphine usage.  Wonder conspiracy nutjob sister law would stop calling shit fake bloody nurse. Ugh course benefits environment would huge, topic deliberately muted reddit. care environment, hate needless ""commute"" tens millions day sit front display worked well home. dodging question. goal reopen cases matter, reopen. UK EU likely much better office working conditions. work 50-60 hours like many us. live closer work. probably congruent comparison. gonna lie, got first half. unethical fake residency get shot? 

Yes. *It's job hospital make cost benefit analysises armchair warrior.*

Then also job make decisions kind offer kind expertise subject.

*Just like PEI task make sufe vaccines safe*

Then provide data blood clots issue offer guidance. Let politicians take call, since willing provide cost-benefit analysis. Based reading article, Charite instead unilaterally decided stop injecting vaccine. would it, unless there‚Äôs pattern emerging that‚Äôs outside expected range? That‚Äòs works mate ... type cell phone? Well damn, mine week ago suddenly clotting issues i've never Los Angeles area am, schools closed since March, 2020. That's one whole year kids stepped foot schools. agree parents social interaction kids. rules, choice. school district planning re-opening now, teachers union fighting every step way. Right now, 6 feet rule, planning use hybrid model, means two days in-person learning, two days remote learning. students masked, seems reasonable 3 feet would fine, since teacher talking. Considering poor messaging around vaccination right Washington, nothing short miracle. happens people vote functioning government instead whacko conspiracists. Yeah don‚Äôt understand either. I‚Äôm California days there‚Äôs state mandate along employer one.
I worked construction site (still checking temperatures.. why?) require masks. guy alone tractor day. ‚ÄúOh well won‚Äôt hurt‚Äù - makes sense. look like they‚Äôre taking super serious. 
Meanwhile guy tractor still hasn‚Äôt anywhere near another person day. U think it‚Äôs bad now.. wait...#HoldMyBeer Yes, anti-spike protein antibodies started anti-nucleocapsoid assays well. 

[Blood samples tested antibodies using assay IgG immunoglobins spike (S) protein, produced fight virus, irrespective symptoms. information methods around antibody assay found study comparing performance four assays. March 2021, also testing samples IgG immunoglobulins nucleocapsid (N) protein Also 300 million AZ doses according current schedule 100 million reach EU end Q2. sometimes Q3 likely time enough vaccines available Germany vaccinate everybody. 200 million doses AZ vaccine potentially reach EU time least Germany really need much anymore. AZs delivery delays significantly reduced importance vaccination programs EU. going us 'hypochondriac freaks' want stay safe we've identified? Harass us? Bully us? don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely whole vaccine leaked out. would take someone drastically failing giving injection. felt side effects, definitely got shot. Fwiw, almost every shot I‚Äôve gotten, I‚Äôve bled bit. Think that‚Äôs fairly normal. fuck? Yeah, well, global cooperation possible without globalisation üòÅ scan read feeling great misread it. 

Thank detailed analysis shall revise position this. 

Apologies Even broken clock right twice day. would want give praise getting vaccine program right however really make mistakes. mean charge running country, guess 80% incompetent arguably corrupt unaccountable better 100% give wider praise feels wrong.  funny instance. would see x amount people wasnt infected vaccine?

None vaccines live virus them, 100% impossible get live virus vaccine. make full FDA approval businesses employers require it. Even military mandated emergency authorized vaccines personnel before. Asking someone wear mask requiring vaccines anyway. Firing someone wearing mask already happening. Government schools kids masking, virtual schooling, quarantining colds. clearly lot saying can. Private schools employers whatever want long discriminating protected class. can‚Äôt here?

We small island nation lot wide open space people. New Zealand one trade centers world. nation 50 states, governments, rules regulations. 

New Zealand quite literally shut EVERYONE negative effects. America not. like every country Europe could not. America, literally can't even close borders states.

Comparing New Zealand America apples oranges comparison. Actually, probably apart apples oranges. we're concerned kids spreading virus, vaccines stop spread, follow kids need vaccinated? probably good things vaccinated folks unvaccinated low risk folks according CDC guidelines: Y'all need COVAXIN. ?? surprised 50% immunity enough open things monitor situation. 50% big number. R 2 1 regulators keep saying ""no big deal, fluke"", media eat up. make big deal tiny issue. We're lmao Maybe Covid doesn‚Äôt like people Michigan? /s anecdotally know many people afraid pandemic hiding behind want resume daily 1 hour+ commutes close proximity coworkers.

Prohibition 100 years ago moral attitudes around alcohol. Businesses thought banning alcohol would improve sales forms diversion. Racist organizations wanted use alcohol laws target minorities (really, look up.) Whenever see massive movement like almost never single reason. 

Our behavior pandemic large extent driven pandemic itself. But, pointed out, ""There plenty cogent arguments supporting increased WFH"" organizations opportunistically looking implement changes convenient. UK routinely BCG given high risk populations areas.

E.g. everyone born London would BCG would everyone Asian African descent  regarding contract European Union. J&amp;J seemingly something EU got right. know broken clock is... data collected vaccinations. vaccines don‚Äôt cause it, others reported similar cases, within ranges patterns would expect within population large anyway unlikely related vaccination. 

You seem know little side effects reported judged. honestly, really think there‚Äôs something political play, would likely certain country heavily reliant vaccine simply underreporting - no, doesn‚Äôt mean think UK is. suspect conspiracy, might well start there. Yet another leader trying force shortcomings onto others.  Honestly, it‚Äôs personal decision want go not. don‚Äôt think CDC Fauci ever say ‚Äúyou safely socialize‚Äù time soon type decision making discretion get though. working population 18-50. vaccinated people 60-90.

So herd immunity work herd inside going out..? can! I‚Äôm using 3M conservative estimate given get next week. 4M day could happen sometime May. UK recorded cases, statistically significant level. It‚Äôs hard. don‚Äôt want to. Nah agree u/thosewhocannetworkd - hospitalization trends continuing follow case trends rather continuing fall regardless case counts means achieved wide enough vaccine immunity yet case counts going ""doesn't mean anything"". Clearly point huge spike case counts would also huge spike hospitalizations (and probably deaths) would materially leave us much worse off, instead we're seeing small increase hospitalizations small increase case counts, perfectly manageable long unexpectedly spiral upward control anything. saying panicking anything, absolutely continue least monitor case counts change behaviors adjust risk assumptions based trends near live rather ignore completely. Per capita? friend new york, parents still live there. lived years, realizes vaccine-eligible convince residency. still gets mail addressed parents' house, mom willing write note saying lives - according NYS website, item mail note would work provide proof residency. looks like it'll long time eligible actually lives. 

is unethical fake residency get shot? permissible? Depends too, drill sergeant basically stab ass 2 basic penicillin shot. weighed odds wife getting vaccine third trimester lot people trust celebrities politicians.  Anybody advocates vaccines helping. fair trending way took office. rollout result many peoples efforts. throwing focus anything mishandling situation. would think would less prevalent among medical professionals, it‚Äôs question needs considered. one year also learned per capita mean country.

 Brazilian average age 33 europe 40. Brazil 2% population 80 europe 7%

If Brazil deaths per capita countries mentioned means people got infected per capita Brazil people died younger there. Props parties involved smashing 100m shots 100 days goal couple months ago. Highly unlikely, UK one biggest scientific hubs huge amounts data collected post vaccinations.

How wild speculation getting many upvotes? manufacturing vaccines EU? arguing semantics politicians. safer 3ft 6ft 6ft anything without ventilation, almost schools bad ventilation. would vaccinated people, thus reducing people get lot. 

Currently around 65K cases 7 day average according worldometers. winter surge around 200k cases day. That‚Äôs 3 times current average. 

In months time gotten half US pop one shot 60% adults one shot. 

In two months time 60% US pop one shot 80% adults one shot. 

So yes, cases could double get high again, takes time. time passes, get people vaccinated decreases odds cases increasing winter levels. Eat help fucking stupid too. Keep hand still use it. Also walking around something expect number drop. won‚Äôt work well nail polish. People dying vaccine. Approximately 70 million people US 1 3 vaccines aren‚Äôt people dying droves - would absolutely hear about. Go get don‚Äôt listen them. Protect yourself. remember that! ""Why cases Israel going down?!?!?!?!?!?"" comments like two weeks... cases went down. Back day used 2-4 weeks behind Europe, appears 2-4 weeks behind Israel. Let's this! That‚Äôs true

I don‚Äôt think actually say this‚Ä¶ body took shoot better doesn‚Äôt mean someone else didn‚Äôt, felt like someone jacked arm People die. always always will. die. die. 

I supported lockdowns restrictions know facing, continued support cases rising control real end sight.

Now end sight. worried Covid unvaccinated, hang there. Otherwise, longer support shutting things extreme restrictions, especially guise utter bullshit like ""its still spreading rapidly control"". outright make something justify stance, stance sucks. Locally might creepy world travels years get vaccinated types stuff able go places. mean global cooperation, right? üòÇ Globalization something different üòÖ I‚Äôm excited finally eat indoors Two ding dongs work wearing masks tested positive recently. small room half hour. wearing kn95 3.5 weeks 1st moderna. 5 days after, tested negative. believe pre-symptomatic, think shows efficacy masks, little distance, vaccine. thankful. True, let's hope cooler heads prevail scientific community answers then. 

In mean time hope feel good please try let stress much. German regulator also adopted stance 

Source: point life going safe go groups? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated elderly parents. I‚Äôm sick living inside year don‚Äôt kill parents see them. want go eat, want play sports summer, want go vacation, etc... haven‚Äôt hung anyone named parents siblings since March 14th 2020. possible way vaccinating kids found effective. First foremost limit risk kids themselves. provide extra protection can't get vaccines. 

Reminder kids 16 make ~20% population. They're rounding error. idea create situation media reporting every new instance blood clotting caused AZ vaccine? help convince people get vaccinated LOL. think lot people won‚Äôt take vaccine emotional reason, logical ones, given information there. It‚Äôs easy label people dumb taking case many. may uneducated lot basing decision emotions AZ meger 10% expected vaccine deliveries Q2. Yeah, mate.

Also, yes, occurred vaccines, outside expected pattern (because always see cases unrelated vaccines). It‚Äôs reported precisely unexpected. College spring break

Decreased restrictions 

Most people vaccinated ideal infection rate right low possible, level whenever hospitals overwhelmed? 

The current vaccines solve problem immunity probably next 11 months.

And, real small chance long term effectiveness variants.

But history coronaviruses bears immunity much 12 - 13 months, consequence virus evolution. met anyone that's blood test antibodies, matter, anyone knows somebody that's one!

Seems conclusions extremely speculative based limited data! Yeah it‚Äôs kinda rough, bad Peanut butter shot got ass Basic training Army, onky like 12 hour shitty time second one, unlike itchy damn Smallpox vaccine is. we're going weeds risk assessment, seeing substantially UK deaths AZ dangerous? tradeoff vaccination seems like reasonable harm reduction. guy Twitter (Anthony J Leonardi) immediately dismissive T-cell news says SARS-COV-2 special protein allows ignore t-cells. true this? Current thinking 60s get booster shot next September believe. Thank you. 

As man UK 50 still happy choice 5 2 million chance adverse reaction. certainly profile introvert reddit loves sort **work-from-home**/avoid everyone lifestyle. That's people healthy, certainly anything us year.

Why work-from-home getting thrown this? plenty cogent arguments supporting increased WFH nothing introversion pandemic management. trying spread anything utilizing purpose thread vent exasperation people. relaxed mother bit fully vaccinated time. grandparents first shot time always wore mask made wear masks them. similar reaction last night. Really wild dreams asked different reply source numbers actually known incident rate low around.

Not sure method rollout distribution effects this, majority UK vaccinated Az. total 50 females vaccinated greater entire Germans vaccination count, surely better source data?

Currently demand outpaces supply, there's reason publicly acknowledge information. want create incentive lie vaccinated, they're either going punish people vaccinated (e.g. vaccine passports) fails they'll finally give tell people wear masks follow guidelines vaccinated. alright then. wait places fully reopen without requiring proof vaccine risk creating spreader events. Becaus instead makes sense give AZ groups give women 55/60 vaccine. risk lives women group reason cirumvent that? comparing Sweden rest Europe cultural geographical similar countries? Well thats says contract can‚Äôt exactly go around admitting case Yes, would workable solution... every employer (or even critical mass employers) board. 

Are they? don't, statistical problems. never going get answers looking way measure definite exposure challenge studies ethical.

These tools look effectiveness. Take large groups people either vaccinated unvaccinated live normal lives, significant period time see many infected group. 

No perfect science modeling enough individuals reach statistical power make conclusions within certain degree confidence. 50 got astra fine, mean rare cases someone (clearly 9 people Germany died short span time). like dismissing issue blindly, like like panicking overreacting either. someone says ‚Äúhospitals *saying* everyone died Covid‚Äù, statistic need see &amp; understand. (early) trial results out? I've heard earlier going March seems that's happening then? say ""You'll need eat get medical care"" say ""No forcing required"" sentence? Yes, health competencies. federal government constantly pushing stricter measures prime ministers German states seem listen scientists medical personnel. Doesn‚Äôt feel great? first shot last week, walking sunshine, feeling hopeful future safety family. agree you. CDC messaging absolute shit beginning, administrations. Instead speaking science numbers, make emotional appeals. think would much productive less divisive simply stated things like ""based see Israel, follow path happens. follow path B happens. strongly suggest B save X number lives"". Making emotional appeals attempting play psychological games make sense we're (US) diverse (polarized) country. galvanizes people equally sides message. Norwegian health authorities previously stated cases developed within 3 14 days taking vaccine. statistic probably include latest cases good indicator. places require proof (concerts, events, possibly air travel). Otherwise... can't. never able to. people lie it. unvaccinated person wants go world, point, put them. Everyone wants one get vaccine (or, well, immediately future get vaccine). 

The original goal post set overwhelm healthcare system minimize losses. vulnerable less vaccinated point, everyone else getting jabs, too. We've done set do. let's get back life. I‚Äôm pretty sure can‚Äôt enforce essential businesses agree gist post. Needing show passport participate society government overreach, it‚Äôs even enforceable since three vaccines still Emergency Use Authorization it‚Äôs gonna way till US reached herd immunity (which lot experts say won‚Äôt till kids vaccinated, might next year). seen posters past days claim healthcare workers UK got Moderna Pfizer. statistics distribution vaccines different age groups UK? Yeah that's what's weirdest this. Denmark / Norway / Germany shows patterns ""best-in-world"" monitoring systems. 

Either produced local facilities, different rest world, politics worse monitoring system. new concept new reality. many places require vaccinated certain diseases travel there. government already information know. I've vaccinated diseases order travel, big deal really invasion privacy all. Fuck powermods . I'll take shot, astrazeneca Yep. Nice try however.   said UK would ‚Äúfirst get access‚Äù Oxford vaccine ‚Äì comments likely raise eyebrows around world. 

Or prefer video.  

OK maybe *everyone* expecting, can't expect everyone equally prescient, Trump. odds really, really good would happen did. 2 weeks second shot Fauci mask mandates lockdowns lick butthole. Well, compare countries cultures somewhat similar. asking Sweden worse numbers neighbour countries. open suggestion brigading problem. Finding angle tackle issue somewhat within days assure top list. Jeez mixing vaccines? Europe's rollout complete total fuck up.

Merkel fucked imo entirely fault mutations could far less dangerous also.

There's whole lot evolutionary pressure SARS-CoV-2 become less dangerous though. Presymptomatic asymptomatic transmission already seem occur frequently symptoms last time without killing host (in cases). one knows happen, current circumstances suggest anticipate comparable level danger time, mitigated common cold virus could mutate become incredibly lethal

Also, weird analogy pretty much circumstances right now? up? Yup, looks like we're seeing fourth (hopefully significantly smaller) wave least states. enough widespread immunity yet totally prevent surges deaths/hospitalizations, likely May June vaccine continues roll virus rips people either can't get vaccinated. young people risk getting brain bleed AZ higher dying COVID many populations. know ""stupid"" consider risks young people. using ages 65 older cohort benefits far outweigh small risk vaccine. still expected deliver total promised (970k) Q2 according (page 8). personal health regarding Covid vaccine, don‚Äôt actually care vaccines effective. people children immune deficiency can‚Äôt get vaccine fucked over. I‚Äôm opinion people choice ones face consequences rather without one.

But also, argument hear vaccines well, like MMR, vaccines like 50-60% effective. those, still get severely sick exposed, true protection comes herd immunity therefore *really* matters others get vaccinated. So, Canada return vaccine US now? considered purchased?

As far know US never approve AstraZeneca use, today. benevolent advance vaccine Canada. Canada. Ouch Correct Texas percentage population that? forget true patriot gqp Yeah, I'm sure people South Korea Austalia really upset lockdowns tiny fraction dead here.

Absolutely jurisdiction continental United States ever imposed strict lockdown.

Florida pretty bad crisis considering weather advantage, major exporter virus.   need continue look Israel data. Brave step first cool provide data. really hold water anymore.

The end going predicated almost entirely mass vaccinations creating rapidly dropping case rate drop continuing occur states open up.

Today we're 60k case rate. go 70k 80k next two weeks drop 30k 40k, going impact ""the end"" is. 

Obviously, people die interim go 70k 80k sucks, much sacrifice children's development lives? joblessness, hunger, etc? 

While white collar WFH-able jobs going back work, seems far relatively safe conditions (split schedules, masked, etc.)

My big ass company even started talking going back office. similar story basically every company industry. Agreed. Rewarding people vaccinated makes sense punishing get vaccinated.

As long overly intrusive, I'm fine business offering discounts people choose show they're vaccinated. encourage businesses offer bonuses employees get vaccinated. like idea businesses refusing service unvaccinated people. want now! care also concern variants may render vaccines less effective. study‚Äôs results confirm fear. Troubling variants circulating time study ‚Äî Dec. 14, 2020, March 13, 2021 ‚Äî yet vaccines still provided powerful protection.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Thanks advice! soon need vaccine passport work, eat, get medical care, everyone role sleeve.  forcing required. You‚Äôll also need backup cell phone times still show passport main phone breaks. UK mainly given vaccines old people - vaccine rollout age based. blood clot deaths they've males (in sharp contrast EU).

If EU giving vaccine women contraception pill, might pill key culprit vaccine.

Also: MHRA gave emergency licence Pfizer AZ, manually check batch quality. think happening EU. (MHRA 1,200 staff, EMA 790 staff dealing greater volume vaccines, opted standard licence (no batch checking) rather emergency licence). 

(The manual checking one reasons suspect stockpiles vaccines, bottleneck MHRA checking procedures. example 1 million AZ imported EU checked given yet, also 1 million sent back india quality reasons). Yes, vaccine contagious like covid. Almost half BioNTech factory Marburg, Germany afaik nothing Pfizer, still impressive. it‚Äôs good thing study involved 3,950 healthcare workers/first responders.

And would determine many definetly exposed? every first responder, nurse, doctor gets infected per se. Like 3k fisherman monitored 1k caught carp; fishing spot, time, bait? think initial shipment, whole country waiting second round. Thanks sharing! curious piece data. It‚Äôs grim suspected would be. every class leaders, Pfizer/Moderna, laggards, AstraZeneca.  

It would interesting see study Placebo vs AstraZeneca Chimp Adenovirus sans Covid-19 part. vaccine useing different Adenovirus vector like common one used J&amp;J Sputnik.  question is, causing difficulties AstraZeneca experiencing... unique viral vector, COVID payload, something else. does. However, worry. chances Greek state organise zero. fizzle like everything else think best evidence is: WIV samples Sars-CoV-2 closely related vieus outbreak, would also record samples collected. China could go back particular location say ""hey found origin"" all, inability find animal host main thing causing speculation.

The fact they're saying ""we know"" pretty good indication record virus. slightly concerning already hospitalized years back severely low platelet count doctors never could figure cause was. already take Moderna vaccine though, hopefully, two related. Think got wires crossed...

It appears so. Time go get coffee wake more. 

Sorry misunderstanding. know many people live US, right swear stupid illiterate ashole blocks 100M doses whole EU happily deport den Hague trialled crimes humanity.

At least support that. live Austria. way. Ok, and...? It‚Äôs given we‚Äôll get boosters variants manufacturers already working saying they‚Äôll ready fall. really isn‚Äôt big deal. unemployment $600/week duration pandemic? adds decent ""monthly check"" I've ever seen one. true...

I'm colorado. I'm 30M healthy even got doses. Colorado great job rollout. fact know single person life fully vaccinated now. Idk Info reading trying easy get appointment here. fact places giving vaccines excess spare doses end day. age based strategy haven‚Äôt really really gone 50 years yet.

Healthcare workers first vaccinated, NHS biggest employer Europe quite lot young people already vaccinated.

Also vaccinated February, I'm 26 hospital got it. horrible thing say...but wish pandemic taken people out, cuz traffic sucks now! ""Impending doom"" memes aside, anyone else getting really freaked talk ""digital vaccine passports""?

Every day seems like people warming idea. encourage everyone wants vaccine get one, want government encourage fence also get them. idea present digital medical records buy groceries. want live two-tier society punishes people wanting get vaccinated. someone want get vaccinated, everyone know vaccinated, matter? Texas case count continued decline even ending mask mandate. right, let get thing. Well, mr. specialist, guess COVID ""evolutionary error"" According UK green book: injections given needle 90¬∫ angle skin skin  stretched,  bunched. Deep SC injections  given needle 45¬∫ angle skin skin bunched, stretched.   necessary  aspirate  syringe  needle introduced muscle (WHO, 2004; Plotkin Orenstein, 2004).

It seem mandated United Kingdom. idea standards rest world. ""it's fine""

Well, except teacher's union complaining press reporting controversial.

&amp;#x200B;

""schools must reopen""

I missed part President Biden ordered ""schools must reopen"" (as authority). 

You can't say ""trust CDC! CDC staffed experts best interests heart!"" ignore make recommendations like. Whether they're right this, know. I'm inclined trust CDC person overseeing executive branch calling everyone take hydroxychloroquine based comments French crackpot, saying doctors look sunshine bleach COVID treatments, ignoring lying pandemic weeks complaining masks. Outside kids, there‚Äôs almost downside work home 

Except social component many office-based jobs influences everything promotions teamwork. example used lunch learn monthly job brought team together talk problems facing group discussion solve them. free lunch penalty missing them, one attends year hurting team mean makes sense consider Moderna established Pfizer is. anything catchup Moderna done something could admired even more. pump pretty much even numbers Pfizer US. Canada they're 50% Pfizer still pretty good considering catchup! least parties, especially reigning one.

But Germany's case rate winter, soon nearly everyone know severe case younger age personally. currently shifting public opinion. Anecdotally, really notice change behavior before/after restrictions lifted. hell trending 100m vaccinated another 100m already covid USA? state rapidly reopening? mask mandate egregious policy example, things different. Could also men less likely seek medical examination symptoms they‚Äôre experiencing? Nope im health care worker co-workers got astra, 50 fine. There's way inherent problem vaccine countries issued doses experiencing issues it. friends Dutch parents turkey awesome. Well, inept medical record keeping systems inefficient. that‚Äôs claim, evidence? think we‚Äôve supply constrained anything else.

At point I‚Äôm less sure we‚Äôre arguing about, thrown garbage across room anger safe side. rarely fatal

From article:
""and fatality rate among develop clots high 40%.""

This **not** normal clotting like DVT. Yesterday, CDC also reported first ""real world"" study Pfizer Moderna vaccines showed 90% efficacy help prevent asymptomatic infections. ... 100m people vaccinated plus another 100m already covid USA..how trending up.. Look answer person copy paste it:  


 ""Scandinavians tend bit richer, less multi-generational households, lower population density, culture less socially promiscuous"" 

Exactly Scandinavians generally tend to, Swedes hand received close million refugees since 2015! Sweden's overall population 10 million now, means 15% increase immigrants span 5-6 years. insane. Covid-19 especially prevalent immigrants homes tend live close smaller spaces on. Couple fact may trouble understanding everything Sweden, resulted immigrants way higher % people diagnosed Covid.

""Sweden still managed kill"", please stop childish language western country especially Northern European cynical, could say thing missed cancer treatments, abused kids forced live abusers full year, delayed surgeries, overall decrease public health... Norway distribution vaccines younger age groups 77% women 23% men 16-44 group according ones vaccinated group health front line workers (and they've given AZ, earmarked health care).

29vs2 fit entirely, agree. inclined believe women susceptible disorders, I'm sure. first dose that's really key driving cases though Covid killed family friend dialysis Lol I‚Äôm thinking they‚Äôre taking full advantage able say whatever‚Äôs minds Walensky isn‚Äôt handling well. states, cannot make appointment ahead time age group. helps prevent websites crashing previous age group still booking like crazy, also can‚Äôt book many far ahead, due unreliability deliveries vaccines (e.g. don‚Äôt want make hundreds appointments get shipment shots in.) I‚Äôd imagine CA operates similarly.

However, waiting, become familiar state sign page! Check evening age group opens, states set ‚Äúopen registration‚Äù night before. Doesn‚Äôt hurt check! health insurance, insurance card handy booking appointment ask type number in. Receiving first shot today, thankful 5 6. read graph see direction going. Might want learn little high school math. They're safer unless they're not, spike would trigger auto immune reaction would intense. good news though response likely would caught quickly, seen anything. good. you‚Äôd ever ride parked Boston you‚Äôd agree. people get antibodies virus old fashioned way haven‚Äôt already. FEMA site center city free while, they‚Äôve finished giving first doses available. wonder anything Birth Control. 

And many AZ trials women. You‚Äôd think would came already hasn‚Äôt UK seen much. put EU this, traditional Austrian fuckup. politicians perfectly able make mess without external help. Glad approved states. take second shot 3 months?

I think making decision point makes sense. They're investigating exactly happening hopefully know details time scheduled get second shot. Ahh yes, ""I need doctor interpret complex medical advice"" type know-it-all. favorite.

Why seat listen someone expertise instead puffing chest read blog once?

There many, many ways Coronavirus could still change enough fuck us people pretending everything fine exactly way happen. Try listening instead speaking. five cases weeks ago. Pretty much normal incidence rate line rate people who'd received Pfizer vaccine Tbh mostly agree this. I'm 25 woman find bit concerning. expect get vaccine around June/July wait anyway, I'd rather know sure risk, I'd rather get different vaccine. rn I'd wait anyway know sure. work home really go anywhere like I'm risking people. really support getting vaccinated want get mine well, get people dismissive potential risks. Obviously think huge risk, anything available long time I'd probably get anyway, think good mindful things, make anti-vaxxer. Sure agree requires us figure actual incidence rate publish number. 

Emphasis always informed consent UK can't ignore want informed consent vaccine recipients government fucked ungodly amount things covid. even get started track trace. 

But actually vaccine rollout, part, one thing government right. 

We one countries decided opt getting first doses done fast possible without waiting second doses available standard 6 week interval. aided procurement, could order much larger initial volume vaccines compared countries similar populations. Granting us favourable contracts minimum doses prompt delivery dates. gamble, science explicitly support measure, immunity tested based two doses, one. gamble paid off, data rolling suggests rather large amount protection based first dose alone. 

The infrastructure role also incredible responsibility lie NHS, say government nothing vaccine success (lucky may paid off), slightly inaccurate. 

In short, fuck Torries, acknowledge good decision making happens. I‚Äôm 41 (not young younger parents)

Funny coincidence. I'm 43 also happen younger parents! :)


On serious note, 68 &amp; 70 negligible side effects Moderna. Pfizer sore arm. also headache runs shot 1 Pfizer... I'm prone daily migraines due Keto diet also prone runs. know got shot... sore arm, I'd assumed anything amiss.

I already April 9th marked calendar wife &amp; celebrate full effectiveness day. current bump seems almost entirely concentrated denser states north, probably people starting socialize even though *quite* enough outdoors, vaccinations quite yet. think weather gets consistently nice vaccinations continue coming, things trending downwards good. can't see bad last spring past winter, ""impending doom"" comment CDC bizarre unprofessional. Captain obvious : 

""In order control viral spread need 

N95 masks

Air filtration enclosed spaces

Mass testing pooled testing home rapid antigen testing""

I clue governments late perform common sense practices. 2021 1918 Swansea University health data experts looked vaccinations January 180,000 AstraZeneca doses 260,000 Pfizer-Biontech.

180k would range expect (not many) cases show occurring roughly rate Germany/Norway/Denmark. However, article bit frustrating giving much detail exactly given vaccines. AZ Wales given young people January, example? Cases starting rise Florida U.S. whole. I'm optimistic relative normalcy return soon there's good reason end mask mandates many people yet vaccinated. I‚Äôm still wearing mask around public, even though city dropped mask mandates. It‚Äôs habit really. I‚Äôm starting see friends aren‚Äôt vaccinated haven‚Äôt caught covid inside instead outside spread apart. helps covid died substantially county. Actually no. filling orders order negotiated. EU tried holding better deal, invest infrastructure little research. 

They tried usual ""we pay"".

The EU spent whole year virtue signaling exact thing said america would do. 

EU stealing countries vaccines. What? vaccine rollout trash.... Grow brain It‚Äôs based different epidemiological models reliable ones pandemic. It‚Äôs also factoring seasonality states bad year ago seem ones getting hit hard now. year ago around date cases began decreasing states. Sure many different circumstances April 2020 2021 (level lockdown, amount vaccines etc) things play similarly year Nah, they'll say one home  male seems there's difference rate expect general population. Definitely seem issue women certain countries though needs looked at. 
I'm pretty sure Faughcheigh hope problem affects countries big problem outside EU. vaccine really important many countries America, Africa Asia. Thank posting this! I‚Äôve recently gotten back reading reddit, useful interesting info hear about! Cause like responsible citizen want keep abreast latest developments. Sounds like concerned constructing echo chamber. someone still saying, ""I'm going wait see,"" 100 million it, I'm sure going move them. January, sure. Now? Anyone else tired goal post shifting that‚Äôs happening lately? recently saw comment say vaccine program won‚Äôt effective kids vaccinated spread most. thought key normality vulnerable adults vaccinated. it‚Äôs turned adults vaccinated. everyone vaccinated restrictions lift? 

If told last March would‚Äôve killed self cause hate living never ending nightmare. Florida pretty rough place music, especially south Florida. peninsula, acts, especially smaller acts, exclude us tours. result get lot bigger (and also expensive) festivals. explanation CVST occurring much higher rate countries, others. Incorrect administration technique? Genetic differences like factor V Leiden? hope EMA health agencies get bottom ASAP. Nope. regular human who's currently equal parts bored opinionated.

Can't speak one. point, disease level low enough matter. fact EU countries cancelling current vaccine THIRTY cases blood clotting side effects need know dangerous virus people 50 one cares think Spain using AstraZeneca people 65...that needs change. Nope. regular human who's currently equal parts bored opinionated.

Can't speak one. Actually, Italy demanding vaccines contracted delivered within Its,y sent Italy. drug companies contracted EU countries less money per diesel countries. So, like good capitalists are, decided fulfill orders later, profitable, contracts, first.

Italy rest EU right thing demanding get doses ordered go elsewhere. think possible cover up, especially countries reporting it. cost $9000 get rid dead body?. Damn priorities fucked country. 

Have ever looked modern casket? cost plot cemetery? cost headstone?

There's also necessary embalming services, preparation, etc. 

I honestly think funeral industry gouging people. They're turning profit, course, unless want morticians live poverty also responsible bodies loved ones, there's whole lot fat trimmed Funnily enough, Woodstock happened Hong Kong Flu. Science known liberal bias. Like history. poor baby Norway caught still early vaccine deployment, people shot. stratification fundamental.

Having given shots 31 million people, stratification longer useful decide there‚Äôs issue, issue is, big is. brazilian dealing worst moment pandemic country far, feels good see world well.

Keep People keep comparing public schools requiring vaccination, comparison seems me. vaccines schools around decades fully approved tested. still EUAs Covid vaccines, even know long immunity lasts studies still ongoing. really think require EUA vaccine participate normal life, especially seeing what's going AZ. possible there's kind genetic predisposition this? Maybe there's incredibly rare genetic disorder exist, hardly exists, United Kingdom somewhat common parts world. first time found genetic disorder unexpected way.

The explanation think would United Kingdom somehow looking side effects, think that's case. information readily available attempts cover ups developed nations pretty much unanimously failed. think there's something unexpected happening here. approximately 50‚Äâ000 adults diagnosed ITP US year. explored temporal relationship 17 cases occurring within 1‚Äê2 weeks vaccination, could extrapolate multiplying 26 52 weeks look rate ITP per year cases totally ‚Äòcoincidental‚Äô. would approximately 39,000 78,000 cases ITP per year far estimated total baseline incidence per year.

It's within normal range could potentially higher. already risk concerning me. conspiracy theorists field day this.... Glad hear it! type side effects Pfizer type deaths, links, I'm trying learn deciding.

Thank It‚Äôs wild. Positively amazing. can‚Äôt describe ridiculously fast numbers falling even open businesses. future US developed world, provided variants don‚Äôt mess up. Enjoy it! 20% true believers. good news they're ones growing numbers. Everyone else seeing friends getting shots becoming remote controlled robots seeing friends posting insane shit getting turned off. good we're going do. comment ticket prices? Comparing vaccines relevant high supply levels multiple different vaccines. Given every major country, aside US, massive supply limitations, stupid use AZ, given still good vaccine. Oop sorry misunderstanding. meant I'm gonna go week! Can't wait Nope, muh freedumbs! still odd 3.3m 50 women vaccinated UK without reported side effect. 

It odd reported segment populations countries getting side effects question becomes data collected wider scale? factors involved? 

Also Az reported blood disorder vaccines also cause it?

The likely issue play also used political point. Woodstock 1999 Im dropping Brazilian tears  government to. made cock-up pretty much every aspect pandemic get vaccines sorted. know voting public focus tremendous job done regarding vaccines omnishambles preceded it. two b0ts, show almost every comment section say exact things.   Decreasing antibody levels might cause issue, second doses elderly people delayed. also curious date people got corona even first dose. infection rations increases 8 week antibody levels start decrease?

""But ONS warned seeing evidence reduction antibodies older people recent data"" Thats interesting stuff, still fact preprint, still accounts less 0.1% taking true (I'll wait till peer reviewed coming conclusions it). 

I see pre-prints time similar get ripped shreds medical community. matter let specialists thing agree disagree something considered fact. 

A similar pre-print knocked Trump pushing Remdesivir solution covid. People kept throwing pre-print around like meant something, completely debunked medical community. might happen honesty numbers cases happening miniscule. people *obeying* restrictions? Biontech developed it, partnered Pfizer trials production etc. People mostly call Pfizer cause ones producing distributing mostly, already household name vaccine. Ah that's scary. Pfizer contacted BioNTech BioNTech started development. It‚Äôs pretty much BioNTech product, supported Pfizer‚Äôs large scale trial distribution capabilities. Why? misinformed memeing? didn‚Äôt change much, back January knew effective first dose was. didn‚Äôt know much asymptomatic transmission either, terms vaccinated people ‚Äî made worry, work hospital acutely sick patients didn‚Äôt want spread covid unknowingly.

My spouse gotten first dose I‚Äôve really changed much isn‚Äôt fully vaccinated yet, lots caution. felt better careful. But, you‚Äôve got good bit protection first dose, point it‚Äôs logically safer participate something may done prior vaccination. It‚Äôs personal choice need/feel comfortable with, imho. bad government officials would rather suck teachers unions trust science. based straight risk calculation. chance people 55 dying covid lower chance getting blood clot dying particular vaccine (if they've calculated incidence correctly). That's put age limit. chance woman dying due pregnancy higher chance birth control causes blood clot dies. ridiculous mischaracterization it‚Äôs hilarious. 

I cannot believe anyone believes single word says. People hate desantis much believe lady clearly repetitively displayed psycho behavior. 

They even gave award lmao Thank reasoned response. seem like it‚Äôs aspiration issue it‚Äôs age group mostly one gender. That‚Äôs true. Maybe experience flu shot arm pain actually lasted week intense. COVID shot arm pain lasted 2 days wasn‚Äôt bad all. isn‚Äôt really comparison making, flu spreads, r clearly 1 else couldn‚Äôt spread. flu season comes end, r falls 1 that‚Äôs way stop spreading. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* something like 72% US population overweight?

I thought way that‚Äôs true percentage overweight obese people US 69% according [this wonder we'll ever get clear picture many people disease actually killed.

One interesting piece information comes Egypt. official death toll due Covid-19 11.000, article Daily News Egypt days ago, Egypt Doctor's association informed 400 doctors died covid. Egypt rate less 1 physician per 2000 residents. doctors died rate others, would mean 800.000 dead Egypt alone. number dead doctors increased steadily, seem like faulty report either.

So number casualties seems 70 80-fold compared official number.

Edit: link Daily Egypt post: think parents may overly worried. kids also live high risk family members. I‚Äôm NC open shots high risk people 65 two weeks ago, families worry kids bringing home. also think school done unusually bad job communicating families upfront safety. dealing first cluster cases right leadership‚Äôs inclination attempt (and fail) cover everything up, doesn‚Äôt help anyone. factors (along worry new variants mean kids) may driving families choose remote. regardless, still think families felt children getting kind education, would overcome misgivings return person. fact choosing remote gives hope feel child well it, least acceptably. hope that‚Äôs case. also think start next year catching kids, whether attended year remote person (because wasn‚Äôt normal year either), that‚Äôs ok - good teachers able meet kids progress there. Let's reframe it: People obesity 20% likely require hospitalization non-obese people. doesn‚Äôt really mean much since 72% Americans overweight I‚Äôve following sub since beginning couple Reddit accounts. didn‚Äôt check sub days, short time, entire attitude sub changed cautious optimism outright denial. fucking frightening. 

I saw thing happen politics sub Trump/Clinton election. Almost overnight, sub became militantly anti-Hillary. 

I‚Äôm conspiracy theorist, wouldn‚Äôt surprised coordinated brigading effort another sub subs. man vasectomy impact health others. vaccinated does. That's difference. public hazard, even personal belief get vaccinated.

When vaccine available everyone (soon) onus get vaccinated, everyone else prove they're vaccinated presence. 

It's literally entire idea behind vaccines I'm little less week post first Pfizer plan ease little bit month April. Cases way down, many people around one doses, I'm low-risk category.

It's you, suppose, I'm ready start seeing friends/family seen months. guy twat Kill 10 people room/// packed 384 person room infected person infects 100% people none vaccinated prior immunity 73.6% adults age 20+ according taskforce secured vaccines deserves praise yes, NHS's contribution logistics rollout, incredibly fluid well organised start. jab yet parents have, said in, jabbed, within 15 minutes, small GP centres getting hundreds patients day.

A lot problems country live 40 different systems 40 different regions, causing backlogs confusion half population idea elligable not. NHS's centralised well run organisational abilities far deserves praise getting. still 99% severe illness? one unlucky nurse giving Pfizer vaccine dose hit vein. bled normal injected shot everything seemed heal. I‚Äôve bruise arm last week. 

Since didn‚Äôt aspirate hit (probably superficial) vein, fine? assume tell aspirate nursing school precisely it‚Äôs probably fine don‚Äôt aspirate hit vein don‚Äôt know. Oh see. Makes sense. degrees fields general thinking younger people stronger immune system old people. Getting vaccine activates immune response, body signaled produce antibodies. Triggering immune response, brings side effects. Generally speaking stronger immune system, response have. younger people getting symptoms.

Someone correct wrong. CDC suffered unprecedented leadership difficulties past years. chaos last admin current leadership making absurd comments like ""impending doom"" (seriously, say leadership position like that), tough tune things said organization. sad, CDC used one flagship gems US.  Well looks like we've come full circle. point, struggle believe CDC following science 100% time bending pressure. I'm unbelievably envious people Texas Florida get go conventions festivals. Massachusetts, PAX East Pride parade, scheduled *June,* cancelled preemptively, even though we're absolutely going far, far past majority adults entire country vaccinated point, hopefully close ninety percent Americans 65. think there's legitimate safety reason justify it.

Why Mayor Walsh okay streets flooded election vaccine even available, outdoor parade everyone made vaccine eligible considered dangerous? Governor Baker treating indoor sporting events something *needs* happen March, convention months away definitely dangerous? restaurants need ensure sit six feet apart, even closed booths, schools safely place students three feet apart?

The inconsistent degrees caution really waned lot faith public health officials. determine safety based politics lobbying groups rather evidence. can't ""trust plan"" people screaming even trust themselves. Dishonesty double standards defining pandemic response makes entire thing difficult confidence in. point thing still truly believe vaccination effort, everything else increasingly feeling like superstition that's used toolbox favors politicians hoping none follows come time reelection. lol sounds like long winded way saying ""gEt mEr CoUnTry!!!#@!@!"" BS. think person understands anything, tbh.

People fly business, see family, attend weddings funerals, etc. someone living diaspora, can't drive across ocean home country. Exceptions must made, antigen, PCR, antibody tests available, scientific reason alternatives vaccine passport exist, especially since vaccines 100% prevention rate anyway. Look curves Israel. 4-6 weeks behind. point May weather warms northeast we've achieved vaccination 50 percent see drop. April rough weeks seeing huge difference. Remember bad first wave New York was? result 20-25% population catching virus. still enough vulnerable people haven‚Äôt vaccinated us see significant impact another wave. probably make milder illness, reason scientists won‚Äôt elaborate. Flu mutates spreads every year still maintain level immunity it. decent amount global population partial immunity covid-19 prior spreading around, due exposure coronaviruses before. vaccine commission expected recommend using AZ vaccine people age 60 time being. investigate whether already got first shot AZ receive BioNTech second shot instead issue recommendation late April. AstraZeneca Terrible, Horrible, Good, Bad month March.

I high confidence vaccine, choice would get (I already got Moderna), man, bad month public relations standpoint. constant drip countries banning it, re-authorizing it, re-banning it, limiting it, etc. 

It's difficult overcome contradicting news cycles without solidifying perspective people's minds vaccines available, AZ's least desirable. vaccines also manually checked affected countries local inspectors:

Here example Denmark: translated: *each batch inspected, including transit papers, temperature logs etc, storage batch papers checked..* Since stopped giving completely (thus infrastructure there) reaction, able get second appointment Astra.

However, one shot Astra two shots Biontech would probably even better. least 22% U.K. 50s vaccinated. I'm getting vaccinated, think defeatist attitude right privacy insane, think rant end making assumption whether I'll get vaccinated like bearing issue also insane. guess want corporate encroachment personal lives, go ahead, hope get use app heart's content. fact, ask Bezos submit blood work BMI free year Amazon Prime lol. WTF talking about? think argument overestimating amount people get covid exposed. Look data prisons. exposed enough, get it. passport. vaccination information already CDC. Hook instead multiple individual places keeping lists, increasing chance leaks. Ya bro first person realized correlation equal causation. think take account. I've heard context international travel, absolutely yes, focus effort getting everyone vaccinated checking vaccine passports every Walmart Also literally since everyone know scrambling vaccines. passing shit everyone know get signed up. Also people businesses still require masks get in. anything it‚Äôs stayed low knew would explosive didn‚Äôt actually try stop it. many people loss life acceptable, since people treating seriously more. actions say accept outcome. except young folks ending hospital. matter people try get right instead impatient refuse admit I'm old enough considered prune juice really, really hope neighbors north get vaccines asap news like brings down.

I hope good news coming U.S. vaccine numbers start offering extra doses Canada really soon. States like New York, Florida, etc. opening vaccines anyone state next week majority vaccinated hope we‚Äôre going point offering extra doses soon. brought issues vaccine passports I‚Äôm concerned. 

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt want get vaccinated?‚Äù

Could possibly want get vaccinated don‚Äôt want put information app show enjoy life? 2022-23 way far away that. need change need now. curious long term effects be. workers discovering home office good , employers making discoveries. may find work home, you‚Äôre competing job people area basically people worldwide. I‚Äôm mostly concerned could drive average wages people living high cost living areas rude awakening competing job people lower cost living accept lower wage without losing purchasing power Thats amazing truly believe seasonality + vaccines make Covid history July Panhandle mixed bag, yesterday vaccines open they're easy get, people take COVID serious started vaccinations going soon. Panhandle also full antimaskers decent chunk already COVID one top spikes. Anecdotally know many anti maskers 1/3 already diagnosed COVID. think we're tail end lets give month could completely wrong (in late November December max hospital capacity high number daily deaths). noticed serious change distancing mask usage, antimaskers antimasker wore still wear them. could see companies like Ticketmaster trying pull off. Even market ultimately decides worth enforcing 99% scenarios, I'd feel lot comfortable literally option first place.

""Digital vaccine passports participate society"" currently Overton window. Even become reality, still sit well me. vaccine output absolutely crushing Europe. isn‚Äôt equal comparison anymore. excluded covid vaccine trials though.... didnt come up

It's rare enough necessarily show trials. Antibodies forming platelets. causes antibodies attach platelets, cause clots. platelets cleaned bloodstream invading virus, don‚Äôt important tasks do. Thank voice reason! Sometimes purpose life serve warning others.

OH GOD. [Dispair.com still agree, read 60% effectiveness B.1.351. 50% pretty good anyway. China numbah ~~wan~~ two? previous months, many headlines hospitals capacity there. crazy know right? sub lol. swear /r/coronavirus could turn record low ‚Äúakshually worst case scenario.‚Äù sub‚Äôs headline ‚Äújust wait two weeks‚Äù. Sorry that's majority believe anything told without knowing damn sure true think assumption idiots Texas might incorrect...so celebration might premature. Huh, everyone know (including myself) felt incredibly sore arm first vaccination. true, opened AZ eligibility birth year think made people 59 58 ran out. It‚Äôs shame 1.5M doses US probably would‚Äôve enough finish lot people age group. Except, places require proof vaccine things like getting hired going school. upheld US law. Hell, entire states require vaccine, according former court ruling.

This actually major overreach government try limit independent businesses. vaccine passport need required, would standardize lot. Instead, people get scramble suitable proof every time required. 18% Warm prune juice open floodgates. roughly 80 years phylogenetic distance COVID closest natural relative

This incorrect statement. closest natural relative **discovered far**. thousands undiscovered coronaviruses nature. Scientists know genomic sequences tiny fraction them. Houston here, got first vaccine shot last week. vaccination site 6 lanes drive thru, done 5,000 vaccinations per day, maybe double that, one location alone. think vaccinations texas huge outpacing covid lot, that's opinion small lens. 559 million shots given still need wait see Marburg capacity 1B per year. 80M month, slightly EU gets anyway. 

EU approach BioNTech ask get doses capacity increase. distributed evenly could mean 15-20M increase per month EU significant IMO. Pretending pandemic isn‚Äôt going make faster. 

New Jersey top 10 US states terms COVID vaccine doses administered. [They still seeing resurgence cases right 

Vaccines *will* end we‚Äôve administered enough, aren‚Äôt point yet.  This. Much instead drone ""we're DOOOOOMED"". destination domestic? *tips tinfoil hat 6 feet also arbitrary though? countries different distances I'd recommend taking step back thinking logically. fall trap comparing scary phrase (remember incoming category 5 Covid hurricane?) actually scientific data. released little information yet ideal society would look like instead ‚Äúvaccine passport‚Äù system basically shut non-vaccinated people society. 

If want give free donut show card, it‚Äôs nothing new I‚Äôm 99.9% sure thing frontline workers last year. 

I think sports teams raffles people get vaccinated certain day stadiums used vaccination points: whether tickets prize pack whatever. Yeah like variants new, vaccine developed what, 6 months ago? almost 20% surveyed epidemiologists expect useless 6 months less. yeah, lets blindly trust scientists. please Herr Kurz, wanna go holiday Alps, cant since Hungary get mostly Sputnik Sinopharm. 50-55 yo women often least pre-menopausal. Yes I‚Äôd shocked weren‚Äôt testing covid. something else countries don‚Äôt enough vaccines create mutations render vaccines useless.

""There N+1 instead N countries enough vaccines!""


That's argument making. makes sense.

There argument risk people get vaccinated worldwide, fuck, no, I'm going ask country send vaccines Brazil Turkey hope give risk people instead biggest pocket-books.

Vaccinate country fully create one fewer country mutations occur. (Obviously, realize virus likely endemic, thousand infections every month different story 60k infections every day) You‚Äôre correct thinking work work quite literally close get magic human race. use age limit, however, remains possible discretion physicians individual risk acceptance careful explanation,"" commission explains. ""Regarding second dose vaccine younger individuals already received first dose Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, Stiko comment end April,"" adds. then, studies evaluated determine whether second vaccination also possible mRNA vaccine.

Kind good news people (like me) already received second dose. Seems like we'll either get second AZ dose risk we'll start new vaccination course mRNA. Personally take second dose, believe AZ. Niiiioooooooccccccccceeeeeee Also forget awesome RECOVERY Trial saved countless lifes. way test that. time cautious work assumption provide protection options table. 10x long-haulers, plenty getting hospitalized. Covid joke. clue, especially UK variant proving infectious. infectious means higher percentage needs vaccinated herd immunity better monitoring system.

The MHRA (the UK regulator) manually checks every single batch vaccine whether pfizer AZ - that's gave emergency licence.

I think EMA manually checking batches. gave standard licence, 790 staff looking whole EU, whereas MHRA 1,200 staff looking 67 million Brits. feel wave impending doom media covering case increases nuanced way. shit's down, down, waaayyyyyyyy downstate! Upstate like Lake Champlain Adirondacks. excluded covid vaccine trials though.... didnt come rush spread news (all bad) getting ridiculous. Bad press vaccine pandemic? looks like science fiction, it? Unreal. Bagholder gods work thread. way ""When given choice, swedes showed proclivity higher risk appetites' neighboring countries"" guy *not* perfectly good argument. impression vaccines 100% effective preventing infection? Anyone else leave ""no"" reading heart started racing? Honestly? can. places need make required. never group budge, places legally require it. Furthermore, reduce effect ""never"" category limiting move public. help prevent spread among still vulnerable(growing evidence vaccine least less effective among organ transplants recipients, example)

There legitimate medical reasons get vaccine. extremely low percentage people people also typically higher risk covid spread is. Give exemptions medical reasons, make super specific really compared fisherman lmaoooo Ah interesting, source 'second half April'? opposed schools, grocery workers, etc.?

4) thought properly dismissed January 2020 

I would certainly say conflict interest Daszak's inclusion investigatory team connections Prof Shi Zhengli.

Personally, cannot conclusively believe leak 100% happened, think evidence gone certainly allude scenario leak possible i.e. history gain-of-function-manipulation, publishing articles sequences RaTG13 virus, 2017 safety concerns potential biohazards. believe circumstantial evidence rather direct evidence, smoking gun speak. 

However think label conspiracy theory suited think intended malice involved leak scenario i.e. China purpose, purposely created virus attack west etc. conspiratorial. would reject notion,
 
From read circumstantial evidence given, appears along line safety laxed gain-of-function manipulation vein H5N1 study testing potential pathways viruses could emerge developing treatments it. leak occurred, much like concerns others WIV safety protocols, cover loss face diversion tactics (claiming came Italy, America &amp; on) shift blame save face .But again, cannot 100% believe fact. source info?

Reddit black anti-vaxers: ""It's okay. good reason skeptical.""

We need recognize vaccine hesitancy comes distrust government malicious fake news. entirely anti-vaxer's fault, still make logical decision. interesting disorder seems mimic Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, [also affects women Speaking which, take full authorization, considering we're planning vaccinating entire USA least accept it, EUA. kind make full authorization moot point? Kinda like keeping software program beta status forever. Fuck anti vax bullshit Whose morals? morals say vaccinate those, need most, first. solution Odds dying COVID 18-49 years old: \~1 2,000

Odds blood clot risk hormonal birth control: \~1 6,000 

Odds blood clot AZ vaccine: 1 100,000 1 1,000,000 

I really understand reasoning here. seems like very, poor risk management. Sorry I‚Äôve seen much misinformation exaggerating bit  exception two cases, reports concerned women ages 20 63. two men 36 57 years old.

This definitely looking like pattern.

As side note, I'm glad Reuters reporting ""blood disorder"", instead using ""blood clot"" misleading lot people thinking (or people purposefully misrepresenting) generic blood clots uncommon.

Good hear. influx vaccines end April, Moderna, J&amp;J Novavax going live end next month. really speed last stretch rollout. Well I‚Äôve put gym membership hold several months ago tired around people wearing masks lifting treadmills. Felt unsafe. 

I‚Äôve put 10 pounds since fall. Better risking life guess. suggest happens millions Germans 55 already received first dose? Without second one immunization complete means travel all, since you‚Äôll classified unvaccinated. panicked response early days governments felt *anything*. Yep. That‚Äôs tell people drive recklessly wearing seatbelt. Otherwise wouldn‚Äôt wear it. Oh wait... flu shot kill flu virus, either. still get vaccine. yet magically get influenza.

Clearly dont get it!  


And yes flu vaccine kill virus body. Thats actually flu vaccine does.  
The flue vaccine exactly kills virus enters body! Thats whats flue shoot does. dont get influenza.  
 True. possible infected received shot. immunocompromised. wait long enough build enough immunity became infected.  get second shot. valid reasons happens. mean vaccine work taking it. 

Sorry need listen fauchi said... said virus still body rest LIFE, antibodies SARS (NOT corona)  


Maybe actually listen people say believe media propaganda! 


Fauchi said clearly would always Corona, Vaccines stop SARS corona.  


Try actually listen interview fauchi, fauchi got right questions.   ""We"" one US, UK, India allow private companies production within region export.

""We"" one allow private companies, vaccine manufacturers fill global production.

If EU meant burden entire worlds production come EU produced amount US amount time? US apparently meant US? I'm sure massive production investment put private companies planned go exactly one customer investment EU meant 150 customers. Well good Im going mark comment like year 3 teacher might. 

Firstly it‚Äôs Fauci. Fauchi. 

‚ÄúThe vaccine don‚Äôt...‚Äù doesn‚Äôt. 

There‚Äôs also full stop ‚Äúvirus‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd‚Äù. 

‚Äúeven got vaccines‚Äù ‚Äúeven get vaccine‚Äù

Well done spelling propaganda correctly. 

Now onto scientific inaccuracies. 

You say vaccines don‚Äôt kill viruses, you‚Äôre mostly right. vaccine isn‚Äôt like antidote poison. It‚Äôs designed mimic virus body responds way would real covid infection. difference vaccine doesn‚Äôt potential cause harm. body done fighting vaccine stores antibodies. cells used ‚Äúkill‚Äù vaccine. future infected real COVID-19, body would means fight quickly effectively it‚Äôs already done vaccine. 

You say it‚Äôs still possible spread covid-19 even you‚Äôre immune. also correct. could spread clothes example infected person sneezes another person accidentally touches virus gets transferred skin. However people country vaccinated immune, infection rate would drops dramatically virus would able infect enough people sustain momentum would stop spreading exponentially like now. Europe actually anti vaxxers maskers. France worried argument. Case law support position. Government much forcibly vaccinate you. Covid shut country cost multiple industries billions. war virus, wartime efforts. need get vaccinated, end reach herd immunity. Even now, 4th surge looms. CDC Director quaking fear ‚Äúimpending doom.‚Äù

I hope tax incentives pop employers mandate employees vaccinate. Multiple courts already ruled employers mandate employees get shot. we‚Äôll ultimately get compliance. It‚Äôs like one understands science, anti body levels go time blueprint stays bone marrow lonnnnng time. get covid body uses blueprint ramp levels anti body large numbers. don‚Äôt get chicken pox twice life. Wish people would read stuff like spreading misinformation What? voted Biden would never ever consider voting Trump. However, objective this. Trump bungled lot pandemic, Operation Warp Speed creation, administering 1 million doses per day end term. Biden ramped administration infrastructure match supply, brokered deal J&amp;J Merck.

The development, acquisition, delivery, administration vaccines bipartisan victory. actually wonder GOP vaccine uptake would rise Biden would give credit Trump. wouldn‚Äôt feel rebellious supporters turn vaccine. Time find waste list take road trip! literally study says vaccine prevents entirely vast majority people. Makes sense. co-workers ready back office. probably moreso others. actually left fully WFH job two weeks pandemic started needed get back office setting. 

That's say work occasional Friday home need work office least 3 4 days week. One answer: get shots. 

Duhh number people particular forum think know CDC think wish virus away absolutely comical. level denial regarding COVID makes even Trump administration look like super aggressive response. Female üôÉ

In seriousness though I‚Äôm honestly worried lmao, I‚Äôd much rather get jab way wait months confirmed nothing worry along Would make sense since vaccines right administered 50 population particularly poor headline calling ""British South African cross-mutation"" suggests recombination, whereas B.1.1.7+E484K already seen small number times UK anyway. municipal workers prioritized vaccines? everyone offered vaccine office see problem. ‚Äúnot actual‚Äù argument? That‚Äôs oddly specific! /r/COVID19 additional 1000 . additional 12.5% americans dying daily Yes. can't stop talking variants much, encourage vaccinations path normalcy, goes wrong small chance due variant, adjust there?  comparing apple oranges. That's probably lifetime risk vs one-time risk. Completely different things. whole:‚ÄúWe supply Republic Ireland vaccines‚Äú publicity stunt? Good know. work hours environment Europe also vastly different us. Nothing good comes happens work sort American workplace. risk dying vaccine higher dying covid age group, worth risk. starting look like still gathering information. 55 risk blood clots seem decrease risk dying covid much higher risk-benefit analysis much clearer. Depends. still want global pharmautical manufacturing take place EU? Ok, source big claim? heard this. vaccine dont kill virus.

True. flu shot kill flu virus, either. still get vaccine. yet magically get still spread even vaccine.

True. possible infected received shot. immunocompromised. 
 wait long enough build enough immunity became infected. get second shot. valid reasons happens. mean vaccine work taking it. live PA. technically qualify 1A (my BMI it) waited two months work home health issues didn‚Äôt decide really wanted shot weeks back. put wait list saw two TV reporters get vaccine document story, figured get one without question, I. Cool. I‚Äôll play medical exemption card too. stress it, likely fine, week pass like nothing think there's nothing worry about. new daily thread? makes think based reply saying it‚Äôs far complex simple yes question? sure you‚Äôd ask another question simplistic situation. 

However, UK export ban AZ exporting due contract UK. It‚Äôs different scenario EU threats regarding blocking vaccine exports UK. male female? vast majority people blood clots females 55. Seems world may want think alternatives AZ. 

I wonder places make AZ switch JJ? Pfizer/Moderna ramped up, somehow? Russian vaccine panning out? hate yet, can't really say that. started vaccine roll started lockdown, could due lock down. opening slowly let's see happens people start mingling different story entirely, family member dies this. work home limit risks I'd rather wait investigated 40 get vaccinated different vaccine available.

It's pretty clear benefits outweigh risks 50+ risk infection high due job/lifestyle. extremely limited amount people gotten vaccine, especially compared UK, clear something going on. 

Give AZ 65+ populations investigations go - group anyway far fully vaccinated continent. Yeah, kind point. Closed border island country (you close air traffic that's mostly it) far away closed border inland country 4 neighbors people simultaneously living/working 2 countries once.

But talk Schengen borders, sadly thing past time many places - even covid hit things started fell apart refugee waves. How? There's absolutely nothing stopping Pfizer Moderna J&amp;J setting factory exporting China US, want to. exported 70m vaccines

""We"". others said, EU exporting , vaccine manufacturers. invested heavily factories expecting use international production centres.

Once over, central manufacturing model also over. chances dying motor vehicle crash 1 103.
OSHA says last year, one death job every 33,000 active workers

Moron. Yes. Someone mass-downvoting thread, I'm say agree you. absurd. average number COVID-19 patients hospitals fell 0.5% 36,000. Hospitalizations fallen 11 weeks nationally, rising 24 states, 18 prior week. largest percentage increases Hawaii, 57%, Michigan 49%. Excellent ensure every country manufacturing ability vaccinate citizens three month period, fuck pharma profits, vaccines developed taxpayers money anyway. country able manufacture multiple vaccines even share vaccines other. able choose got last week.

The right people feel safe protected scary variants may may ever happen deserve priority rights body autonomy, privacy, ability participate society. immunocompromised unable get vaccine reason, wear N95 mask. Kids literally higher risk dying influenza COVID. need infringe upon everyone protect likely could go away cases drop zero.

Do honestly think government would ever willingly give power like that?

Do honestly think cases ever drop thought hypocritical voter ID, would hypocritical voter ID free.

I've never seen ID law proposal cost money? Many states already offer free ID programs low-income people. Meanwhile need present ID get vaccine. since J&amp;J vaccine approved governments actively going homeless communities making sure chance vaccinated. Get back governments start that.

[The government gave free vaccines poor Americans Let's act shocked homeless people refuse get vaccinated based America's shady history, bonus let's make vaccine passports mandatory punish them.

I said many times feel like broken record. support making vaccine readily available everyone wants one. hope lot people want them. never support forcing people get vaccinated punishing don't. That's free country be. Florida Man indeed doom us all.

Seems random predictable way. ultra-healthy over-70 friends reactions either dose beyond sore arm dehydration. parents pretty weather multiple days first dose. Another friend (who mild COVID case months ago) could barely get bed days first dose. got first shot could sleep right arm (which quite sore roughly 3 days). misleading none tested time.

The r number flu lower R1.3, herd immunity 24% (lucky considering take UK 71-75%) - feel better this, know can.

They talking 60% herd immunity Covid - make R2.5, UK variant 70% infectious r4.25 = 76.5% herd immunity. disagree, way verify say true.

Truth people care anymore since type hopeless messaging made people numb taking precautions. take precautions things anyways take precautions? rest us deal consequences decision.

We though. Infectious disease community problem, individual one. need hope live community without lot dumb asses it. Also taking account deliveries US assume, Canadians give country lot shit vaccination drive, actually pretty damn good overall. 2 20? Many?

I dont think representative American public all. experience quite opposite.

We approximately 50% country vaccinated end April. vaccine available approximately 4.5 months many folks even eligible week.

So far, vaccine uptake seems hugely encouraging me. masks capacity restrictions indefinitely protect them? symptoms 

Man...this made think getting sick first time going freaky experience. 

I haven‚Äôt sick year. Probably first time life. kids kids street play always wear masks - really care. all. firmly believe adults care kids. Profits everything...for day. Companies want work DAY even means 5 workers show intervals next month (thus leading overall reduction productivity vs letting Patient Zero stay home 2 days). Short term gains matter long term gains indisputable fact. 100 percent effective. 90something percent effective. news.

Then slowly X starts dumping links closet vax centers zip codes. make fun, mass vax days based bullshit around birthdays 5G inventors (to stick scientists, effers.)

As crazy sounds, convinced way get 20% cuz that‚Äôs originally became 20%, gotta meet level think we've seen lot culture freakouts past weeks.

The competency difference **palpable** certain interested parties really want noted. know 80% efficacy Dose 1 mean ""you're protected 80%"", may not, fact, protected point, know there's wide variation studies numbers, know ambiguity variance efficacy disappears 2nd dose, and...what...you're still willing wait additional 3 weeks??

OK then. attitude taken sub even stupider originally thought. Erm - NHS didn‚Äôt order vaccines vaccine task force did. venture capitalist pharma background charge. also didn‚Äôt use NHS distribution. NHS didn‚Äôt invest research production. NHS responsible administering vaccines done good job claim vaccine process UK NHS success spite government absolute bollocks. may double counting significant number people. Honestly, willing travel, something like 20+ states going open vaccination next week.

Right regional shortage rather total vaccine shortage. areas high demand, others low. Go low demand area, boom.

I couple weeks ago. would say sounds like outdated law, but...

...just look Georgia leadership right now? Yes exactly Maybe deliberate, majority UK doses (according BBC) manufactured UK, currently exported elsewhere. small chance, possibly error difference/error manufacturing process may caused this. 
But small chance, especially strict standards. 30 old. I'd say people look results studies Israel soon, UK US shows reduce transmission.

In way wrong. still get it, small chance, nothing fullproof. far nearly 100% guaranteed result mild symptoms, requiring hospitalization.

The messaging mess whole pandemic. professionals need emphasizing vaccine reduces chance serious medical conditions death part much more. Yeah agreeing you....but wanted kinda reword already said take glory hahaha 

Wall st huh? Nice! another arm done

And another arm done

Another arm gets shot! EU done - ban exports day 1. today's world pay show solidarity. ""We first"" - that's world works.  Lol Wearing mask easiest thing day. Problem even easier wear one lol it. Plus they're vaccinating illegals questions asked.

Why guys think hard? Oh apologies. Well there‚Äôs way tell false positive unless test develop symptoms. you‚Äôre fine quarantining 10 days test you‚Äôre okay. want leave get another test. Antibody test month inform actually you‚Äôre curious.  Spent lot time Brazil mate, I‚Äôm really sorry see situation there. Hope improves soon Nobody really checking eligibility since pretty early pandemic.

Checking eligibility greatly slowing amount shots going arms, scaled even moderate amount, make sense logistics standpoint.

Everyone needed get vaccinated, point vulnerable people been, we're onto mass vaccination huge number states (20+ states everyone 16+ available vaccinated within next week so) matter. They're currently vaccinating illegals. think use have? makes immune response vaccine longer lasting stronger? Seems describe pathogenesis really ""trigger"".

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Last looked breakdown likelihood risk getting long covid thats guessing based anecdotal evidence. new information come out?

Only studies Ive seen quoted long covid referring symptom lasting 2-4 weeks ""long covid."" Id rather lingering cough blood disorder need breakdown ""long covid"" really know do.

Also dont forget, still get covid still unlikely get. 

So evaluating risk of:

a) getting covid

b) serious outcome

c) time takes get different vaccine besides AZ

is greater risk getting bloodclot.

That straightforward answer.  Yes, NZ currently community spread, hardly anyone vaccinated. risk snap lockdown (as happened Auckland February) always lingers, borders looking stay shut quite time. things life 100% safe... explanation think would United Kingdom somehow looking side effects,

The UK, Australia, India, South Korea covering reason? chance. Actually way around. think way: transmissible something is, people need immune order reach herd immunity. Unfortunately, B117 (UK) variant seems transmissible original, increases number people need immune order reach herd immunity. estimates said unlikely reach new, higher number year, part bunch people seem hesitant get vaccine. said, things changed since initial estimates could make us likely reach herd immunity. example, people missing second doses less often thought, vaccines actually effective thought. vaccine provides benefit people get vaccine things happen, could reach herd immunity year, although practice might matter, cases would low regardless. true. look opinions economy based political power: Definitely, that's California highest mask usage rate country Florida mask mandate since September deaths per capita. 

I'm sure history also totally forget fact anyone died within 28 days positive test counted covid death, even clear alternative cause death. I'm sure history also miss part record low numbers deaths heart disease, cancer diabetes despite done nothing reverse course things. Outbreak.Info GISAID data:

Variant Interest

B.1.526	0	not detected people vaccinated period healthcare workers, they? Many affected age group. would say people think there‚Äôs still risk contracting spreading virus you‚Äôre considered ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù? 

Because lot people think that, keep harping online. fear mindset discourage people getting vaccinated. recommendation too. lot people seem passively waiting.

I passively wait. eligible felt vulnerable people vaccinated, searched vaccine. drive quite distance get it, got vaccinated week started looking.

I know people passively waiting weeks 2 weeks. Yes ""we"" that's efficacy measures either. measure relative risk vaccine studies.

Take two vaccine studies: use *same vaccine*, number people age groups levels health, everything. difference Study 1 takes place time low levels infection spread within community. Study 2 takes place time community spread high.

Same vaccine, everything, Study 2 may show different efficacy rate vaccine Study 1.

Why? small numbers infections study group means much larger confidence intervals statistically (larger possibility statistical noise), whereas larger number infections shrink confidence interval.

On top that, original J&amp;J trials take place time variants already spreading, means efficacy numbers comparable trials took place absence variants. thrombocytopenia cases yellow cards (quite alternatives) apparently one died though, difficult see yellow card reports numbers, seems impossible even see numbers belong one person e.g. see problems get reported together major reason pandemic ended people arbitrarily deciding it‚Äôs dropping precautions. Keep playing w fire tho disagree vaccinate 60% children flu, real numbers would probably lot worse we're comparing two diseases are. children spread disease daycares never really closed. Lol. know felt US sub compared Europe US case numbers, hospitalizations, deaths last year. suddenly tables turned, meaningful compare two? get wrong, sucks Europe things turned way wish bad friends EU. let's pretend screwed stage handling pandemic. Putting toothpaste back tube extremely hard yes. 

Don‚Äôt even need go libertarian party see potential issues - it‚Äôs like juiced-up turboboosted data harvesting scheme, since social media optional imperfect data (how many people lie use outdated data points social media) would required law used updated. 

Insurance companies would love data, employers would 100% use hire people, police would 100% abuse ‚Äúprevent crimes‚Äù. Hell, able remotely ‚Äúswitch off‚Äù people‚Äôs passport access another level control police would have. 

Police never abuse power (obviously). 


Employers never discriminate deciding candidates (ugh blip gay bar 3 times last 2 months? Next.) 


Insurance companies data systematically discriminate new level. parents even kids follow guidelines now. live, mask requirements supposed apply everyone age two reality they‚Äôre enforced kids age 12. Like go grocery store there‚Äôs always ton school aged kids without masks. would say less 50% parents actually follow rules.  heart problems &amp; AZ vaccine 3 weeks ago. I‚Äôm fine &amp; people know. Really enough make huge difference, there‚Äôs like 5 degrees difference latitude wouldn‚Äôt explain going Germany. sunlight, higher minority population susceptible vitamin deficiency, population like work healthcare therefore likely received vaccine. No, *you* idea *you* talking Opening vaccine wider groups people faster good metric well state vaccine distribution. many cases states opening early due low demand, vaccinated majority priority groups. seems occurring almost exclusively women 20 55 years old. Could brand contraceptive pill distributed Germany? interesting idea try reach elderly residents able get shots. Taking vaccine *to* would better, course, hopefully come soon supply increases, especially easy handle J&amp;J. mean negative tests, false positives.

If false positive, know it, going regarded asymptomatic person infected. already believe infected, incentive take second test. bittersweet. Holy shit, like shards glass inside body! Okay, bad, plan nothing whole day. pleasant. Operation warp speed fact too. Sit down. Yayyyy! probably least first couple flu seasons see masking prevents getting influenza. Although, I'd run control one season wear mask see difference. essential worker, got fully vaccinated early Feb. agree pandemic over, also agree poster nothing really stopping people living relatively normal pre-2020 routine anymore, even California. seen many bars restaurants adhering 25% limit since opened back January, even county purple tier.

About 2 weeks parents got vaccinated, pretty lived pre-pandemic lives. Eating out, traveling, zoo, sea world, going gym. still vaccinated, would probably avoid dining indoors going theme parks, say vaccinated, it. hospitalizations deaths trial I'm interpreting correctly study basically told us vaccine performed around levels placebo group terms preventing moderate mild infection.

Yes, may true. Moderate mild infection something afraid of. lived moderate mild infections various sources point yet known vaccines fair long run vs variants like B.1.351.

Again, link J&amp;J clinical trials conducted South Africa B.1.351 variant vaccine 85% effective severe disease cases **no matter infectious variant**, **all deaths hospitalizations trial occurred among people got placebo**, point fully understand vaccines wil fully impacted variants, especially newer ones.

We pretty clear data clinical trials, well real world scenarios countries like Israel support claim vaccines prevent hospitalization death current variants covid. repeat, known cases hospitalization death covid among fully vaccinated individuals clinical trials real world millions people vaccinated already, many people countries different dominant variants said would never make absolute irresponsible claim ""the variants major impact USA.""

Maybe rephrase say ""current variants"" since definitely possibility emergence vaccine resistant variant. happens, conversation changes entirely. right now, single variant able kill fully vaccinated individual. even look knew state.
If know IL Chicago politics request going nowhere. realize people die daily flu flu season right? Thats low bar set. concerned getting flu regular flu season, no. That's fact. public knowledge trump said ""Here go states, figure out"". Yes wonder happy potentially throw away sacrifices waiting 14 days. * Activation particular gene genetic constellation prevalent North Germanic (Nordic) gene pool.  Well Trump give states. even fucked up. nothing that. Exactly, perfectly put. can't vaccinate entire human population based deaths thousands completely ignore deaths caused AZ statistically significant. something carefully monitored complications may develop later know. Best analyze early possible. I'm cynical, think ridiculous celebrate administration (any administration, whether R) setting goal obviously going exceeded. Nobody works kind job involves planning would that.

I mean, imagine men/women running assembly line Pfizer done that. CEO calls asks ""how many vaccines going produce next 100 days?"", can't give number 35% expected total claim victory exceed number. Anybody tried pull shit would fired incompetence.

If want celebrate current admin number doses delivered, that's fine, people need drop celebratory ""underpromise/overdeliver"" bullshit. sandbagging, plain simple. Nobody deserves praise setting ridiculously easy goal going exceeded 2.5 times. I've read, safe got symptoms 20 days vaccination. Florida also surrounded ocean, provides breeze, outdoors weather year round. Corona spreads primarily cough vapor clouds linger indoors half hour, determined primary cause infections nationwide. outdoors slight breeze protects massively covid. One epidemiologist Edinburgh University said identifiable outbreak ever occurred anywhere world beach gathering party. Furthermore whatever reason scientists believe covid survives poorly areas high humidity. Photons UV sunny weather natural disinfectants.

I believe Florida's natural geographic advantages helping it, despite older average populace. maybe UK healthcare systems failing recognizing and/or reporting cases (maybe reduce panic cause) complications AZ shots. I'm sure twists turns going forward... it‚Äôs not.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* definitely read turbotax confused Bank auto bailouts well past, case TARP actually made money taxpayers stabilizing economy.

Income tax good thing appreciate benefits paid it.

Not sure point here. got shot #2 Pfizer hours ago... yeah! right though :)

They indicate anything. will, if, right. They‚Äôre thinking media constantly telling cases spiking, 4th wave coming, ‚Äúimpending doom,‚Äù etc. that‚Äôs problem. AGain, said. pandemic California want be. want sit mattress 2024, free well.

But life pretty much normal want, mask many places. immune escape every clinical trials, present Israel. shrinking along strains.

We hope vaccines same, real-world data yet. would definitely take Sputnik Vax asap chance, I'd still prefer pfizer.   Europe‚Äôs gonna get really confused. 
Step 1. Trash AZ vaccine. 
Step 2. Insist it‚Äôs fine
Step 3. Complain AZ deliveries
Step 4. Raid AZ accuse impropriety.
Step 5. Sheepishly admit impropriety.
And Step 6. Go Step 1. small part delivery affect overall EU schedule. Pfizer prioritizing US. Ministry Health shared last coronavirus table March 30, 2021. According table, 37 thousand 303 people diagnosed cases 1376 people diagnosed coronavirus patients (Covid-19). 155 people died. daily number cases, record number reached new normalization.


Because coronavirus Turkey 155 citizens lost lives, 37 thousand 303 cases people reported 376 thousand people coronavirus detected patients.

While 31 thousand 385 people died due coronavirus, number coronavirus cases increased 3 million 277 thousand 880. number people recovering today 19 thousand 925.

According table, total number tests 38 million 338 thousand 45, total number severe patients 2 thousand 54, total number recovered 2 million 995 thousand 33, number tests today 235 thousand 298. Oh thank letting know! Interesting, feel somewhat tired hours injection leg muscle tension like gym leg day, headache. Maybe asymptomatic infection before, long time covid around. 1 case 60k way risky imho! 1.7 million people enough larger size say something going on. whole speeding process testing think countering now... vaccinate enough people, &lt;0.5. know anyone who's ever it.

0.5 means pandemic over, entire public health burden gone. ain't even flu anymore Israel. US restricting Pfizer exporting US plant extra doses Canada receiving European plant fine I‚Äôm cool punishing anti-vaxxers ostracizing society. long time coming. Get bring polio back. saw Chinese study ago seemed indicate (based early research) J&amp;J dose Pfizer dose optimum treatment can't find now. Peak peak that. There‚Äôs nothing ‚ÄúI‚Äù it, get vaccine ffs. I‚Äôve done part, I‚Äôve isolated year I‚Äôve enough this. 

It‚Äôs fair people‚Äôs idiocy taking pandemic seriously laid upon me. I‚Äôve enough reciprocal rhetoric saying it‚Äôs us Americans fault it‚Äôs clearly anti maskers. Lmao previous president also suggested injecting ingesting UV light disinfectants good idea hyped snake oil snake oil. saying would magically vanish last April.

If Trump said sky blue, could forgiven checking heavens. remember it. one people early days bravery speak out. watched documentary explained waited briefing Trump plane heading back big trip India. got back found out, livid. path past decade, openly say it. Actually, one person tried warn people last year... wonder happened him... Thats pretty much feel now. Last night worst I‚Äôve ever felt woke feel 1 million times better processing CDC director‚Äôs speech yesterday?

I personally don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll get bad last year, time, I‚Äôm hesitant completely disregard concerns tbh. different people respond whenever child teenager dies covid? states would impose restrictions? used live swansea ...
It‚Äôs absolute dump tldr statement: important mandate, equally essential voice shared concerns international expert study source SARS-CoV-2 virus significantly delayed lacked access complete, original data samples. thought already bought sputnik Unless EU commit full export ban mean much. We've seen Pfizer-BioNTech exported US past.  take it, I'm 29 I'm going take second.

If vaccine total fiasco, one dose already supoused protect something, going diferent people get Janssen.

Maybe next winter get another variants keep much concern, now, given age, want second dose AZ neither feel like mixing vaccines. Czech republic : 

  best covid  line says all. It'll morph ""34 people got Covid vaccine"" way idiots say ""I got flu shot gave flu."" fully packed restaurants, bars, etc.

Ah yes, fact plague rats idiots means pandemic state. Totally. Bro get bullshit. clearly don‚Äôt understand implications covid infection health mean points testing deciding follow EMA regulations then?

And talking about? 31 many? UK covered numbers luck get bad consequences vaccine? 

Also Canada reported risk blood disorders order 1 100000, way risky vaccine considering choice. restrictions. season starts September. Everyone wants vaccine would chance. want see uptrend, go look evidence problem related specific batches vaccine particular manufacturing sites 

I think one first things EMA investigated. far sure could believe it...

But argument political spin definetely possibility would misdirect anger away EU politicians/policy makers regarding failure timely complete vaccine contracts, supply lines generally invest enough capitale ensure best result.

Straight Trump book ""if look going make look outrageous news here!""

How many news stories seen investigating vaccine ordered/supply lines created/financials invested EU compared AZ Bad/Evil/Slow/Incopmetent/Dangerous.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway saying believe certainly something put past politician anywhere world. Super Bowl allowed certain number vaccinated front line workers. Maybe NBA make sections vaccinated fans. 

With way things going, it‚Äôll team vaccine versus team covid sitting different areas stadium. antivax wear big spiked balls heads. ü§£ EU members paid far Biontech/Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccines UK. So, according reasoning, belong EU. CDC hire public relations. premise comment needs emphasized everywhere. Google, Apple, Visa know things already. Better turn phone use cash! Agreed wonder UK follow suit... hope do! affordable care act makes vaccines free patiants. may cost insurance companies more. costs enough, insurance company say cover different vaccines, Pfizer. think need educate second point. one hand ""official"" sources acting like ""oh feel lil' tired, maybe arm hurt gonna great!"" hand kept hearing personal anecdotes feeling obliterated. Fevers, chills, devastating fatigue. like people sugar coat shit. Makes feel like they're trying best used-car-salesman impression. grimy can't help feel suspicious. 

Just buck tell people truth. Treat people like adults they're likely adults (per experience sometimes managing bunch under-21 year olds).

Anyway, know I've ever tired day second Moderna dose. barely made downstairs recline chair even supposed full night's sleep. make masks clear.   misinterpreted post, say ""they trending down,"" means trend simply rate vaccination have. 

The thing would prevent variant vaccines useless against. almost certainly going happen. think it'll happen even sooner - soon open vaccines everyone. Right we're vaccinating high-risk party, somehow expecting people 20s keep taking pandemic seriously. agree. First Bidens best interest get many vaccines possible. Whatever public stated goal I'm sure private goal thats much higher harder achieve. cynical think hes making goals really care exceeding them, objectively best interest politician get people back normal asap means shots arms. also obviously best interest politician exceed goals looks extra competent mark win. things true.

Separately example exactly think better feeling employee wants hours money. boss goal 40 hours week gives 35 (maybe lets early slow day something). boss goal giving 30 hours asks stay later end 35.

Both results one would end bit annoyed boss would happy get extra hours.

I think cynicism unwarranted especially given obvious best interest get people shots economy fully open take another win. goals public fanfare seriously doubt okay resting laurels getting shots asap.  good news Worried won‚Äôt vaccinate people quickly enough vaccines become pointless virus keep mutating especially countries don‚Äôt get vaccine going stuck like forever? think might see consider J&amp;J shot, single dose seems bit milder/better tolerated side effects wise?

I'm glad hear grandma protected. Take upvote! See downvotes saying perfectly reasonable thing...

I'm pro vaccines, telling everyone RNA vaccines going remembered historical scientifical breakthrough, AZ vaccine controversial since start.

I got mine march 5th MANY doubts, followed ""mass"". there's way I'm going get second injection it...

And I'm 29.

So decission perfectly logical able decide fate health... need jab all... 21. higher chance dying meteor Unfortunately can't see anything changing get rid First Past Post election system. I‚Äôve got hypothetical question - community 1 person got COVID-19 vaccines, 1 person got sick covid, what‚Äôs everyone else? care happens 1 person everyone individually ‚Äúprotected‚Äù? could always wear mask. metaphor doesn‚Äôt work coughing sneezing going anywhere. I‚Äôm thinking 3-4 weeks go cases slowly dip May onwards, maybe earlier vaccine opens general population tri-state Michigan month.  Outbreak.Info

I think you‚Äôre captive mood affiliation - type people past suggested virus escaped accidentally Chinese lab type people disgust viscerally refuse believe second chance right - utterly opposed kind (deplorable) people important open mind coronavirus really spread among humans. 7 day average rises 2.769 million doses reported.

At rate, 41 days half Americans least first shot. Curious feel mask-wearing becoming normalized thing winter/flu season general much data flu cases/deaths sharply declined? 

You wear mask flu season want. ;) Yes, many people voted certain person willing share virus others try protect ourselves. Booooo. sub ran power drunk dictator. Booooo. Said day lifted restrictions. Yes. 143 million doses administered, 93 million people received least one dose vaccine 51 million people fully vaccinated.

93 million 320 million almost 30% that‚Äôs count children infants. count adults 18+, ones danger, realize HUGE amount population vaccinated degree. 

And what‚Äôs it‚Äôs worth. father almost died disease know well damage person family. However, stand ground, get vaccinated, wear mask open up. GOAT Governor!!! great news. means vaccines effective enough get herd immunity low case count safe.

The inverse roughly 10% ineffective rate: someone vaccinated acquire covid infection. So, masks distancing case counts low still makes lot sense. businesses operate tents? business owners would build buildings? UK started vaccinating 50s en masse yet, may well become apparent do. say ""allowing"" like vaccines. exports means definition used finished, financing, technology, paid it, components, raw materials. live state planned economy. 1950s Russia. years benefit strong productive vaccine sector flowing money due international businesses operating there. can't turn around say tell you, ours? 

You ignore export components UK fact AZ also misses substantial deliveries UK. UK significant amount money far earlier EU earlier process across doses vaccines. Much success due paying significant amounts Pfizer. 

You allow nothing, demand everything spreading falsehoods misleading arguments. dichotomy betweeh AstraZeneca ""No vaccination"" tailoring gets vaccine.

I definitely think vaccine going hard sell women 65 stories reported Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria also UK. I‚Äôm same. Pretty sure Boris Johnson stated Novavax already producing anticipation approval. I've exact concern describing read article topic recently, though can't recall publication. Basically, said would scenario Person (vaccinated) exposed Person B (infected) active virus nose, goes sneezes around Person C (unvaccinated).

Not exporting equate export ban. article claim export ban either. Also vaccine manufactured particular country mean it‚Äôs owned country, EU hasn‚Äôt blocked exports, it‚Äôs Pfizer actually done majority exporting UK. Well identified P.1 illinois weeks ago there's that. saw somewhere surveillance study caught 46 P.1 infections went 176 weeks later, spreading fairly quickly.

Yep üò≠ I‚Äôm absolutely thrilled gotten Moderna, second shot *obliterated* like three days, want anecdotal evidence. people come think know pandemic director CDC? Smdh. good news countries signed contracts buy it. means countries (such Australia) have, clear first dibs first batches vaccine.  Nah, rapid ones state free. ones take 3-5 days results free. yea, it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating now. surprised people stop giving fuck year tunnel made longer longer consistently watching light end never get closer. [virtually flu around world. [Australia, New Zealand, South driven brink extinction lockdowns, social distancing mask wearing, one hidden silver linings entire pandemic. 'facing' abyss. abyss.

With abysmal 'leadership'. seriously. pathetic see everyone wishing world would end ...cute attempt moving goalposts, that's still accurate. California's curve mirrors rest country, despite slight variations public health measures. Maybe re-read OP's reply: we've making pizza, regardless regional differences still basically pizza. Maybe could expect different result epidemiologically made souffle, us US range responses relatively narrow. Fauci also pulling acknowledging difference. get he‚Äôs worried population rather one individual don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs mora lead people believing J&amp;J good mRNA vaccines. even get acknowledging difference, you‚Äôll give ammo people who‚Äôre already anti-vaccine they‚Äôre primary targets this. They‚Äôre going get vaccine matter what, give accurate information public actually willing listen. ""stop living 2019 lifestyle"" things way worse, I'm encouraging people slowly go back good things 2019 lifestyle. Nothing black white, gray, postures change accordingly.  People 55 given second dose AstraZeneca vaccine. Canadian authorities said they'll wait studies determine if, which, vaccines given second dose.  vaccinations stagnate people still insist enough? Studies shown antibody response order magnitude (10-15x) worse B.1.351 WA1. said, response good original variant still likely protection offered, seeing Israel - we‚Äôre certainly hoping that‚Äôs case get boosters tested produced! calculations better CDC's. world enough armchair experts.  know poster r conservative would advocate less government involvement. think compatriots demonstrated can't allow mob rule. Incredibly?

Yes doesn‚Äôt doom us it‚Äôs really newsworthy. I‚Äôm confused stating ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt educate unwilling‚Äù translates using force people disagree me. statement fact supportive idea forcibly cause someone‚Äôs views change whether good bad. 

Now believe deplatforming certain circumstances, bullying hate speech way help prevent spread dangerous ideologies protect others. Free speech wonderful thing people immune consequences society implements, protected government. would risk it.

+1

The way fly 737 max, even though I'm sure risk death super super low compared anything. known defect, want risk it.

So, yeah, would risk? waiting year. Waiting months (or even one year) get different vaccine sounds way better playing russian roulette blood clot.

The world getting safer people vaccinated. need hero, get AZ earlier, risk lives. understand, already Covid necessarily confer protection. dedicated avenues priority groups (hospitals risk group only; mass vaccination sites pharmacies anyone get appointment). It‚Äôs really frustrating working office building seeing everyone around get shots because, oh one‚Äôs uncle works hospital, oh one smokes, oh one cough cough asthma, oh one works approved public facing job, etc etc, go work everyday left dry love laughably weak conservative talking points are.

Reporter asks VP Harris would take vaccine donalds suggestion.

VP Harris says no, takes advice doctor.

Conservatives cry sides. 5-7 days I‚Äôd say (weak) evidence Pfizer vaccine effective B.1.351 variant Israeli variants-tracking study, although there's little B.1.351 country overall hard ton confidence that. know people 55 already gotten first dose. Curious see happens - revaccinate different vaccine? Surely won‚Äôt give second dose think could dangerous? Literally almost everyone mask nyc? Stop this. Democrats completely lost way Covid policy. thought (because yes, Democrat) supposed fight rights working people? Lockdowns (and already started to) widen gap rich poor policy last 50 years. people see supporting privileged people wealthy enough work home without issue. Lol. Ironically one worst reactions know people know moderna 80+ year old. Walgreens app killing me!!! Exactly Impending doom utter bullshit, anything it‚Äôs shit we‚Äôve dealt longer. Doom wrong word believe close half adult Americans initiating vaccination - believe lower. PA expected open eligibility May 1, there‚Äôs official date announced yet. That‚Äôs true. makes sense ever hear great J&amp;J even individual patently incorrect. people eating parroting others without understanding actually entails individual.

I‚Äôm conspiracies generally certainly concerted effort prop J&amp;J quell dissenting opinion politicians even journalists. anyone trouble getting vax appt new york state lmk help! always case I‚Äôm aware people seem feel second dose. Yeah, live Montco behind, scheduling people signed late January üò¨ suburbs basically got screwed allocations. state focused rural areas course Philly gets supply feds, FEMA sites etc. people suburbs go middle nowhere get appointment. Georgia allowed lick doorknobs again! US free AFAIK (at least Florida). Well look bright side. mask mandates lifted, keep wearing one, I'll go way avoid talking you. rare double wooosh? Thank awesome explanation. Cleavon Gilman widely known Facebook posts realities NY ER. read lot stuff last summer. recent search seems filled controversy moved AZ help ER tried fire posting bad things state. struggled find anything first google page stance vaccines I‚Äôd shocked anti-vax. blogs could help looking front line perspective bad be/has been.

Longterm powerful message pharmaceutical companies businesses general, cultivating image UK government ever mess about. Agree. Oh, good point. think residents, I'm sure strict they're stand-by line. might try asking Philadelphia subreddit.

If happen Montco, I've heard website works: might similar sites counties. sure said... fact small rural areas receiving way doses use throwing away extras can‚Äôt find anyone give to. *There righteous skepticism know history,"" Harris continued. ""But promise I'm telling vaccine safe, save life lives family community, within power actually that.""*

That said yup.  cut short reply little bit.

so mrna adaption black/grey.

the technology seems allow improved quality accuracy choose.  instead saying candies want chocolate ones coating; currently say want smarties ones.  might also able choose type smartie; possibly color itself. Got it. position based vaccines, lockdown. think might agree then. point shouldn‚Äôt saying things like ‚Äúwe keep resurrections effectively zero deaths‚Äù that‚Äôs unrealistic would mean we‚Äôd restrictions forever. yeah you‚Äôre saying zero Covid deaths effective vaccine, agree you. much hope so.

Australia contract 50 million doses, subject approval, everything I've heard vaccine positive. wish that, like Astra-Zeneca, on-shore manufacturing capacity it. already gave people 60 can‚Äôt go back say it‚Äôs safe always helped. trying preserve limited stock medical workers. isn‚Äôt hard. OP Toronto. gyms, barbers indoor dining since October. Mix full stay home go retail since then.

800$ fine interacting another household (although strongly enforced February). Smart people parents Sorry, bad news gets attention. Wake we‚Äôre doomed again. click link see P.1 Israel.

It believed reduced antibody response P.1 B.1.351 E484k mutation, common variants. anything remotely approaching ""proof,"" fact vaccines appear effective B.1.351 make us confident also effective P.1.

I say ""*appear* effective B.1.351"" possible B.1.351 never got much foothold there, numbers low conceivable noise, signal. (e.g., maybe small B.1.351 outbreak contained via isolation). 

So go far say shows escape vaccine-induced immunity non-issue B.1351, small bit additional evidence hypothesis. Available appointments thing available supply. Available appointment availability determined many people possibly give shots time. say clinic give five shots one takes 15 minutes. given 12 hour day, 240 open appointment slots, even 30 vaccines give out. matters - excuse language - fucking great deal South African (and African), born raised city vaccines finished filled. city B1.151 first discovered well, ironically. 

After reading endless comments developing countries wouldn‚Äôt infrastructure properly manufacture vaccines IP waivers granted, knowledge Aspen offered J&amp;J use facility without conditions SA receive order first, fact Africa people standing back queue relief. We‚Äôre also cautious third wave fact general population SA probably won‚Äôt wait next summer vaccinations become available huge deal. already waiting Pfizer shipment due arrive *February* probably end arriving 20 million doses ordered scheduled June arrival.

The frustration AVAT GAVI existing vaccine supply likely made agreement J&amp;J no-brainer. recently, South African President also chaired AU, goes according plan, provide AVAT GAVI large, reliable supply instead smaller batches bits pieces. 

It also gives organisations greater opportunity investigate countries reporting inaccurate figures nothing all. SA scientists also bulk genomic sequencing Africa already uncovered mutations Tanzania. ability work closely manufacturer, distributor recipient nation help establish scientifically sound plan deal mutations, vaccines notwithstanding, test whether vaccine suitable mutation examine behaviour, ultimately also advise J&amp;J anything within vaccine might lead tweaking, determining whether two-regime suitable circumstances.

There nobody understands B1.351 better group scientists KRISP Durban. genomic sequencing work invaluable Forbes wrote article suggesting US take leaf book. work directly SA DOH determine optimal science-based approach official pandemic response. deserve credit fact we‚Äôre sitting fewer 21k active cases positivity rate (important acknowledging asymptotic people likely tested) low 3% (today) hardly ever higher 5%. last three days, recorded deaths 15 47. 
I‚Äôm obviously going regard numbers absolute gospel truth it‚Äôs decent indication current situation. Whatever measures place caused active cases fall faster countries doling vaccines and, actually living here, seems 121 countries banned SA travellers acted tad hastily. variant evade tests could make us take them. People panic presence yet ignore country best knows behavioural patterns. Banning travel *to* SA vaccinated country would simply make look don‚Äôt trust vaccine. fly interrupting relative calm constant reminder potential third wave (our admittedly extremely cautious) DOH. w/o mask much safer unvaxxed person triple mask.

why plan wear gaiter getting shot, feel like wearing mask all. Oh please. masks helped, nothing, worn doubled? lol people downvoting you. feel like people talking thread people even live here. Every time hear people saying Manhattan really rich people, feel like bunch people across country seen couple youtube videos Manhattan apartments read biased articles. definitely live comfortably middle class income roommate, alone upper middle class income. We‚Äôve put lives hold year. vaccine doesn‚Äôt resolve issue yeah, fuck it. Wow bad naive take government. Possibly. hope not. least chunk people got first AZ dose use shipments give second. Second this! lol people like really reinforce stereotype sub place full people want locked forever. parents went get vaccinated went small town hour away place could find appointment person gave vaccine told got doses first weeks people entire town. solid R part PA lot people don‚Äôt want it. said already called everyone knew give vaccines still receiving could use. Also whenever go check appointment availability many appointments available rural counties appointments suburbs get snapped immediately soon they‚Äôre released. see time true.

Weddings. Baby showers. Hospital birth visitors. personal gatherings 25 people (in state venues even rent law). Religious ceremonies. Conventions. Birthday parties. College classes extracurriculars. endless smaller, yet still meaningful, events decimated virus. things I've listed either HEAVILY modified cancelled due restrictions family's life past year. that's family. many things even personal radar affected, too.

It's ""huge indoor concerts"" never been. restrictions suck minimizing impact ""just huge concerts"" disingenuous. ....you‚Äôre seriously bullshitting right now?
they‚Äôre putting ppl risk. think kind armband symbol might simpler way identify people vaccine. want part society, perhaps show papers card law enforcement designated authorities showing allowed. need follow science this. *Younger 55 Rough time, started nicotine then. vaccinefinder.org tool usually tells explicitly shot stock location. I‚Äôm going get involved probably pointing lack correlation mandates virus levels states without them. Overall statistically significant correlation since nearing end pandemic real world data important theoretical lab data. also danish study nature issue allows proven don‚Äôt protect wearer, gold standard RCT study. heard called know exactly talking find little ironic exposed. I'm sure got I'm advocating permanent restrictions, though. quite leap. goes ways. lied beginning came masks, conceivable someone trust that. People still think closing borders EU simple matter pressing switch, island countries it. Nope, literally can't close borders here. huge number people living one country working other. unified EU actions covid - means can't even fart without mask one country covid exist neighbouring country, 15 minutes away. Also, people relatives across whole EU virus move one country slowly.

People also forget virus comes waves. Israel far vaccinated country numbers coincide end second wave (that much larger longer first autumn). hand, Serbia vaccinated EU country numbers soaring past month. Vaccines not, May situation quiet summer wait next autumn/winter see vaccines really helped cope new strains. available export British locals ?  They‚Äôre expensive...but I‚Äôll look see maybe could pay half. People like change username gender neutral. showed female people consistently critical would default blatantly sexist language like did. Learn. Would think would acceptable policy prescription make midst another surge cases deaths despite reaching acceptable vaccination levels? hardly crying wolf variants. know currently observing uptick cases deaths. expert subject think expert subject, would encourage take step back consider whether capable making policy prescription. case listen experts. I'm sure there's balance make lifting restrictions get acceptable vaccination levels also still managing variants. would analysis made experts restrictions could lifted point given know variants. conversation, I've getting impression think sufficient vaccines available everyone wants one let may come come, find incredibly irresponsible prescription nowhere near qualified make. Source? quick glance turned nothing suggest don‚Äôt. first two. 

For pertussis, whooping cough, wikipedia source blocking transmission well study showing minimum 30% drop, maybe more. least 30% exposed new antibodies detectable viral load. Kinda hard sides one side responsible 500k+ dead civilians. that's already what's we're today. Like said, everyone means drive hour. need still plenty supply rural areas order ensure people live rural areas get vaccinated.

Is evidence places letting significant quantities vaccines go waste? Sure, sometimes it'll happen, part supply states getting getting people's arms. agree. kind feel like priority groups guidelines rather firm mandates. America loves red tape. vaccines still prevent hospitalizations deaths variants. never 0 cases goal. wonder people choosing tune favor sources information. love people keep saying can't stay afraid virus forever ""gotta live life""

I'm best physical &amp; mental shape I've ever in, multiple new hobbies, loving wfh spending time family. people value ""life"" ability consume &amp; served others. narcissism best brain disease destroying world everyone along Underrated comment!!  also uses separate supply chains mRNA viral vector vaccines, avoiding bottlenecks global supply raw materials types vaccine.

Unfortunately not. said struggling supply chains, reason signed deal eu yet. new Tanzania variant? I've following guidelines I'm halfway vaccinated, trust CDC either. They're manipulating language pander dumbest sector population, instead upfront actual situation. know super easily pick sub use invalidate everything I've said. 

Please, pick comment I've made sub. Tell horrible was. They‚Äôre good. It‚Äôs best get whatever shot work. likely need booster point. Comments like others believe slow vaccines irresponsible. 

Must nice living first world problems... could hire couple extra workers actually limitation play lol! say? I‚Äôm hoping wasn‚Äôt anti-vax nonsense. prevent confusion, best one rule now: wear mask regardless Johnson &amp; Johnson trialed South Africa 95% cases trial lineage B1.135, proven efficacy it. Moderna Pfizer work same

The issue AstraZeneca, failed B1.135 seems outlier regard love hearing positive good news. remember year ago around time felt correct. current doses came India. next batch coming week US. also got Pfizer! There's small bruise around injection site, next large, red, swollen bump. wondered older people weaker immune systems reactions might less. Moderna, nothing, shots. know one person headache first shot. know another person fever second shot. I'm older person might impact side effects outcome.  fiery 10 -car pile-up right finish line. They've saying exactly months. idiotic governors lifting mask mandates safety protocols. mention many people believed stupid conspiracy would dissappear election.

The biggest messaging issue see many people think vaccine cure. realize vaccine prevent severe symptoms. mean virus stop spreading people vaccinated can't still spread virus.

In fact Fauci warning high infection rates vaccine administration higher chance mutations resistant vaccine. can't ""aggressive measures"" without economy falling apart, need moving reopening within next months we're world hurt death virus ever achieve.   forgot high efficacy South Africa variant. 

Given AZ vaccine ineffective South Africa variant, indications Pfizer Moderna also much reduced effectiveness, could hugely important autumn. write Novavax US yet.

I also high hopes vaccine providing excellent base potential future pan-variant vaccine, number new proteins added vaccine cover every possible mutation virus.

Oh, also uses separate supply chains mRNA viral vector vaccines, avoiding bottlenecks global supply raw materials types vaccine. explain press conference CDC doctor today said terrified worst yet come? It‚Äôs you‚Äôre bored since laminated something, can't cut lamination off?  vaccines? live GA appointments basically impossible side state. mean even cute cat videos, ""liberals hate cats"" whatever.  Everything venom. Wtf moderna hate thread?

ModeRNA pioneered mRNA - see name?

If choice I‚Äôd choose heartbeat. Plenty happy Pfizer well. work way. Moderna deserves ton respect new tech helping save millions lives covid, countless future threats well.  think conflating people referring Vaccine Passport. strictly talking international travel, think makes sense. 

But lot people referring vaccine passport requiring proof vaccination within US attend public events like concerts, sporting events, potentially restaurants, etc. OP talking about, absolutely agree point onus individual take risk rather keep everything closed limited number reluctant individuals. figurehead. entire Republican fake media establishments fully guilty well. want lie want blame lied them. politicians way are, scientists unpopular. vaccination vast majority people 65+ 2) significantly higher natural immunity.

And yet despite this, cases hospitalizations still rise, people like pretend already over.

Impeding doom like Europe correct tone. know cases work? grow exponentially.

The message keep fucking mask stay home need go out, message vaccinations wrong message. Vaccines FAILING STOP CURRENT SURGE evidenced fact surge going away. Vaccines match stupidity COVID denialism sub elsewhere. agree. second shot waiting get two weeks. realize doesn‚Äôt make 100% immune two weeks up, done bullshit. I‚Äôll get together friends I‚Äôve room year also vaccinated hug, dance, make lost time.

as refuse get vaccinated, that‚Äôs business tough shit vaccine readily available catch it. May odds ever favor.   source this?

I find hard believe carefully planned months ago. aware supply issue second doses would dramatically reduced first doses now, haven't.   So, use blatant sexist language? Walk around Bushwick tell otherwise. live? There's 0% chance Americans putting another lockdown. struggle get people barely follow rules past year. unbelievable there's still much COVID denialism. Cases hospitalizations rising, supply constraints vaccines months.

This sort pretending already exactly causing resurgence, vaccines currently match for. since laminated something, can't cut lamination off? CDC officially stating vaccine efficacy 80% 2 weeks....   
   
[Here that.     
   
In summary:   real-world conditions, mRNA vaccine effectiveness full immunization (‚â•14 days second dose) 90% SARS-CoV-2 infections regardless symptom status; vaccine effectiveness partial immunization (‚â•14 days first dose second dose) 80%.   
    
   
Good stuff! California, state website lists shot administered facility. rush get first possible appointment theoretically choice. since listed, theoretically wait see shot would rather take. know people waiting little get J&amp;J shot feel strongly one done. Problem is, there's ton people never give fucks, tunnel gets longer longer. sooner realize we're connected this, sooner end. Legal Question Pertaining COVID-19 Topic

Is true Pfizer, Moderna Johnson&amp;Johnson complete legal immunity liability something go wrong vaccines long-run?

I read Public Readiness &amp; Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act 2005 would grant immunity 2024. protections liability beyond date?

*Note: asking likelihood vaccine going wrong. understand probability low, based current evidence.

Thanks advance good trend case hospitalization increases week week.  Got second dose today! feel mind control working already! 

Here‚Äôs hoping get past one day. Yeah shit they‚Äôve saying day one. could put packaging tape mine.  Alt-right reactionaries boring, get new memes son. Got second Pfizer dose today! GET GET IT!!! Ah okay. differ point then. find irresponsible. compromises made there's much people endure. grueling year, think gives us carte blanche throw caution wind. entirely possible things fine effectively rolled vaccine return level normalcy case healthcare experts find time lift back restrictions think best course action however may feel consider actions contrary irresponsible. [We wear mask, definitely wear mask protect others. wearing mask already today, please upgrade mask. Whatever mask wearing, upgrade it. double mask go Fair enough! comments discussed throwing people jail. thought little absurd without knowing facts. people spewing misinformation intention purposefully harming others, maybe fine sort civil restitution may warranted still believe combatting idiots facts, logic, information, discussion. doesn‚Äôt work, shame them! Hell, I‚Äôm even ok publicly branding idiots people feel it‚Äôs deserved. 

One reasons internet used work well anonymous, also, people didn‚Äôt believe **everything** read online. grew assuming damn near everyone full crap trying scam me, I‚Äôm saying that‚Äôs healthy either nobody stole lunchmoney, nobody convinced believe bullshit. pointing direction, yes, gives hope. curiosity, weren‚Äôt rush before? voting restrictions! corona restrictions? much Fingers crossed translates real world protection practice! surprised us opening vaccine everyone soon, us expect that. cake day. upvote.  This.

Also, happy cake day! :) I‚Äôm really sure hill trying die here. Initially saying listen experts ‚Äúthey lied‚Äù imply agree masks work - experts shouting rooftops since last April. Sounds like agree experts even though purportedly said shouldn‚Äôt listen them. Yeah, we've also seem testing recently robust cross-reactive t-cell response. 

Remember, antibodies first line defense. T-cells matter, too. 

(The recent TWIV interviewed guy study; podcast contains great explanation difference antibody t-cell function immune defense). can't talk whether emerged lab without branded conspiracy nuts? Ya it‚Äôs health anxiety thing. Took Xanax influenza vaccine last years fine okay, go hide underground bunker. ppl LIVES get back to. Good advice got: keep moving arm got shot! help arm pain Round 8,9,10 anyone? I‚Äôm making fun scripted remarks. I‚Äôm making fun blatant lying ‚Äúoff script.‚Äù Ah yes, UC got without even applying. anti-vaxxers belief system ethos? could find (as medical person) reason pour money energy cause.  Yup, agree. Someone told brilliant fields actually make worst teachers, everything come easily them, know break learners. chemistry teacher like high school exactly - brilliant man, would talk board assume got said. think also plays role well ""smart"" people explain concepts way acceptable easily understood. think gonna convince people get annual shots cases fear pandemic gone. could've eliminated flu long time ago everyone got vaccinated couple seasons, too, are. 

The hope therapeutic drugs help us get decade virus evolves common cold. Yep! happens we‚Äôre back lockdowns wait new vaccine.   um, they? deliberately claiming masks unnecessary, fact claimed sake medical workers prevent shortage...well, that's lie. Hear, ye fools! Harken mighty oracle, brings tidings doom! ""OH GOOD TIME OPEN EVERYTHING!"" - People still get covid works. afternoon first pfizer shot got hardcore sleepies - like wake 10pm sitting upright couch drooling shirt last 4 hours tired.

The second shot start getting myalgias various muscle groups torso within hour, feeling like pulled muscles side diaphragm. early fever bad enough shivering, sucked combo muscle pain. trouble getting bed walking around following day. injection arm felt like got hit foul ball mild headache off, though manageable NSAIDs. Generally better 48 hours, fully good go 72.

31m underlying health issues immune system apparently goes fucking war knows look for. Classic ""but children"" meme.

Kids going fine. They'll probably deal shit believe killed grandma though. wear glasses fog time even pinching nose thingy tight. it? specifically referring poster posted previously getting shot. happen while. 4-6 weeks, anyway. kinda expect CDC director paranoid. random, chances mutation non-infectious think that's interesting, maybe useful interesting nonetheless.  Ok, wear it, there‚Äôs reason drama queen temporary piece paper. life 2020/2021. didn‚Äôt choose it. We're fucked terms vaccine rollout now. proven safe nobody take IMO. 

That leaves us Pfzier Moderna last checked high demand probably blocked EU. 

Enjoy getting vaccinated 2023. shot arm. Biden hires corona atrocious, one even worst one people without young kids, pandemic essentially whenever get vaccine. people young kids, get keep eating dick case rates lower. Words cannot describe much worse pandemic people children lol. everyone lucky.

Canada here, hoping first shot July, delays continue lucky get one year.

Goverment also 16 weeks jabs, buzzin' single jab even two recommended. Honestly guess folks already fall wave  Almost everyone? 25%+ 'never' get vaccination?

We got deadly variants + people wanting vaccinations + rising rates.

And say month?!? Let's make interesting.... Paging people covid subs downvoated hell every time suggested covid vaccines would reduce transmission. Apparently intramuscular vaccines don‚Äôt reduce transmission respiratory infections according them. now?! pandemic strategy whole thing. Harken, fools, oracle brings us tidings dooooom! Doom tell ya! style. Lol you‚Äôre delusional. Wow Title alone...if news, given millions doses U.S.? Probably nothing ... couple months vaccinations become widely available USA ... plus another month vaccine get full effect. USA probably close normal July so, take couple years become widely available worldwide. There's small chance virus mutate two years become suckier resistant vaccines.  female age group

There's lots economically rational reasons person rent. people can't figure get mortgage. large matter 30 40% also protected vaccinated additionally would suspect many already immunity natural infection least period time remember early publicity spike but, post, heard exactly important. think making people feel comfortable, proof definitely case, why.

No, willfully ignorant people find masks annoying. hate wearing always make sure wear one good seal, under-the-nose BS. looking forward day anymore. already 4 variants **do** spread faster current vaccines **aren't** effective them.

Do /u/HendersonDaRainKing trust liars? temporary? take get vaccinated now? 

The vaccines going stop surge they're rolled fast enough counter relaxation denialism people.

If everyone vaccinated tomorrow, surge would stop. Instead we're 27%.

The OP comment net 20 upvotes. vaccine prevent entirely. lessens severity symptoms. realizes even team/player tests positive Final Four, NCAA probably cancel game. far much money line. true, really don‚Äôt get many people EU complaining about. Many EU countries target giving everyone first dose end June second dose July August. seems supply actually better EU UK coming months. Minn poorest state richer 2/3rds continent. Surprised getting many downvotes. gut reaction too. Im we're going 55 everyone. family Iceland? question they‚Äôre going continue strict overall infection rates Europe/UK/US hopefully go summer. get stressing it, since nothing I‚Äôd try to. lot health care workers 1 AZ dose, I‚Äôm sure authorities going come kind plan people.  could used outer shots AZ found effective enough....at least choice manufacturers booster shots. Asking administer vaccines keep accurate records slowing us down? really think distribution without record-keeping, without tracking data, would efficient long run?

You‚Äôre trying establish somehow well-coordinated distribution reasonable goals way bad. assume making rather strained effort political loyalty, sad display true. Source? articles want scared that's get clicks. also proxy political agendas. following corona news closely must noticed huge spike variant panic started vaccine rollouts began. 

The vaccine producers testing products known variants far none compromised vaccine. Countries ahead vaccine rollout per-capita like Israel also reporting single instance variant compromising vaccine. think still first doses June July per government's target.

If get beginning June... would still result think.

Ideal timing would early April... first doses slow second doses could finished first doses much much earlier (I.e May). 

But somehow get enough novovax finish first doses end June would best hope for. kind message need, thank you! different allowing older people disabled ppl go first. POC higher risk. Found Destiny players do..to extent haha Perhaps unclear, apologize. mean ask uninfected people spread virus; would make sense. I'm asking whether studies exist people vaccinated spread virus, presumption being, course, despite vaccination, may hosting virus making sick. words, carriers sick. well-known phenomenon types diseases. live Europe, third world country like US. People need understand SIP policies form social distancing, necessarily effective. reason rushing buy vaccine fully manufactured UK.....and eu demonised UK. Good citizens countries UK put first orders. whole vaccine palava showing bad eu good UK is. Personally think people refuse vaccinated put curfew. Exactly. Dumb people think government put something vaccines lying misguided. Democrat Republican, politicians want economy strong. reason would lie vaccine. want people buying things, finding work, offices, businesses, restaurants open. things stimulate economy. opposite SIP orders lack social distancing, stop acting like that's case? Social distancing come variety different forms, limited making people stay home. Supply already outstrip demand US whole.

LOL. want messaging terrible, they're acting vaccines daily administration rate 3 million average.

The message indeed terrible. They're focused 100% vaccines reopening, instead focused lockdowns Vaccines supplied fast enough, lockdowns needed stop cases exponentially rising. Well... it‚Äôs not? pisses ‚Äúfriends‚Äù 60‚Äôs rabbit hole w/Fox Q. take vaccine ‚Äúfree riders‚Äù ‚Äîthat call Pharma industry. benefit population immunity takes spreading dangerous disinformation DNA changed, Bill Gate chips 5G.

Well, tomorrow morning every adult aged 30 eligible vaccine. That‚Äôs big deal. I‚Äôll looking appointment tomorrow.  7 days post shot one me. Go, immunity, go! UK use vaccines produced locally opposed EU Canada using vaccines produced EU, possible explanation. honestly beyond clue. Cases undetected definitely possiblity, specific type blood clot near impossible miss. count monthly cases countries one hand, rare. guy maths  data shows growing infection rate? flat infection rate, although number low close false positive rate PCR tests. trend line 65+ vaccinations? number 65+ vaccinations plateauing?

I‚Äôll second shot. travel internationally lot work, don‚Äôt want take chances mixed signals governor vaccination sites. won‚Äôt sign book, I‚Äôll call media sit site someone sign it. 

As using enter businesses, personally care business knows I‚Äôm vaccinated. Everyone right them, I‚Äôm mind getting vaccine, won‚Äôt care people know. don‚Äôt know every single human, may wrong. Roughly 1/3 country covid. 1/3 vaccinated. There‚Äôs probably lap doubt it‚Äôs huge. We‚Äôre vaccinating almost 5% per week. Roughly 20% population ineligible. Another 20% refuses take it. 

Were getting close getting far go without vaccinating small kids.  Though describing Polish people... completely disagree this. problem demographic time 25 40 year old age group. keeping disease alive going weather gets better restrictions relaxed. 

The vulnerable, notably elderly, gotten vaccine now. Period.

We need open up. need start knocking social demographics potentially transmitting virus. We've saved sick elderly, let's block vector transmission. entire process never ""orderly fire exit"". means everybody, seriously, get vaccine. smoker now. it. dire map article based data last july... July 2020 shut downs full sail obese strange. January technically obese. that's muscle mass. fall obese numbers take much. that's substitute! bought thing we've whole time, places bad relax compliance, become hotspot, say, ""Oh no, time clamp again"", spreads somewhere else relaxed, whack mole continues. way vaccination. think underestimate preparedness many African nations place pandemic. I'm saying numbers underreported, [many contributed lower expected counts Sub-Saharan Africa.

In case, nearly half population actively resisting measures curb spread, surprise US disproportionate number cases deaths compared countries took adequate measures, [such many countries whatever actual numbers are, main point one can't say ""the US 4% chance producing variants 4% population"" mutation occurs infected populace, uninfected, we're talking roll percentile dice here, country with, say, 10% world population curbed spread expectedly less chance producing variants country 4% world population hasn't. upfront honest it, issue contract law reflect that. Arizona live, basically 0% rate mask wearing anywhere posted requirement sign. posted requirement.... maybe 50%. 70k cases day 1k deaths. Imagine lack fucks given 2-3 months way less that. wonder already happening? Initially vaccines allocated state population. recently I've seen governors complaining get proper share. Assuming that's true, could well showing demand getting areas moving slowly. they're longer distributing per population must formula use. NFL play moving goalpost next season too. Makes challenging. common Hopkins determined *better* outcomes expected higher population density urban areas younger populations better access healthcare. New York's failures *despite* advantages. main goal reduction hospitalization death. shots mention wonderfully, time, it‚Äôs hard assume could happen. key reduction death hospitalization that‚Äôs vaccines focused doing. Potentially, get past pandemic phase covid, better vaccination available booster longer lasting immunity protect variants may encounter, including reduced asymptomatic case rate decreased transmission.

It‚Äôs safe say J J AZ curb transmission degree, though, efficacy ‚Äî sure logic would apply AZ SA variant, it‚Äôs far less effective it. Many skeptical Wet Market theory . one months ago.

""Did Coronavirus Escape Lab""  Well boat sinking filling water managed bail half water out, would stop? Keep bailing get much water reach shore. guess misunderstood word ""vaccine"" meant. thought preventative well.. changed minds easter lockdown next day. misleading? Like literally case ... post needs lot attention. ooh, sick burn! Yep. ""IMPENDING DOOM"", we're certainly acting like it. 

We've made vaccination sign-up process incredibly difficult (visit 100 different web-sites hit refresh hope random number generator favor!).

We've put many different tiers (we tier 1.c.3.6.b!) looks like legal document something comprehensible.

We public health officials hysterical logical.

Absolute mess. want people hold weeks way explicit it. Biden saying MAYBE SMALL gatherings JULY, 3 whole months now. Really feel like Michigan canary cole mine rest country. Restrictions let right UK Variant emerging COVID exploded here. much ""impending doom."" I'm still convinced sudden mutation would lead complete even large scale evasion mRNA vaccines, comment two since they're ones I've read about. things fantastically well made induce wide range antibodies could imagine mutated virus able escape impact would different might even able infect humans anymore.

I understand concern variants recognize possibility, way treated inevitable time bomb absolutely ridiculous. messaging lately, media even CDC, vaccines hardly make difference since **will** variant makes useless **will** need get another vaccine fixes inadequacies current ones. world meant encourage successful vaccination effort? reasoning arguably ridiculous consequences absolutely dangerous. study 4,000 health-care personnel, police, firefighters essential workers, Centers Disease Control Prevention found vaccines reduced risk infection 80 percent one shot. Protection increased 90 percent following second dose.

Since people risk actually dying?  primary endpoint phase 3 trials symptomatic disease (it's listed trial protocols): studying prevention asymptomatic infection/transmission, although always suspected likely. Happily, research carried CDC (corroborated similar studies UK elsewhere) confirms vaccines indeed great preventing getting infected/spreading virus others first place well preventing getting sick. think hybrid model likely, also companies might also willing accommodate fully remote trusted workers preference. goal open country 14th June. Thought well known.  definitively saying otherwise? seems like absolute shit show.  definitely skipping it!

Hi, many vaccinated here? brand vaccines get? I'm still thinking getting vaccine. country provides astrazeneca &amp; sinovac out... here

looking mroe reputable subs subject matter Huh. governor?

[Georgia GOP governor quarantine COVID-19 used AZ. crazy around since sudden opening everyone, *really* doubting I'd get appointments anytime soon. read LOT people luck 5am. Happened stay past night til figured ""wth, might well look"". also gunning specifically Pfizer since I'm planning traveling it'd responsible to. Managed get myself, mum decent locations Walgreens. require separate accounts though sucks. 

what kinda helped find whole 5am thing going city's subreddit, finding vaccination subreddit state well see everyone doing/recommending. finding best times place, leg work. Luckily isnt much.

Edit: like dot 5am checked. Kept eye filled 50 minutes locations. original vaccine trials studied symptomatic infection, several recent studies post deployment verified asymptomatic spread also nearly effectively halted (90% vs 95%).

I think covid done lot harbor mistrust citizens public health official advice mostly good slightly alarmist borderline paranoid times. Maybe, true European countries suspend use AZ vaccine again? Family 20+, issues. Everybody family wants vaccine now, year different lack masks. know someone early 30s exact thing. Remotely answers phone hours dentist's office two hours away claimed work medical field. two months ago. same, BMI 33, making obese made qualified state. second guessing getting mind, knew people needed (I sense gotten doses).

Made livid. 

My mom fighting cancer 4 years, got line front her.

Absolutely livid. Austin too. mean pretty much everywhere, cities like Austin Denver definitely highly impacted. Besides polling showing anti-vax much, much larger problem right left? important remember address left, even close scale. remember hearing young adults getting severe flu-like sickness late 2019 testing negative flu. Europe facing resurgence population vaccinated. Half elderly Americans fully vaccinated. We're getting close point half adult Americans initiated vaccination. negate surge, solve anything, bother vaccines? bother anything?

Why given American care wearing mask, distancing, getting vaccinated, anything they're going spend next year told enough? we're told nothing matters, believe anything does?  ""the shots 94% 95% efficacious protecting people getting sick COVID-19. studies didn‚Äôt show whether vaccinated people also protected getting infected virus first place.""

... I'm sorry.. What? vaccine supposed do? Thanks sharing link case study. idea language (‚ÄúAdenovirus binds platelets cause platelet preactivation.‚Äù) study explains aren‚Äôt seeing similar issue CVST mRNA vaccines? state opened vaccines 30+ morning unexpectedly (they previously announced would open everyone 16+ Wednesday 40+ opened last week). able snag appointments Wednesday!! I'm excited. around customers time work many regular customers never wore masks throughout whole thing. get vaccine either, least I'll lot safer now. article:

*...the vaccine works well preventing severe outcomes death older populations 55, particularly 70, risk blood clots appear present age groups.* see fully open states like Florida Texas living pretty much normally packed events minimal masks lowest current levels virus nation think lockdowns restrictions necessary even making much difference all? spiking states currently lockdown states like NY, PA, Michigan, etc 

Cause ya know.. governors hiding real numbers. Scott Steiner  r/germany Yes tendency get hyperbolic type. Nobody said 3 years basement necessary. referring ridiculous stay home orders issued year ago. always pointless far I'm concerned. 

But covid-19 much different? statement bullshit? exact figures hand, know fact deadliest disease human history, whether percentage raw death toll. 

Yes, I'm great typing reddit exaggerating bit effect ONE COMMENT. that, think I've unclear. Using one comment beginning think knew meant gone long enough. It‚Äôs bloody time. closed restaurants bars months ago Slightly higher protection Pfizer, interestingly. ""In people older 70 years, data shows symptomatic infections decline three weeks one dose either vaccine. Since January, protection symptomatic cases four weeks first dose Pfizer's vaccine ranged 57% 61%. protection increased slightly people received AstraZeneca's vaccine 60% 73%."" Failure bureaucracy. Congrats! true,but lets see works want post username r/unexpectedoffice  what's explanation this? give different age groups? vaccines somehow different batch? UK cases somehow undetected? one hand, multiple national medical agencies recommended precautionary stop based data country, hand, fairly large country like UK vaccinating full speed. saying that. correctly pointing enough protection avoid transmission growth. R0 America currently greater 1 deaths leveling 1,000 per day.

The lockdowns major surges may unwarranted, far woods. black white. Germany's cases went lockdown around Christmas. new mutation spread lockdown restrictions partly lifted, back rising cases. say lockdown effect decrease cases Germany flat lie. know one? heard reliable. Second shot Saturday??? Go dinner COVID January one shot Pfizer, immunity similar someone who‚Äôs shots? so, probably even protected normal vaccinated person second shot? evade vaccines yet.

Anyhow proven someone caught covid walmart (as case counts go contact tracing becomes effective possibility), proven Walmart somehow negligent (perhaps unevenly applying mask policy something), that's potential wrongful death suit could actually go trial, even Walmart prevailed, would expensive defend.

Today first day I'm eligible places get appt can't even find one. 

I'm ready go, jab let's move on. It‚Äôs one thing personally vaccine hesitant based you‚Äôve marginalized medical system. It‚Äôs another thing actively try campaign vaccines‚Äîwhich picture show. It‚Äôs easier encourage vaccine hesitant person deprogram rabid anti-vaxxer. Yes! think going accept people lie, cheat, still vaccinate majority people matter much.

It's going companies people beyond international travel, highly doubt many companies bother. would federal law books, one allows regulatory agency make rule.

Good news spend hours phones able get wife second shot another walgreens. trolling me? Lol. Direct quotes article
That suggest even cases go (which want clarify believe bad) doesn‚Äôt look like heading towards impending doom :

""We begin re-think COVID case data interpreted,"" said Dr. John Brownstein, chief innovation officer Boston Children's Hospital ABC News contributor. ""With rapid dissemination vaccines, increases cases among healthy populations necessarily translate hospitalizations deaths previously seen pandemic.""

‚ÄúHowever, experts say many at-risk Americans dosed, potential wave may lethal significant previous ones.‚Äù

""With large proportion vulnerable individuals vaccinated, fourth wave cases may translate fourth wave deaths,"" Baker said.

Even fourth wave ""likely,"" Sehgal said, ""I think anywhere near magnitude wave like saw winter holidays, deadly.""


""I encouraged rate vaccination -- even optimistic moments expect we'd averaging nearly 2.5 million doses per day, protecting vulnerable means fewer new cases result hospitalizations deaths compared earlier surges,"" Sehgal said. Wow. Angry much? I'm guessing one great lake republicans hate ""the libz"" UK based company manufacturing America, make uk. Errr wont reach Europe? Tenth Amendment, says powers give Federal Government remain states Also get efficacy getting third/fourth/fifth shot. I'm getting vaccine couple weeks already thinking get third ""booster"" shot September case.

I got vaccine literal middle nowhere didn‚Äôt even tell stay 15 min us walk around single street town 15 minutes lol. Still super sore arm that‚Äôs matters AZ wired situation. see business employees customers massless (which granted able now) major retail businesses still mask mandate up. say North Phoenix better compliance Tempe Mesa. would useful two weeks ago states started opening up.

I‚Äôm returned thoughts pandemic began‚Äî mild cases? Worth antibody test least. Smartest decision UK could made Brexit, especially losing EMA.  Also, Oxford/AZ final regulatory approval use Brazil (as well Pfizer/BioNTech, vast majority vaccines Sinovac, EUA) I'm trolling you.

Now waiting game one one countries reach high enough vaccination thresholds everything start plummeting centralized system appointment sign ups, sent doses populous counties mass vax sites set areas probably would gotten point ago.

All this. centralized system could enabled state understand exactly need far queue were. could getting better timelines next phases would start. Instead, we're watching 65+ population like need 100% done announce move 1B appointments going unused middle state. People many lists know sign up, means none vaccine providers actually know many people left get through.

Case point: managed get husband Rite-Aid appointment yesterday. morning got notification mass vaccination site telling turn sign up. Obviously need spot, held 48 hours waiting **not** sign go list again. i'm going guess mean anything said literally trolling. world did. US Like week. days everyone baking bread gathering extra supplies staying almost feeling sleepover something, wore extremely quickly. Sometime early April 2020. article 6 specifically says federal law trumps state law unless found Constitution, Laws United States shall made Pursuance thereof; Treaties made, shall made, Authority United States, shall supreme Law Land; Judges every State shall bound thereby, thing Constitution Laws State Contrary got first Saturday past, arm, armpit neck pretty sniff/sore within 6 hours, hoping #2 doesn‚Äôt hit hard. need ink need scanner read 'barcode' skin constitution specifically word word says federal government final say.

This isn‚Äôt true. constitution gives wide latitude states says feds legislate specific set enumerated areas.

In practice, Supreme Court vastly expanded interpretation specific enumerated powers, federal government indeed supreme power lot areas. that‚Äôs certainly black white text Constitution. Please cite whatever article you‚Äôre referring to. IME many people (of pretty much every age political background) pent due pandemic see vaccine ticket going fun things rather stopping pandemic. FOMO/jealousy aspect human nature real pain :( I‚Äôm part trial - got email week ago begin ‚Äúcrossing over‚Äù (giving everyone originally got placebo real vaccine vice versa, continue monitoring us immunity) weeks, believe means blinded Phase 3 Trial done.  AU collaborate J&amp;J although act distributor first 30 million doses vaccine produced - likely done time next month - reserved (having purchased by) South Africa.

All doses finished filled Aspen Pharmacare SA. agreement presently 300m doses facility said wants function 24/7. appear started manufacturing doses ink even dried final contract last night.

Given willingness capacity function day night, room double initial number. discussing contract back November last year, SA assumed most, all, finished doses would exported EU. Aspen facility approved FDA, EMA major health product authorities, final product easily exported countries orders J&amp;J vaccine.

A personal benefit joint venture vaccine couldn‚Äôt imagine receiving end year beginning next may well available summer. parents likely vaccinated within next months.

Africans often accept standing back queue. announcement - first time heard foreign company explicitly put country continent first - almost tearjerker üòÇ  federal government‚Äôs authority limited powers laid constitution. Per tenth amendment, ""The powers delegated United States Constitution, prohibited States, reserved States respectively, people."" absolutely final say every time. Often times federal government use financial incentives states follow lead. Like states used different drinking ages Congress tied highway funds. Right?? way spread fear misinformation something already fraught distrust I‚Äôm scientist doctor, advice remember there‚Äôs pretty large amount viruses existed long covid could causing situation. Someone said michigan highest rate increase. michigan mask mandate believe. 

So factors may play understand dangers virus. one debating that. referring ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù. 

Here another article shares similar sentiment line seeing play nations little farther along vaccination journey US (Israel). impact public trust vaccines fragile say least Like three days like Somf3f00l also likely Covid 2019, tail end December. Ended hospital 26th hit truck. could tell tests acute respiratory infection lead pneumonia. known coronavirus, strep, influenza. sounds like dream. Thank you.

She‚Äôs either worst scientist time she‚Äôs 200% fear mongering.

How could possibly suggest would see Winter/Last Summer surges based uptick? How? difference last summer vaccine. could possibly see surge equal comparison 40% country least 1 shot? Yep, 7-8 days I've found CDC still provides updates past ""grey zone"" chart. Nothing amazingly huge, often another 5-ish percent. We'll 1A everyone gets vaccinated.  keep adding people ü§£ Completely dishonest take.

First, Brazil 6th largest country world, course going deaths. thought learned last year need compare deaths *per capita* meaningful.

Second, current 7-day moving average deaths per capita 2/3 UK 2 months ago Spain year ago. Recall Brazil southern hemisphere moving fall. see similar effect last year deaths running strong winter Northern hemisphere saw dramatic takes money increase production capacity. countries spend money.  friend got first dose 2 weeks ago Covid back Jul-Aug last year. symptoms, mild headache fatigue day two, back normal. Typically second infection milder (though always).
There variants E484K mutations people vaccinated probably get much 25 percent time. far looks like vaccines available US prevent symptomatic infection even variants people.

The people refuse vaccine going ones getting sick. so? parents need make arrangements childcare stay remote learning. Also, there's desire give graduating seniors going elementary middle school person interaction school year. Lots kids mental breakdowns too. No, don‚Äôt contact trace, doesn‚Äôt take genius realize may risky without. it‚Äôs 82% second dose four weeks later. means 12 dose schedule Australia using (and effectively) it‚Äôs likely higher daily reminder Merkel, along rest German government go fuck terrible handling situation.
‚ÄúTwo weeks lockdown save Christmas‚Äù... Never even thought share laundry room apartment... Crazy. uou getting downvoted USA exists... don‚Äôt understand downvoted, absolutely right.
The government response since lockdown started November beyond catastrophic. done nothing besides ‚Äúurge patience‚Äù keep clinging useless metric Yes, politicians ‚Äòunliking‚Äô scientific advice early on, upset economic-centric world view, exactly got mess. When? reach herd immunity?  evidence someone infected one variant made ill new variant? would assume enough homology variants antibodies still able recognize. This. completely disingenuous AZ even news orgs say/report rate blood clots lower general population. ""general"" blood clots; specific/rare type blood clot condition blood clots found conjunction low platelets. rate found AZ patients (within 1-14 days injection) 12x standard background population rate. parents need make arrangements childcare stay remote learning. Also, there's desire give graduating seniors going elementary middle school person interaction school year. Lots kids mental breakdowns too. Uh... Wat? Well firstly lot evidence man made secondly even evidence point coming animal who's say conditioned exist wait, get - lab.

Don't personally know sure pathetic assume body CCP capable incompetent enough happen. headline really bad time dyslexic brain kick in. Sorry, bad news gets attention

90% news sub currently good news. :) Maybe concentrate bad miss good news (vaccination progressing faster faster). I‚Äôd say close 100% Novavax approved EU also ordered. 

There weird comments coming certain politicians, current block producers vaccines meet delivery commitments use EU produced vaccines fulfill commitments elsewhere. Germany, Netherlands Belgium many EU countries also confirmed blanket ban exporting vaccines completely table. *and wearing masks presume*

Definitely data collected anywhere near me. Half nurses bars social exposure nearly group know exception construction. Nice see us picking up, though news Astra ideal, granted still used 60+ thats good Wtf? Microsoft already announced workers going back office. Kinda hard argue second largest tech company world don‚Äôt ya think? Great explanation came back really traumatic evacuation abroad, really never honeymoon period, wanted life, one consolation home, back ASAP still do. can‚Äôt wait get mRna shot regrow thinning hair. worth looking side argument. business wants stay open people want customers, local government tells can't operate. make interesting time court. Well past observations show plateaus trend cases leads another spike, scientists worried spikes stop happening. Right much better chance escaping large spike case numbers due pretty large factor didn‚Äôt before. understand still worried. mom actually called today found one Friday. Pfizer is! Glad found one too! Good know! know formal approval coming. It'll interesting see companies go handling requiring vaccine. true, always refuse get vaccine. hope reach herd immunity without them. Philadelphia Rest State operating entirely independently other. state decent job Philly still total disaster.

Vaccines allocated administered separately Philly. suppose could try driving outside city assuming proof residency issue. could also drive New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland case. mean Friday!!! information time.

We STILL info whether second dose makes immunity last longer. Every empire falls. Usually they're ignorant prideful. Someone's always waiting pick scraps. asking unreasonable people reasonable. nature. can't reasonably vaccinate people immunocompromised. That's exactly herd immunity. Novavax horizon blatantly false thing think I‚Äôve ever seen. constitution specifically word word says federal government final say. say states something, they‚Äôll barring Supreme Court saying otherwise. Oh! think I‚Äôm person world couldn‚Äôt get office. I‚Äôm debating statement. I‚Äôm countering logic. record take virus seriously. Havent little year. 187,299 doses administered Canada! 

Yesterday, Canada Vaccinated 0.478% population. equivalent US vaccinating 1.58 million day. highest Monday report record represents roughly 28% increase administration last week.¬†

15.2% Canadian¬†*adults*¬†(18+) least one dose.

12.18% Canadians one dose.

Good luck. Hopefully get soon. I've heard vaccine readily available west side state, maybe say that. far know findings first ready 9.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  one job.  Shes problem. It‚Äôs media adding bit seasoning spin statements gets everyone worked up. say real. reaction disease gone way far. last year lockdowns never happened. Everyone forced hide basement three years safe. Well, thanks sharing way. Public communication bad Philly right listening closely rumors anecdotes. appreciate sharing experience. yea philly definitely underperforming makes feel better, pa state currently #1 country far doses administered per day per capita goes. last week, pa vaccinating average 1.28% population per day, comparison, texas 0.69%, florida 0.72%, ohio 0.88%. might pa slow start yall vaccinating lot people every day run every vaccination site 24x7 situation delicate? 
Yes miracle science incredible outlandish statements don‚Äôt inspire confidence. Wish media would ask questions put PR pieces. We'll know soon. CDC publishes date-administered data well date-reported data, date-administered data often finalized bit week later. seeing beginning rise

How know, see future Ah OK, guess people dinner make sure serve well done meat! Company received 300M‚Ç¨ investment German government May 2020 know said, sure trying debate statement 29 million doses AstraZeneca found Italy produced Netherlands AstraZeneca never applied certification European Medical Agency production facility Netherlands instead export UK. Sneaky seems like work. exports UK AstraZeneca doses Europe anymore. Rightfully may add since numbers UK already quite low per fine article less need additional vaccination there. He‚Äôs going ride right presidency, isn‚Äôt he?

I think lot people going surprised majority country view Florida covid success see failure. lot ppl talk virus. Bc don‚Äôt take seriously doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt take virus seriously. 

I‚Äôm talking virus right now. obviously don‚Äôt take seriously. mean don‚Äôt take virus seriously ?  South west Germany Whatever happened data circulating Italy September 2019 based upon examination blood samples? 11:59pm

Doctor: keep fighting! believe you.

Patient: *gasping noises*

12:00am

Doctor: Awesome. We're done folks. went department anti vaxxers work (im person even partially vaccinated) desperately scrambling schedule appointments one new employees almost died covid called warn (he vaccination got sick.) It‚Äôs wild seems brushed aside favor endless coverage Walensky‚Äôs silly performance today. Yes, yes continue pretend saying something different also saying ignore doctors. comments damn near copy/pasted one another. county, numbers reflect national averages, timeline true.

Initial rollout healthcare workers 70+. yes, pretty much done. Ages 65-70 became eligible March 1, *just now* getting second shots, weeks receive them. still group know even gotten first shot appointments still booked solid.

Preexisting conditions became eligible one week ago March 22, none one shot, still weeks even first, plus month get second.

We still couple months away elderly preexisting conditions fully vaccinated. making optimistic timeline match reality. Get one pfizer one Moderna daily thread reminds Facebook disinformation groups  eating steak medium rare going give people around fatal illness. Monday, state reported 2,144 adults hospitalized coronavirus, 53% jump week earlier 1,404 hospitalizations. four weeks Whitmer announced ""Pause Save Lives"" Nov. 15, largest percentage increase COVID-19 hospitalizations week Monday Monday 45%.

Their 7day average cases went 1000 5000 weeks ""The change comes following reports Europe rare instances blood clots immunized patients ‚Äî¬†notably among younger women.

But 300,000 shots have¬†been administered Canada¬†already, with¬†no reports blood clots here, officials said."" vaccines certainly exist. abundance them, though, outside united states israel. know canada's deals vaccine manufacturers. appalled AZ's lack clarity broken promises that. i've already said, went cautious stop analyze data make sure safe started use again, certain urgency kick pandemic ass, speak, UK's current situation goes show AZ works. analysis made european regulator 25 cases 20 million vaccinations. still warrants analysis, doubt it, ain't got shit ton pfizer's back pocket.. can't stop. Boo! Based timing access vaccines there‚Äôs higher chance AZ BioNTech, Group 6 would fall under. weird, 19 year old cafe worker Philly got first shot two weeks ago, coworkers. also know tons people age even jobs able get past weeks. pretty surprised hear complaints PA here. Ig Philly different plan rest PA said nobody takes seriously, talking virus, means take seriously.

Are really going pretend said? Depends location. open anyone 16 older am. Biden said earlier today 3 weeks open adults. Like even come you‚Äôre met opposition feel? It‚Äôs like beating dead horse.  get along psychiatrists wife works better does. :) They're totally tech people human body. nerd similar stuff. Sure, league decides require vaccine. like league requires physical get one.

We're really talking sports leagues ones looking adopt vaccine passport system though. using example many things require kind health compliance. wondering vaccines used UK? UK long history opting kinds EU programmes.

We part Schengen, eurozone country, opted EU's 'area freedom, security justice', (among things) meant obligation reallocate refugees EU's resettlement programme, etc. stuck opt-outs matter much criticised team player.

Even referendum never happened past five years gone entirely differently, there's *way* would joined EU's vaccine procurement programme. Government procurement drugs vaccines national scale mass implementation public health programmes **speciality**.  luck registering [clinic Ford I‚Äôm side state considered driving there. mean, I‚Äôm trusting science, science says over. Vaccines reduce infection 80% one shot phizer moderna. eldery risk able vaccinated now. It‚Äôs time open interesting study politeness showed NYC actually among polite action, dead last words.

we give shirt backs, curse :). also checked New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston, Miami, others. manually look can't easily check again. find major cities far outperforming Philly. 

San Francisco definitely leading pack, Philly trailing outlier San Francisco leading outlier. facility Toronto produces flu vaccines, currently used COVID-related vaccine manufacturing. 

This year flu vaccine shortage imagine factory change anything. already needed. Noone realise anyone issue vaccine uneducated idiot see AZ bad! would totally take chance personally. Give meeeeeee! Dammit  virus real never said didn‚Äôt take virus seriously believe wasn‚Äôt real. think CDC needs change messaging want ppl cautious. Fear mongering isn‚Äôt working. think comparing seat belts mask disingenuous completely false equivalency. Seatbelts save life given day. point mask I'm wearing going pointless day quickly approaching jumps quickly first two weeks next two weeks. others told you, simply ran people. 
As today 64% population vaccinated recovered. 
26% population children 16 covid. 
So 10% left vaccinate, they're probably hesitant antivax.  
The ""problematic"" Ultraorthodox Arabs, groups 16% population still get vaccine, rest population 5.4% left vaccinate. groups high infection rates probably many COVID take test, 16% figure probably true. Honestly, vaccine passport going convince people emotional outcries bureaucrat. 

People may see personal risk, getting shot means won‚Äôt hassled masks distancing grab beer? Hell yes they‚Äôll vaccinate  Whatever happens Super Bowl spread others ""waiting 2 weeks"" well holiday spread? post literally showing it‚Äôs still fine come often seen thread related Chile near top. Chile 55% population partially vaccinated cases still going fast. people think can't happen elsewhere? Every thread US UK. course. smart wait data early days shows 10x increase. come lab, situated right beside wet-market, CCP go great lengths cover up? great isn‚Äôt everyone also wearing masks social distancing? Would no
masks shared air? freshwater ice would heat 0C melting. saltwater ice could tuned anywhere \~-25C 0C depending ideal temperature drug. stay temperature fully melted. TX, weeks declared everybody 16+ could get it, smaller counties already giving vaccinations adults wanted appointment. grandmother went way get many folks workplace (truck yard) vaccinated, included warehouse guys young 26. Every dose helps. mean since wouldn‚Äôt count fully vaccinated wouldn‚Äôt able get vaccine passport able travel. Maybe us know follow basic rules civilized society stopped caring *you* people think. Ever consider that? doesn't. Millions doses administered UK India shown work. Stop stupidity once. 45¬∞ slippery slope covered oil, bottom hill Chinese social credit scores. 

Here's better question, need it? need punish unvaccinated people everyone wants vaccine able get one? for? protect unvaccinated people want protected first place? protect vaccinated people need protected first place? people implementing power-hungry?

If we're dumb enough normalize presenting digital vaccine passports participate society, there's going back that.

And lastly can't restate enough: finding disgustingly hypocritical people think requiring ID vote human rights violation also think requiring vaccine passport participate society perfectly fine. love vaccines... Maybe mine days Folding Home project say thanks Canadian government federal level badly screwed procurement process vaccines they‚Äôre desperate anything Oh, Kemp involved? Might well put public vote, mysteriously pass 99%.  barely see cops wearing masks they‚Äôre supposed enforcing. would law name only. ignorance?

Yes, pathetic way would drive economy ground mask entire lives. 

If way, we'd done pandemic early last year would living lives like normal. ignorant folks extending pandemic longer, wreaking havoc economy struggles cope repeated bad decisions make. ignorance lockdown lovers astounding. lack fundamental understanding economies function. 

Amazing. ignorant folks understanding economics whatsoever. people like extending hurt. pathetic ability grasp even basic concepts epidemiology relate safely reopening thriving economy rather piecemeal crap that's going go years end due ignorance. see things one prism unfortunately.

Says ignorant individual wants extend memory United States July whether want believe not.

Not current rate, be. lectures somebody else.

Somebody educate little ignorant pricks. Better give someone use it.

FTFY. something 

The goal simply ""do something""? media love run fear-mongoring. Here's idea. shut fuck coulds people encouraged actually take vaccine. incredible quickly sub changed. tired pandemic finish line quite yet. completely reasonable public health official express concern. number died astounding give anyone pause. They're jobs, trying encourage everyone help us finish strong fatalities possible! asking lockdowns, wear mask till jab! 

Insane people got upset officials said covid big deal officials saying big deal, people get upset. Look guys post history. He's foxnews over-outraged poster.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   eyes scanned headline missed important third word. Nearly aneurysm. think (i.e. lockdowns, restrictions, masks, etc.) going 2 months, gonna surprised. Especially live CA NYC. actually wrong. Keep coward.  lmao Assuming alternative people legitimate medical problem keeping getting vaccinated problem them?  Gotta watch Chinese shills sub now.. getting blatant. need serious mental help No, people talk US exporting vaccines diplomatic purposes, referring confirmed orders US government negotiated paid for. 300 million AstraZeneca doses plus 100 million Novavax doses order likely entirely unnecessary here.

Canada's orders, plentiful manufacturers, separate - although many likely manufactured USA. rate US rollout occurred, likely couple weeks production mRNA vaccines alone entirely vaccinate Canada month two US orders delivered - point two countries likely collaborate send unneeded doses countries worldwide. years out, revolution medical field.

Multiple cancers likely going cured this, along ton amazing things.

mRNA amazing. variants concern appear infectious deadly, population *isn‚Äôt vaccinated yet.* lot us can‚Äôt get rn matter much want it.

You go bankrupt hospital expenses country ‚Äúleft‚Äù party‚Äôs president reneged giving people $2000 citizens almost every industrialized country getting monthly checks. 

The idea Americans soft spot downtrodden absolutely exploded attitudes toward downtrodden minorities - specifically, African-Americans suffering disproportionate police violence undocumented immigrants packed like sardines border under, guessed it, ‚Äúleft‚Äù party‚Äôs president.

Haven‚Äôt experts said actual infections like 8 x actual confirmed? would put us like 240mil it? top vaccination? Yes. Great. Acknowledged. whole rest statement tho people ignoring entirely exaggeration.

 


To explanation worded way saying whole important actual wording used.

 


But fuck guess jumping bandwagon hyperfocusing two words. knew dealing took proper precautions. Nice would imagine federal mandate would override forces states completely open vaccinations everyone regardless current plan Professional Ben Franklin Impersonators Association pushed out. become infected, proportion hospitalized, placed ICU, intubated?

What proportion 'long covid'?

I understand none died. It'll interesting see recent opening vaccines under-65 influence trajectory. Young people, mostly interact w/ young people, chance get vaccinate. could see turn back vaccines become available regardless age. 
 
They also takes 4 6weeks full effectiveness...so delay. 
 
The numbers Israel, vaccinated half population, quite promising.....  vaccines prevent hospitalizations death extent. varies depending variant. think aim 0 cases feasible mean take precautions variants major impact. irresponsible claim making. Yet mention laying staff, knowing want come back lockdown over. Looking around people sub, people life, *hissing* notion things getting worse, genuinely terrified free fall lot people going go when/if lose progress COVID due variants rushing reopen.

There *so little* stopping becoming 5-year problem, 1-year problem, people can't mentally cope that. ""Be gay, crime, eat hot chip"" sucks! Keep trying though. know people Montco gotten appointments. also mass vaccination sites New Jersey could sign for. That's point shed masks totally rescind restrictions save schools (at least kids vaccinated) anti-vaxxers want take asses hands point? Also odd see 3ft guidance CDC director ""scared."" wonder purchase tests. What?

Yuuuup. last week really made look around realize truly, *truly*, fucked. It‚Äôs also uneven logic part groups like CDC. kids seriously risk highly doubt would‚Äôve cut schools 3ft even sending back Unfortunately keeping mask properly fitted elementary school students bound problematic.

AZ / Pfizer/ Moderna tested original coronavirus UK/South African Variants. even vaccination lot people going get sick. Hopefully stocking PPE huge numbers metropolitan cities nationwide.

There much reason expect P1 better vaccine resistance B.1.351. There's reason expect *less* vaccine resistant B.1.351 - neutralizing antibodies [bind better P1 know B.1.351 is... vaccine resistant. J&amp;J study, efficacy \~72% regular COVID \~64% B.1.351. fun wrong everything. 

Take bet Well I'll step up, sniffles slight limp early 2019, probably anyone else WAY cool. I'm pretty sure COVID also habit twisting ankle stepping curb see. US big country. 

NY NJ cases still high trending due infectious variants even people getting vaccinated. problem people wearing masks They're ahead states comes administering doses, there's less incentive open things lower priority groups. NHS England vaccinated 5.3 million 55. know exactly many given AZ vs BioNTech let's assume half half. know 5 cases registered far UK. Given incidence rate CVST 2 5 per million per year 5 cases 3 months still seems higher expected. mean, nothing else feels *fair* keep shit everybody wants shot access it. Haha, good question. think lasted 6 weeks me.

I really took advantage weather went walks/runs, caught relatives/friends zoom. six weeks, realized depressing stuck one bedroom apartment, started ease precautions taking. Oh yeah got decent amount muscle BMI start less great tool. still restrictions Georgia?  Don‚Äôt walk fema sites? dad got one Miami way. variants major impact USA

Back work, back school...back lockdown. never really learn history. really. Even leave, UK would still free they're now. Cameron classic Eurosceptic - liked single market etc. sceptical EU's expanding powers. would exactly brand new ground EU would hesitant about. That's say signed (he Osborne famous penny pinchers all), think fair say uncertainty. Yep, whenever go treatment, wear N95 mask. luckily half dozen real old-school 3M N95 masks remodeling project couple years ago appointments every 8 weeks. reuse masks since covid survive 8 weeks, I've use around 3 far. AZ either stands Arizona AstraZeneca. :-) got doctors note, got lucky getting appointment Publix first shot. point restrictions cause harm virus though rapidly approaching point people vaccinated.  know PA NY, idea Michigan ""lockdown"" state laughable. live none measures strictly consistently enforced throughout pandemic. They're less nonexistent now. Whatever peaks valleys we've head entirely driven much fuck everyone chose give given moment whatever still unknown environmental social factors drive spread. Schools distance learning longer places, expect big factor. evidence evades vaccination (although acknowledge vaccine theoretically offers ""less"" protection). suggesting Americans freaking about? evidence mRNA vaccines can't take care new variants either current form potentially booster.  would say told currently hospitalizations covid less flu previous years? take precautions that, too? hi guys , quick question , 1st dose astrazeneca shot prevent hospitilization?

my parents took 15 days ago , want socialize understandable , i've kinda forcing go guilt tripping , i'm really trying prevent going , understand mentally hard

is safe? body build considerably amount immunity now?

thanks! Ahh ok, thought talking dying covid seems talking dying general. don‚Äôt believe anybody says ‚Äúmasks social distancing won‚Äôt last forever‚Äù we‚Äôre going continue find reason keep every time last reason proven incorrect. Even emergency phase pandemic, there‚Äôs 0% chance relax precautions.  thick sarcasm.  one answer question honestly, want to.  Reading sub lot seems like lot people actually want numbers good wrong. angry, no. Yes former, latter. normally reply posts like this, ""Wait? What?"" entire comment history bashing vaccine. paid what? Shocking!!  really depends energy levels sore are. Yeah, UK variant propagating since *at least* September. estimates, likely accounts least half new Covid infections. remember hearing frequency last month. here, yet keep coming back. Even convince one person get vaccine, that‚Äôs win me. I'm curious see curve looks like! Maybe archive 65+ data somewhere? tried looking post history stopped haha. God. I‚Äôm sick ‚Äúwhat variants?‚Äùquestion.

There evidence suggest variant, future variant, mutate something completely negate vaccine‚Äôs ability keep people hospital. 

‚ÄúOh, well *could* mutate something bypasses *all* vaccine protection‚Äù

Yeah, next influenza variant could also turn us velociraptors. there‚Äôs evidence case, expected outcome..? Oh yes, things depending are. Remember ton militias, one busted planning coup governor last year. Congrats, exciting news!! Yup, got it. 

We'll see comes UK, friends getting vaccines getting AZ (all 50) must rolling greater rate population concern now. mean, could avoided messaging clear based science beginning. previous president called pandemic ""a hoax"" long time, fought masks, encouraged mass gatherings rallies, pushed unproven drugs (Hydroxychloroquine yada yada), thought injecting disinfectant shoving sunlight butt good idea. Would blame general population trusting person? mean, least, freaking coherent messaging campaign something important pandemic claimed 400K lives watch. means Canada able fully vaccinate roughly 70% adult population end June. think end, countries like EU countries Canada much behind U.K. US, even large gap moment. Yes, thousand times yes! Normalize mask wearing public ill immunocompromised. advocating mandates (once crisis over), become cultural norm mask public protect others illness. think shes hospital completely sure. Underpromising overdelivering sound policy building confidence. definitely radical departure baseless promises like ""it Easter"". properly tested mean could potentially go get Ultrasound bombarded kill Covid get positive test? would applicable words. guess field expertise. Go tell Rosa Parks sit back bus get out. private company. Yeah don‚Äôt get she‚Äôs suddenly reluctant. I‚Äôve tried send links studies showing it‚Äôs safe, even sent animated video demonstration vaccine works it‚Äôs injected it‚Äôs safe she‚Äôs still adamantly getting vaccinated. way many people like making assumptions effects vaccine don‚Äôt know prove otherwise. 

The hesitancy likely first mRNA vaccine that's mass produced widely distributed remember correctly. Add fact released ""emergency use"" go full battery testing. words, ""we'll give (half) dead COVID-19 virus"" vaccine people accustomed to. 

So far everything looking positive, someone reactions vaccines past, understand skepticism. He's already said going to. Unless dies declines rapidly (totally possible) anticipate he'll run again. Despite take Tories' bullshit last decade underfunding, NHS still absolute fucking powerhouse dedicated professionals given pandemic. 1% payrise fucking joke, needs 15% minimum plus bonuses them. talking about. Look figure 7.c nurses educated enough giving real health advice. personally would trust medical professionals opinions order: Doctor (MD DO) Mid-level(PA NP), Nurses(RN, maybe LPN CNA). I've hearing recurring reports AstraZeneca vaccine causing blood clots, I'm getting mixed messages internet regards severity impact side effect. someone comment AstraZeneca vaccine triggers blood clots speculation anti-vaxxers media? I'll likely take Moderna Pfizer vaccine available they're matured results. Texas. Lol Yup, annoy karens.  sick flu exposed flu, stay home protect others. Also, get flu shot, rarely get flu.

Colds extremely unlikely kill someone. However, again, cold, stay home.

See works? 

Also, car analogy makes sense entertained. Yes, mistrust vaccine due politicized, everyone thread seems working hard ignore actually politicized it. Anecdotally, thing happened significant side effects, goes different school know her. question anybody would kindly answer. 

My laws traveling New York months asking need quarantine vaccinated. anybody know? 

Looking CDC website don‚Äôt see anything saying contrary I‚Äôm assuming still need everything expected everyone else. Thanks! hope people choose wear mask sick. makes much sense really make difference. issues though, Scotland took 19 emails 12 phone calls, finally getting MSP involved, resolve issue taken ""vulnerable patients"" list despite part one priority groups. headache next day chills. make sure eat good breakfast drink plenty water. Also, maybe take ibuprofen something hours get it. honestly, bad! half population antibodies, ten percentage immunized, means almost half population contacted virus. clubs open? *asking friend... great news, follow-on question SA variant variants E484K mutation. get spread UK variant Israel vaccine strong impact? Yeah missed point comment going get removed mean let‚Äôs honest, previous president re-election, would disaster according many Reddit.

We go information historical performance. previous president oversaw unmitigated spread virus, partly driven mixed messaging critical measures. saying performance great controlling pandemic pre-vaccines? surprised Reddit thinks vaccine distribution would similar? seems logical me. someone trouble hearing relies lip reading aid hearing, sure hell hope not.  tell people dont need masks anymore wont vaccine hesitancy, still pisses even vaccinated im legally obligated wear it. majority going (youth) vaccinated cases increasing like across board nationwide now. R0 number 1 would probably good thing too. CDC update first dose shots:

1,028,284 first dose shots. Last week 1,158,079

7 day rolling avg 1,730,507. 1,749,049 yesterday. 

95.69m adults first doses - 37.1% (up 36.7%)

73.1% 65+ done (up 72.8%)

At rate, first dose shots:

**Adult population numbers**

End of:

60% 5/29

69.420% 6/16 extrapolate stratified sample. N95 masks help many allergic people. Crying EU stuff think important actually normal. 

Usa UK went beyond EU basically bare minimum that's vaccines. 

Just nationalize pharma company already lol. age doubt Biden even runs second term. significant misrepresentation happening. claim uproar potential vaccine safety based president time absurd. talking matter President Trump ""pushing FDA speed approval"". fact, FDA already worked scientists streamline rules find way get vaccines approved much faster ever before. 
 
The president administration [openly working override scientific effort get vaccine approved election day. people time stated would trust approvals. *entirely reasonable* doubt scientific results scientists openly ignored. end, FDA stuck science-guided rules talk trusting vaccine mostly went away.  
 
TL;DR; 
The potential mistrust vaccine due president, specific actions president attempted take. conveniently ignored laboratory testing. P.1 B1.135, shown substantially less resistant post vaccination sera. study apply

Boosters irrelevant purposes conversation. Every vaccine boosted I‚Äôm expert coronavirus vaccine contracts, would stand reason would de facto deprioritized took time negotiate, whereas countries bought stated price soon offered. Entertainment venues almost definitely should. Huge mass gathering sites means necessity. Going concert sporting event important risk health others it. 

Things like grocery stores weird one barred getting basic necessities, think makes sense level, return mask mandates much longer. 50:50 split AZ Pfizer. get ""ended forever 3 months"" ""always""?

An emergency measure prevent mass death overwhelming heathcare system exactly currently used. Without we'd probably back 1,000 deaths day within weeks. Canada significantly less supply US. nut? agreeing disagreeing. Genuinely curious u/nonstop158, may ask family's side effects were? get mine tomorrow trying prep bad might be. I'm curious 1 shot protect almost 100% hospitalizations 2 weeks, much like J&amp;J (altho efficacy lower others good regard). point? /u/kobeng13, may ask side effects were? get mine tomorrow trying prep bad might be. great grandfather passed result Hong Kong flu, Grandmother still clearly hurts whenever thinks anything year. Norway Germany (as well many EU countries) gave AZ vaccine people 65, 65+ age group got Pfizer Moderna. good negotiators signed contract gave vaccines I‚Äôm loving wearing mask outside ridiculous pollen. People don‚Äôt look (that) weird once. Maybe public lot people certainly around friends family vaccinated. reasonable trust free political influence president literally telling twitter approve prior election. 

The civil servants give political pressure, got see results studies it, reasonable become comfortable vaccine got data, people gotten problems, etc. Pretty much every metric says way life unsustainable.      
How look climate data last 100 years think ""yes, fine"". Nah. point sucks.

Do remember phone made EU? EU 6610? indestructible. Anyone else notice cdc covid death tracker change data past couple weeks? know specific numbers 7 day average hanging around 1000 deaths/day past week two, says 7 day average 1000 since March 18. Anyone know what's up? Oh know, know. offered people choice less calls, people would problems. 

And symptoms got worse, maybe would helped.. yeh annoyed better dead. Managers freaking everyone becoming aware little work schedule many virtual meetings, scheduled 2 hours last 30 minutes there's nothing say. earnest question. positivity rate less 1% portion would expect false positive? significant portion children quarantined never sick, social costs program might outweigh benefits. Yeah I'm confortable that, one shot AstraZeneca seem way lower % protection Janssen, young population seems going given Janssen, I'm confortable protection one dose. also protects employees prison, well, considered front line workers. private business wants say ""We refuse business unless follow rules"" suddenly Republicans find unacceptable? change China uncooperative appears actively concealing evidence could link COVID-19 outbreak Wuhan research labs? Yeah, everyone already that. I'm sorry break you.  Yeah, missed point.  Teachers unions. Grocery store workers don‚Äôt.  really. private pharma companies. EU hasnt nationalized them, yet. 

EU played ""we wanna pay"" card got outplayed countries understand value innovation. quote you, ""brutal"" surge.

Why decided use **SCARY DOOMY** adjective? ""brutal surge"", instead simply increase? I'm going mix matter ""studies"" say, already many studies vaccine totally safe...

At point, take freedoms back... No, frontline health care workers, care home staff January cohort. high prevalence younger females, far vaccinated now. sweat it, least anymore someone works first responder, grocery store, hospital, etc.......every single public school employee vaccinated end summer, late. time, kiddies 12 &amp; getting jabs, too. Canada one first countries sign deal Pfizer, even ahead EU. absolutely lowest name list. list exists anyway. discuss Essentially, UK hospitals held one organisation (the NHS), allowed quickly organise find eligible candidates recovery trials find new treatments hospitalised severe COVID.

[There's article days ago dexamethasone treatment studied Low-dose dexamethasone cheap widely used steroid reduced deaths Covid patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation 36% (uncertainty interval 19%-49%) receiving oxygen 18% (6%-28%). finding alone estimated saved 22,000 lives UK million worldwide. I‚Äôve noticed trend people getting vaccinated mentioning friends nurses, nurses saying vaccine isn‚Äôt effective, giving people lifelong side effects, whatnot.

Not shit nurses lots tough jobs, educated enough claiming things claim. personally know smart would think. vast majority doctors tell safe effective encourage get it.  Think missed point. correct, 7 day avg indeed increasing last couple weeks, appears accelerating some. Maybe reasons getting vaccination? example people getting sicker dog first shot two 2nd one supposed worse. Nobody wants willingly get sick.

There‚Äôs year virus new scary variants popped significantly altered disease. spreading among less people make significantly mutating even difficult. chances escaping vaccine even smaller.

Now won‚Äôt get micro chipping... come on, don‚Äôt conspiracist.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Vaccines provide good levels protection, especially severe forms COVID. There's *zero* risk COVID vaccinated people sense there's *zero* risk crashing car way grocery store, personally stay isolated avoid going daily business small risks like that. Hello, I‚Äôm 22 got today. brain hasn‚Äôt fallen yet.

In short, no. Ooooo, UK right way herd immunity!

Things looking pretty good America (though particular state, worst COVID right now, rampant infections), 30% one dose far (myself included).

Hopefully get numbers within next month! cannot shut shut even reduce numbers. states, indoor dining never really even closed, meaning workers risk entire time. flight attendants. exposed via jobs, regardless whether justified people flying.

How people going get medications factories shut down? grocery stores going get food stock? Texas going survive snowstorm electricians plumbers shut down? Electrical, plumbing, HVAC essential year-round sanitary healthy society. factory workers going get work without bus system car? 

I'll agree abuse public, plenty public-facing employees dealing this. 
EU investment tiny. basically paid cheap jab UK US spent Billions. 

Eu got scammed french sanofi. 

My favorite car EU Murcielago  lead nothing, think china would ever take responsibility this. Hah! Source? one Canada EU recommended given 55 year olds today. gambling winning good decision making? lady ran got face yesterday newspaper separating us tell put mask on. run 5 miles nowhere near anyone. virus broken peoples brains AstraZeneca Pfizer strange. mass vaccination site used never asked this. compare rest world's horrific handling vaccine manufacturing rollout US.

The US poorly. rest world horrifically, unforgivably bad. Israel fine, seems, looking numbers.

The US system healthy people skipping lines, vaccines given states based population rather demand, people need vaccine still can't get many places hard make appointment.

And, wayyy vaccines manufactured ready go approval. J&amp;J hundred thousand week weeks terrible. They're way behind March goals, we're waiting see they'll actually come 11million dose promise. Well Moderna Pfizer 'new technology' ones, studied worked decades new sense first one deployed. However really delivery mechanism different, function similar viral vector vaccine (what J&amp;J is) works. work giving cells instructions produce certain protein virus's bodies learn recognize it. Taking account previous party power vaccine rollout strategy whatsoever, I'd say party power fact matter. entire pandemic, Denmark experienced one single fatality age 50 COVID-19.

Having one fatality age group vaccine aiming prevent Covid-19 makes vaccine tough sale. aware 2/3 ""UK supply"" came EU, right?

Because gonna take stance, might unravel badly UK. No, must always doom misery. good news allowed! That's good thing! No, annoy germaphobic loners. assume it'll start happen late April early May. cautious states waiting case numbers fall significantly lifting additional restrictions. 

The UK weeks ahead US terms first doses, cases plateaued month. Israel's cases started dropping significantly weeks ago plateau, they're probably weeks ahead UK.

There signs new cases UK started drop past days, hopefully US follow weeks sooner. fear heart attack though? Covid thing kill you. lmao. also someone make beeline 20 ft away outdoors tell put mask on. like, dude, outside keep walking distance already away see reason people would allowed wear masks chose  think stick at. 

In state felony wear mask public outside state emergency.

There exceptions, cold flu would cut it. That‚Äôs reasonable concern although would counter pointing really shouldn‚Äôt opening widely everyone get vaccine. states opening vaccination everyone coming weeks give bit supply unequal distribution shouldn‚Äôt issue. agree. lot elderly compromised still waiting cared like should. people wonder back normal hospitalizations deaths start increase again. There's reason anyone 65+ risk conditions contacted scheduled get vaccine (or least signed one). Yet mother received peep anyone despite signed everywhere could. actively pursue one. still couple 80+ relatives contacted, I'm trying help out. way. Curious cells react? Group 6, largest priority groups people aged 16-65 health conditions, carers whole bunch stuff, 7.3m people. group getting vaccinated mainly past month so, would mainly recieving AZ. I'm group 6 got AZ, everyone else know got group 6 got AZ too. getting vaccine give person covid antibodies? Maybe first world, situation wildly different countries. maybe turns one newer vaccines easuer update or.... bill insurance it. probably call see picture work. would assume yes. takes 2 weeks shot take effect. People choose whatever want. me, never mask again. ironically enough, traditional vaccine opposed Pfizer Moderna use totally new tech.  insurance, they'll get billed vaccine. don't, government billed. picture insurance card fine. may need see sides though.

With Pfizer, become less likely test positive unvaccinated person around 14 days first shot. wife accompanied father&amp;cousin eligible morning vaccine appointments. 

We got first doses pfizer! 

Woohoo let's get everyone done! Agreed. Fauci composure choose words carefully. makes bitter pill easier swallow. Hearing director CDC dramatic word choice makes angry. Thanks response, anyone information/good sources actually answers OP's question? curiosity anything reason AZ get approved become option sure UK stats true hiding cases?

It seems highlt suspicious. Maybe UK keeping numbers secret matter national security government orders, cause panic. (Which would reasonable.) bs headline conspiracy site run ""34 vaccinated people still get virus"" true, ok. many bogus treatments push? Remember idiots drinking aquarium cleaner dying statements?

That administration earned it‚Äôs distrust that‚Äôs fair.  That's crazy amount money know get away massive fees America. UK they're free everyone secondary school kids get test given school take home every week. That‚Äôs protection it‚Äôs peak I'm 6th :( necessarily true. I'm adult at-risk group, living San Francisco Bay Area. rollout California mess, I've trying weeks get appointment nearby first shot absolutely zero luck. Saturday I'll driving 5 hours town another part state get first dose. able drive clear across state (many people severe health issues disabilities can't), probably able get long time ? seeing Ohio mentioned article. Michigan yes. led nation new cases 57 percent rise past week. state, relaxed covid-related restrictions earlier month, also reported largest increase coronavirus hospitalizations, grew 47 percent. Source? like above? 

So country analogy created vaccine, government bankroll R&amp;D, invest heavily production facilities way anyone knew would even gain approval? 

And where‚Äôs country gone way discredit said vaccine every possible opportunity, whilst hospitals capital city currently breaking point turning Covid patients away? one single person vaccinated good enough? true flu shot live like risk. understand waiting another couple months adults access shot. it‚Äôs time normalize completely. Anti vaxxers fend that‚Äôs choice. make sense?

Because next shot scheduled three month now, we'll hopefully know issue, causes it, applies situation, possibly combat it, deciding based data available *now* make sense actual decision made 12 weeks now. Well, point :P Curious feel mask-wearing becoming normalized thing winter/flu season general much data flu cases/deaths sharply declined? 

Personally I'm opposed wearing mask winter time live Northern state, wondering public large respond mask wearing. it‚Äôs true vaccinated people can‚Äôt infect unvaccinated people, that‚Äôs game changer. Agree. guess, leaders want project caution close 'finish' line everyone able get vaccinated. Opening back everything (which safe vaccinated folks!) also encourages antivaxxers unvaccinated folks go end spreading disease more.

Nuance terribly hard age soundbytes, guess stick conservative messages. Wisconsin consistently top terms % used middling terms shots per capita. numbers per capita skyrocket increased supply larger pool. I'm 20 min away there, bunch Superbowl parties throughout Tampa Superbowl people downtown Tampa literally filling streets blocking traffic partying up. Barely em wearing masks everyone packed together. Amazingly, cause surge!

&amp;#x200B;

Yup, can't wait WM. would actually go person fully vaccinated since I'm I'm gonna sit one watch TV lol. I'm still excited though! They'll get lifted summer coming back unless something extraordinary happens. fall, Americans unvaccinated chose receive I'm going wear mask protect them. Perhaps crucially stability season, vaccinated individuals need quarantine identified close contact someone tests positive, unless symptoms. Variation states roll plans. Personally, think particular state I‚Äôm hasn‚Äôt done great job. created tier system that‚Äôs overly complicated left lot high risk people out. depends live. think US whole making great strides though. agree masking even say end year public‚ÄîI think even us want open soon agreement that. Re: vaccinated people unmasking, get concern it‚Äôs I‚Äôll probably still wear mask bit get shot, time people don‚Äôt wear masks anyways l I‚Äôd rather force people wear reason necessary‚ÄîI mean that‚Äôs kind definition public health theater signed deal UKs govt vaccines made oxford exported

Well looks like AZ played sides, point UK finalized contract first vaccines could start distributed, otherwise AZ would manufacture millions vaccines risk might even used. 

It's also unclear whether AZ could claim ""best reasonable efforts"" justify delay vaccines made within EU. also clear whether EU right demand vaccines made UK, given UK longer part EU.  much higher average lmao. steal back landlords home, gladly. Yeah, complaining gets nowhere, changing locks invoking squatters rights will. high number cases deaths, B117 causing big waves elsewhere letting virus loose issue getting vaccines delivered others stricter contract sanction laws, would good, guess. feel much live CA. think see restrictions lifted summer want avoid bad optics reimposing winter lifted restrictions include mask mandates hard venue caps, etc. 

I think Illinois said would keep mask mandates CDC said longer needed. think strict states likely masks could go 2022. (The CDC pro masking politicians). really recommend finding activities safely unmasked unwind mental health. post appears vaccines. encourage visit subreddit FAQ resources vaccines vaccine appointment scheduling.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* consistently pessimistic dishes rather soberly. I‚Äôll take ‚Äúedge doom‚Äù shit don‚Äôt live Philly Pittsburgh, you‚Äôre pretty much SOL getting vaccine Pa.  No, still small chance give Covid someone else vaccinated. It‚Äôs 100%. It‚Äôs closer 80%. Giving someone else means still spread it. there‚Äôs still risk hanging around unvaccinated people, health. Yes no. 

There‚Äôs coordinated federal response handling purchasing distribution. 

There zero coordination passed 100mm vaccine doses lord knows why. Props revisions ü§ô tried appointment cvs asking insurance prescription information, thought free? Also bring insurance card you??? picture. Finally pzifer first shot, take ‚Äúeffect‚Äù? got covid year ago curious. Can't uptick cases

According - no. led nation new cases 57 percent rise past week.

Please look ""uptick"" - think uptick refers small percentage change like maybe 3% 1%. look up. leadership place actually cares us. 

Instead stating elderly would gladly die keep economy going, suggesting inject bleach lungs, government working us. Thank man, sometimes make stupid mistakes. sincerely wondering, something really believe, based something more... Partisan? wits end maybe saying things - I'm sure based anything real. Idiots keep saying flu, yet got organ failure state (FL) alone 10k cases winter surge!

10K cases across entire US could well mean states would seeing NZ numbers. Can‚Äôt wait get second dose later next month get :) Yes, join Slack secure HEB appointment eligible Phase 1B Texas. Otherwise, refresh appointment page trying secure new graphics card console. even check eligibility appointment basically free time. 'doing part' anymore, people charge prevent another wave making vaccine moot point. vaccine valuable intense tracing mitigation efforts, instead, we're treating like magical silver bullet. Meanwhile, states blazing ahead reopening despite experts *begging stop*, federal government tisk tisking like neutered puppies ability anything. anything else, CDC director can't help break national stage, unavoidable. We. Are. Fucked. Nothing said advocates zero Covid perspective goal. do, people recovered covid least 3 months ago eligible one dose vaccine. True. think Singapore done best job balancing low numbers, good vaccine rollout, hasn‚Äôt put stuttering lockdown protocols like island nations.  Correct. seasonality spikes think reaches level pandemic over. going look like give Trump credit developing two amazing vaccines world ever seen getting us 985,000 doses day left office.

P.S dumb. Health workers scientists deserve credit politicians divide us. Ahole? Really? Really? know fuck I'm dealing  I'm guessing Spokane Portland (or Boise, counts); Seattle ever relaxes I'll happy. daily values aren‚Äôt reliable like tests deaths. 7 day rolling average went like 1%... mention possibility people needed second doses week got higher proportion. relax Going back old threads (don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôm bored) wow, spot on! Despite told (register county health department), tell anyone looking wait someone else make appointment. Make own. wait doctor employer reach you. 5 hospitalizations close 2 million people amazing. Especially since people already vaccinated medically high risk. town near me, think 17 fully partially vaccinated nursing home residents tested positive. group, 1 went hospital. symptoms time, overall health poor wanted hospital observation case started develop symptoms needed treatment. Ruby pretty much echoes sentiments. Like trust me, covid never ate planes idea touching mouth public disgusting, go straight bathroom wash hands go eat rule. additional cost stress time put workers charged cleaning surfaces well. overall think creates paranoid mindset‚ÄîI‚Äôve met people otherwise broke quarantine didn‚Äôt social distance expressed concern going ‚Äúdirty‚Äù areas city, masked bigotry using pandemic. 

As aside, someone Norovirus covid, former like 1000% worse healthy youngish person lol, hear Right pace 5-6 weeks behind Israel appear herd immunity right now. I'm sure we'll little bump along way, timeline impossible. wrong side history. entire world you. forced, die. Soon necessary vaccination card enter grocery store. shunned society. children taken you. fit world. Science, compassion, common sense prevail. They're probably going wait available everyone including children. looked data 1 January 2019 31 January 2021. means best tiny percentage people affected age former. building sea wall, last bit place stop everything. one zone everyone vaccinated means even new variant 50% able infect people always fail end (unless statistically unlucky). share vaccine double population number people protected little control transmissibility populations.

The logic literally boils close people vaccinated. important place like UK island. course complexities international travel, atm that's limited, point is, get everyone done UK quickly, that's 70 million people basically unable mix countries can't create new variant. Dealing virus zones TOTALLY (as much possible) fixing one zone makes sense closes ability virus least double. expensive travel internationally American living near border.  Personally, would go Pfizer-BioNTech (I received it). There‚Äôs ton data efficacy, especially real world conditions think important. Additionally, reassured fact substantial number people (like 60+ million US israel) received vaccine haven‚Äôt seen real safety concerns vaccine. 4 days ago says Exactly stated. J&amp;J tested Brazil variant period. Pfizer, Moderna, Astra Zeneca (which isnt even approved point USA) regular novel covid yes do, variants no. BTW articles outdated. young risk adverse see not. Nothing life 100 percent safe - decide small risks worth it. Yeah, friend 4 kids age 10 says nightmare productivity work home. get like 5am try get work done get up. doubt going able elect president next year even vaccine make feel safe, would? Covid going extinct? I'd interested see women birth control, it.  going slow loss effectiveness people lose effectiveness faster. going every 3-5 year thing suspect most. Skeptical new vaccine every year thing covid. Best base scenario every 5-10 years MRNA vaccine. 10-20 percent chance scenario imo actually i'm quite hopeful understand logistical nightmare giving everyone masks taking Temps door? figured out. know they‚Äôre talking political polls around election time; it‚Äôs always brought survey 2k participants isn‚Äôt indicative anything since numbers small. Idk logic would apply here.

I‚Äôve seen state map town, though, infection rate vary greatly district. What‚Äôs true Springfield may true Framingham, Salem, Clinton. 

IMO, framework positive cases per person rise pst certain point, things get closed down. takes emotion it, takes pressure decision makers looked folks sides ‚Äúnot enough‚Äù. Well surprised?? fucked EU over. EU sent vaccines britain didn‚Äôt send vaccines supposed to. think made astrazeneca give vaccines made british soil british people. mean sounds fair, except fact EU share vaccine... window concern 4 20 days vaccination. I've found lot relevant info here:  Lmao *whooshhhh* What? make sense. numbers contract COVID unvaccinated? good numbers people vaccinated. Can‚Äôt believe got downvoted this. might study looking data comparable due age group analysed period 1 January 2019 31 January 2021 determine whether increase numbers rare blood clotting disorder, venous sinus thromboembolism, recorded initial vaccine roll-out. 25 months period, total 19 cases disorder recorded. new cases venous sinus thromboembolism recorded individuals received vaccine period. Seven people previous diagnosis condition vaccinated 31 January gracious, normal. Well, be. ""new normal"" seem look normal; e.g. USA India.  work ALs ohio. vaccines fucking swimming covid residents hospitalized dying regularly. asked someone building today positives amongst residents since theyve vaxed. theyve 1 someone declined vaccine  Earlier today Germany's renowned hospital stopped vaccinating female employees 55 AZ. doctors would treat Angela Merkel think safe crew, can't expect normal citizens trust vaccine. k It‚Äôs mutually exclusive concept. Landlords pay lot commercial tax revenue also - always - profit, mainly sale assets much annual basis simply tenancy. flu tends land somewhere r1 r2. 

A r value .53 shows virus experiencing exponential negative growth. 

Let's say 100 people Israel infected COVID-19. people would average pass virus onto 53 people. 53 people would pass 26 people, would pass 13 people, would pass 6, would pass 3, would pass one. 

As see, infection simply can't sustain negative growth rates like that. people become vaccinated, virus less vectors (non infected people) r value continue drop further. gay isn‚Äôt infectious disease, despite far right claims contrary. See difference? one gonna catch gay. Lol.. need get point Israel has. always goal post, never changed. exactly think rule lab leak theory. location lab ALSO evidence came animals. evidence both, say one likely other? call weak evidence. Supply lines global. dont export think countries willing export vaccine inputs. Vaccine production domestic affair. Ye help EU... govt didnt ship vaccines EU... Dip dried prunes melted chocolate pretend it‚Äôs new trendy superfood kids either seems sticking point one's WFH well-being raising family. I'm stating though, also point discussion. talking Moderna able achieve scaling Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna lacking, pointed earlier, case look circumstances two parties. isn't.

The unvaccinated still get sick gonna push businesses public health maintain restrictions mask mandates etc. recommended to? Even yellow fever vaccinations usually required country prone yellow fever. Something similar happened Israel got vaccinations people started going hadn‚Äôt before. pretty much inevitable, far important factor vaccinate many people possible letting people know that‚Äôs it‚Äôs way towards normalcy. feel need start educating benefits risks don‚Äôt. People probably lean getting told positive benefits.

Now me, got J&amp;J vaccine kicked ass. understand people won‚Äôt get severe side effects. even started period developed UTI never UTI entire life. doctor told he‚Äôs seen UTI J&amp;J periods people. mean it‚Äôs better dying, heads would nice issue can't 2 tiered society everyone vaccinated. tell Americans allowed travel eat restaurants must stay home? identify easily people need wear mask ones say grocery store? case I'm wearing mask required indoors feel confident enough science resume life completely I'm vaccinated.  Yea i‚Äôve seen Kelsey Grammar! He‚Äôs awful, top layer turd mush, bottom layer shit still frozen ground. hold opinion. sell these? mainly is.. absolute Circus show USA. know happening world like America people even bringing ""constitutional rights"" it.. folk UK wear one get it, unless live London they're mostly bunch arseholes anyways. 

There's videos people court rooms complaining rights taken away.

ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAll people asking wear mask minutesü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Moon baby! deaths, hospitalizations, cases going across board literally definition fourth wave?  There‚Äôs probably going (smaller?) 4th wave given loosening restrictions everywhere, sense freedom vaccine, spring break Florida, Easter, etc. Hopefully corona‚Äôs last big ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù. 

What interesting see many deaths result 4th wave. Deaths continued decline risk population healthcare workers chance get vaccine. don‚Äôt see deaths getting back early January numbers even explosion cases.  well cluster New Yor

indeed u/ariehkovler source? know lower efficacy comparative trials. Initial data non-trial use support assertion vaccine lower efficacy. study NEJM efficacy SA variant 10% CI -75% 54%. 3% chance better 50% works. clear reduction hospitalization studies variant. 

Better nothing, EEEK mutation variants get contagious, likely need give AZ vax booster shot something else end pandemic. see &lt;&lt;50% efficacy stop pandemic without shot something else well. looking r rate similar diseases like Flu Measles, compare .53 Corona right now. Yeah, kids, issue, opposed working coffee shops whenever. probably much, couple places mind Friday going right happy hour.

Also small nitpick, medical condition causes obesity, conditions make one vulnerable developing it. Eg conditions ruin energy levels, raise appetite, cause chronic pain dissuades exercising cause put medications fuck energy levels appetite. Actual metabolic rates vary much someone simply dead can‚Äôt cause obesity themselves. warned 2017.  big chunk people vaccinated yet many places really hard get appointment even eligible feels like free all.  
  
Out system think Publix Florida best way it, virtual waiting room that's open three times week morning time. tells many appointments left counties. Everywhere else feels disorganized. There's free check time frustrating constantly trying find appointment stakes high. ""only required"" group may least partially get chipped away though. know governors US said going force anyone get (and truthfully legally potentially problematic blanket vaccine requirement exceptions anyway) employer basically told us current plan (subject change based Covid cases area, obviously) us return working office June 7th CEO basically told us need get vaccine without ""officially"" telling us get it, lot people will, fact, required get may otherwise - government employer.

Due recently Covid hoping wait little longer I've heard side effects much severe Covid within last 90 days, is. I'll deal guess. fact older vulnerable population never ones left homes much younger people anyway. Younger people brought virus home them. active members society vaccinated, everything opening reason believe cases go up. see many radically anti restriction accounts see radically pro restriction accounts, don‚Äôt think bots reason thread different think it‚Äôs people tired seeing compliance little real world benefits numerous real world downsides. ends sight Americans get heads asses get vaccinated, wear maskS, social distance. supplier. Low margin. profits must've made elsewhere. Moderna/pfizer like 80-90% protected point.  Depends strict want follow guidelines terms bad idea not. people would find clubbing bad idea even without covid stupid, herd immunity definitely thing, check lol. didn't. 
But also EU paid least signed deal last. 
That's countries ahead EU. countries made significant investments infrastructure research top signing deals well advance. 

EU paid least held best price...shrug, got deserved. Hopefully learned lesson. We‚Äôre vaccine race variants cases trending places people open fast it‚Äôs looking familiar.

Vaccine efficacy could determined Native Americans Pacific Islanders cases COVID-19 either vaccine placebo groups.  Phase 3 trial, **the Pfizer vaccine 100% effective** Black study participants **94.5% effective** Latino participants, slightly 94.7% effectiveness white subjects. addition, 74.4% effective Asian Americans, 100% effective Native Americans Pacific Islanders. Among people described multiracial, 10.4% effective, one case COVID-19 among got vaccine one case among got placebo. No? title states 1 100 000, obviously ever going major impact deaths. vaccinating AZ mean get vaccinated altogether tradeoff vaccination. ludicrous people often make sound avoid AZ vaccines statistically riskier get AZ jab Covid country age range. Yeah people really need check heads realize every current COVID vaccine even FDA-approved.

The smallpox vaccine invented 1796 eradicated 1977. Smallpox even eradicated US 1949, 44 years 1905 Supreme Court case declaring vaccine mandates constitutional (which included exceptions ""extreme"" cases).

Most mandatory vaccines existed *decades* required. chickenpox vaccine example developed 1970s, approved US 1995, still required many jurisdictions. Less two years development mandate insane timeline. Fucking idiot. immigration. flight states get vaccine, none pharmacies checking resident. lab Wuhan large animal reservior naturally occurring (and mutating) coronaviruses. I'm saying lab leak impossible, evidence ridiculously weak. Anything 1 replicate enough survive. every 100 people Covid right now, they'll transmit 53. 53 transmit 28, transmit 15, transmit 8 . . . 4 . . . 1 . . . gone. 

You'll still isolated pockets get infected, community spread over. 

The caveat .53 probably includes amount artificial social distancing. acted like March 2019, would likely somewhat higher. I'd still wear mask crowded places otherwise pretty much want. definitive data yet much vaccinated people still transmit virus. really point, people vaccinated. OK, and? Infections matter, especially young people die it. article dishonest sensational calling ""Abyss"" utterly failing put numbers context, appreciably different elsewhere scale population size. death though, 10% covid sufferers long term health implications *insert wambulance jpeg* That's 6 feet also ineffective airborne spread. presented alternative mask quarantine requirement, mandatory? 2 weeks shot #2, go clubbing? bad idea. Genuinely wondering. don‚Äôt know world, US see excess deaths fall significantly summer almost everyone get vaxxed. really. agreed profit. it? literally know specific school 200 people quarantine 50 cases. joke. guess schools outbreaks unable pool testing data set. Pool testing works low rates. rates rise, go individual testing again. However routinely given children secondary schools 2005. adults 30 UK. No, everyone afford washer dryer. Also everyone room equipment living quarters. can‚Äôt go laundromat concerns virus, wash manually home. Couldn‚Äôt happen better state PR play - it‚Äôs national Pharmaceutical Regulators

PR... **P**harmaceutical **R**egulators... Would y‚Äôall let good news get instead fearmongering good news distribution vaccine places like States really ramping up. Douchebags giving safety protocols prematurely likely problem we‚Äôll deal long. Basically another month two we‚Äôll know big problem is. 

I guess question is, worth downplay effectiveness vaccine re: preventing infection &amp; spread, get unvaccinated keep masking they‚Äôre vaxxed, could effect discouraging people getting vaccine think ‚Äúwhy bother, I‚Äôm going keep masking distancing get it?‚Äù 

I think vaccine-refusers bigger problem people maybe over-eager ditch masks. Yeah, think we‚Äôre page then. crusade people say need restrictions near zero deaths. sound fun hang around... states confusing eligibility rules frustrating residents well. Overall gone relatively well could handled better areas. Also rate going vaccinations, using positive tests metric dumb carry weight positive test even 5 months ago ""I can't accept lots people disagree me, therefore they're bots."" got pfizer shot two last night. Kinda felt fine morning outside arm pain. achiness grogginess starting creep in, bad. worked like retail job something I'd probably rather miss work, wfh office job pushing through. redditors. highest politicians well. politicization vaccine worst thing could‚Äôve happened. Regardless, I‚Äôm hopeful we‚Äôll continue make strides towards widespread vaccination. Huh? important distinction. 

When acting fast moving situation limited information high consequences either way, think risk trades offs critical.

Upon initial report, limited potentially significant information. time, risks 1) ignore risk, wrong, 2) react, harm people taking away vaccine good reason.

Do reject framework material difference A) investigating concern, withholding vaccine information (due risk #2 above) vs. B) withholding vaccine?

All post saw attacking option B. are, opinion, saying people attacking option A, think anyone did. would opposed finding information? 1.7 CDC reports actually backlog previous 4-5 days, today mostly reports sunday lowest day week vaccines applied far. see trends page: actually right now, US 1.78M + yesterday's 2M+ yet reported either. SARS virus escaped high-level containment facilities Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, molecular biologist Rutgers University Piscataway, New Jersey.

It's obvious came lab. Chinese safety standards laughable. try photocopies ID, insurance medical card along last 4 SSN dont export think countries willing export vaccine inputs.

I literally explained you.

Not detailed enough?

Country A: I'm going ship vaccines people vaccinated.

Country B two choices: Choice 1: vindictive delay vaccines holding supply lines Choice 2: Continue supplying inputs Country get vaccines vaccines ready.

They'll almost always choose Choice 2. choose choice 1, there's really much blood hands Country A. Thanks. dumbass thought today's number. lipids sourced outside EU within. produced majority EU. Marburg plant 100% EU based, everything sourced within EU. Creates week UK since August without single foreign thing amusing still include address EU imports vaccine components. Clearly soil final tick box drawn could've entirely foreign work force, foreign built owned factory, foreign raw materials, foreign components, speaking Welsh factory Bruge, permission Belgium still ask thanks gracious allowance import mighty EU.

All 100% malark. Source it? Nah can't got British Tabloids kind attitude hope businesses think twice investments Europe.

The region allowing exports. Ok must love US allowing export- wait no. Indi- Oh no. Well maybe they'll go UK many doses expor- Oh nope. want sort funding help UK supply UK first can't supply better paying customers they'd like. Oh well better go EU since start pandemic. saying normal take people‚Äôs stuff yet ‚ÄúThe UK ban export vaccines, government signed contract AstraZeneca obliges Anglo-Swedish company deliver doses produced Oxford Staffordshire Britain first‚Äù . actually breaks point 13.1 contract AZ made EU. course AZ denying make deal... britain got 9 million doses vaccines EU vaccines made britain go britain first. EU recieve AZ doses made even thoigh contract says recieve doses Oxford. See point? EU play nice, send vaccines world end fucked end? yeah ban exports seems appropriate me. 

Sad see australia suffering this, maybe world fair place, EU would get doses ordered US UK. result, australia would end getting screwed. That's always starts. fact uptick happened exactly time public health experts said would surprising. apples oranges say compare showing *multiple* vaccination records go school prove vaccinated *one disease* go baseball game.

What? apples oranges? Even is, show one vaccination instead multiple better? legitimate arguments vaccine passports, think one them. would faulty injection technique cause low platelet count ? I‚Äôd *really* careful kind analysis you‚Äôre making small sample size even smaller. hear you, really bad thing businesses actually take hygiene sanitation seriously (assuming actually clean way claim)? Restaurants especially. Chances low even pandemic, I'd like ever catch Norovirus all...ever...thank much lol don‚Äôt live parents. like see without guilt I‚Äôm putting life danger. Changing recommendation safety drug vaccine every week wonders experts' reputations suggests enough data previously collected fully support recommendations. Remember, experts completely opposite opinions matter, can't matter pick favorite expert thing like chart scale. set highlight difference years, good job highlighting scale change. graph starts 50k. 
 
The thing like death. Pretty embarrassed human right now... Yes there's still 60, even 70 year olds gotten vaccination yet even higher risk. feel men 60 higher priority list? making distinction men women within age groups? ban customer who's ever Israel

Last paragraph sounded like nazi propaganda.

Everyone hates antivaxxers, strapped table sent camp? Jeez Possible, likely. new evidence showing vaccine effective even emergence variants got first shot last week TBH didnt feel it, like all. didnt little soreness/tenderness next days would thought didnt even get Lol seriously? Yep! Hope goes well remember drink lot water take ibuprofen afterwards! U.S. official distanced Biden administration report, issued predecessor, said U.S. position discourage Brazil countries accepting vaccine approved local regulators. would 100% didn‚Äôt lockdowns tell NJ ton availability getting appt freaking disaster. there's that. Planning yea.  Thanks! Sad mentality. brother girlfriend tested. Although case think interested know got Covid didn‚Äôt despite living together. understand point perfectly. gay doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone. Spreading covid does.

You‚Äôre trying make antivaxxers kind protected class really it‚Äôs matter public health like spreading HIV, hepatitis, etc. 

Being black doesn‚Äôt hurt people. Jewish doesn‚Äôt hurt people. woman doesn‚Äôt hurt people. Spreading airborne infectious disease doesn‚Äôt.. oh wait, hurt people. 

See difference yet?   They're effective variants. variant mutation. would guess mix fact *are* countries faster, might lead conclude better. Seems like horrible calculation. Even week extra lockdown expensive extra vaccine purchases. ask India ? R.I.P Ohioan, missed getting one  rude! nice day :) really wasn‚Äôt bad all! hate shots I‚Äôd argue flu shot worse! say day pretty gnarly headache it‚Äôs good! Don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll fine! always wondered sure explanation - release number daily shots 10 PT west coast vaccinations done yet? safe say 1.7M approximate might couple thousands? one remember prison outbreaks almost exclusively B117 mid February?

Perhaps supercharged Michigan B117 count slowly rise population explode.

* Varicella (chickenpox)
* *Haemophilus influenzae* type b (Hib)
* Pneumococcal conjugate (PCV13)
* Hepatitis B (Hep B) ""H*rd *mmunity""?? 

Why would censor that? moronic or...? they? able find available spots Wednesday near 2 minutes work vaccinate previously infected make sure...I guess. think issue know effective second shot like month past recommended time. UK rolled dice looks like paying off. kind concern legitimate, ideal infection rate right low possible, level whenever hospitals overwhelmed?  need widespread immunity quickly possible, vaccine, infection.

Even U.S., someone going get vaccine, better go maskless, live life, get infected point?

I know impossible manufacture scenario like that, can't control enough stop short hospitals overwhelmed.  seems either COVID rates control, hope widespread vaccine use, infection way out.

For kinds reasons, worry countries low infection rates, also low vaccine rates, like New Zealand Australia. There's little immunity kind there.  long term plan careful closed off, wait pandemic fully globally (perhaps years road)? Got first Moderna shot! Texas opened everyone 16+ yesterday able snag appointment CVS today. consistent line people coming appointments. groups vaccinated. Take Michigan. Earlier pandemic 70+ demographic made up12% cases, last weeks they've made 4% new cases makes perfect sense look percentage vaccinated (66% started, 50% fully vaccinated 65+ bracket). think right lot low risk people still unvaccinated vulnerable people lives vaccinated taking many precautions balancing decrease we'd see people getting vaccinated. vaccine developed Germany two scientists Turkish migration background made possible logistics American company. Showing really positive globalisation ‚Äúwait see‚Äù category wait see something crappy happen coworker family member chose vaccinated. also see amplified indifference others deniers coupled people cared whole lot could bothered empathize plight someone refused vaccine avoidable negative reaction. AZ vaccine Germany last week. check-in counter leaflet Paul Ehrlich institute, post vaccine symptom/side effect logging app use. also equivalent program yellow card system (although I'm sure name.) doctor spoke vaccine told look for, I'd asked him, 30 something woman taking AZ. said caught early, clots much treatable. rare nature, nobody looking expecting them. inform clotting symptoms monitor home - doubt, call 116 117 Germany (or nhs111 UK, equivalent service) discuss symptoms. also call GP doctor doubts. probably variants. plateau *is* surge. Give weeks we'll trending down. Okay, still really understanding. You‚Äôre saying link getting vaccine protected covid don‚Äôt know circumstances infection? Weren‚Äôt things tested thousands people proven effective? saying one knows vaccines provide protection? things indicate bad reactions dose may mean you‚Äôve virus Ok, say chance 1 50k 1 150k, 95% confidence interval. Normal people care exact numbers, interval enough them. ""Informed consent"" way way way easier normal people medical ""ethicists"" try make sounds like.

Just bring Tuskegee, suspect would. Yeah much show haggling proof pudding.

There even models show mRNA vaccines sustained effectiveness, much less effectiveness virus evolution.

And accident.  great deal opposition basic science Fedgov, profit bases. No, spreads Marshall humans, that's virus attacks! Michigan kept restrictions even cases fallen suddenly loosened recently people right doesn‚Äôt seem give f anymore.

Loosening restrictions gradual. Hypothyroidism common among women, silly say ""They already had...""

It perfectly managable dismissed 'they already got problems' like weak, feeble shells humans. Dare say 4M üëÄüëÄüëÄ People accept vaccine going accept data, least spin it. ""It Spring"" whatever. I'm 1 month 2nd shot. Honestly still masking lead example. Many still gotten first shot yet want encourage people discard masks yet. private meetings work however(where almost us shots), remove readily. I'm starting make arrangements hangout others vaccinated well. (I meant 2 weeks 2nd jab work schedules got way.)


My wife gets 2nd shot week. 2 weeks probably relax even more. dined indoors year would nice finally again. foresee us dropping masks entirely till May likely vaccination rollout going. exciting though finally see light end tunnel! Imagine pathetic wearing piece fabric face hard. Weak people. Slightly smaller hobbit, often found hiding 3 coat. Thank info.

My comment meant ""in tone"" reply comment replied to.

I hope science wins numbers behind become clear wake political games. 

When comes people lives politics back hell off. Geez...You sound like Evangelist.. Maybe different diagnostic procedures used decide whether someone particular condition not? decided bullshit

they never *decided bullshit*, went *EH* carried vaccinations don‚Äôt understand you‚Äôre perfectly fine people dying  happy see Biden administration taking pandemic vaccine rollout serious. get last months, light end tunnel now. I'm counting days age group comes up, hopefully it'll get moved May 1st point. stupid take, Michigan wouldn‚Äôt much different obeying restrictions neighboring states. really, really stupid question thread Ok. want get vaccinated. family telling damgerous. say people dying stroke, heart attack, really onsets vaccinez. Efficacy measure levels antibodies body, ""prepared"" body fight Sars-Cov-2 infection given time.

It's number compares many people got infected group vaccinated people compared many got infected group unvaccinated people. says nothing got infected, physiology, etc. election Biden asked people commit 100 days masking. would mean April 30th. Obviously we're yet, Biden give go-ahead away mask mandates end April would expect states start lifting mandates. dumb. least understand governors want get rid capacity restrictions kind thing sake businesses, wearing mask affect ability go spend money. haven‚Äôt hit two weeks yet, know I‚Äôm already 80% protected even got second dose, wear mask businesses mandate around work I‚Äôm sitting office. It‚Äôs theater now. seems like eligibility restrictions dissolving rural areas Western PA since distributors loads appointments going unfilled. yeah drive around nashville dallas see concerned covid people are... possible provide vaccines AstraZeneca volunteers many vaccination schedule dates cancelled. UK zero (as far aware) reported issues 3.3m 50 females vaccinated. 

The 5 cases (just found out, waiting source confirm) men 50 blood clotting side effects 2m vaccinations. 

The EU numbers vaccinations age groups familiar with.

This decision likely car accident driving home reaction Az (as male using numbers above).

See numbers say 3 months try worry mean time. US really well vaccines too, people countries pleased reports come places UK? UK country used AZ vaccine most? Sounds good factor lost property tax revenue buildings lose value, means less money essential services. Commercial property one stable high-value taxable assets states cities. pretty much went back normal life 2 weeks first dose I'm low risk begin with. ate indoors damn felt good year! one said want forever. We'll 6-12 months transition back ""normal"" life. *possible* solution safely hold large events decent portion population vaccinated. found resistance 10-14 days.

Short answer - you‚Äôre fine. Especially since side effects. what? source that?

Because case fatality rate closer 0.2% think would agree countries handled well. Mine included. vaccinations good regardless pace rollout. step right direction. know it‚Äôs small number feel like need away vaccine stick others. Can‚Äôt afford anymore doubt among society right stories like helping all. Err much, especially mRNA vaccines. resistant mutations vaccine currently available. That's still effective variants pretty good efficacy others like Astrazenica potentially sinopharm essentially offer protection. anyone medical background explain condition diagnosed, much subjective judgement involved deciding whether someone condition not? I'm really buying US UK shipping vaccines next month two going slow production.

Countries going act best interest slowing supply inputs countries help get vaccines faster. CaTeGoRy 5 CoViD hUrRiCaNE think coincidence state rises faster first. Germany, states rising case hospitalization count. really seasonal global cases rising too, hot countries like Iraq, Mediterranean Sea, South America etc. US nothing first, resulted us terribly, threw bunch money problem, digging way hole dug decent pace, dealing bunch people still trying dig wrong direction. Nope, it‚Äôs over. don‚Äôt care. got two shots, two weeks later April 9th, I‚Äôll fully vaccinated, I‚Äôm done. shifting. thinking BCG vaccine--some countries require required recently, others (e.g. UK). Okay, thanks correcting me. Guess I'll getting german vaccine üòÇ‚ù§ many ""blood clots"" think people reported ""heart attacks"", especially older people? bet there's far numbers. reporting them. Easier explain ""heart attack"" elderly one young, healthy adult. get second dose. Nothing stays body vaccine. Also vaccine way better getting real covid vaccines basically weakened version covid. Move dude. Statistics like 550,000 deaths echo chamber. It‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhat-mistakes-have-we-made-and-how-can-we-do-better-going-forward.‚Äù thats definition echo chamber, count in. I‚Äôm going trust experienced scientist, listen opinions ‚Äúresponsible citizen‚Äù yourself. still respectfully disagree. Colorado well opening vaccines everyone. data colorado vaccines directly contradicts statement. Idk county literally pharmacy street extra doses almost like every night now. can't think single person vaccine them. understand might hard time maybe county? would branch try places. fully believe colorado want vaccine get now. Let know private message need help finding one! Great point! know polled get result wanted. computer believe UK study found 28+ days first mRNA efficacy 90%. many young people died Covid?

215 women aged 50 Germany last week. potentially life long disabilities long Covid?

I think reliable numbers yet. covid before? need CDC finally stand say ‚Äúvaccinated people spreading covid-19.‚Äù 

The messaging still way vague ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know sure yet.‚Äù 

But think see message weeks. hope. said going up... Lol. even addressing point. 

It's irrelevant, I'm process vaccinated. 2nd pfizer dose next week. Sounds like mad they're better negotiators Oh that‚Äôs awesome hear. Thank man!  Could manufacturing cause? Entirely different supply chains manufacturing plants UK Vs EU.

And well documented EU sites issues. insane?? moving glacial pace lockdown.

Keep fear mongering doom yourself, thing done for.

You heard first states Germany powers. really equivalent UK, imagine counties wielding much power. I'm Brit live Baden-W√ºrttemberg, southern state Germany. completely different lockdown rules neighbouring states. cases, led response much effective localised, all, rural states north lower incidence locked hard us southern cities tough time? But, also results lot inconsistency. Thumbs long getting pzifer get degree resistance? got first shot last Thursday woke feeling tired slight head ache today. I‚Äôm really hoping wasn‚Äôt unlucky enough get covid right got vaccine avoiding year. two articles necessarily contradict other. Republicans white evangelicals largest percentage report definitely get vaccine, 30% each.

Not much leap suspect getting Fox News (and/or Republican leadership, 1 5 Republicans report would likely get vaccine Trump strongly urged them). surprising. Remember overweight obese say place infested bots straight face. daily thread 0 points 26% upvoted lol... bots able upvote downvote ideas want suppress. become anti-restrictions downplayers virus sadly. Everything claimed Pfizer done BioNTech. BioNTech research development partnered Pfizer Fosun trials production. vaccine name BNT162b2, give hint designed it. funding also come Pfizer alone, Germany EU invested millions BioNTech Fosun well see, choice. either take perceive risk (having people know got vaccine?) get benefit extra privileges prior complete reopening pandemic, decide worth avoid places businesses decide want people vaccinated.  


Nobody forcing get vaccinated, feelings respected.  


I think misunderstanding options fully opened require vaccine. open require vaccine. getting vaccine certain people get privileges things otherwise would able to. Herd immunity validated concept epidemiology.

Why would punish people getting sick?  Point proven. EU tried worm way paying, typical EU. Almost vaccine reactions point immediate 3 months.  idea vaccine complications come years years later based historically seen vaccines. it‚Äôs criteria use move EUA actual Licensing (aka approval) ever. people freaking ""surge"" also freaked Israel's slight increase cases massive drop. wrong one! dipped 1000 March 26th! Silly question mean offers less protection post-fusion shape spike? would irrelevant binding target cells impossibility anyway? Stupid question: got first dose day. took band-aid off, noticed decent amount blood little pad, little bruise injection site. 

The vaccine can't like...leaked out, right? I've never bled shot guess nurse nicked vein, need worry somehow first dose stay arm? (I feel mild side effects, mostly fatigue sort heavy-limbed feeling 12 hours) Oooh insulting now? many deaths is

The Canadian official said blood clot rate increased 10x news.

So, know. waiting seems smart.

Apparently, dont know either since argument basically: ""Let's call person dumb. it!"" 23.5m 25th total. get split Az others?

Am wondering thing. copious studies proving vaccines significantly decrease transmission. vaccines stop one getting sick, vaccines work. Except, do, there's nothing wrong EvanSei doing, take sanctimonious bullshit elsewhere. Nope. Obese here, 39 BMI. vaccine now, I'm good. I'm going living life want live it, without fear deadly virus. Literally cold pizza soda breakfast morning. I'm favor hypochondriac freaks identifying rest us vaccinated ready go back acting like normal human beings. empathize states there's enough maniacs justify things like becoming actual policies. Oh god, vaccine prevents normal clotting!

Norway taken affluent, well-educated immigrants, Sweden taken complete opposite. Scandinavian lived countries, compare Swedens Malm√∂ Oslo quickly see big difference

Victoria's hotel quarantine good contact tracing seems work well enough cause third wave politicians trusting either causing issue. read day thought really fascinating. Could explain mRNA vaccines seem effective providing neutralising immunity (targeting spike pre-fusion configuration means immune system primed target virus first encounter)? 

Could also explain vaccines, including AZ uses 'wild-type' protein (not pre-stabilised), protect severe disease? One dose proves 80 percent effective according articles week though exactly study linked thread saying.

That vaccines effective infections. infected. means carrier. 100%, 90% cited study carrier. 90% effective preventing infections meaning 90% vaccinated carriers cannot spread it. earth even begin enforce though? earth even begin enforce though? I'm sure understand question drivel get published CNBC places?

Go away then, move like want others do. states open varying degrees months now. one hiding home. truly successful lockdown never actually took place. 500,000+ dead. think speaking rationally, not. EU produced around 150 million doses far, exported around 70 million them. UK produced 15 million vaccines total. difference scale production enormous  It‚Äôs 1 million getting blood clots it‚Äôs better medication people take. really want set precedent people denied services among things haven‚Äôt yet taken unapproved vaccine?

This thing allowed school without MMR. vaccine isn‚Äôt even approved zero multi year studies done it. Granted, haven‚Äôt done much research this, think would many reasons. virus become politicized degree never been, consequently, left leaning individuals (of consider one, I‚Äôm harping anyone here, recounting sad fact) see virus dangerous is. 

Realistically, COVID non-issue young children. They‚Äôre barely affected it. parents taking kids school probably won‚Äôt get flu shot, even though that‚Äôs deadlier (for young children). There‚Äôs lot fear around COVID, justified, not. 

I think research showing harm good keeping children school. Maybe haven‚Äôt lost year, literally, absolutely behind peers attending school person, education standpoint, socially they‚Äôre behind they‚Äôve spent year inside formulating years, peers remained immersed social aspects school. It‚Äôs big reason lot poorer neighborhoods frustrated: rich families sending kids private schools there‚Äôs person learning, poor families remain public school system remote learning, leading gaps along rich poor. joke? lung damage.

The UK virtually vaccine production capacity start pandemic, building fast can, new Novavax factory announced yesterday.

The UK also (from start) massively spread-betting came various vaccines. already bought enough UK population committed passing excess poorer nations 3rd largest contributor COVAX scheme. 1, stop good chunk catching it. 2, reduces much spread it. two factors dramatically reduce vector paths available virus, reducing much virus spread. hampered much (r&lt;1), effectively dies (locally). say now. January 2020, different animal. people denial Covid back then. 

I trusted since watched first Covid Presser January 1st 3rd, witnessed Tedros, Director suck China hard put point havong research finding China pushed Tedros get job Navarro back 2017. Why? Tedros open supporter One China Policy. Navarro not. 2nd time next presser, Tlthen realized believed carte blanche. Straight dystopia People can't read statements. EMA never said association, say yes yet. seems pointing towards yes EMA e new meeting next week could, possibly, update guidelines vaccine. 

Also still seems pretty clear potential benefits outweigh risk certain age, important identifying particular population risk treat it. halt instead putting sign says ""you 0.001% chance getting blood clots this"" letting people take risk not? ""please love god stop doorknob licking"" supply April limited they're still ramping production newly established facilities Europe. 55M 3 months huge commitment, far less AZ able deliver period. Curevac may also able make shortfalls June. look roadmaps four nations kinda funny different are. really listening scientists?

Scotland 2 weeks behind England April, open 26/4 England 12/4, England wait til 17/5 get things Scotland getting next month. know number people added system. Took minutes find out. make herd immunity ""vaccine"" dont kill virus? Dont make sense all. would ""asymptomatic infection"" part. 90% affective people getting infected knowing due lack symptoms. 

If understand specifically asking 10% remain, I'm sure. seen anything specifically addressing this, though enough people vaccinated, moot point anyway. half population dont need vaccines! Thats good! Words meanings. Choose carefully. 

And made you‚Äùlol‚Äù? Low bar humor Yeah think pretty much agree everything saying. making excellent points. 

Within Schengen kinda impossible fully close border. can't even imagine world someone can't stroll across border Belgium Netherlands. Massive barbed-wire fences? crazy notion. 

I guess we're disagreeing ""border control"" means context. extremes silly - idea nobody possibly cross EU border silly. idea EU borders open everybody, current circumstances, also silly. think we're quibbling precise definition ""open border"". 

When say ""closed border"", mean nobody possibly cross border (that would almost impossible). mean border controls reintroduced implemented. people longer cross EU borders, Schengen agreement temporarily suspended, define ""closed borders"". vast majority people can't cross many EU borders currently. define ""closed"". 

But yeah reiterate think absolutely correct really debate define ""closed border"" Yes, sorry that. Could try make contact vaccine centre, show proof position ask put list vaccine looks like going waste shows. welsh relative got one early way accompanying another relative needs assistance. week early, booked later anyway, shows sometimes spares. UK banned exports, bought supply domestic supply chain. plants produce 2m/wk, mere drop ocean - really exporting capacity UK atm. Maybe lab release one. 

Half serious. stay safe? Get vaccinated. Giving kids experimental drugs... Worst parents ever. believe headline say. says shown effective preventing asymptomatic infections previous guy pointing make sense able spread infected. anti-vaxx

This vaccine. anti vaxxer? Yes would. guess Austrian government desperate cover epic failure ordering Pfizer doses got offered. disagree UK‚Äôs stance export vaccines? care say there's new strain we're gonna die get pub fuck off. mean work one thing, school completely different. Adults done growing forming personalities, children growing quick. 

I‚Äôm shocked people Reddit aren‚Äôt concerned this. Children school past year missed essentially entire year. That‚Äôs going lead major issues. Younger kids learning afraid people crowds. Middle school kids missing critical learning phases. Kids high school college year behind be. 

To say ‚Äújust wait‚Äù ignore major problems missing entire year school development going cause nation (and world.)

This kind ""closed border"" far closed reality. countries enough staff check every single road leading one country another, check busy ones. also green border, officially cross-able border, people still cross it. types border business consists border crossing multiple times daily exception rule.

somehow, mood ""happy"". reminded cold looks like. reminded sick felt like. like ""this taste covid could be"". knowing vaccine working made feel LOT better Basically, Greek government submitted law parliament require students school staff produce two tests week (home tests) show lack coronavirus infection. Schools legally required collect data.

The issue schools due open next week tests yet ordered government (10 million required initial order).

The Greek government also bad track record organising anything. beginning pandemic called fire ordering adult masks small school children covered entire faces. also sold Cisco citizens' data e-learning platform negotiations. 

So, effectively, next week schools open legal requirement negative test school little chance tests available. Greece also people ICU ever pandemic government decided opening regardless economy survive thought it, recently saw numbers COVID took personal fear away bit, added feelings want stay place. 

If you‚Äôre 18-29 age range, COVID really major risk foe you. checked numbers long ago, year COVID, 1,700 people age range died. 1,700. Taking account everything: preexisting conditions, risk factors, weight, etc. 1,700 died. 

Comparatively, 2,400 people age range died flu 2018-2019. So, you‚Äôre age range, COVID truly worse flu. 

The vast, vast, vast majority deaths come older Americans. Knowing personal risk minimal, I‚Äôm happy wait little longer ensure older Americans access, people interact others often do. It‚Äôs deadly enough people age range justify jumping place potentially taking vaccine someone who‚Äôs much higher risk. Bold. Daring. Brave. Walensky harming entire effort get vaccines OMG GONNA DIE ANYWAY act. loaded discussion goes beyond seeing surface level. 

There‚Äôs nice way saying this, America lives chasm stupidity. nation‚Äôs anti-science trend reality American culture years. 

Nearly 77% Americans believe angels. 8 10 Americans believe angels.

Americans don‚Äôt seem understand scientific thought. dealing novel virus. science obviously going hanging. took us YEARS understand AIDS. There‚Äôs way going get concrete understand COVID19 short amount time. People‚Äôs educational gaps contributing serious problems. 

Add that, pandemic fell maelstrom American politics.

Sorry, apparently not, I've read post: ""Waiting months (or even one year""

That's fantastic areas without easy access medical refrigeration I‚Äôm hoping like Memorial Day üôÇ So, widespread, stopped courts...not happening time. Cool cool. 

Conspiracy nut...confirmed. Yeah, went nearest Walgreens asked waste avoidance list said no. doesn‚Äôt seem option. I‚Äôll need wait weeks. true, 25 confirmed cases blood clots people AZ vaccine total entire EU + UK. UK alone 12 million AZ jabs, lets go that. Pure math logic here, speculation.
25 12,000,000. (not even including rest Europe numbers easily identifiable many jabs total) is: 0.002083333333% taking AZ issue, whatever may be. Less fact 25 mostly UK.
Either way asteroid head analogy still stands. referring speculation, post-print articles, facts, speculation. think that's forgivable given circumstances.

Nope.

Lying lying. public health emergency, thing we're supposed able complete trust about. There‚Äôs tough discussion people don‚Äôt want AZ vaccine, arguments using becoming less less compelling. It‚Äôs lower efficacy vaccine, ineffective B1.135 (and likely E484K carrying variants), it‚Äôs associated blood disorders younger people, AZ selves constantly obfuscated, misrepresented data mired constant, serious production problems. Public confidence vaccine destroyed. every metric, it‚Äôs worst vaccine. want 'anti vax' paradise I'm still getting vaccinated, want third party app scan info every bar go name public safety? Ok. good point, also perfect comparison.

Israel's borders far, FAR less porous New Jersey's Wisconsin's.

I live Massachusetts. true Mississippi's vaccination rate affect us here, affected states Northeast. Heck, suburbs Boston New Hampshire. Osterholm Ding deserve public floggings....or least personally liable costs therapy meds people bought schtick likely require.

That said, never apologize. Im sure think messaging saving variable humanity. partly NHS, partly Tories power appointing Kate Bingham people, Racism Asians come science. least USA. image world view look like year‚Äôs end. lots doctor friends got Moderna. Mostly two biggest hospitals area giving that. 

My parents also got Moderna first clinic found became eligible Moderna. 

Wife got Pfizer CVS area Pfizer became eligible. 

I'd taken 3 currently available though. said, happy got Pfizer mainly much data coming Israel saying effective is. already COVID 1 shot protected- enjoy gym!  data currently available, I'd also stay away AZ case possible. recommendation might change future depends demographic, currently certainly looks like women significantly often affected compared men. 

Luckily several different vaccines available think vaccine distribution adjusted accordingly soon. hyper focus probably vote certain political party, dislike public schools unions, used ‚Äúgrocery store workers‚Äù talking point pressure teachers schools unvaccinated couple months ago, claim care children. matter diseases one same. businesses receive right one disease, receive all. act surprised someone suggests this. Exactly. Even easy read charts, sure deniers understand (or admit understanding) gravity situation. share data hope sinks in. 

And data shows first five days 2021. reflect current problem drop deaths stopped plateaued started rise again. That's good question. Underreported, maybe even reported? comment said, genetic variability? Maybe happens incorrect administration UK different technique guideline jabs?

We know. hope we'll find soon. TL: didn‚Äôt say coronavirus come Chinese lab, Washington Post disagrees. Period. seriously lack introspection know we‚Äôre back normal don‚Äôt you? covid something deal still live lives. always background, vaccines going cover many people. 3 million day. 6 weeks, we'll okay remember initially thinking AstraZeneca would best bunch last year, wrong Virus run Bodies(Vaxxed, Natural Immunity, Etc) travel could mean spreading variants, no? [Can't even take two seconds Google yourself, Could weaker PR? California. cases dropping rapidly. I'm 3 weeks first Pfizer shot second reason scheduled 4 weeks after. Based 3 weeks first shot already covid months ago think I'm gonna start re-enter society starting going gym. I've really missed gym much people isolated looney... hhaha brand loyalty Research paper referenced US lost half million people single year due disease. hard wrap mind around number watching idiots protest masks fight virus done damage wars country previously rallied together for. can't get objective common enemy fucking infectious disease yet critical part population damned government decided maximize stupid they'd stewing decades directly caused deaths hundreds thousands still alive today.  think anyone denies that. think wave severe previous 3. relief, I've concerned radio silence while! Anyways.. missing point. get back lives quicker follow instructions.

I understand point. agree it.

You missing point. ""get back lives quicker follow instructions"", goal post moved. moved again. moved year now, point Fauci still talking masks DOUBLE masks Biden saying ""maybe small gatherings July 4th"", despite fact then, every adult wants fully vaccinated.

The goal posts stop moving, people sick it. suffering it.

I care anymore neither lot people. succeed original goal. Let's get back life (which 9 months anyway...).  Exactly. vaccine endgame, there's nothing that. Give couple months adults get vaccine, pandemic far restrictions concerned. thus looks younger kids disdain separate ‚Äúmature‚Äù selves ‚Äúannoying little shits‚Äù. talking disease vs. disease scale infectiousness, we?

Also, wonder window concern vaccination? hope get info stuff! astrazeneca news made want mine sooner living america. hurry poke gets approved option.

I got poked moderna Saturday. seen percentages age group took vaccine UK? US seniors willing line jabs? 22 degrees week, want it. Indeed. Like safety measure, vaccines perfect, *really good.* Pfizer vaccine, example, found 94.6% efficacy phase 3 trials. means chance getting virus 20x lower Pfizer vaccine, according Phase 3 study. 

To measure this, enlisted 40,000 people volunteered trial, gave \~20,000 vaccine, \~20,000 placebo. 20,000 received vaccine 9 people got virus. 20,000 receive vaccine, 169 got virus. balanced placebo group vaccine group region demographics, started groups time. this, would expect 0% effective vaccine result number infections, 100% vaccine result zero infections. infer Pfizer vaccine prevented 169-9 = 160 infections, meaning 160/169 = \~95% effective.  Getting vaccination records going school normal thing decades US, good reason too. totally agree, guess causing bit anxiety want know things bend good. know can't answer sure. feeling like got hopes way high spike holidays went huge decline. waited year. year ago, told might take 4 years develop vaccine. help end this, long everyone acts responsibly, long takes. isn‚Äôt yet.  used normal, governmental incompotence happened stopped AZ. embarassing Expect cases start rising two weeks, happened Texas Oof, stinks. got Pfizer one, sure may change things. industries also lockdown reduce staff services case numbers go up. grocery stores one operated full staff lockdowns remaining extremely public. also subjected incredible amount abuse general public restrictions, many refusing common sense restrictions designed help protect workers. argue antimaskers, least able reduce risk getting sick so. understand point, since discussing AIDS Dengue. everyone Canada gets AZ. 1 in100 000 get blood clots 40% death rate... 120 die. ( Canada 20 000 deaths due covid)  really comparing Covid smallpox (or polio), you? ignorance showing. shots cvs? switch pharmacies too? nuts me, school systems thought could give everyone vaccine ahead others, pretend like nothing going happen said they're opening schools even hybrid model. remember MSNBC whole story ‚ÄúLA County Variant‚Äù theorizing could avoid vaccinations. 3 weeks ago. Haven‚Äôt heard word since. Journalism throughout pandemic pathetic made lose respect lot places thought high integrity. also said hospitalizations would hit 195,000 mid-to-late March. late March hospitalizations 7 day average 36,000. 

The best thing Osterholm thing anyone spreading misinformation: ignore him. CDC FDA said safe, thats good enough Americans. FDA's final decision approve vaccines decided independent panel academic scientists, what's purpose 4 states coming ""western scientific safety panel"" confirm vaccines safe?

So panel also reviews workplace safety make care defision safety vaccines? input safety vaccines give confidence, instead gives impression somehow final decision approve vaccines somehow influenced Trump administration believe. seeing significant increase yet.  well CF clearly huge minority group lol Substantially higher 1:100K, absolutely. Could genetic component - remember reading medication that's used Scandinavia minor genetic difference makes react differently larger part population. Funny say people ask say Moderna, they‚Äôre like oh‚Ä¶.I got Pfizer. Like look Moderna. referring sub reddit, yes. funny - whole time people saying ""if people want wear one respect them"" which, comment shows, always bullshit.  right, that's reddit all!
/s Canada's perspective huge deal. many AZ vaccines right now, still millions 55 vaccinate, majority vaccines Pfizer Moderna. think they're overly cautious. question much damage cause increased vaccine hesitancy. fair job, kindness heart. Everyone else wears masks job, he? Biontech's vaccine developed Germany largely funded German government (they later partnered pfizer april trials) AstraZeneca developed UK (Oxford). 
a large portion exports june (150 million) going US. even first shipment vaccines US flew Belgium. 
At time could hear US channels ""OUR US VACCINES"", ""Look USA developed"", ""'MURICA"", ""WE IT"", ""TRUMP"", ""WARPSPEED"", ""YEEHAAW"" etc. vaccines mostly developed EU aint worth mentioning. 

The EU late, yes, expanding production facilities placing orders doesnt change part Europe played initial development.  
 
not mention US administration tried buy Biontech threatened share vaccine states think ""hostile"" (from administrations POV) efforts pirate european supplies. 
 
 
the transatlantic parnership dead. hope EU finally moves parasocial relationship.  rural better... parents poconos fit 1A 6 different ways.. got it


There's 1 rite aid miles, hospital... baby boomers stay till midnight spam F5

It's 20yo saying they're smokers China never held accountable unfortunately. think respectfully disagree. 1 100,000 blood clots, absolute worst case, seems still favourable risk/reward versus alternative coronavirus. 

I know always think drugs purely utilitarian matter opinion. problem vaccine authorized emergency use, still live clinical trials u til 2023. lockdowns end, emergency ends it.

They unable administrate vaccines enforce vaccine ‚Äúpassport‚Äù program. attempting promise, cause distributors work harder normal?

Is possible overcoordination ‚Äúslow‚Äù process? example, forcing every hospital/nursing home/care facility administer vaccines lightning speed, accurately log file data? dont remember cdc started breaking wasnt pretty recently. cant seem find historical data site :(  people bad side effects doses. guess without knowing everyone assumes virtue asymptomatic infection reduction. reduces ability test positive seems unlikely reduce ability transmit disease. Ditto.

My retired, diabetic, lyme disease, overweight dad got shot...

All 20yo kids got months ago saying smokers staying till midnight spamming F5 sounds like haven‚Äôt paying attention‚Äîthey‚Äôve warning us weeks relax guard open things Biden sharply criticised Republican governors Texas Mississippi decision end state mask-wearing mandates, describing move ‚Äúbig No. That's literally vaccine for. population large vaccinated (or opportunity be), that's protected. Nah.

Major companies already putting signal come back Bay.

A couple made premature announcements leave, they'll reverse it. real interesting data come next year millions mRNA vaccines millions inactivated adenovirus, get compare difference many aspects, like longevity, resulting ""ratio"" effectiveness responses memory b cells, killer tcells, antibodies, upon later reinfections challenges, even long term cross reactiveness like future viruses. That's seems like yes cases going back states hospitalizations increasing. Based what? J&amp;J stored temperature Moderna, normal refrigerator temperature (36-46F 2-8C). Moderna approved stay temperature full month. Pfizer stay normal freezer temps (\~0F) 2 weeks. think J&amp;J really much logistical advantage storage requirements, one dose nature gives huge edge. cunning linguist wrote article, even fooled bots! Carrying someone high risk like husband. others family ending like good friend mine zero risk factors, possibly permanent lung damage needed inhalers six months. people life need protect. hey, see you‚Äôre always pleasant others, maybe don‚Äôt. need 'fairness doctrine' applies anything word ""news"" name. can‚Äôt remember I‚Äôm allowed link here, google jnj penis graph. 6 weeks it‚Äôs 80% range. would definitely hit herd immunity everyone got (seriously Moderna Pfizer would loved see 66%) don‚Äôt think anyone gets vaccine criticized pick. Focus people won‚Äôt get one! cdc released study today saying vaccines reduce transmission. shit what? old side effect feel like fever? I‚Äôm tired this. Every time think reaching end hear good news, met kind statements. ‚ÄúImpending doom‚Äù ‚Äúthings aren‚Äôt looking great‚Äù etc. It‚Äôs fucking tiring hate it. can‚Äôt stand anymore want someone tell definitive timeline shit over, instead giving vague answers moving goalposts. can‚Äôt anymore. yes - ‚ÄúTo estimate Earth Overshoot Day arrive, Global Footprint Network calculates number days given year Earth enough biocapacity provide humans' total ecological footprint. rest year represents ""global overshoot.

When footprint consumption worldwide exceeds biocapacity, authors assert humans exceeding regenerative capacity Earth's ecosystems. year, estimate humans using natural resources 1.7 times faster ecosystems regenerate ‚Äì or, put another way, consuming 1.7 Earths.

As example, ecological footprint France 4.7 global hectares per person, global biocapacity 1.7 hectares per person. Therefore, would take (4.7/ 1.7 =) 2.8 Earths everyone lived like human uses hundreds tons natural resources lifetime. That‚Äôs major reason I‚Äôm children- there‚Äôs 8 billion us (losing 2.7 million tiny blip comparison), don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair bring someone existence dying, drowning planet. according projections reach herd immunity end 2021? CBS‚Äôs Face Nation Sunday, Dr Fauci said ""children clearly wind getting infected"", play kids despite parents vaccinated. Dr Fauci said expects kids elementary school probably vaccinated early next year, high schoolers hopefully starting get jab autumn. told NBC's Meet Press 28 February: ""If project realistically we'll get enough data able say elementary school children able vaccinated, would think would be, earliest, end year. said (now) intend file approval end Q2. corporate speak ""maybe June"". thought could make May, said May. really UK, always get found eventually. We're still seeing people held accountable infected blood nightmare happened 70s Ah ok, good lol jobs, like office work data entry, looks like real work-from-home future finally here. suspect individual infected test negative symptoms? benefit taking second test don‚Äôt quarantine longer negative. don‚Äôt understand think they‚Äôre sick?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly. Plus office would expect sit cubicle night alone, 50 feet nearest occupied cubicle, wear mask job requires answering hundred calls night. Sorry reason person already exposed COVID needs mask near anyone else, especially I'm sitting desk. Half calls get Indian immigrants issues understanding English good day, much less muffled voice coming phone. home that. Half country immunised, 10%... Covid non-issue September. I'm going downvote really hope wrong elderly weaker immune systems, therefore immune response different younger people presented vaccine. likely factor clotting response simply age, hormonal differences.

Interestingly, elderly also likely cardiovascular issues. Hong Kong, numerous fatalities may link vaccines pretty much people died elderly.  GLOBAL CAPITALIST CONSPIRACY

p.s. spoil fun profit vaccine ya spanner read article contains alot good information. similar across UK could explain lower numbers side effect compared countries Wait, NY *now* opening eligibility 75 older? common take two tests asymptomatic people? 

Also, incentive take another test already believe asymptomatic? + immunity 2020 definitely helping lot! Well we‚Äôve lost extra 2.7 million people Covid far, we‚Äôve got going us. problem lies overconsumption unsustainable bullshit people seem love. big fans minimalism, stuff like r/buyitforlife, grow food, don‚Äôt dump chemicals lawn, don‚Äôt buy much gasoline. Corporate pollution, etc causes massive proportion worlds issues environmentally socially, 2 kids.  wonderful news. means vaccine effective enough current variants prevent significant outbreaks. UK would fall criteria doesn‚Äôt receive enough sun light winter prevent vit deficiency  it‚Äôs 400 fatalities 100 million? That‚Äôs pretty good odds, I‚Äôm pretty sure 400 people choke Olives outta 100 million. think you‚Äôre lumping vaccine hesitant vaccine refusers. client trained engineer, pretty high level manager company wait see group. says engineer cautious. suspect full FDA approval may make difference him. 

The wait see group aren‚Äôt anti vaccine. They‚Äôre nervous. fucking stupid. actually working good amongst olders. People PTSD, claustrophobic anxiety, autism, skin conditions, hearing loss, etc. reasons disliking masks. People like say, ""It's half hour grocery store!"" forgetting people wear one 8 hour shift.

I'll wear mine wherever required, panic disorder acne-prone skin improve mandate dropped. (By then, I'll likely fully vaccinated.) Right? even issue? want appease certain politician's supporters, given Nino Vitale, biggest anti-masker one Dewine's biggest critics, voted called blatantly unconstitutional, tell blood chance law surviving Ontario? Ah goes ways. see. Thanks response. Thanks! Reality suggests unless elderly high risk, covid19 much threat you.

Again, understand talking about. Keep clinging mattress line though, eventually someone think witty guess. lol we‚Äôve constantly heard ‚Äújust wait there‚Äôs vaccine, wait there‚Äôs vaccine‚Äù it‚Äôs they‚Äôre still trying this, fuck outta here. Canada? 

Since 22% population speaking French mean give two shits France does? I‚Äôd wager vast majority French Canadians couldn‚Äôt pick Macron lineup. know couldn‚Äôt. Every single one us could recognize Queen though, helps face money. sure, we‚Äôre basically France :/

The AZ suspension certain age groups little overly cautious theatre point- supply isn‚Äôt big enough majority provinces vaccinating anyone 55 anyway. area opened 75+. get 1.5 million doses US next days, don‚Äôt scheduled delivery AZ doses sometime June- point may even really need them. So, really- none really matters.

It‚Äôs clear comments carry hatred toward France, it‚Äôs bled hating French people general. Maybe spend time reflecting that. Yea that‚Äôs society works. Businesses schools mandatory vaccines ages. large events like said places probably require test spread near 0. Reason ton people died covid inoculation one effective tools medical history. It‚Äôs going mandated government sure private entities may require like require shirts, good behavior vaccines.  guy asked, medical expert scientist anything, wife talked extensively - first daughter killed virus attacked heart; probably contracted week born. NICU two weeks died; autopsy suggested virus caused heart attack. 

Our second daughter born March 2020. imagine played hypothetical billion different ways.  


Here came with:

1. Ask OBGYN medical opinion. 
2. Get vaccine first trimester. first trimester? reaction vaccines cause side effect can, themselves, cause miscarriage. fever cause miscarriage. Fever common side effect. Still, ask OBGYN
3. Otherwise, get vaccine. baby getting vaccine too, least getting protection. breastfeeding, although understanding ""passive"" protection active - baby antibodies, producing - daughter get vaccine soon available age. see lot, bodies forget antibodies gone. mumps antibodies, get infected mumps, body start pumping antibodies like they're going fashion. Surely means problem, unless I'm misunderstanding costs wearing mask low, government mandate mask use indefinitely? criteria removing mandate? actual fuck about? Congratulations! spreading lies like always? cute. really know distribution across UK data Scotland indicates heavy skew towards older people AZ vaccine. live rural MI 95 + % people county still wearing masks stores. also hitting target goals vaccines yet increase cases hospitalizations last week here. know why. said inject bleach lungs? people act like you‚Äôre monster cos you‚Äôd rather job (and id guess better) home save time money commuting. elderly weaker immune systems, therefore immune response different younger people presented vaccine. likely factor clotting response simply age, hormonal differences. Delicious! mad? long China stonewalls investigation, never evidence, therefore never consider possibility virus escaped accidentally lab.

Got it. truly amazing start year 100 million shots 100 days seemed ambitious, today 100 million shots 30 days could considered ""worst case"" scenario.  7 day average 2.497 last tuesday, we've seen quarter million rise last week!

The tuesday numbers 2.435, 2.151, 1.942. less month average rising 200,000 week. Thanks! That‚Äôs bad. really accelerating summer diet plan lol.

How whole covid case? loss smell whole time? like second third day tangible symptoms, little freaked first sign intense respiratory stuff still way... Pfft. realize that's Gen X age Gen X built much modern internet right? 

Most boomers 55 70 older. 

Millennials turning 40 now. vaccine 100%. vaccinated interact awhile inside someone Covid neither wear masks probably get 100 people, vaccinated, interact person odds around 5-30 get Covid. someone Covid still limit contact people regardless people vaccinated not. Canada thanksgiving :( one 90% effective vaccine, two. plus another vaccine 80% still higher dreamed last year. see turkiest turks ever turk believe vaccine turkish. Yes. Every vaccine theory vaccines worked meant basically impossible route chosen work. site graph from? (literally. like looks, curious look states myself) That‚Äôs exciting. Two weeks since second dose yesterday I‚Äôm planning go restaurant soon. long long break world almost Also UK man 50, AZ vaccine, exactly 0% concerned side effects. trust UK healthcare.  issues Moderna (fatigue nauseous 4-5 days), afaik never confirmed COVID case.

Surely wife would've *also* caught anyway, tested past, minimal side-effects second shot. % people straight want dwarfs % can't it. even close. cant stand talking point. I‚Äôm gonna continue everything full force till least Q3, it‚Äôll re-evaluate situation see it‚Äôs safe let anything. Even know lot young people got key workers etc  don‚Äôt allow negative news stories sub anymore! Damn. first time I've read anyone invoking Pasteur's name regarding topic! Truly man culture! there, going away.

I guess that's thinking behind vaccination campaigns. race really suffocate evasive lethal variants. That's really promising. I'm English I've one. randomly selected. know someone. also friend one. Yeah go beach sunny day UK see scar place arm adults. subtle nearly always see look ‚Äúyour social medical paranoia‚Äù

Where come from? They've bad months since November published study. already controversial turned people away vaccine. I'm already getting headache much Giants tix cost. 1. What‚Äôs standard ending mask mandates? August 30 (or insert another date)? hospitalizations deaths reach certain threshold? That‚Äôs want‚Äîsolid guidance. ‚ÄúA weeks/months‚Äù we‚Äôve heard year now‚Äîat point, refrain means ‚Äúindefinite.‚Äù government going mandate restrict something, need create criteria mandate restriction.

2. flu also cause long-term effects kids. government doesn‚Äôt shut half society it.

3. There‚Äôs way avoid creating vaccine-resistant strain variant unless hit 0 transmission globally. never happen. cannot keep restrictions spread, hospitalizations, deaths low hopes reaching unattainable goal. reopen eventually, solution variants resist current vaccines new vaccines given annual (or as-needed) basis. That‚Äôs flu. seems like public encouragement masking transit would great - public health messages, free paper mask dispensers airports train stations, etc. Since would dealing covid, simpler, cheaper masks would fine would fashion masks. I've got couple nice print ones I'm looking forward wearing I'm vaccinated instead surgical masks N95s. 

Maybe mask dispensers grocery stores doctors' offices - sneezy, grab mask like get sanitizer clean cart. toss walk door. Yoooo add count! That's simply true. Per person, paid 5-6 times less (see post source). Totally agree point. think that‚Äôs one many reasons don‚Äôt see huge different CA Florida example. certain subset Americans always going wear masks stay home another group always ignore rules. don‚Äôt think many people relied guidelines mandates covid safety advice. stricter govs defense, getting % careful big impact exponential spread. sister mid 30s active (ex-college athlete, runs marathons). got COVID around Christmas. never hospitalized described symptoms ""similar flu"", 3 months later chronic fatigue still gets short breath activities. number types cases young people far outstrip complications caused vaccines. can‚Äôt get haircut He'll popular abroad.

Good, be, popular too.

COVID **global** problem, needs solved globally.

Do want countries huge vector COVID variants might deadly immune vaccines arise? sure fuck don't.

Once we've got vaccinated, rest developed world need solve problem globally, countries can't afford it, health affects health **directly** here. Okay, thank you. That's reassuring. originated spread help models future disease spreads help future outbreaks airborne viruses. Maybe remember travelers UK brought British variant country December, resulted highest death rate worldwide January. That‚Äôs thinking. projection use lower rates (the ‚Äú7-day rolling average‚Äù 1,730,507)? reality: Germany uses report limit vaccine usage doesn‚Äôt supply reach vaccine targets. 

Only anti-vaxxers support EU this.   Lowest age 24 year old healthy women 55?

this also dangerous hospitalized case covid, comparable trip icu anything? confused - ultrasound imaging - it‚Äôs also used cleaning parking sensors.
Ultrasonic actuators actually cheap. disagree mandated vaccinations long past available. 

I agree 100%, arguing people want mandates stay cases reached manageable levels. There's nothing wrong encouraging culture masking, like one East Asia/SEA, that's saying government needs continue mandating masks pro-mask people seem conflate two arguments. Yeah realistically ""world"" well - handful countries well (Israel, UAE, USA, UK, Chile... that's it)

And even within that, UK's number bit misleading compared others ""first doses only"" - leaving 3 months doses, rather 2-3 weeks, although UK vaccinated half population, we're actually 1/4 way total program concerns correct? going say something like facts, figures, studies *something* back up. runs CDC, supposed full scientists. Can‚Äôt wait insurance provider gets buy data raise payments +8% scan mcdonalds often. 

Or, let‚Äôs honest, kind tech always discriminates maybe likely scenario black people sudden get expensive insurance prices since geolocations scan *statistically* likely lead claim. 
You don‚Äôt see level data harvesting could harmful? fact want everyone keep wearing masks vaccines widely available. direct link quotes origination, forgive incorrect, appears directly contradicted today saying ""we kind almost see feel speech? Idk...I guess feel like hyperbole, flip-flopping emotionally charged statements masquerading ""science"" harmful helpful.  kind data coming Israel large vaccinated population tracking pretty carefully. tried post link removed bot ""political"" (it wasn't) Google articles look main page sub. Sweden. Alot retired nurses helping vaccination, shocked large number newer nurses doesn‚Äôt aspirate. CARRIER FULLY VACCINATED?

I feel like end back square one travel normalcy wise answer question yes.

;( No, asked why, concerned children‚Äôs futures, you‚Äôd first place. next generations ones going dealing serious effects global warming. honest question I‚Äôm still interested answer. Yeah, lot places went fully open instant first teachers got first shot. That‚Äôs works... don‚Äôt get immunity second shot plus two weeks. hey, least waited all. teach NC, schools open since mid late fall teachers weren‚Äôt eligible vaccines February 24th... it‚Äôs rough school year! I‚Äôm arguing 1 shot gives better protection 2 personal standpoint. Clearly two better. 

I don‚Äôt think 2 shots gives better protection entire population compared country nearly double amount people vaccinated, real world data backing up. There‚Äôs good chance (based seen UK) would basically done pandemic US point, instead averaging 5,000 new admissions 1,000 deaths day.

The clinical trail never tested two dose verse one dose strategy term would save lives entire population end pandemic sooner. Trying use clinical trials prove something don‚Äôt isn‚Äôt science. Hearing public health officials use trials excuse stick two doses extremely disappointing. Hearing people defend saying ‚Äòthey following science‚Äô makes want pull hair out. Agreed, cheap point well made, but, ho hum :) 

I've actually impressed amount vaccines administered, the, even side effects??? almost like believe science :) mean time, try looking places carrying J&amp;J. know area (Central Ohio) places J&amp;J give could luck found similar place. Experts might answers. hacks answers. discussion allocating vaccine doses based demand different states? Great. need vaccinate half population. save time money england! Wild guess, cabin fever northern states might contributing factor. States cold winters bigger surges people going spring.

Infrastructure could also factor, since places warmer year round tend outdoor infrastructure built (outdoor shopping malls, restaurants outdoor patios, open air schools etc.) compared places like Michigan cold winters. people thing Michigan (shopping, eating out, going school) higher risk setting people thing California. kills (well literally) people driving alone car windows rolled wearing mask. Like, protecting from, protecting yourself? sealed car air flow. get it. virus radioactive.  country, travellers expected abide COVID-19 restrictions citizens. Currently, travel prohibited different areas country.

The trouble tourists ""abide Covid-19 restrictions citizens"", want party care natives. Whereabouts prion-like motif? feel stupid, used get appointment 2nd I'm excited unless missed something, can't tell vaccine I'm getting. Like end day matter assume one Moderna Pfizer since mentioned two I'm still curious though. one people hoping pandemic goes forever, right? good news. I‚Äôm still going wait I‚Äôm fully vaccinated go gym. I‚Äôve already one dose 2 weeks ago though I‚Äôll fully vaccinated exactly 4 weeks. wait 4 weeks. think answer ‚Äòwe don‚Äôt know‚Äô. Still research constantly done heard little re-infections I‚Äôd imagine protection quite good. key thing long last. don‚Äôt understand vaccines work lol Yeah really unlikely ""unless"" clause totally right tried register closest spot appointments open hour half away nothing 19th, Made appointment anyway wife I, figured drive worth it. 

At lunch, wife got separate calls Saratoga County Health department scheduled us vaccines two days now, 10 minutes road. county Vaccine interest list put names on, figured would fill last minute cancellations such, used make appointments.

If Saratoga County, still put name list. think going everyone eligible signed up, might worth add name case something open sooner able get appointment multiple media outlets, Monroe County Coroner Bob Hill asking statewide audit COVID-19 reported deaths.  concern person tested positive COVID-19 point, that's death classified as, misleading.  seen Monroe County coroner said, seen anybody's response yet, think possible,"" Sangamon County Coroner Jim Allmon said. ""Some deaths classified inappropriately middle pandemic, yeah. think intentionally done? seen evidence   completely agree America making right choice November, 148 million americans dying huge exaggeration. think we‚Äôd worse position election went differently though preferable situation low case numbers vaccination order decrease selective pressure trigger escape mutant end square one again. hey...fuck immunology science, right? Go back circlejerking. States need coordinated. Hearing horror stories people states serious risk still gotten it, meanwhile roommates (they're 20-22, healthy) gotten it. claim know remedied, something feel right. chance I'm using oooh. Let load 3D printer. You‚Äôve obviously never heard honey vinegar. one going listen little kid throwing tantrum even speaking truth power. 

Next Canada's timelines dependent AZ much. Procurement currently Pfizer Moderna bulk vaccinations. AZ even firmed delivery schedule Canada. pretty fantastically, recent swing happened quickly - even 3 weeks ago pretty well.

It's thought may due transmissible variant probably right Works Cuba. Cardiovascular issues usually related non-communicable disease atheroma, high cholesterol. COVID-19 infectious disease - hence involvement immune response dulls age protective eg. Spanish flu. Although disease types could work tandem due apparent increase clotting risk covid itself? - thought. Hong Kong fatalities clearly linked vaccine use (not conditions), &amp; vaxx? seems like public consensus health officials call tighter restrictions, it‚Äôs following science. say loosen restrictions, it‚Äôs politics health experts muzzled. Almost nice never said shouldn‚Äôt able to. Anyone point forward able wear mask desire, disagree mandated vaccinations long past available. way disagree idea people making personal choices ‚Äúover here‚Äù?

And delivering completely opposite messaging safety vaccine contradictory?  kids! thrived one district near creating permanent online option. Kids also chance participate extracurriculars campus go campus things like labs. school year awful us (for students teachers) I‚Äôm also interested see long term, benefit kids. Might make bad stuff. 1.2 million delivered last Tuesday, good head fricking CDC think use language different ""suggests"" present actual studies facts. No, means June latest. someone coming Philippines disappointing government response well (but bad yours), same. drink bleach Cities counties TX allowed institute mask mandates. [Austin legal fight state every private business I've Houston still requires masks (or least shows sign), effect there's real difference. provided zero backing information anywhere thread frankly even post history.

Who's making shit up? Well kids 12 years vaccine 2022. guarantee parents kids adhere guidelines another 12 months. would‚Äôve said that‚Äôs probably realistic disease 1% death rate killing 45% population. Heck, I‚Äôm sure Confederate flags Capitol every day Southerners‚Äô offices. mom dad got theirs. It‚Äôs intriguing. means June, agree.  Ahh see, makes sense! Sorry, see lot people saying antibodies disappear months thinking protection goes it. mistake! NHS fully responsible vaccine rollout unlike every mess pandemic given private government contractor. stop. clear repeat talking points picked elsewhere capable backing anything stated without dredging fox breitbart bullshit. Oh ok, make eligibility herd immunity percentage increase? Sorry, I‚Äôm truly dumbest understanding this, want badly understand...   Counting deaths done seeing increase average. Someone several issues die covid. covid death could go unreported. can't recorded wrong total number deaths, easily compared yearly average. chance experiencing lifelong complications is. real data starts finally trickle in... give shit people like me? want shut sit idly people make shit up?  know people gotten shots literally asked single thing. show license think age verification literally nothing else. ban export vaccines

Correct. didn‚Äôt expect see admit lying. Yap, save elderly. Young healthy people dying acceptable. Frankly seeing someone supposed professional managing important crisis well go script, present almost actual facts data warn ""impending doom"" feeling ""nausea"" completely killed credibility me. need someone else getting front public going hyperbolic heaping doom gloom. need someone understand present facts make us feel like plan. going listen anything else says. bad, high hopes could restore CDC semblance credibility. Chicago, I've noticed big change within last two weeks. city performative restrictions, clear majority people give shit anymore, genuinely think I've seen maskless faces past month past year. think city drag feet regarding large events, surprised things feel pretty normal late May. Thank much. I'm grateful know modeler well figured out. That‚Äôs live. Swag.  16 comments, downvoted. 

Do really think come like able? 

Go back commenting Eve something... said within end Q2. corporate speak within end Q2. Also opened vaccine everyone yesterday. Man time flies. stand first sentence, clearly accept lack relation issue hand. I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs ‚Äòlive virus‚Äô I‚Äôm open corrected. Non verbal communication pretty big one. lose lot interaction without it. article state students/staff selected. 1% 159,000 showing Covid positive great news book. Even people taking seriously aren‚Äôt tested, wouldn‚Äôt end positive still infect say taking seriously choose tested?  spent 2020 scared shitless, that's signed vaccine trial got vaccinated.

My part done. know lot people scared ""two-tier society"" vaccinated unvaccinated, that's based science. millions people US fully vaccinated, nothing people scared pretending like is.

The reality messages need tailored people *not* vaccinated. hard say, ""I know difficult scary, people getting vaccinated every day; soon, going one them. Make appointment soon remember fully vaccinated, part get US back way used be.""

Keep showing vaccinated people seeing grandkids, BBQs, going dinner, show people vaccinated world look like! Talk strides made Israel they're basically going back normal thanks people getting vaccinated, people like miss families friends want things go back way before! 

That's get shots arms, amateur-hour ""COVID 19 BAD"" nonsense. Spain teacher aged 43 died also days receiving AZ vaccine. bold statement month since every school staff person k-12 eligible presidential decree.

Before federal government line schools safe teachers vaccinated. seems they're trying rewrite story. (Reuters) - Germany‚Äôs vaccine regulator said Tuesday recorded 31 cases rare blood clot brain, nine resulted deaths, people received COVID-19 vaccine AstraZeneca.
The Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) said registered 31 cases clots cerebral veins - known sinus vein thrombosis, CSVT - 19 deficiency blood platelets thrombocytepenia.
In nine cases, affected people died. exception two cases, reports concerned women ages 20 63. two men 36 57 years old.

That's entire article. Definitely. tangential factors caused increases deaths like mentioned. least 2/3 attributed Covid directly according CDC. Though would personally argue person died due inability see doctor since Covid overloading system direct result (through indirect means) Covid. would guess, lifted possible way public accepts reimposition mandate.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Let's set floor incredible is.

The lowest positive identified 7-day average cases OH March 1500 per day. That's 45,000 positive identified cases minimum. 11.7 million people. 0.38 percent Ohioans got COVID March (it's that, time extra math).

Let's assume positives came March (probably not). 34 positive cases 1.8 million March .0018 percent vaccinated Ohioans tested positive.

At minimum, 211 times likely catch positively-identified case COVID unvaccinated Ohio.

Extrapolate whole population. full vaccination rate accounting herd immunity benefit, talking closer 7-10 cases per day 1500. end April *start*. Sure - another redditor posted sub last week it. 

Probably cleanest way verify death numbers fudged look total excess deaths - year year vs. COVID deaths can't (easily) hide dead bodies, even accurately classified.

The NY Times solid data topic another article at: Florida shows 35,000 excess deaths vs. 30,000 reported COVID-19 deaths. roughly line national data (556k vs. 484k), I'm sure much death hiding states (ahem - Kentucky, Oklahoma, California, WV - showing least 30-50% fewer COVID deaths total increased year year deaths). people like feel deserve feeling safety lockdowns supposed represent? everybody supposed suffer years restrictions could feel safe disease everybody owes that?

Gtfo hypocrisy. Go doctor ASAP matter tell posible vaccine """"totally safe""""... New York variant Actual (=good correct) information spreading isnt problem.  fuck live?? That‚Äôs dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever heard. really? sure refer to. still enough state. saying want go back might disrupt routine. routine awesome. unions using lobby benefits go back (Seattle). Cool story. He's already said run again. Barring kind health issue really see changing. No, Michigan. three worst cities per capita COVID rates, another 5 cities top 20 worst (so 8/20).

It‚Äôs pretty bad here. looked appears 800k mark around inauguration time...

I say satisfaction % would a-hole office, number seems roughly correct. really 29 year old?

Because feel like is... Michigan. Pretty much epicenter COVID. think east coast worst states, we‚Äôve got three worst cities country per capita COVID rates (and like 5 top 20) believe government went way far. virus mutates around vaccines, really going another series lockdowns? No, way perpetual lockdown lies. sustainable way deal viruses. free, still want put information health insurance.

I health insurance CVS site asked drivers license info social security number, got Pfizer vaccine dose yesterday.

If health insurance going ask health insurance info, parents, could say put drivers license info, free regardless though. always wanted wear masks bad. can‚Äôt stand drawing attention myself, work yard. feel dude, I'm same, exahusting, one never really confident times... Good news good news. Thank god US good mass distribution production, response Covid pretty bad least vaccine production first class. I've saying weeks...hottest tourist location Country. You‚Äôre really don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted white nationalist talking point? governors covering deaths purpose

I'd keep vaccinating senior right Yeah, I'm concerned us hitting wall soon lot people wanting get it. friend Facebook actively trying get people get it. unfriend much crazy. Who‚Äôs betraying him? UK online system people self-report vaccine/ medication side-effects professionals too. reports published weekly would think extremely unlikely kind coverup relatives would go tabloids was.

You download full data seeing reported side effects. self-reported quite amusing ones, including 'crying' side effect. done 12 months ago mess. I'm afraid ask... peanut butter shot? Definitely. need enough cases get narrow enough credible interval. trial interim point unblind positives (at something like 50-100 cases) final point that's also based time passed get sufficient safety data. unblind even know whether cases vaccine placebo group. 

If vaccine production issue really running larger trials though. Israel's rollout unblinded trial, essentially, since health care system fully opened Pfizer. Look much data gotten us - Pfizer. bit sad see thing repeated countries vaccines. set goal December singe shot even administered. ambitious goal first announced it. limited understanding repeating read another thread, body recognizes second time goes attack, that's sign body supposed do. Good getting shots. please wait 14 days post 2nd dose, go blast.

By time, likely protected serious illness inhale Sars-CoV-2 virus, body able fully kill exhale yourself.

Your body MAY able already post 1st dose, science topic certain waiting period. ‚Äúr‚Äù number people get virus one person. 

So r 1 means average one person gets infected another person. course, r one would mean number cases remains flat , infected person replaced another infected person. 

An r 2 would mean 2 people would get infected everyone one person, means cases would double week week.

An r less 1 means cases dropping, 1 means cases rising week week. virus disappear r value 1 certain period time, smaller number fewer cases week week. r .53 means half person infected average person infected, meaning cases dropping half week week. That‚Äôs insanely good want Covid cases disappear.

In terms flu, depends time winter, flu cases rapidly like January, lessen March April mostly goes away spring. don‚Äôt really measure r -rate usually isn‚Äôt important, it‚Äôs probably like 1.1 worst things. Absolutely zero chance. even finishes term,

Do think Karens refuse wear mask go get vaccine? I'm already seeing versions shit Twitter re: Florida. ""Vaccines work"" new ""masks work."" pure superstition. Looks like outbreaks correctional facilities, unfortunate avoidable. Whatever one thinks prisoners ""deserve"" vaccine not, vaccinate still strain hospital resources infections still spill community. administering Covishield vaccine, person condition thrombocytopenia (Abnormally low platelets), shot given caution.

In Florida scheduling vaccine appointment CVS add appointments throughout day, click time fast enough disappear literally within seconds, pop throughout day need book once.

I refreshed page every 5 minutes one popped up, got this! Except trending downward majority states. Hopefully blip least smaller wave.  answer personal choice, really want masks every single face look unacceptable need see faces. however sick good wear mask avoid getting people sick.

so short yes sick. want widespread like now. Simplicity messaging vaccines general public. Think smart/dumb average person is, 50% people dumber. completely fair. 

Not argument made comment responded to. say 250M get 240M L say 200M get 240M W say 20% higher new goal was. fairly obvious give opponents ammo like making goals hard hit. 

I little doubt current administrations best interest keep vaccines going fastest rate can. peoples best interest get vaccines arms asap.  Mainly Spring break kids bringing place acting like idiots. hospital Dr office closures absolutely contributed this. Every day someone shows doctor must admitted hospital. replace dr visit telehealth, people end dying home see huge increase deaths home 2020. Osterholm: job scare people wits, scare wits. wouldn't, options. awful Brazil reference vaccine campaign.

And government denial. cold mutates, stuff outside virus change hence catch multiple times. Covid mutated hence different strains however seems general anti body help I‚Äôll definitely wearing mask ever go movie theater I‚Äôm plane. Yet FUCKING Germany maybe get 11%. Fuck fuck Also note people vaccine already developed good level protection actually population probably even higher level protection! Good news!
 
Still thousand positive cases yesterday, lot feel different time we‚Äôre top it.  Wow. thumbnail place regularly go to. Never though would live see day. without saying anything, that's trick Good course ultrasounds created equal terms frequency, beam size, etc., maybe none units would appropriate therapy discussed here. ultrasound non-invasive completely harmless, practical therapy COVID cases would godsend.  some, lucas county (Toledo) spiking. It‚Äôs interesting 3 Cs increasing. really screenshot sub last April/May...utter despair reigned! remember briefing got Nancy Messonier cancelled last year? Would considered wreckless? 
I agree saying except one little lift mask mandates pretty much one going listen try reinstate them

The CDC carries incredible amount power here. mask recommendation holds authority state-level mandates, we've already seen places like Texas Florida basically 100% large businesses still require masks.

But yeah overall right. CDC want people lie vaccinated. wish they'd honest say instead fighting lies lies. personally, didn‚Äôt feel much anything. Definitely little sore around area shot lasted days. felt slightly warmer following day, also mild renovations son‚Äôs room, attributed elevated temp. daughter worst feeling sick prior shot, compounded onto itself. also experienced numbness arm(shot area). youngest, shook everything day later. Wife fine. mid 70‚Äôs parents MIL fine after. all, success book. everyone get back things pandemic. I‚Äôm glad people getting wish best. still like ""freeloaders""... god wish reddit gold left give one. state that, mind asking?  Bmi pretty useless individual scale, macro scale looking large populations better indicator overall health population Maybe Vit deficiency, common northerly countries (Vit moderates immune responses prevent excessive reaction infection, might expect excess reactions, like clotting, vaccine simulates infection countries Vit deficiency). single part comment true  Remember President want sick cruise ship passengers come ashore want cases count numbers?

Good times! Seems isn‚Äôt evidence support particular theory origin virus, whether accident design. 

It comes trust. trust China‚Äôs explanations? No. 

But get me? Nothing. 

Can someone explain origin matters much? make China pay, somehow? Curiosity? is, IMHO, obvious seasonality/weather play here.

The North/Northeast ramping hard South/Southwest things declining. Mostly regardless policies particular state. family signed doses since opens next days. go vaccination doses take time fully take effect plans. might want temper enthusiasm NHS far perfect. Staff terrible job preventing spread covid within hospitals - almost 50% positive cases hospitals contracted within hospitals. far many cases people went hospitals reasons unrelated covid, caught covid died. 

The failure maintain normal services things like cancer diagnosis treatment unforgivable. Even community level GP dentist closures lead unnecessary deaths suffering.

The doctors nurses refuse vaccinated also ashamed themselves.

And keys forget millions wasted vanity projects like nightingale hospitals never used. got calculators last week... person UK 30 perhaps. I‚Äôm 42 everyone know similar age it, remember lining secondary school. Yes know anecdote anecdotal I‚Äôm fairly sure true, school special BCG test zone. I've read stuff saying we've really underestimated role luck this. probably got unlucky - whether that's B117 states; virus happening get big prisons, workplaces, schools instead smaller ones; etc. California, I'm going guess mask mandates end either long time now, becomes politically handy recall election. 

That said, businesses enforce rules? Hell no, already don't. long typical game Fortnight? Seriously though, say many days title. fact everyone's going shots reason frustratingly hard get shot. frustrating live middle nowhere. CDC update first dose shots:

1,028,284 first dose shots. Last week 1,158,079

7 day rolling avg 1,730,507. 1,749,049 yesterday. 

95.69m adults first doses - 37.1% (up 36.7%)

Today 9M since Sunday. measles insane R0, like 12+ vaccine used uk? get shots plan hit favorite arcade, maybe go play mini golf. Though plan acquire personal transportation, something put hold past year everything closed. vaccinations far disproportionately gone elderly, cases disproportionately young women 

Re UK 5.4mil 50's 1st 420,000 2nd thats good +20% UK doses. 

UK use steering different vacines different groups safe bet \~60% Lack surveillance symptoms, lack correlated reporting occur 

This seems unlikely considering public stats available UK, also NHS likely best stats information 1 shared public health actually occurred UK, haven‚Äôt announced publicly yet

Get rubber hats folks! course anything possible, straight along lines opposing conspiracy theory financially motivated powered Pharma's stand make substantial money get ""Global"" massive market AZ (Initially pre-sales Pfizer Moderno combined twice believe). 

Speculation like damaging also impossible prove get real information pretty pointless even discuss unless want go talk conspiracy theories differences mistakes specific continental European doses  technique differences  prevalence specific birth control products countries

Potentially feasible, also common shared environmental factors many guess at, common antidepressant? common pollutant? different vaccines kids? infections diseases, direction wind.. well ok one many potential unforseen potential causes interactions guessing bit pointless. rite aid michigan Yup, hear vaccines seem providing relief longhaul symptoms. Oh yea, we'll probably 100 million shots april alone worst case.  assume they're gonna let vaccinated fans. Similar Superbowl 30,000 people attend. What? right There's always 0 appointments available look website. time usually look appointments? question remains vaccinated individuals contracted symptomatic covid. vaccine resistant variant spreading low numbers still spell trouble later. complacent regarding virus.  let translate 100 million vaccinated, that's 1000 death Correct virus spikes really little CA's numbers concerned right now. northeast concerned, everything southwest looking like seasonality currently beating wave hitting elsewhere everyone recommended get vaccine. Please keep mind. work math. 1/100 000 0.001% need compare day 1 week prior. Tuesdays low reporting day. Tuesday higher last Tuesday.   Well, California anytime soon. don‚Äôt care anyone else does, wear masks forever makes feel safe, never wear mask required. don‚Äôt even want hear words ‚Äúmask up‚Äù - grating 2 words I‚Äôve ever heard. 

I wear mask protect others I‚Äôm asshole, I‚Äôm never required. Likely outside metro areas Milwaukee Madison demand non-existent.

Same situation Illinois.  math work this? 31 million people 16. 44 million doses end June. get every adult fully vaccinated early July? 

I'd love happen missing? I'm agreeing you. rest thread trying spin every complaint previous administration's handling things ""purely political"". know numbers hand, I'm pretty sure continued bump 7 day average. noice  Germany given 2.7M first AZ doses, less 1000 second. likely first dose.

One things (don't know still are) counting anyone ""out state"" hospitalized Florida. would include people changed addresses winter Florida caught Florida came symptoms quickly. almost 100 million people least 1 shot.

Cool, that's actually better early lol. I‚Äôve second two week mark, wife, state getting there. I‚Äôm glad see progress.

Like stated, actually thought would take much longer this, I‚Äôm optimistic! Many anti-mask laws roots KKK violence well.  went testing even added benchmarks (because many people placebo arms got Covid quickly). difference EUA traditionally licensed vaccine normal circumstances especially case nothing testing extra QC, batch sampling protocols slow things down, ongoing plans production inspection whatnot. Testing still paramount. good example reality AZ effed phase 3 testing (that half dose thing) told go back better also late game. 

Not studies show it‚Äôs safe vast majority people believe EUA means something different does. Flip coin. 

Oh wait, got four choices.

Okay, flip *two* coins, flip another decide winners two flips. yet enough vaccines still going high risk groups first, sounds like expect three weeks enough all. test half England like ? 1 100k means hundreds deaths.

There's substantial research showing infection + single dose gives tremendous protection. find /r/Covid19.

I believe random though many people symptoms. think possible could element ""politics"" might lead suppressing ignoring data might reveal similar results UK?

why assume EU shenanigans nothing possibly wrong UK? arent? 7 average still falling. first dose likely cause side effects prior COVID diagnosis anecdotally none friends position suffered much (chills, low grade fever). say 250M get 240M L say 200M get 240M W say 20% higher new goal was. fairly obvious give opponents ammo like making goals hard hit.

Sure, matters care goal is. 


Let's say need work 35 hours week pay iPhone 12 payments Kia Forte. boss Wendy's posts schedule 20 hours. calls couple times week end getting 35 hours going say ""Wow, refreshing boss underpromises overdelivers!""

Of course not. Anyone claims otherwise never participated real budgeting process matters. places go help. enough real world data mass study. It‚Äôs month so. Give bit. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs fine though. Two officials said EU‚Äôs contract committed paying 336 million euros ($406 million) AstraZeneca, mostly finance production vaccines four named factories. Two these, run Oxford Biomedica Cobra Biologics, Britain, others Germany Belgium.

So, addition supplying UK 20 million doses mostly Biontech/Pfizer vaccines, EU also funded AstraZeneca vaccine production exclusively claimed UK. less agreeing said? agree 100% saying! agree people get risk trade offs, others don't. work wall st., feel certainly taught think risk. ruled batch problems last time EMA reviewed believe Aka Pfizer vax beast state opened anyone 30 supposed open everyone April 1st. actually impressed efficient sign website compared government websites I've used. Everyone parents age (60+) already 2nd shot. happening much quickly I'd guessed.

Also, like 2/3 people know 2nd shot said felt terrible day 2nd one, maybe consider getting work anyone reads able. Interesting felt like crap first one too. Spoiler alert: they're going tell us. fact 11 days since article published can't find information anywhere. Wtf? yep, rural Saxony. Texas reaching three week anniversary mask mandate doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs making difference positive negative way. 

The case numbers mostly deaths slowly going down. Also people hard time figuring get past paywalls, least get gist article. 

But oh well :/ once, agree man. Downvote want, think vaccine passport going scare people away getting vaccine. They‚Äôre going feel pressured getting therefore want it. 

It already difficult enough convince mom get vaccine. hear passport getting vaccinated, would definitely change mind. 

I think vaccine passport travel fine. passport every day things? That‚Äôs bit much. evidence points this. Simple that.

There trial designed study effectiveness vaccine variant. vivo studies suggest protection - especially severe disease. 2500 people, avg age 31 nowhere near sufficient make sweeping accusations. 3 trials intended simulate that. 

No they're not, especially global pandemic. Look vaccines like Moderna. effective clinic anywhere near great impact pandemic Ox/AZ vaccine high price, awkward storage lower production. ljve Germany?  real problem anti-science cretins state. know what's happening there, governor's fault. too, disappointed. Sorry man that's true, last Tuesday saw 1.7m doses reported. indeed increase last week. feel her!

Finally came 27 hours 100+ degree fever earlier today. Still residual aches lymph nodes swollen side shot in. Florida fifth oldest state median age, 27th per capita coronavirus deaths.

Couple state least amount virus restrictions masks social distancing, data always seemed suspect. thank sharing sources! Penicillin, new recruits get reception go boot. must hard math. one going fucking check thing. sign go. HIPAA applies medical professionals great news virus  forget children cant vaccines medical reasons. 30% total pop, add 20% adults and.... great news virus 18 minutes.  Fair. historically made many highly positove changes to/for humanity. grew highly respecting institution flawed may been. 

However, last decades really stumbled. sad me. 

I think still serve purpose, said, now, long time, double check academics facts whenever make assessment juxtapose together filter ever growing political bias. Wait. mean not? great news virus standard contract law. Sign contract attempt piss party without getting contract wet. Lmao catch one XD ""socially promiscuous"".  disagree. Given pace US vaccine distribution accelerating, makes complete sense stick manufacturers' recommendations. One dose good, clinical trials clearly shown two doses better. think one dose perfectly valid strategy supply issues unclear timeline overcome them. US clearly knows supply issue late April. Epidemiologists Virologists Biomedical Engineers reported delays due fact lot coronavirus infections longer original strain variant need sequencing figure efficiency one.

In German interview one board members company, said target second half April results. Refusing acknowledge reality true idiocy. Also, reading comprehension seems lacking never said anything locking staying closed. saying can't ignore variants. Following data leaving emotions equation best way deal sorts things. test non-Israelis? medical trials women often excluded, results often affected periode. become available US, price magically become $200. polio vaccine smallpox vaccine used give people polio smallpox. Yet used rid world diseases. 

31 compared millions isn‚Äôt cause alarm. *fancy smart people math actually bouncing slightly week it‚Äôs deserved. deserve owed nothing. rage tantrum like grand scheme demands don‚Äôt outweigh greater good, none do. you‚Äôre young doesn‚Äôt mean rest society gets shafted. lot self absorbed energy get nowhere. end ends, part decision. What's mechanism involved? thought platelets part clots, low count lead clots? Everything TN less open open since June. 

And right problem.

And think ineffective? nobody really followed rules, pretty much summation failed country.

Sure vaccines going everyday people couldn‚Äôt wait July 4 celebrate? attitude vaccination means absolutely wrong. Leaving 15-20 minutes go get first shot (either Pfizer Moderna). I‚Äôm nervous also excited show traditional vaccine selfie. (Only close friends family; don‚Äôt post pictures Reddit.) Hopefully go well! 90% effective preventing infection, symptomatic not. Trial participants tested every week. Opposing lockdowns ‚Äúright-wing‚Äù. Yeah, let's exacerbate privacy surveillance issue, try make better, got it. genius idea. same. oh shit took az shot sunday, long take till die course is, comment care others vaccinated are, facts facts South Dakota north Dakota case count. One mask mandate, one didn't.

Michigan case rate going mask mandate right now, texas dripping without it. Lots possibilities:

- Vaccinations going heavily toward older population. Many confirmed positive cases nursing homes retirement communities, illness severe people closer together. possible saving vulnerable vaccinating largest group already COVID.
- number estimated positive cases may lower think. Early estimates said may 10x number cases. would impossible now, 10x confirmed cases would nearly Americans. estimate 4x number cases. Either way, learning there's still plenty uninfected burn through.
- Even vaccines strong many variants (which fully confirmed yet), know infected early minor case similar protection. Reinfections getting common places like Brazil. Getting COVID mild could similar getting low dose vaccine body needs ""booster"" either vaccine getting sick again.
- Hospitalizations deaths extremely long tail. Many get hospital quickly die quickly, also cases folks ventilator 6-8 weeks dying recovering. Deaths hospitalizations stalling could impact normal churn new admissions/exits large backlog long-term cases.
- 100 million vaccinated first dose, going fast many vaccinated full 14 days after. Early studies showed cases started reducing 11 days.
- Early data Israel shows case hospitalization cohorts group, especially younger groups, initially rose group 30-40% vaccination. may cohort/group socializing feeling safer. group reaches 60-70%, cases hospitalizations began crash again. 36% adults vaccinated 72% 65+ vaccinated, means adults age 18-65 still well 36%. group 20% vaccinated increasing social engagements surge over, could easily account rise cases.
- Case increases happening places low vaccine distribution. Vaccines always distributed equitably. Black, brown poorer populations seeing lower vaccine uptake places (and reasons multifaceted). rollout happening quickly, there's time address gaps. example, certain communities likely take vaccine recommended personal doctor, individual doctor offices unable administer vaccine. Smaller vial cases distributed offices could help this, could vaccine prescriptions consult doctor. **Even America highly-vaccinated, single community low vaccination rate still risk transmission.** Think measles New York/California enclaves example. Oh ok, thanks. large study tens thousands people similar one care home. 

These statistical models prove vaccine works. worry post-pandemic life. expect overseas countries, don‚Äôt care aside cruises, don‚Äôt really travel internationally either leisure need. neither lots people. 

What worries passport required restaurants, sporting events, basically anything want part everyday life. think may little late backtrack this. PA sports events open fans within current capacity rules now, unlike NY, proof negative test vaccine isn‚Äôt required entry. think backtracking requiring would heavy backlash. 

I‚Äôm getting vaccinated it‚Äôs worth. son going school person since September wear masks every day. kids understand comply really well (I've seen pictures classroom). 4 year olds! They're better adult coworkers half time.

If normal enforced like school rule, it. going poo poo would impossible capitalist country. started thinking companies like amazon might benefit this..still think feasible even wanted force it. 90% efficacy mean 1 10 exposed going get sick. means every 9 people get virus without vaccine 1 gets virus vaccine exposed way. Norway taken affluent, well-educated immigrants, Sweden taken complete opposite. Scandinavian lived countries, compare Swedens Malm√∂ Oslo quickly see big difference Already have...so you. zero concerns this. government maybe however legally HIPAA. aren‚Äôt. Private business is...boycott them. remember skinny fatass comorbidity COVID vaccine that's 90-95 percent silver bullet reason move lives might well throw hands live fear forever. Since people love newfound freedom businesses able pick choose service via medical history, hope issue Catholic business owner requiring information people they've ever vasectomy abortion, bar requiring daily updated STD test every visit. Another person who‚Äôs morning personally victimized impending doom. Anyway, don‚Äôt disagree ‚Äúwave‚Äù sorts right now, could really get bad? think cases decline again? I‚Äôm NJ we‚Äôve really picked vaccinations sucks watching numbers creep slightly everyday. Also I‚Äôm send wedding invites already postponed wedding end June. recent numbers headlines starting make think I‚Äôm making mistake. Cases need drop like rock soon Jersey they‚Äôre going significantly less June. *sigh* coordinating sharing expertise throughout. Also BioNTech legal rights sell vaccine Germany, Turkey, China. stipulation Pfizer waived speed production.

People discussing issues sub months Idk pure logic reach December numbers many people already either sick vaccinated Still less chances getting clot taking birth control....which women take stage lives handed like candy doctors anything reproductive, skin hormone related. What's explanation. Difficulty: explanation vermont needs explain stringent rules work NJ/NY/CA etc. problem is, undiagnosed disorders. So, finer regulations likely caught thought healthy really reading comments actually posted. linked doesn‚Äôt disagree anything said Oh I'm saying Pfizer/BioNTech impressive. contrary, seeing unprecedented supply chain porn front eyes! point can't fully compare two companies purely based current output, one quite headstart. Pennsylvania's bottleneck? strain becoming dominant (b117) much infectious numbers referencing. idea infected person sitting room extended time 5 people 2 get wishful thinking imo. regardless, transmission go nearly 0, companies require employees wear masks follow covid protocol. Think like that. really get feeling lot people think get vaccinated pandemic them. risk sickness, mostly, herd immunity life same, especially masks certain states. pandemics major health emergencies. single government multilateral agency address threat alone

\* angry noises Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Australia New Zealand \* Kingston. appointment now, get April. much this. immune system. taught person past 5 years likely would gotten sick. Healthcare workers mainly done early (December) would Pfizer think. Pfizer started getting rolled 8th Dec, AZ 8th Jan. obligation, chose supply UK three plants EU one? looks like AZ supply bit more, end Q2 delivered third EU delivered. 

The EU feel lucky placed large order reliable company like BioNTech. want blame immigrants Swedish number, simply normalize pandemic numbers extra proportion immigrants Sweden countries Scandinavia. still explain numbers it?

Also according chart, Norway pretty close Sweden migrant numbers:  Lmao 'why give personal information third party via app stores data visit times'. ever gone wrong, right?  Yeah, biggest problem clotting presenting low platelets. That's absolutely common all, point hard figure doctors seen before. misinformed. blood diseases correlated AZ vaccine e.g. Norway Germany rare clinical picture similar caused another medication. like ""ordinary"" blood clots all. needs investigated fully.

If cases Norway caused AZ vaccine risk 1:20 000, much higher acceptable. list patients COVID (+) counts hospital, 20 days post infection unless compelling reason isolate still. numbers hospital lowest since thing started. remember months ago felt like every patient saw COVID even came something else well. That‚Äôs good point you, 99% (this inaccurate statistic way) loss life continued severe health issues unacceptable. makes minority percentage inconsequential comes health public large. would one thing experience global epidemics vaccines past. Closest swine flu 09, like much real world experience this. Also remember studies indicating partial immunity Covid prior significant spread populations. idea vaccines like mRNA ones becoming completely ineffective 6-12 months sounds ridiculous. people blindly trust statements like tend never involved research seen kind politics go blind statements occur. ""muh yellow vaccine book go africa"" somehow equals Microsoft IBM storing data go days knows long hold data share with. mention possibility data leaks. Fucking insane people think equivalents. hundreds thousands young healthcare care workers received AZ vaccine UK? Surely that's large enough sample size side effects show not, unless ignore majority world live poverty without enforced mandates all.

I'm guessing focusing taiwan, newzealand etc shaping view, think slums India, communities Africa, crowded cities Pakistan Afghanistan Iraq etc. Minimal mask wearing, really high death rate. far one hospitalized vaccinated right? literally even read it.

I think problem understand word efficacy means context. say efficacy talking ability prevent infection, agree less likely vaccines protecting variants. Unfortunately B.1.351 variant around long enough determine extent capable protecting severe disease hospitalization far I'm aware although expect offer protection. 

Johnson Johnsons clinical trial done South Africa variant dominant... links say much. Again, hospitalizations deaths clinical trial among vaccinated tell study demonstrates they're effective preventing severe disease hospitalization? know extent prevent severe disease hospitalization?

YOU linked study. Based evidence far, safely say nobody fully vaccinated hospitalized died covid variant. 

Here perfect quote sum argument, right now, know line crossed see people fully immunized vaccines [who], nonetheless, infected variants, hospitalized,‚Äù Offit said February 4 COVID-19 Vaccine Analysis Team press briefing.

If variants mutate avoid protections currently offered vaccines big deal. right simply case. 

I may wrong, posted anything show that. premise extremely easy disprove, asked thing numerous times. 

**Just find single case someone fully vaccinated hospitalized died.** millions people fully vaccinated, many areas multiple variants. happened would major news story around world. need post wall text, single link study anecdote somebody fully vaccinated ended hospitalized dead covid. google it, cases rising last 2 days. going comment morality state people make appointments ahead time drugstore check ""50 up"" box. long age group allowed vaccinated day appointment matter box checked make appointment- pharmacist can't even see that.

I'm seeing posts vaccines worthless anything subreddit forums filled schizophrenic conspiracy theorists. universities West already required proof vaccination years years. comment would make vaccines provide magic shield virus.

The vaccine simply bolsters ones immune response, goal reducing overall R value virus 1, limit spread.

Once vaccinated, one still get COVID (though less likely, severe), still spread (though much less likely).

Public health depends reducing spread (R&lt;1) therefore requires vaccine uptake wide possible.  Yeah, crazy stupid Fox News grandpa energy want IBM Microsoft medical data, name, address, data acquired stored every business choose visit. Absolutely insane anyone that. Even so, fuel anti-vaccine sentiments end scaring people *all* vaccines. That's public cost benefit calculation recommending something. Following logic, we'll never repone one virus might mutate sometime somewhere. idiocy. vaccines work variants. End story. Infections hospitalizations continue fall many states. Thats issue. also pretty weird happened men kind immune response far common women (and line seeing Europe). working (and several other) theories reported conclusion yet Tfw 3rd world outvaccinates EU. What's difference sub r/covid19? Well point, unless start selling profit incentive AZ keep altruistic thing? Massively disappointing they‚Äôre written simply they‚Äôre cost material gain, corporation not.

No good deed goes unpunished that. mean widespread issue yet? bad need become ‚Äúa widespread issue.‚Äù would know? anyone challenged virus? number representing people risk group? confirmed clusters contain vaccinated unvaccinated people?  Like, 0 accidents comapny last year, year giving everyone toiletpaper free 0 accidents too, toiletpaper prevents accidents. right? Lmao like clockwork, ol ‚Äúgrocery store worker‚Äù rebuttal... I'd like know new T748 variants found US lowers efficacy existing Moderna Pfizer shown vaccines tweaked incredibly easily cover viruses don‚Äôt require initial phase 1-3 trials thought pretty well known 55 (and especially 65) significantly risk Covid, even use low number 1% dying (its much higher that), thousand times less risky 1 100,000 blood clots. much United States owns doses blocked export.

We much India owns doses blocked export.

We much UK owns doses unable exported *despite* listed EU's can't turn around say tell you, ours?

These words would mean lot said United States December 9th, UK late August, India past week. EU ordered 2.6B doses produced within borders. many deaths EU take demand start receiving 2.6B doses solely domestic production *precisely* manner regions ignore export components UK fact AZ also misses substantial deliveries UK. UK significant amount money far earlier EU earlier process across doses vaccines. Much success due paying significant amounts Pfizer.

Could source claims outspending? Taking account EU spending, EU countries individuals allow nothing. spreading falsehoods misleading arguments.

Every nation powers emergency stop exports emergency equipment. EU allowing exports help vaccinate vulnerable across globe. EU allowed 20m doses reach UK. precise thing allowed UK.

What falsehoods misleading arguments. Everything I've said sourced. trend flatting, meaning headed downward imminently. It‚Äôs anti-mask, it‚Äôs denial fourth wave starting US cases increasing least 22 states. 

Thank report message.  bullshit? Great! I'm Florida south Tampa right now. Mask usage 50% mall day. Grocery store maybe 60%. quite unusual experience spending whole past year NY 1 unmasked person store garnishes lot attention. legit saw 30+ people unmasked grocery store yesterday.

One reason questions getting asked answered mainstream media Daszak others carried water censors shut discussion.

Lots questions many answers anyway. Thanks everyone reading. He's also [threatening block EU vaccine deal wants Pfizer initially thought would want. say? want good laugh expecting CNN given doom reporting surprised Fox. Good, hope fucking scared fearmongering bullshit you‚Äôve pulled last year need several vaccines. Stop new vaccine/drug review standard practice. happened pfizer well.

Still low number causes benefit overweight risk. another vaccine could fit better specific group/case.... Use it!

An example, people allergic require specific flu vaccine. think US ordered 100M more. think original target 200M end June. think sound strategy. many 60+ anyway, supply used easily. misleading. 31 cases blood disorders higher would normally occur population? investigation conducted, found levels clotting actually lower unvaccinated people, among vaccinated, Pfizer marginally cases AZ kills ever push back people bring needing proof vaccination enter another sovereign country like we're talking needing proof vaccination enter restaurant.

CDC finds Pfizer Moderna vaccines effective real world conditions 

This constant flip flopping optimism gloom really taking mental toll :/ Approved! Thanks pointing out.  15 million, nope. Different manufacturing sites though - UK ones manufactured domestically, think Europe's Belgium(?). (which 40m got last 14 days significant immune response 

On top throw another week back, since detection lags behind infection 5-10 days. is, guy 3 weeks 1st dose tests positive now, probably caught still protected first two week period.

So see cases correlate number vaccinated need look many dose 3 weeks ago least partial protection, number vaccinated 1st dose 6 weeks ago full protection.

This huge lag get's people misunderstand situation, Israel. ""he UK received five reports specific brain blood clot people AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, though causal link made jab, medicines regulator said.

The five people men aged 19 59 experienced clot together low blood platelet count. One five since died.""

That's one I've heard. many compareded given vaccines. Mine too! Maybe Health Minister kept track officials important meetings. They‚Äôre saying problem isn‚Äôt gone lmao None bearing discussion covid effectiveness lowest level mental health funding state (that's see many crazy ""Florida man"" stories)

This see many ""Florida man"" stories. press access criminal records law, full access report crimes happen, decent portion crimes people going Florida vacation much drink. ""Florida man"" really someone state visiting Florida.

Basically, want shit Florida ignoring reality substituting so. effective how? Again, efficacy numbers misleading (it's based specific point pandemic specific population dependent trials run, differed company) there's good evidence AZ less effective vaccines preventing serious COVID. jury still moderate illness SA variant Moderna/Pfizer done studies Novavax/AZ (and AZ complete neutralisation SA variant regardless low antibody response). show example people disappointed revised deaths?  


Why post good news get removed? one want celebrate cases falling great state Texas! reason party hard second shot guess. 

We already know evident discussions boosters.

Yeah, gonna open door stupid shit, hope exploited fullest extent within parameters provided show bad idea is, correct. That's true, thanks vaccines Israel's cases fell 95% peak still falling, country reopened almost everything including mass events. 

The comments answers, first 145M 1st dose, million, variants, lag 1st dose protection case detection. we've seen entire time typically takes weeks rises
 cases takes weeks hospitalization go up. takes weeks death rates rise. 

This case whole pandemic. happened summer people tried point governor restrictions low cases. weeks later low hospitalization rates. weeks later low death rates despite high hospitalization. stopped talking disappeared deaths caught up. This. governor, EARLY on, like April so, said ""We're going trust public"" knew wild ride. Imagine guy quoted saying basically ""People mean poor megacorp, nobody would blame rage quit making life saving vaccines"". mean anti-bodies virus real world tests shown beyond doubt antibodies killing virus. mechanism irrelevant. new variant Covid-19 identified Henri Mondor hospital Cr√©teil (Val-de-Marne). seems less worrying English South African variants, would worrying Breton variant, detected weeks ago. identification many variants France, new one detected Alsace Strasbourg University Hospital. hospital identified noting marker PCR tests ""systematically came back negative"", according information L‚ÄôAlsace. moment, detected metropolitan area ‚Äã‚Äãthe Alsatian capital Regional Health Agency alerted. dangerous ? variant carries ""mutation enzyme, polymerase, involved multiplication virus,"" said Alsatian newspaper. moment, nothing confirms variant dangerous resistant vaccine. reminder, English variant remains problematic time being. claim true EU would able claim AZ vaccines UK, UK would also able demand EU produced ones exported UK.

The UK already laid claim millions doses Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab produced Dutch ever seems work one way though, funny that. Never mind idea many doses actually exported UK AZ refuse disclose it. nothing hide problem disclosing it. That‚Äôs basically complete guess. There‚Äôs data AZ effect hospitalization, symptoms, death infection South Africa beyond 10%. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* far know AZ vaccines (~1 mill) exported EU UK UK components them.

Nope, produced UK sent EU fill finish (the bottling facility ready point). Since fully domestic. think EU expecting 100 million doses arrive per month late April. definitely cool deaths. Ontario? ton PHUs 70+ getting close week now. immune system develop antibodies spike protein, reduces chance ***both disease*** infection.

So agree Sars disease virus? Yes no?  


And virus isnt called SARS-Cov-2, respiratory illness get Covid-19 called that.  


"" February 11, 2020, World Health Organization announced official name disease causing 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak. new name disease coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated **COVID-19** "" 


 
Sars-Covid19 sars illness get Covid19 string Corona virus. Aka respiratory disease get Covid19 string Corona. 


So must ask question still need answere to. get herd immunity corona treating SARS called vaccine. I'm impression certainly possible. ""A long time"" certainly subjective though. please provide source indicating EU also considered blocking Pfizers/Moderna?

As far know AZ export controls, reasons known all, didn‚Äôt think got much AZ EU days anyway. neither we, heh. That‚Äôs certain thing though. Viruses aren‚Äôt going inevitably mutate purposely evade vaccines rule. isn‚Äôt movie it‚Äôs certain get worse plot. know original target (by end july)? gained 30 lbs thought higher range Might take years. first strain update necessary pretty soon. Canada three vaccines offer young women also effective. recognize many countries don‚Äôt options. get 100k steps walking every week still lift dumbbells home then. It‚Äôs full workout it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm inactive all. reason experienced volume specific blood disorders. read registered though, can¬¥t remember amount. Better restrictions country vaccinations able internationally travel, restrictions, less vaccines, also able internationally travel.

Couldn‚Äôt give rat‚Äôs ass takes two years UK allow international tourism again, would care it‚Äôs four months till restrictions lift. 10% going elgible? One important thing people keep forgetting lag first dose vaccination cases.

Front 1st dose partial protection two weeks.

From 1st dose full protection 4-5 weeks.

From infection detection 5-10 days.

Case numbers seeing lag 1st dose vaccination 3-6 weeks. Look number 1st doses month-6 weeks ago gauge effect cases. similar misconceptions Israel vaccination effort. literally wished kind situation original post. would anyone think it? saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mad fuck everybody else‚Äù then, don‚Äôt really believe sort thing? childish mindset. study details indicate mix vaccines. Would never get EMA authorization. Full protection especially important healthcare workers. even indication second dose could ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù? According data cite average daily cases 3,400/day 4,100 day since March 24th. define 21% increase 5 days something would define surge. 

In North Carolina average daily case rate went 5,000 10,000 couple weeks. doubling cases something would call surge.

The fall Texas deaths flattening expected cases rise. North Carolina average daily death rate 78 98 last 5 days.

The data clear. mean, probably close 500,000 doses administered, Canada hasn‚Äôt seen single case CVST. abundance caution, based what‚Äôs happening EU. think WFH crowd forced back offices going need psychological support transition. I‚Äôm kidding. feel bad guys. Yeah, people able find jobs WFH, lot won‚Äôt. 

I dunno.. maybe you‚Äôll everyone else doing, maybe before: podcasts commutes, strict leaving work end day, fewer coworker outings, etc. Concentrating people main location covid spread always bad idea. restrictions need exist, things like sending college students home shutting gathering spots except people's houses, they're less likely wear mask,are terrible idea. We've given shot half country now. *have* cases (and read any), sort scale made waves news vaccine paused. countries. thought Whitty Valance said 1 100,000 expected amount anyway? always stay home forever. could give someone flu cold kill one grandparents. could crash car kill family. tool.  No, live type facility TwO WeEkS. How... cases increasing?! fuck this. fucking bullshit don‚Äôt deny rise cases, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll severe summer winter. Given worked hospital saw many patients had, way get back vaccines don‚Äôt work. 

Otherwise, rise cases bleep downward trajectory seeing. Go gym please still wear mask. people cannot get vaccinated, require get vaccines time. xXxC0r0naDeStr0y3rxXx though MIT study showed ~30 ft stats show elderly much likely antibodies, would assume detect antibodies vaccinations well. Hmm, yeah. again, German doctors say already figured targeted treatment. really news that. five rare ones UK curiously men (about two weeks ago) many young people died Covid? potentially life long disabilities long Covid?

It sad always numbers game end. acceptable risk level? 1 million? 1 hundred thousand? 

No-one deserves die this. theory. good one maybe still that. act like free trade zero-sum game? Free trade leads vaccines available global scale. One month later...screw that. I‚Äôm never going again. 25 watered cocktail medium shelf liquor? Hell no. I'm conflicted. really want everyone get vaccinated, really want us country takes medical advice 'a group celebrities'. sure saying, suggesting might warrant pause vaccinations studied resulted online lynching.

And let make perfectly fucking clear. can't jab people something potential without least warning them. options total pause ensuring every patient knows small actual risk. Except issue subject periodic lockdowns forever decide vaccine bigger threat COVID. Account made 2 months ago comment. Forgive (or don't) believing single word said. dare FDA hold approval things like clinical trials? US falling apart. Awesome, even better current pace expected accelerate! believe you. say ‚Äúimpending doom.‚Äù It‚Äôs inconsistent We're still doomed, least virus going take us researchers Thursday said undertaking several investigations determine whether rare blood clots might linked vaccine, occurring chance. noted many events occurred younger though rare, associated pregnancy use oral contraceptives. ""That's one things investigating near future,"" said Sabine Straus, chair EMA's safety anything makes Michiganians substantially different average Americans couple dozen states cases declining plateaued, many less equal restrictions? anything Michigan makes people likely disregard public guidance people elsewhere? common sense answer no.

Does though? still seen good reasoning UK given literally tens millions AZ vaccines seeing phenomena. 25% under-50s received vaccine authorities UK coming confirming link...

Mask mandates lifting people gathering again. . get appointment? Bro we're literally CLOSE. fucking wait couple weeks. Kinda hard answer question definitively get enough people vaccinated. Right we've made amazing progress, recent uptick cause potential concern given we've seen Europe. hard say doctors likely know till side effects occur person receiving vaccine gets bad side effect would late point. Completely disagree. It‚Äôs much easier apply something evenly across everyone vs certain group, especially if/when group small consists people didn‚Äôt get vaccinated - many didn‚Äôt don‚Äôt see COVID real risk. 

How would ‚Äúeasy‚Äù school, employer, venue enforce masks unvaccinated people vaccinated people don‚Äôt restriction? would *you* go that? Week Virology actually discussed episode 735. highly recommend listening forming opinion. also reference studies higher quality disagree CDC‚Äôs perspective safely decrease distancing kids. seems primarily politically-motivated change order allow full school capacity. Ok, unless vaccine killing lots lots people, censor news deaths? I'm trying link anything, said, perhaps massive coincidence. mean we're allowed talk it. Nowhere article say ""the vaccination killed person"". says autopsy take place. Great. Really good summer!  Pretty normal. trouble breathing concerned. give fact sheet appointment???  would go near Twitter ten foot pole. Anecdotally tell almost people previously told ""they waiting getting it"" jumped first chance get vaccinated. think people like acting like tough guys surveys.   goverment blocks chance  Counterpoint: AstraZeneca. vaccine design problem.  Ads currently designed, current vaccines set ups failiure  expected large scale evlulation virus strains. Anecdotally, I've got couple friends asses kicked dose 1. Also anecdotally, couple wife's friends got laid dose 2. things talking vaccinated, 5-15% chance serious side effects death COVID. amazing odds.

As far COVID goes, safer Israel Florida given vaccine hesitancy here. Pfizer well? Pfizer Moderna feature? Imagine every country Meh even I‚Äôd rather wait vaccines. I‚Äôd much rather risk catching covid (when it‚Äôs somewhat likely I‚Äôve already even known) fighting compared getting vaccine getting blood clot. No, lifting mandates encourages people think everything don‚Äôt need vaccine all. moment I‚Äôve seen comments news articles, Reddit, Twitter, I‚Äôm worried sway public policy extra cautious. joke sometimes quickly get package example want breathe air delivery guy exhaled, lol. Probably silly needed, easy implement, not. What's political gain here? Losing vaccine slows already mediocre vaccination campaigns even more, nobody profits it. many doses issued Az whole Europe specific age/gender group? many reactions?

I think talking 29-31 reactions? Need add take number.

I checked UK's numbers 50 women (as seems group risk this); 3.3million doses 25/3/21.

Is risk? Yes. much risk? reporting accurate take UK's 50 female vaccination number; 0.0009%

But thing is, end day choice. 

Personally everyone talked said thing; likihood side effect versus likihood getting Covid, asymptomatic Covid long Covid makes go vaccine. 

But feel comfortable with, ask questions. Yup. wouldn‚Äôt said January February. time nigh! Why? 

Where articles old people dying? reason think it‚Äôs worthy article you‚Äôre trying link death vaccine. isn't. recently another lockdown. getting used abnormal. Yeah actually worried give shot got first one! minor ache next day gone 15 minutes gym That's efficacy numbers work.

% protected thing.

90% efficacy means trial group, 90% fewer people vaccine group infected/got sick compared placebo group X amount time.

e.g., one group 100 people trial get vaccine 100 don't. time X, 10 people placebo group got infected, 1 person vaccine group did.

That's 90% efficacy Time X. *doesn't* mean people vaccine group ""90% protected"" Time X. paper say current rate consistent baseline rate symptoms, admittedly wide range estimate rates implied current vaccine data. mRna vaccines seems less 10% great news front Maryland phase 2B today; pre-registration mass vaccination sites opened 2B last Tuesday. signed mass vaccination sites Phase 2B appointment Friday.  curious, excluding data 2020 data lacking, 2020 saw excess mortality total 2,719,253.99 people 15-19 average mortality world wide.  Another reason Moderna needs whole lot lipids vaccine BioNtech. high demand right now. wasn‚Äôt aware Brit decided stated Google it. government 10% population received first jab whereas USA 30%. UK nearing 50%. 

That paint Canadian roll bit pathetic far. think age concern long term health effects mortality. France report vaccine bad 50' , people need stop reporting lies

You're liar here. Oxford vaccine administered time statistical data older people yet recommend use age cohort. data produced, administration went forward. blame Captain Obvious, failed deliver. Yes, far much ask. Whatever happened flatten curve? ever supposed keeping hospitals overflowing. COULD MEAN!!


Leading health experts around world warned slow roll-out vaccines unequal distribution could mean shots become ineffective new coronavirus mutations appear within next year. I‚Äôd agree hospitals hospitals purer, better sanitizer. benzene contamination tricky ‚Äî hazardous exposure occurs respiratory tract GI system. it‚Äôs skin, sanitizer, quickly evaporates (now, benzene contaminated water shower, exposure would far greater). It‚Äôs filtered blood would affect liver kidney function, it‚Äôs probably going take general exposure 12 months we‚Äôve notice trends public.

I think it‚Äôs soon jump conclusions hand sanitizer linking cancer cases point. Anyone else get significant reactions first moderna dose?

Obviously, arm sore, last night chills, potential fever, clammy skin, similar unknown disease child. 2 weeks....... Yes go actual achieved current pace shots arms plus 7 day trend extrapolated forwards we're well ahead. really slow start current daily per/100k lot better quickly catching take EU week know many people die every day? Many vaccination, one, assure you. report case fuel antivaxxers? rated. live SC we've never done anything plague. conventions real size held professional touring bands can't move enough tickets merch insure profitable tour yet. Broadway shows happening till least July. drove across Arkansas 2 days ago, mask mandate? UK ""doing much better"" people percentages higher. US vaccinated 4 times amount people bigger percentage global population really matters. 

Plus vaccines starting become available everyone US. I'm ""under 30 preexisting conditions"" category I'll fully vaccinated 5 weeks (that includes two weeks second dose vaccine fully effective), looks like California opens category 2 weeks, New York opens 1 week.

We'll fine. Original risk dying vaccine higher dying covid age group, worth risk.

I tho?

You got wires crossed... Depends are, places still considerable snow ground last week places 60s. tell vaccinated not? need kindly ask mate. guest. Could human factor? example, may someone deliberately poison selected batches? think whole delivery chain investigated. Statistics UK indeed different.  Ok lockdown year get Biden vaccine.  Big deal. one idiotic things ever read reddit. Read article. study, ever, works way describing. seem operating assumption understand world better experts. truth appears much much different that.

Uh... get infected, risks 200x higher supposed 1:100,000.

I guess think something literally 200 times riskier substantial increase risk. Which... well, guess know someone make argument, guess hill want die on?

For (and suspect almost everyone ever existed), we'd rather take option 200 times less risky. don‚Äôt want know Almost entire family went CVS lied underlying health condition could get vaccine. crazy governor lifting mask mandate felt choice. Nothing recorded, proof shown, fairly easy get appointments figured wasn‚Äôt difficult people actually qualified get vaccine get one. say it.  mean continue rise least 22 states. Given exponential spread virus, know need proactive. understand people minimize listen experts that‚Äôs pattern since day one well. think relevant number cases 19 (Includes cases rare deficiency blood platelets thrombocytopenia), 12 cases blood clots statistically significant. wrong? "" Well done spelling propaganda correctly. "" Got chuckling ngl felt wave impending doom get every morning get rush hour traffic. I'm glad we're opening back damn miss empty roads last year health competencies though? many experts vaccinations etc really city/state? Surely makes sense pool resources together national policy? looked methodology study? looked anything study? main concern studies companies selling fluid reliable. 

This wasn‚Äôt conducted Moderna Pfizer, CDC. cant give 10 people vaccine 8 never contact infected person claim 90 effective. 

Well it‚Äôs good thing study involved 3,950 healthcare workers/first responders. ground safe conclusion ditch parachute get quicker. Nope, stipulation UK first made August, day EU's contract. Nice try however.

By everybody expecting US export ban, include private companies operating made deals arranged millions doses exported prior December 9th countries Japan, Canada Mexico? Flordia State Governor sent swat team make sure coverup continue? 55 women. group large risk covid (age largest factor, generally women less affected covid).

If az vaccine really 1 100,000 risk causing blood disorder (the upper limit countries reporting) honestly might worth group.

There's also difference administering vaccine know might kill someone letting die (based moral distinction action vs inaction) Seems Norway told they're going get 10% expecting April. authorities talking normal blood clots combination thrombocytopenia blood clots Explain Vermont best entire country...we strictest lockdown mask mandates still effect. Wow. need prevent variants?  goal post moving next?

The reality met original stated goals shutdown isolation etc. 

Unless major mutation occurs changes virus significantly betting don‚Äôt see surge like Dec / Jan. 

As continue vaccinate continue build ceiling high surge could get. 

IMO much immunity vaccines play make another big surge feasible. Yep, like people cannot process lab study bat viruses might intentionally built area lot bat viruses. Makes even sense know field studies sample track bats. totally agree last statement. trying get ""strong opinion"" statement. 

I'm scientific skeptic, think good science consider lab leak theory. said, I'm 99% sure get tossed really unlikely compared options have. like people misusing Occam's Razor.  would hope simce we've jabbed 200mil+ moon!! üöÄüöÄüöÄ surprise messaging. weird phase getting vaccinated (most old getting clapped left right Covid), waiting patiently impatiently shot (currently me), remaining ready get back normal life without vaccine soon businesses open hope best. cause concern hopefully concern keeps going time progresses. 

By summer we‚Äôll probably debate, think lot states giving vaccine mostly everyone adults (Missouri starts April 9th). many options, people go J&amp;J lot, help greatly it‚Äôs one shot. fall ‚Äúback normal‚Äù crowd grow even think kids starting get shots (or maybe not, sounds like right time). holidays hit, we‚Äôll debate around gatherings, hopefully worry little Jimmy Jane got vaccines yet (which probably yes schools definitely require then) opposed older family members their‚Äôs months.

Come beginning 2022 on, we‚Äôll enter new phase start mimicking life pre-March 2020 probably gamble people took flu shots, may Covid shots.

I know really (she seem compelling reason thinks that).

It's odd generally anti-vax, anti-science, etc. got vaccinations normal schedule kid, get one well turn comes. saw American Airlines going back pre-pandemic fleet. news said air ticket sales close 90% pree-pandemic. concerning far variant spreading.

South, like Bradenton/Sarasota? think stronger political push away masks way. live north Tampa Bay. Masks definitely worn here. see laxity rural places like Plant City.  U.K., course, seen pattern. isn‚Äôt one. 

The pattern, is, blood clots occur randomly, vaccinated unvaccinated people. remains evidence rate higher vaccinated people population whole. 

Occam‚Äôs razor suggests ongoing ass-covering exercise, doctors trying avoid getting hit political fallout EU‚Äôs botched vaccine rollout.  common vaccinated population

1 100,000 estimate read yesterday ~33% least partially vaccinated
~30% covid (some overlap)
~15-20% minors cannot vaccinated
~20% refuse vaccinated
5% vaccinated per week. (Actually way higher percentage remaining pool)

We‚Äôre getting damn close max soon.  Well got obliterated quickly.  anxiety increased male female university students? damn shame. insignificant number people die weeks would gotten inoculated. get us sooner.

Why want go longer needs to? get it.

Were trying funny? Lol, keep searching comment history since life apparently void purpose. 

I literally never claimed also privileged, we're proportionally identical all... Maybe look history let know dont think so

Oh keep downvoting comments lol, seem enjoying EMA lost 25% staff moving London, know went probably helped UK efforts. made decision watch complete isolation. Hahahah.  Won‚Äôt long till China powerful enough start sanctioning everyone else.  Scarcely truthful sentiment typed. wear mask whenever I'm public pretty much constantly work.

I hate damn thing. I'm one lucky people never gets headaches unless I'm really sick. get almost daily job stricter mask policies? guessed it, headaches. 

It makes hard hear counterpart work sometimes mumbles. goes boss. voices break through. Others seem well. late February work building's heat system went absolutely haywire literally 92 degrees (F) office 15 outside. 

But yet randos internet get pissy say like wearing mask. hate take.

We fake pretend like people bad feel bad someone saying bad? Let's hope get there. war hope win. older 55, think. r/whoosh Needs institute nationwide mask mandate.

Which can't do. There's actual constitutional authority.

Could Congress pass law giving power? Yes no. Yes could, won't. note, I'm pretty sure vaccine used Canada India (CoviShield), EU. He's bad views actions, face. I‚Äôm doctor take vitamins improve immune health might help. tbh body going react one way another matter it‚Äôs better let play it‚Äôs course fine. got second shot Sunday morning felt like body recovering bad illness. Around 2pm got better chances whatever side effects experience short lived. rather hilarious guy started exchange essentially calling moron (""dim bulb"") yet failed respond substantively points. surprising based similar exchanges I've sub, though. lol shit show. didnt EMA say relation? know people tough time Pfizer covid common. Moderna I'd almost say typical covid Novavax this? even use anywhere yet. could well case Israel using Novavax primarily, we'd still seeing headline. play dumb. 14th arbitrary date. deaths thousands still opened up, goal achieved? many times people told vaccine mitigate symptoms still distance mask thing wiped out

Oh, guess see current [CDC study telling us mRNA vaccines 90% effective asymptomatic study also one first estimate vaccine effectiveness among participants infection ‚Äî rather monitoring symptomatic cases ‚Äî including infections result symptoms, according CDC.

It's over, dude. entire group vaccinated, hang unmasked. Canada UK able figure out. lock people want stay lock down. 

Just want people supported two dose regimen know many people died choose.

Here another fun questions would saved lives first dose first wearing two mask? really. Staying hydrated could help. Otherwise thing would work would medications suppress immune response, defeats point.  You‚Äôre probably right. one know complains pfizer people basically feel like flu Moderna. One dads navy coworkers couldn‚Äôt stand cause muscle aches entire body broke rash.  He‚Äôs fine recommend get second dose. mRNA vaccines induce ‚Äúwide range antibodies‚Äù.  actually induce narrow range, targeted specifically ‚Äúspike protein‚Äù corona virus. 

It‚Äôs super effective spike protein can‚Äôt mutate much ceases perform function (binding host cell allowing RNA transfer). spike changes enough avoid targeted antibodies, there‚Äôs good chance it‚Äôs longer capable infection. You‚Äôre begging question... 
Only rich people live city, except poor ones live city... poor ones really wanna leave get money... become rich, they‚Äôll live city.
Sounds like there‚Äôs diverse population people live city... news me. share link Biden Harris said vaccines bad? letting daughter play kids might get Covid that, might potential increase risk Parkinson's? reading right? Yeah masks distancing really worked far huh?  Yes ... that‚Äôs right. quarter year still lockdown

been 1.25 years without anything meaningful. sad. covid19 vaccinations give us level immunity covid19 inheritance gives us seasonal flu?

If so, makes covid19 variants concerning flu variants vaccinations become widely available? right misleading part. wrote response rather quickly rereading it, headline literally correct that's headline want put bold print trying get many people vaccinated possible. one.

I'm curious way redder places like Texas.

Yes, way Texas. Thankfully, Texas government sensible this. article [**Do citizen get vaccine Texas?** 
No, according Texas State Department State Health Services spokesperson Chris Van Deusen. 
‚ÄúWe want people living working Texas vaccinated. That's best way slow spread COVID-19 make sure everyone protected,‚Äù Van Deusen said.

Where exactly? Except lol Safe? keep shutting schools rolling quarantine entire classes every week? sound safe me. two kids middle school (were elementary started). struggling too, I've unemployed well. also risk mother lives now, well relatives help also susceptible. I've basically resorted teaching kids need know get behind, otherwise rest wait. Everyone concerned getting back school, education, government paid child care is. think left overs taken countries basically. countries also bought much less J&amp;J countries like Norway, Denmark Netherlands get countries Q2 Michigan got hit hard beginning locked fall four months. 

We less immunity place like Texas. 

Locking creates massive waves open things. lockdowns longer recommended cdc. finish line, goalpost continuously moving already priming move variants. sad since obesity huge factor react COVID lockdowns infections happen homes? Israel waste tax dollars look Florida see nothing worth emulating. worst public schools nation, lowest level mental health funding state (that's see many crazy ""Florida man"" stories), crime rate that's nearly 3 times New York despite slightly larger population, beautiful environment ruined endless sprawl poor planning. 

Florida cesspool top swamp.  What's difference sub r/covid19? Check OOTL subreddit Sure, might be. clear, what‚Äôs happening Michigan good. thats widespread issue yet. vaccines continue accelerate, trajectory stunted. Walensky warning us impending doom? 

Because people like think we‚Äôre lot along towards herd immunity really are. 

You‚Äôre worst kind layman- kind knows enough think handle what‚Äôs going reality you‚Äôre clueless anyone else. Neither reported outside normal range. read recent MHRA yellow card morning showed rates CVST normal vaccines. UK also vaccinated volume far Germany age groups including age 50 equal amounts Pfizer AZ - issue would evidently visible within dataset. 

I would suspect number confounding factors maybe lead difference: vaccination technique, genetics, smoking/lifestyle, contraceptives etc education staff eligible time state, two months ago point.  even cover continental Europe though. Plus large make sense generalise compared smaller places like England. wheels bus go round round, round round... someone teacher 

But, nevermind, need prove  Variants matter either vaccines variants much less deadly, point vaccines. lack mask mandate, real effort stem spread, way know person next vaccinated not. could asymptomatic carrier, spreading disease. passport, would allow businesses either refuse admit person(s) seat separate area. Lacking people continue pass disease. There's lot ""it'll fine easter"" types around here. also like to, dunno, get shit done work relax home. Oh horrible enjoying home life. Sure, hospitalization rate also declined positivity rate declined. indicate situation improving without mask mandates lockdowns. debate variants. much wrong misunderstood information sure begin.

Right? Cases matter another surge likely spawn another wave variants, time get new variants chance immunity evading variants.

Cases also matter surge caused variant transmissible likely cause serious illness.

I know great job vaccines day shore defenses little more, underestimate power B117 surge could wield. feel torn, one hand, want people safe covid. hand, idea handing even small peice HIPPA protected medical history non-medical organizations demand makes uncomfortable. previous paper released topic 9 studied cases 8 female ‚ÄúTwo patients pre-existing autoimmune disease (1 patient, demyelinating disease [*e.g MS]; 1 patient, antiphospholipid antibodies), two patients underlying coagulation disorder (1 patient, von Willebrand disease; 1 patient, Unspecified ‚Äú.

Would interesting see breakdown additional cases see also links. Also would interesting explore wether cases prior covid infection

A study mRNA vaccines found higher incidence adverse events prior infection prior vaccination evidence people Texas behaving responsibly people Michigan? something keep trying explain people. also much transmissible means there's going people hospitalized. sure UK data 20 million AZ doses none side effects would agree you. Important note ""blood cloths"" AZ something completely different ones anti baby pills. understand really unusual type blood disorder. Calling ""blood cloths"" misleading best. Saying get vaccine seems like acknowledgement things said realm possibility get worry. thing is, can't get vaccine. recommend anyone experienced anaphylactic shock medication take it. almost died taking penicillin before. 

I've heard mention kinds exemptions made vaccine passport stuff, maybe understand concerns. Also, issue seems younger possibly female age group, vaccine dangerous illness. Still rare die either would risk it. seems potential hormonal component.

It's likely seen cases Canada ages vaccinated far vaccine. 

This still useful vaccine older age groups. They're 30 10 micrograms new refrigerator-stable storage.

They [test original phase 1, chose 100 250 phase 2. guess know necessary antibody levels now. Humans share 90% dna cats. virus shares 96% genetic similiarity another virus might relevant significant.

All correlation coincidence. one worst states right comforting... opinion pulled ass people dont side effects vax would asymptomatic gotten Covid. say far know, never got side effects 1st shot Moderna. Still waiting get second (which probably put ass hubris.). No, I'm talking Providence Therapeutics, though Medicago's vaccine exciting too. all, selfish ridiculous

I live w people older risk cant risk anything there‚Äôs going worry variants, need make clear worry is. current variants differences default version aren‚Äôt significant still affected well vaccines? idea new variants popping up? virus isn‚Äôt leaving. want hear actual justification governments variants would reason reopen. Trust people, can't force something people's throat forever. live liberal democracy. Private settings able whatever please know humans fallible, handled past year really surprised me. good way. 

I still 100% believe good necessary thing. let response feel sort thing necessary for. decentralized system total disgrace. Recently, found eligible job... took full week stressful online bullshit get appointment. kid kindergarten, I'm paying close attention school spread, evidence there. class one quarantine since school started, even Christmas whole lot, finally sent son back person week. Indoor gatherings problem, especially older kids. high school reported positives anything reason anywhere else: they're likely think they're invincible less likely consider people. know help help family, National Medical Association (NMA) professional organization black doctors founded century ago, dedicated task force promoting vaccination among black people.

Where still 1.25 years without anything meaningful. sad.

That's you. last year strange, anything meaningful made choice yourself.  People enjoy spirited driving. belt keeps planted seat better turns. nice get thrown around car panic stop too. What's point? governor gets covid restrictions state permanently? Iraq worst early on. like 100 cases travelers testing positive place ton parliament coming Hard believe you‚Äôre fucking us

So many people going get seriously hurt another serious pandemic future. (Not one isn't) ""growing infection rate"" SF, cases leveled 30/day past 3 weeks, beginning year. rate positive tests holding steady 0.85‚Äì0.9%.

Whatever growth think seeing noise data. go back 40 50 cases/day averaged whole week meaningfully say infections growing again. (And certainly could happen; indoor activities opened back past weeks.)

Key question: early indicators increase COVID-19 positive cases? New Cases per Day per 100,000 Residents 


at BEST number longer going down.

a .3 increase spike means, 3.3-3.6 still pretty far target 1.8 without vaccine. completely honest non scientific.....

I wanted either Moderna Pfizer vaccine simple fact getting historic vaccine. lucky ended Pfizer vaccine. yeah rate vaccine good enough! Victoria, Australia: Pathetic. one month without cases, 2 months January one Oh 75+ right now? would explain think. open people they‚Äôd full. Nice, even county toggle.

Never really heard Michigan bad...probably nobody understands cases per capita important number cases. You‚Äôre starting get point? very, weird pop anywhere AZ discussed. Including subreddits specific UK never said vaccine work. Lolwut. I'm talking US I'm fearmongering sharing obvious facts. Cases hospitalizations rising many states. Half cases rising. short-lived due vaccination rates people act like impossible. even arguing? interview ABC News' ""Good Morning America"" earlier Monday, Cuomo predicted American public would ""very skeptical"" taking vaccine touted Trump administration.

Look...another ringing endorsement! coward think one saddest things good intentions kind-hearted people manipulated, used, weaponized politicians, media, rest circus.

I don‚Äôt see many businesses willing kick people completely don‚Äôt it. guys still wear masks? spiking due dumbass Republican states removing mask mandates giving shit. anybody actually wears them... it‚Äôs important person (who‚Äôs infected) wear mask.

You said, know poster r conservative would advocate less government involvement. think compatriots demonstrated can't allow mob rule.

Which clearly implies think I'm ilk people regularly post there. 

But I'm actually someone *trolling* conservatives? it? conservative troll? really can't both. compatriots? trolls? realize trolls universally strong opinions government size; that's typically conservative talking point.

Don't fucking *think* I'm going let get away one. saw low-hanging fruit, took without looking closely, desperately backpeddling got caught. 

And, by, using someone's post history respond comment *definition* low effort. Keep telling ‚Äúthey‚Äôll fine‚Äù justify ruining lives safety measures aren‚Äôt even effective stopping virus feel safe. Pathetic. 

But really want play ‚Äúthink children‚Äù card I‚Äôd probably post something like this:

[Huff Post - Supply Chain Linked I‚Äôm sure can‚Äôt bothered info like that. You‚Äôre probably busy staying home saving lives like real hero... guess would hope PR team people know better I. effective, guess I‚Äôm it? great tricky. Colorado opened vaccinations 50+ last Friday.

Excelsior Pass solution problem. It‚Äôs actually pretty cool use blockchain although perfect.  First shot offers 80% protection. Definitely get can't pretend one shot anything.  Well, one choice open scrutiny. fuck anyone doesn‚Äôt get shot. Hell yeah Hospitalizations still down. worried all. Go - ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù argument vaccine passports infringement equally valid saying refusal infringement rest society. Starting lose support. always hate kids growing fast first time ever I‚Äôm counting days son turns 12 June, fully vaccinated fall. older 2 adults they‚Äôll eligible soon, too. Agreed. Good point get 24 hour warning evacuate first? lol

(seriously though, imagine many putin aimed place) think dropped 70 plus result unfulfilled vaccancies. expect stay empty long. 2.9 million people Toronto Iam sure plenty takers.

We also different Public Health Units moving faster others. UK apparently reported five cases rare blood clots. One five reported cases fatal, MHRA Vaccine Safety Lead Philip Bryan said, adding cases among men aged 19 First quotes article clear: trust vaccines, trust scientists, don‚Äôt trust Donald Trump,‚Äù test 7 days traveled since congestion sneezing. It‚Äôs better 99% fact wonder hell going Michigan New York I‚Äôve wondering thing ever since there‚Äôs speculation variants. vaccines incredibly well spike protein COVID. aren‚Äôt variants slight variation beyond spike protein? theory, shouldn‚Äôt vaccines protect COVID related variants since variants spike protein? going used US. Unfortunately Europe going need use debacle vaccine roll out. Basically countries good handle vaccine going need these. countries done good job vaccination afford good job vaccination needed. doubt going need vaccine much anything US including cruise ships long run kind messaging isnt going help. going tell people thing weve waited year wont help end this, many people think going say ""fuck it""? money pours youtube content creators. specific? ""COVID protocols"" sounds like scare tactic buzzword me.

We've got masks, smaller class sizes (pods), washing hands, socially distancing, else? thank you!  docs white dont go church Correction: Oil industry happy finance stores use unrecyclable plastic lamination:  actually safe 6' course better 3'. also article WA teachers added eligibility within hours Biden's directive. online questionnaire determine eligibility, screenshot results, book appointment. online questionnaire screenshot valid everywhere giving vaccines. Less 3 hours Biden's directive questionnaire (which already updated include teachers) booked 1st shot appointment two days later. Nobody salivating idea stupid fuck. want end early possible. longer people misbehave, longer deal shit. hard understand?!?!  No, unless lie. got vaccinated CCC last week obviously ask ID, also recite address loud. chick joined boyfriend line behind told first person checking everyone's appointments ""there support"". got stage asking ID/insurance, like ""oops, forgot cards!"" I'm sure ended vaccinating anyway, hope mean someone legit appointment end getting screwed ""oops teehee even carries ID insurance grown adult?"" woman. never many post-it‚Äôs. Lol dude expression Personally, like Pfizer, also vaccine got. Why? evidence starts protecting 10-12 days first shot, protects higher percentage J J. Also, 2nd shot three weeks first rather 4 weeks like Moderna. also think fewer side effects percentage Moderna. fuuuucked man, Bill Gates give Surface tablet :/  Salt lowers temperature ice considerably. That's salt roads snow storm. would 2nd dose less? Nuke florida studies coming seem show bit difference there. instance, recent studies regarding transplant patients one shot, elicit neutralizing antibodies, did, twice likely Moderna, oddly. thing is, better states vaccinating risk groups, longer it'll roll adults.

Remember opening vaccine everyone change many vaccinations able hand every day. Hope that's reporting delays everyone 50 Boomer. get grass.  80% one dose, 90% two Uhuh. animal get from? really hate fact people can‚Äôt wait clear. rush get back school work prematurely going continue fuck us again. wait clear, go back actual normalcy worry 3ft vs 6ft social distancing. equation different Denmark Norway, considering low amount deaths we‚Äôre currently seeing COVID. Worst case projection Denmark permanent ban AZ would prolong vaccination effort three weeks. 

With improving weather, positive effect cases last year, continued vaccinations Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J vaccines hopefully lowering even further, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs necessarily fair ask younger people get vaccine might represent larger risk death actual disease. 

I say might, obviously they‚Äôre still trying figure out. infrastructure also good enough able quite quickly catch up, case re-approve vaccine, personally I‚Äôm completely behind health officials careful approach issue.

I always I'm obligated wear mask obligated like it. studying abroad semester (in country vaccine rollout going quite slowly), returning U.S. Mid-May. Considering pace vaccine rollout state, likely pick vaccine. anyone recommendations would best get? better get J&amp;J speed pace full vaccination, go full pfizer/moderna regiment? advice much appreciated. dad pretty strong side effects Moderna shots (he covid asymptomatic months prior). experience decided go Pfizer. Moderna kind scared me. However, symptoms probably bit worse first shot (muscle pain, 100+ fever, chills, injection pain, fatigue), weirdly bad stomach cramps 24+ hours later. Also fever started day later, started 12 hours later lasted 16 hours.  Either way, I'd take real symptoms day. retrospect bad - day two feeling lousy, stops almost like switch. ""CDC Director Rochelle Walensky issued urgent plea Americans Monday continue following public health measures.

‚ÄúWe much look forward to, much promise potential much reason hope, right I‚Äôm scared,‚Äù said Walensky, noted begun experiencing ‚Äúrecurring‚Äù feeling ‚Äúimpending doom.‚Äù

The plea came amid news positive Covid-19 cases increased 10.6% compared previous seven-day period.

That's happens someone credibility. like picture girl fire background That‚Äôs true. millions Phizer Moderna doses arriving now. put AZ vaccines storage weeks safe.

That's imported cows somewhere else spread locally city. idiots listen point get herd immunity faster expense. also untried (except studies) new technology, using proteins harvested insect cells test tube. think everyone's waiting see final study results hang hopes Novavax vaccine. works well, might overcome mRNA vaccines popularity usefulness, new strange understand people may hesitant it. par mean population vaccination rate prior par rest U.S.. polling show numbers keep putting up. Stop making stuff repeating things easily disproven. Vaccination rates something gets tracked. Current COVID19 vacs included. 1 per million? Seems normal. fuck downvoting this? Jesus sub gone shit. Yup. millions MRNA vaccines arriving following weeks. take chances? talking about?

Pfizer began vaccine studies minors. probably months approved Literally comment said stuff like would excessive someone who‚Äôs still unvaccinated, get rid mask mandate yet? get everyone who‚Äôs vaccinated want finally feel free, sake others like me, waiting patiently year turn, I‚Äôd rather get sick antivax/anti-maskers jumping no-mask bandwagon get vaccine. It‚Äôs fair people who‚Äôve waited long priority also respect that. Canada‚Äôs health authorities said it‚Äôs clear whether issue would rather wait weeks see data plays out, since millions Phizer Moderna vaccines arriving. Understandable, rest assured goal surpassed quite bit unless something crazy happens! Yeah, state, Michigan, HORRIBLY right desperately needs lockdown infections raging worst state union COVID.

But people done COVID. care.

Even weeks would godsend right now.

I'm relatively young already gotten first dose, I'm super worried, still annoying. said actually replying people asking masks social distancing even full vaccination need fuck off.

That's responded way did. point still absolutely reason wear mask social distance. Vaccination != getting act like virus going on. made clear even vaccination still wear mask social distance.

 


I arguing needing mask. know vaccinated really need one. stil recommended, get tell people still want masks distancing fuck off?

 


Kinda seems exactly like plague rats saying whole time: ""Well wear mask scared, tell live life!"" Seems pretty hypocritical gives reason lie say got vaccine that's need mask.

 


So hey, slow down, read, listen, think. sentences think responding first one clearly offensive second one? Come on. Asia certainly learned past epidemics pandemics. much better job US COVID fake news then? Anti-vax much bigger problem left. 

Anti-*this* vax bigger problem right. Ask prejudiced trust people based qualifications color skin really incredible hope CDC relays this! Ny focused prone severe illness spreading - understandably. (Preconditions, elderly...) it‚Äôs spreading still need vaccinate people takes weeks vaccine fully kick in. Even first shot, develop body. 

So, reasons (people tired masks, opening up...), spreading..... Wanda Vision makes miss Mandalorian. article says cases among females: mean, I'm stating personal experiences lol.

Yep, take away too. pretty much attacks main mechanism infection, virus mutates mechanism probably able infect us anymore. suppose possible variant somewhere might come ""solution"", highly suspect that's case DC sobbing even harder Yeah okay Mr arm chair scientist government shuttered businesses allowing others remain open. sharply limited citizens individual liberty allowing others freedom based employment. would able set disparate rules based vaccines? I‚Äôm seeing benefit. freshwater ice -30c. lowering freezing point -5c help? Actually Bonnie Henry said ‚Äúsignals‚Äù potential problem since millions Phizer Moderna doses coming would rather take cautious approach. There's fine line requiring vaccine attend public school requiring vaccine buy groceries. trouble understanding that, suggest lay Kool Aid. imagine previous Presidents administration announced 3 feet safe schools must reopen. media would‚Äôve immediately announced it‚Äôs coordinated move undermine Covid efforts. next President it‚Äôs fine. üôåüèªüéâüéâüéâ good news once!

Man..that must put worried Americans ease vaccination. Remind little Trump trusted  Pfizer supposed prevent hospitalization 100%. hope recover. honestly hope people riot shit.  daily new cases daily new deaths currently worse time periods last year prior november. 

We close woods people letting guard early. tried sign doctor's office big medical group there's appointments listed six months lol. signed notified via email, hope get enough supply actually vaccinate everyone soon. Eligibility sounds great need actually able get appointments good press. Okay, how's sharing vaccine Palestinians? Bonnie Henry said waiting data several months second shot becomes concern. It‚Äôs wait see approach taken abundance caution since abundance Phizer Moderna vaccines coming next weeks. That‚Äôs article said. 11 percent want go full time. 50 percent said full time hybrid. Man, bad infuriates China's numbers low? Like solely responsible unleashing upon world somehow 90k total cases every week hear manufacturing sector booming.. meanwhile everyone else brink. entire argument COVID restrictions always been, ""Even worried catching COVID, could still pass onto others.""

You're flipping script saying pro refuse get vaccinated need continue isolating. Why? vaccinated, afraid unvaccinated people. There's compromise made. would look experts say. experience bar restaurant industry make expert reopen country manner economically efficacious minimizes risks might incur due pandemic. entirely possible barreling reopening things leads worse unexpected economic outcomes taking measured response. know enough know enough. Take Sweden example impose unlike European countries, impose strict lockdown 2020 attempt minimize economic effects pandemic. However, experienced 7.4% reduction GDP second quarter 2020 compared previous year. reduced production Sweden comparable neighbouring countries imposed lockdowns ‚Äì e.g. -6.2% Finland -4.6% Norway (Eurostat) ‚Äì possibly propagation negative effects locked-down countries Sweden economic networks.""

The irresponsible play listening people know better think do. lot things life complicated non-intuitive. tools determine what's best course doubt either. tell people know better think. 

From I've read one method might reopen things gradually cases consistently fall specified levels replace restrictions cases rise. seems case need lot coordination different regions lifting imposing lockdowns effectively benefit reopening. case adequate vaccinations, probably still need follow guidelines limit travel probably need relief federal government.

It shame realize know. one person capable solving problems world. work best society able achieve much working together. means listening people experience knowledge subjects know enough about.  people believe report also believe China 100k +/- cases &lt;5k deaths covid. 89% don‚Äôt kids Yep yep. husband working home sine last March quit job stay home risk putting daycare. managing tight. Guess little better since literally remember I'm real nervous taking 12+ month old anywhere first time....let alone around people. Hopefully he's well adjusted despite lol several ways happen.

The first immune system may compromised capable producing antibodies, shots really much. Things like old age combined certain diseases treatments, like chemotherapy, severely compromise immune system. Smoking also strong factor, especially diseases attack lungs.

The second vaccine somehow effective. Perhaps stored improperly transported way caused lose effectiveness.

The last final way could aunt uncle take vaccine, claimed otherwise.

The final, far least likely way three vaccines properly, body functioned normal, still got sick. according studies conducted exceedingly uncommon, albeit impossible. Still, uncle would roughly chance win lottery getting struck lightning.

EDIT: also, administered shots December, either truly extreme risk group (where good chance work anyway might well), part trial possible administered placebo shots. See this: No. know seniors got pfizer/moderna J&amp;J even distributed yet. Vaccines required various thing really long time. Schools require them.

It's unique travel either, many countries day require proof yellow fever vaccine example. close country world sacrifice second summer season potential revenue.

I'm talking countries making laws restricting travel. I'm saying that, yeah, traveling pandemic risky people really consider worth it. truly worth it, able quarantine period even 7 10 days ""They fast, run away military shoot them."" Yeah fuckin' right. Society would collapse instantly. Except New Zealand would miraculously keep shit together. Salt water ice considerably colder freshwater need afraid admit that. Vaccine passports participate society insane. Nobody support them. let people gaslight thinking they're morally acceptable necessary. accepting terrifying level 6 months ago seems ok got much worse winter.

We close end, let‚Äôs mess Get help Ohio‚Äôs northern border invaded Michigan. 70 year old Reddit. How?
My father 55 gets around emails  good news colleges universities TROLL, ahole. That's less number deaths moderate flu season, reference. I‚Äôm 20s far many friends said fuck last weeks. It‚Äôs like, wait 3 weeks more. Think hard happens medical system forced deal overwhelming number patients. Think injuries illnesses currently treatable functioning available medical system. reason medical professionals panicking average idiot know close society come literal collapse modern medical provision. Triage exists reason: limited number doctors beds, none account uncontrolled pandemic. **Please refer facts** coronavirus.  

This subreddit coronavirus, people claiming ""12% small"" ""12% big.""  

Read please. led nation new cases 57 percent rise past week. 

It's 12% - ... fact - more. said - ""read it."" wrong read articles submitted coronavirus cases United States continued rise past week, jumping much 12 percent nationwide, senior officials implored Americans stick public health measures help reverse seven-day average new cases topped 63,000 first time nearly month, according data compiled Washington Post, states Michigan, Vermont North Dakota reported substantial spikes new infections. nation appeared poised fourth wave illness even vaccine eligibility expanding many states.

The ""as much 12%"" may low another new articles say 16% nationwide quite low compared surge NY. Nah. burning mine soon state mandate done. Link? think that‚Äôs good analogy, subject two distinctions: 1) Covid, risk ‚Äúdefect‚Äù wildly different different groups people, 2) Covid, there‚Äôs evidence restrictions (or refraining selling defective cars) actually anything prevent harm defect (i.e., restrictions don‚Äôt stop spread/reduce mortality). Came say that. international student US required provide documentation multiple childhood periodic vaccinations TB test. good fucking reason. Also factor 130 million Americans likely infected. course there's cross vaccinated though. idea vaccine complications come years years later based historically seen vaccines.

Question medical professionals I'm idiot hanging basement: understanding new type vaccine technology approved released large scale before. So, we've seen historically necessarily apply jujst making mountain mole hill?  like generous sample size.

Only they're genuinely randomly selected.   self-select ""only ones take Covid precautions seriously"", going get accurate data, even polling 75% them. Africa Oceania show increase...And North America relatively small increase compared Europe, Asia South America. So, think headline bit hyperbole... Link wonder adverse effects 2nd dose? would plausible explanation, UK really giving first doses, I'm unsure EU following original recommended dosage timing. link immunologist? Astrazeneca renamed vaccine bad press, hope people hear different name take vaccine otherwise considering read AZ. Talk shady company practices! Everyone talking deadly blood clots Astra suspect whatever mechanism causing blood clots could also causing negative non-lethal side effects well, case. 
  point wonder people skip Astra vaccine others available market. people pressured take AZ vaccine want antivaxxer... Yes, enough herd immunity stop variants developing. Although, studies produced seems like that's low risk far. time tell, unfortunately.  mean homeless people wanted cut half? normal life ? Normalcy got thrown fucking window along time ago. that's protective idiots like you. Spanish flu pandemic easy go on, deal trolling asshats internet easy slightest bit good news people like start doom gloom. 


And mother fucking information continue part masking distancing, write checks ass can't cash. shut fuck up. 

Don't pretend want things way obviously true  trial phases take longer rate covid spread reduced compared last year (ie due lockdown, previous infections, vaccines). wait placebo population reaches specific % real cases? would great reminder get second dose weren‚Äôt fucking email sent spam folder thousands garbage mails. UK gov invested instead. Probably need it.   Freakenomics great podcast president make big difference economy yet everyone talks like right president fix economy. Beats anyone 40 manages forget lies sleaze Blair. Dr. Walensky abysmal PR. I'm debate qualifications health professional good god anyone get separate media team together people. Fauci least pretty good it, even moments. record respect people trust scientists. holy shit get wound idiotic media decisions. mention Walensky seems consistently expression face looks perpetually disgusted terrified. help! think through, selfish. Understandable, selfish. vaccine producing nation finished vaccination campaign yet. everyone acted way, many countries single jab day. apologize misinterpreted. re-read comment still know way interpreted. gave reasons previous president trusted. mean say that? quoted comment? Round round go stops nobody knows... apparently people can‚Äôt fucking learn wait going wild outside actually behind us. unfortunately many americans think terms political party  anyone know CVS isn‚Äôt following state eligibility restrictions exactly? Tried book vaccine appointment someone Maryland‚Äôs group 2b earlier morning website said weren‚Äôt eligible. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt matter hang vaccinated not. don‚Äôt understand thats whole point vaccination. Assuming trolling: know two things killed US covid cancer (of obese increases likelihood makes treatment far less effective) heart disease (of obese major factor)? saying, ""I vaccine, proudly avoided thing kills fewer people thing actively body."" life live, hope over-abundance food worth reduced quality life decades lost. Also, know still eat cold pizza soda 39bmi, right? know Biontech AZ randomly distributed? rules older people got AZ younger folks Biontech (or vice versa)? Zero sense. That‚Äôs like saying US lot people speak Spanish they‚Äôre basically Mexico. Irish pretty much Australians. Quebecers people France understand other, that‚Äôs it. don‚Äôt really GAF apart that. Haha thank you. well. No, EU doses manufactured EU UK doses manufactured UK India.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wait we're vaccinated. saying weeks year now. end. Australia going another lockdown. thought beat it? NZ. can't zero covid. end unless say no.

Many us saying now. Yeah, I'm fairly certain Covid pandemic viewed generation's Chernobyl: man-made disaster shook world, brought totalitarian country's incompetence pathological unwillingness take responsibility anything bad would harm fragile national ego. similarities they've handling almost eerie - I'm sure we'll see even coming months years, get know depths Chinese government's depraved mishandling obfuscation. they‚Äôre vaccinated that‚Äôs end game. You‚Äôve made live lives. common knowledge, guy ranting internet, cases indeed rising. Many states uninterrupted steep curves. Michigan forefront first reduce restrictions. twenty states joining would good.

Please, wear mask distance much avoid complete lockdown vaccine saturation really reduces propagation enter true herd based remission cases. Talk friends loved ones. We're close avoid another tragedy. target spike proteins, although know AZ vaccine as... Flexible targeting, spike changes shape attaches cell, cleverness MRNA vaccines others, able handle shape change. might account high effectiveness. huge proponent vaccination. think vaccine mandatory.

But reality one vaccines simply worse others. That‚Äôs anti vaxx nonsense. That‚Äôs based facts needs known. Blissful ignorance helped one 

And nice ignored how, said, neutralization B1.135 severely compromised Great! can't wait get second dose Saturday! way truly ‚Äúsquash thing‚Äù reduce transmission 0 globally, way happen. form COVID likely become endemic, like flu. Like flu, annual vaccine common strains. Yes, would it. grandma 80 years old, still vaccinated, still even appointment get vaccinated. Plenty work done, still. Ah, didn‚Äôt know that. Thank correcting me. say, teacher PA, unions incredible. fight us everything. think grocery store workers want protections, need turn unions help. one going randomly decide stick - unions stick teachers pay too. That‚Äôs cute lab

Now since ultrasound signal completely degraded air propose penetrate lungs kill Covid? Since know...It‚Äôs respiratory illness Yes I'm aware. like see declining, especially 10%. Probably? According who? complete speculation parts world open weeks experienced anything like that.

You're making go along government. almost entirely driven northeast 

Where say this?

The article includes North Dakota Michigan. speculative though, mean possible would think unlikely MHRA take things likely, would British public NHS.

The cost keeping quiet, imo, would worth risk. Pure curiosity. haven‚Äôt got vaccine yet since I‚Äôm 30-year-old healthy woman. 61-year-old dad 60-year-old uncle 34-year-old colleague got Sinovac vaccine, side effects all. 57-year-old mum got Sinovac vaccine last Friday sore arm day, that‚Äôs (no fever headaches). You‚Äôre acting like they‚Äôre asking last bowel movement was. want know got poked arm keep employees customers safe. I'm sure data available, I'm curious:

In reports daily new cases, report many people one vaccine shots? new cases people shots, would clear indicator vaccines effective. I'm wondering info tracked not. Norway, Denmark, Germany, Austria ....have cases. trust press health authorities countries UK , especially something politically charged this. 90-95% ‚â† 100%

Some get sick vaccination, inevitability. hell lot less vaccines Blame politicians thought would great idea hide cases ""even rare cases rare deaths could magnified conspiracists appear massacre"" can‚Äôt argue idiot friend. drag level, beat experience! again, two human actions happening everywhere America, several places greater extent, everywhere experiencing surge like Michigan, seeing steep declines. still see continue ascribing ebbs flows human action. CureVac get approval late-April early-May.

They won't. Curevac CEO recently quoted [not expect approval end new variants messing study results.

I would plan vaccination campaign without Curevac now. 1. solution wear masks socially distance decades know COVID cause long-term effects? That‚Äôs ridiculous.

2. Vaccinating enough adult population could still get us point spread, hospitalizations, deaths negligible. That‚Äôs real concern this: overwhelming health care system. Among children, COVID less dangerous flu, don‚Äôt shut society flu.

3. variants, disease likely become endemic like flu. annual shots major variants, like flu.

I reiterate still wear mask probably state‚Äôs mask mandate ends. don‚Äôt think government grounds force mask wearing enough people vaccinated. still recommend it. First shots. Here's thing understand (and sadly changing week in, week help seeing things clearer), please ELI5: impression UK vaccinated basically nearly half population AstraZeneca jab, ‚Äì minimal ‚Äì issues (or we'd heard now, right?). OTOH EU countries halted AZ campaigns health concerns, first 65+, all, sub 65. what's going on? UK withholding reports issues? none EU losing marbles? I'm genuinely confused.

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr possible one country jabbed half inhabitants AZ little issues yet there's sudden concern certain age groups (which ones, pick, seems one thing opposite) others? Yes, study look specifically infected tough symptoms long-term effects. Pro-vaccine sense want force everyone get bar can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt society? sense think it‚Äôs perfectly safe get vaccine encourage others to? latter, totally agree with, also hate lockdowns. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unique stance seem think is. Agreed, countries fucked vaccine game cause unnecessary deaths dragging out. UK US gang massive early unnecessary deaths, save lives impressive vaccine rollout. literally one rule eclipses: Don‚Äôt look sun them.  brings President United States:.... Yikes. States opening early. mind asking, anywhere close Raymond James? so, general area Superbowl?

Huge assumption username excited WrestleMania. I'm looking forward show actual crowd. health provider vaccinating, check site. technically eligible according state guidelines let make appointment. assume doses capacity pretty flexible. That‚Äôs still pretty close million. increase northeast tightly knit, largely unvaccinated communities.

According who?
 Washington Post, states Michigan, Vermont North Dakota reported substantial spikes new infections.

North Dakota Michigan north east.

Is source claim? definitely agree that's likely, especially low % 0-16-year-olds. make sense?

One dose already supoused effect, course I'm going wait getting second that... 

They ""know"" nothing second dose weeks first already recommending it...

No thanks, common sense tells pass... I'm sorry defending vaccine anti-vax nonsense Universal Disney Florida required masks entry ride imagine it‚Äôll clarify even further, potential group children vaccinated prior school opening fall 12 up. still good thing, ultimately opens 12-15 year olds. trials 12 couple months out. weeks we'll probably see daily first doses administered metric start decrease since less eligible unvaccinated people. Perhaps start tracking another metric: First doses percentage unvaccinated population.

E.g. went 32.4% 37.1% adult population first doses week, meaning 7.0% unvaccinated adults reportedly got first dose past week. Similarly increase 69.8% 73.1% age 65+ means 10.9% population got first dose.

Maybe could used estimate future changes infections. making certain assumptions, one could imagine change new cases could decrease similar proportion newly vaccinated population.

It could also measure continued vaccinated progress eligible groups high proportion vaccination, like 65+. risk severe illness vaccine miniscule. number blood clots seen Europe seen UK, we've vaccinated 15% people 16-49. point vaccination simply protect individual, protect society reduce transmission. Even knew vaccine slightly higher risk fatality getting COVID, would still take protect others. End first class quarter prof asks last questions. guy goes ‚Äú question class. safe think vaccines are?‚Äù lmao think it‚Äôs apples oranges mainly measles vaccine others need proof go school went normal testing, whereas COVID vaccine brand new. think it‚Äôs crazy demand everyone takes experimental drug. Also 30's PA (suburban Philly). told wait 4/1 started fight get it. I'm sure what's wrong state, I'm done putting weekend. point, I'm assuming 10% 90% PA residents. :( bye felicia  (slightly) immuno-compromised person here. case Crohn's disease take IV medication every 8 weeks prevents immune system issuing crazy inflammation responses goes haywire, narrow signaling path (TNF-alpha). gist immune system mostly works like normal one specific way tries signal inflammatory response (that associated Crohn's disease) disabled.

For worth appreciate people wear mask around stand within 6 feet. whole family took ton isolation precautions past year frustrating people outside family want stand 3 feet wear mask pull mask talk.

Now vaccine becoming available expect things change. people still really careful. Personally got moderna vaccine 2 weeks ago (just chance!).  I'm 2 weeks second shot I'm going start things again. might still wear mask public indoor places, I'm hoping go mostly back normal spring/summer. really long year. I'm willing give 2 years life 40 year old feel like crap 3 weeks. over. it'll wait booster shot variants something else. swear, people want keep going despite evidence showing home stretch. Virus made China attack USA. TRUMP right defund still ""leaked"" press bound UK, truth coming long headlines gone out.  
 
The level desperation use UK scapegoat, though one country could possibly somehow responsible entire continent's shitty vaccine rollout, really quite something. Boo updated science says otherwise Either talking you, got sock puppets mixed up. Cry harder what? fact you‚Äôre literally complaining non-existent problem?

Or fact I‚Äôm sick reading toddler eats whole bag candy gets sick prove point parents told no? Thanks posting! one variants P1 P1 Israel? Florida opened vaccines anybody 40 today. good luck finding vaccine. can't find place offers vaccine openings. even let schedule appt days advance.   suspect stop people know better refusing vaccine multiple lies told eu leaders backtracked caught lie. name change could help save many morons eu.  understand completely, there‚Äôs 0 evidence suggest we‚Äôd 0% efficacy new variants. would less effective general. still means vaccinated would transmit newer variants, less. people like socialize friends people actually like socialize with, instead forced socialize social coworkers nothing common except working place.

I get people like working office people rely solely coworkers social stimuli, taboo prefer working home also mean automatically anti-social shut-in introvert like many daily thread starved return office think.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Remember almost none press coverage mentioned variants vaccines started come out. simply put. far I'm aware know vaccine efficacy track among variants US mentioning variants seem vaccine-resistant like B.1.351 P.1 variants. Containing spread variants take aggressive measures, seems like opposite response seeing states, possibly necessitate second-generation vaccine booster shot program. Unless expert incredibly irresponsible make sweeping claim.  Israel right? SA Brazilian variant proven resistant antibodies though? yeah ive considered drugs thats probably gonna end well. maybe video games. LOL wish could ignorant think Disney would anything lose dollar actually gave shit pandemic would‚Äôve closed entire time doom faith CDC separating politics science. emphasizing point. banned travel earlier, Wuhan China. news link this?

You said something like, *the lockdown farce*, everyone assumed meant covid real. mostly people either trolling clueless site who've saying conspiracy whole time, we're understandably fed kind talk.

The stay home orders ridiculous people actually follow them, kept getting extended. we'd done like countries, stay lockdown going year now. we'd stayed lockdown well enough, would month. didn't. blame lockdown orders, blame people observe first place.

There's plenty resources show covid different, mortality rate much higher recent virus outbreak, deadliest pandemic since Spanish Flu 100 years ago. various strange long term effects cause people serious health issues, even longer infected.

What people mostly upset someone dismisses seriousness pandemic, year dismissiveness root cause us still lockdown country. flippant disregard health safety others pretending big deal caused us continue lockdown. Nothing else. Y'all gonna die vaccine  One year pandemic, lockdowns causing harm good. 2 couples know got divorced lost jobs close bankruptcy, either vaccinate vulnerable people roll dice young people, cohort good % gotten Covid already number unreported cases far outweigh actual ones... life must go caution like large gatherings obviously mask mandates everyone wants vaccine gets one.  Good Lord. states. doctors 100% sure that's February 2020 went in. ""It's virus know is"" told me.  ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù thing depressing. Got second Pfizer shot today, tho!

Assuming hot spots due shortage vaccines people still thinking it‚Äôs hoax is. 

It‚Äôs already incredibly easy get vaccines rural areas they‚Äôre signing them. anything said. argument based idea what's happening Europe happen United States, meaning thinks vaccines work.

For boat analogy, he's looking ship, SS European Union, hundred large holes it, filling water rapidly. None holes getting patched up, tools it. He's saying ship, SS United States, around half holes patched water emptying breakneck speed crew working quickly get holes taken care of, definitely sink anyway regardless many holes patched much water inside.

Don't think messaging little ridiculous? find discouraging? say harmful trying motivate people get ship back good shape? vaccinate recovered till last month, many consider need adults either vaccinated recovered officially probably even unreported recovered.

This interesting. Almost time someone brings natural immunity US, immediate response comes ""natural immunity work variants"". certainly seems like helped Israel then.

Antibuddies There‚Äôs cows city get burger I‚Äôm every corner true. I've first dose Moderna, pain arm never really got bad. Sure, sore bit stiff, enough prevent sleeping side. Pain Flu shot far worse personally. 16 fortunately don‚Äôt often serious issues. hope teachers get jabs ASAP. know state  short we‚Äôre still test subjects. vaccines approved FDA, authorized emergency use. results part ongoing study effectiveness vaccines get approved. study particularly useful participants provided nasal swabs regardless physical condition (e.g. whether COVID symptoms), gives us detailed analysis actual effectiveness real world scenarios. 

This good news, let‚Äôs celebrate staying home watching Wanda Vision again. don‚Äôt think so. Salt lower melting point water, won‚Äôt lower temperature. Indoor dining? Someone would put gun head eat inside restaurant. Glad okay. need know anything exist first place.

If requiring ID vote racist disproportionately affects disadantaged, requiring vaccine passport buy groceries absolutely acceptable. hypocrisy society astounding. Thought experiment. weighed 100 pounds ballooned 200 pounds 3 months started freaking out, went 400 pound enormous effort medical aid got back 200 pounds, binged ate went 220, would saying good would say
‚ÄúBoy, 6 months ago 200 pounds terrifying, suddenly saying cool level (and gaining) could gotten safer level celebrating half mile finish‚Äù? 1st shot Moderna 2nd shot Moderna. 1st shot Pfizer 2nd shot Pfizer. almost like intentionally wrote understood.... can't understand either I'd rather person inconveniences myself, whether necessary not, order right thing others.

If staying home wearing mask saved one person's life, well worth it. Three weeks might good enough CDC reporting impending doom. We're going get 85% immunity going happen think anyone predicting that. realistic projections I've seen suggests maybe 70 75.we're going magically wait 85% people vaccine go back normal we'll waiting forever Well I‚Äôm rooting guys Los Angeles, helps much. Yes brutal going keep spreading back forth kids though. Real world mrnas getting 90%. still means 1 10 exposed going get sick. own, still risk getting vaccinated especially 16. still sure feel vaccine passports, like sure, traveling things like planes, sure, requiring vaccination card things, ok with.

&amp;#x200B;

Dont get wrong, way antivaxx, already got first dose Pfizer vaccine, getting second dose week today, sure agree vaccine passports. Dr. Fauci said needed reach 85% herd immunity go back normal. 330 million estimated Americans going best case scenario would 240 million Americans herd immunity. find incredibly unlikely 240 million Americans achieved immunity next month so. Even 70% herd immunity level need things go back normal. ""on par"" mean less 15% population vaccinated

and surveys show half population Florida says getting vax, 50% refuses mask/properly complaining, slippery scope way try get world back normal faster unprecedented pandemic.

YOUR ENTIRE COMMENT SLIPPERY SLOPE.

Vaccine passports even overton window 6 months ago. would considered dystopian 2019. ADVOCATING bet going confirmation it‚Äôs hoax... Dude talking about? literally second wave. Yes thousands people died countries deaths mentioned happened vaccine. Brazil basically place number death's rising vaccination started around world. Plus still hot fuck even south. Context: currently worse terms daily cases point prior november (and getting worse), current daily deaths bad worse week summer (and starting get worse)

And annoying probably 6 weeks away really knocking covid keep vaccinating follow guidance states cannot wait virtue signal longer taking seriously. come people getting re-infected? wondering others noticed well. drastic shift sub past 2 weeks surprised me. seem pro-ignorance movement moved encouraging others throw caution wind. get media blame this( pump click-bait headlines instead pumping headline full statement) good grief, public officials saying going live bunker rest year! both? know California set aside vaccines certain zip codes hit hard. makes sense standpoint trying stop spread quickly possible. discussions moot 4-6 weeks

They matter present important. unvaccinated teacher living area hard find vaccine appointments rightly concerned going back class week new rules. catch Covid find vaccine appointment. Telling ‚Äúif survive next month two, won‚Äôt matter anymore‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually useful. really. First shot arm sore jump. Took Tylenol drank water fine. second shot expecting feel sick never came. thing golf ball sized lump injection notice unless touch it. feel lucky. know breakdown Pfizer Mederna is? ....is anyone else really confused comment?

Hard palate = roof mouth? Common garden pest = caterpillar? Like even know article state variants currently present overall israel, though‚Äîthat seems like important question. would reassuring know whether so-called variants concern circulating there. they‚Äôve controlling borders pretty strictly, it‚Äôs given.  
 
I still think good news, also might mean OG covid there?? wish article were. ore clear point Neighbor got covid 1 yea ago... 3 days sick

Got Christmas... 10 days bedridden.. almost sent hospital. He's 40s

There multiple strains Gotcha, sorry questions lol, return home traveling first traveling? way much covid anxiety right bet going find two shot vaccines way effective inevitable next variant longer periods time.  new strategy deal much cautious family members talk baby steps towards normalcy.

Reactionaries love conflate issues, gives ammunition lie with. saying can't trust vaccine president liar. question vaccine. Trump.

Link it, guarantee wrong. knew Trump nothing vetting vaccine probably worried would feather sowed doubt. Harris.

donald trusted Joe VP Harris started sowing seeds doubt? got buddy, crushing it. Harris. Cuomo later admitted much thought sucks viable vaccine released election.

Cool, say take vaccine? snort several lines daily. Percentage shots used always dumb metric. easier give 10% million vaccines 90% thousand vaccines. 

CA given vaccinations state. loose hope wear mask stay home helps keep everyone safe Maybe get better slowly start again? live one busiest non stop cities. miss loved something everynight. Though summer. Could seasonal? 

I reckon keep trying get ice cream week sake 

If hubby page chilling though roll it. know couple moved sea side haven‚Äôt looked back. love seeing hardly anyone haha one dose Pfizer better J&amp;J? I'll probably stick one dose Pfizer think knuckleheads get decimated one nasty variants clean-up 2021.

They still sure vaccinated still can't carriers - case, unvaccinated world hurt 2021.   trying explain friends, childless. gave birth April 2nd...of last year. locked since then. family help, breaks, friends, mom groups, single parent doctor visits. nightmare still even vaccinated now. hope spread drops soon start choosing covid risk development near one year mark. Well commentary around 'quasi effective' exactly completely agree - i've fan doublespeak around topic. low-risk individuals must adhere guidelines regardless health avoid potentially spreading it, simultaneously good get vaccinated spread it? people greatest significant risk ample time vaccine availability get now. Open registrations people actually get instead anit-vaxxers, science deniers, disinterested old people. US govt rescue Canada way sooner that. hospitalizations *are* increasing, *deaths* decreasing. 

This virus confusing. would tell grampa. Pfizer invented Viagra could enjoy life invented vaccine keep enjoying Viagra. Auto correct. Great job. least word. always enjoy commuting. wakes morning, gives time compose myself, lets work need to, brings lot great restaurants. commute hour, trade anything else. feel really lost without train ride separate school life home life. wasted time. One hospital open ages crashed server lol. Pharmacies well. Pfizer good bit stronger cell response relatively heavily oriented towards CD8 cells. vaccine way Novavax. J&amp;J also pretty strong cell response well think focused CD4. Good news. you‚Äôre mouse. less 100 least 1 dose currently. help end help end deadly aspects disease. magic cure make everything go back normal immediately. take time things get back normal. go fast immediately reopening risk causing huge rise cases. CDC Director today stated right still surge larger surges. keep seeing comments idiots braiging they're grill outs hanging friends ü§¶ idiots stay home going place wear mask even vaccinated 90% effective please dumb


Edit:spelling Going need flu passport next? Nothing recorded. honor system least am. people say ""never"" get vaccine people never took virus seriously first place.

I suspect 25% already infected previously.

Even people probably eventually ""convinced"" monetary incentives wanting avoid travel restrictions. Assuming government job.

Its position exists capitalism, middlemen  Whats current data Pfizer Moderna protection Brazil South Africa variants? expected still protection since JnJ one did? Yes really enforced many places let without it.
And around 90% adult (over 16) population already vaccine ""passport"" really non issue. database would strictly indicate whether someone vaccinated not. example, cruise requires passenger vaccinated prior boarding (which Royal Caribbean planning), verify someone isn‚Äôt lying? person could fraudulent vaccine card. That‚Äôs risk take paper documentation. database Royal Caribbean could run name list people confirmed vaccinated would weed people lying. international travel. 

Of course it‚Äôs concert event they‚Äôre vaccinated can‚Äôt produce card, they‚Äôre subject taking Covid test prior entry. state people attend event another state? There‚Äôs right answer this. 

A private company would access national database. would policy vaccinations (most say it‚Äôs required depending industry). Historically, indeed so. Yet landlord still waltz 6 people time living room whenever fuck wants cause he's selling covid. hell showings never restricted!?! 


Businesses closed, open-houses fucking living room allowed. joke. golden state take notes learning sunshine state older sickly people vaccinated. dont understand would see impending doom. even get huge spike cases, hospitalizations bad before.

And spelled farce actually conversation friends week amazing byproduct masks much less colds flus went around planned saving masks use got sick future.  Agreed. Like said another comment 100% masking mandates going away everyone wants vaccine **opportunity** get vaccine. point though masking mandate needs stay place easily identifiable way tell someone vaccinated. Thanks! No, that's whole fucking story. doorknob lickers think girls fake stop spreading know Newsom public health department they've already planned shutdown. Israel little uptick plummet well, function things opening back up. vaccinations catch up, head towards 0 soon enough Zero **deaths**, London.

Nationwide 23 people died, 334 people admitted hospital, least 4,654 new cases.

That said, started gradually lifting lockdown restrictions today. stay home order ended, meet outdoors six people several households unlimited group two households, outdoor sports possible. weeks we'll open bit more, everything's still going according plan, weeks bit still.

Lockdown restrictions projected end entirely June, believe. need listen public health directives avoid another spike. Doubt. government toast vaccination fly autumn elections. lots strings pulled behind scenes. Politicians might mathematical prowess Streeck, naturals corruption. helps obtaining vaccines.

On sidenote, late party might get update already. Hoskins effect backboosting could apply Coronaviruses too. Contrary public opinion, pandemic long time, might count 2022.  American company (Novavax) headquartered Maryland outsourcing/offshoring domestic manufacturing production making vaccine Europe? made USA? Thanks laugh, Reddit stranger!

Your spelling necessarily American, word ""globalisation/globalization"" threw off. guess American British spelling used outside countries, assumed :) haven‚Äôt seen evidence indicate Canada ‚Äúlowest Canada priority list‚Äù. Perhaps Canada top list, honest I‚Äôd surprised even list 

Pfizer meeting targets consistently since delays caused upgrading Belgium facility. see reason wouldn‚Äôt meet target been? get first Moderna shot tomorrow bit nervous. can't get shot month easily? supply issue within weeks glut vaccines. Dumb money really money. give smart money. WSB one big win year, otherwise, they're dumb money. unfortunately named vaccine, even though [it looks like works least decently dice Cansino* Oxford astrazeneca get service curbside online. even barred people want it. voting much different issue. reaching there, think know that.

I think vaccine ""passport"" restrictions implemented frequent outbreaks associated sites, specific state health officials deem safety issue. vary state state, even county county.  joint statement 14 countries: Australia, Canada, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Republic Korea, Slovenia, United Kingdom, United States America

[Joint Statement WHO-Convened COVID-19 Origins What‚Äôs endpoint outdoor parks strict mask wearing policies open again? *It's still obligation react findings possibly exclude young middle aged women vaccination AZ, matter much worse PR backlash AZ end being.*

And proper scientists preparing cost-benefit analysis taking multiple factors account. Anyone PhD able get done within 1 day so, least rudimentary analysis. come two numbers:

 1. Number QALYs (quality-adjusted life year) lost halt vaccine 
 2. Number QALYs lost halt it

Both confidence interval course. meaningful discussion best strategy be. Screaming ""I must react"" ""respect muh authoritah"" good enough. It‚Äôs obvious ‚Äúexercise induced asthma‚Äù probably mildest form asthma, haven‚Äôt used inhaler since prescribed one 8 years ago.
In second week March got call GP asking could go clinic vaccine due pre-existing condition. said don‚Äôt consider asthma since I‚Äôve never used inhaler diagnosed I‚Äôd bad cold spending week hiking Scotland. I‚Äôve tested since diagnosis ruled it‚Äôs still record somewhere.

She said fair enough offered someone else. 

A week later got 3 texts different forms vaccine rollout program asking register vaccine reasons. did, figured they‚Äôd offered wouldn‚Äôt offer again. 

I put NHS number offered bunch appointments. Still carer question didn‚Äôt stop registering.  tell someone intense unshakeable fear dentistry tried Valium, irrational fear strong enough, bit good.

I lot irrational fears growing up. Needles, dogs, dentists main ones. I've managed shake two third one. Well, mostly. I'm still uneasy around large dogs, paralyzingly so. someone literally petrified fear idea needle, get unfortunately say experience little short literally getting knocked helps. you‚Äôre vaccinated almost risk people state vaccinated what‚Äôs point? know we‚Äôre yet meet/see plenty people saying they‚Äôll continue years come. There‚Äôs also hygiene theater certain cases‚Äîplenty people wearing loose bandanas (which don‚Äôt really even work) mouth running walking park yards away others, people masking walk parked car apartment one block away, etc. Damon sucks croaking stops. It‚Äôs vulnerable people taking risks leads hospitalizations. 

That‚Äôs is. Getting moderately aware take seriously. Serious maskers still seriously masking. Never maskers still ignoring it. 

It‚Äôs big fat swath middle hmm go either way she‚Äôs trying reach. Ooooh hohoho. like that, you? Keeping healthy junk top vaccine list next pandemic. I'm üëà‚úåüëÄ. I'd rather dumb money money Yeah Canadian super jealous people getting fully vaccinated might get first shot till June god knows second one. poor people would completely fine taken vaccine üòî sure this.

Life expectancy lung transplant single digits I'd rather 5 years family dead right noe People aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated, unless medical condition stopping them, selfish slowing return normalcy. get vaccinated protect especially can‚Äôt get vaccinated. It‚Äôs seems current vaccines reasonably effective current variants people vaccinated limits Covid spreading producing new dangerous variants. Everybody‚Äôs tough frustrating 1+ years pandemic. People choosing get vaccinated helping Sure, I'm absolutely advocating (and sane person is) jabbing kids complete trials, know great deal longevity vaccine acquired immunity well vaccine's effect spread, would help inform risk reward analysis. Based back napkin math, assuming semi-accurate guess number infections (likely 4x number confirmed cases seems reasonable estimate), start approaching 70% threshold little half U.S. adults (really, 16) vaccine acquired immunity (and yes, accounts virus get vaccine). way things looking now, may get early May, assuming there's variant messes significantly vaccine efficacy then. Much past that, think we're going see pace vaccination slow hit wall remaining unvaccinated adults hurry, need additional outreach/facilitation get vaccines, plus anti-vaxxers. kids 12 get approved later year, really additional nails coffin need onerous restrictions, think. Man, really wish got read said haha   folk UK wear one get it,

I'm curious think case? thought anti-lockdown protests escalating government trying pass bill allow arrest protests, also met resistance ([and Bristol turned pretty top anti-mask/anti-lockdown protests happening past year. feel 'most folk UK wear one get it'?

Also, feel case UK? relatives Bolton Leicester, sounds like mask compliance fairly low, really enforced everyone. Novavax AZ running trials simultaneously US, AZ‚Äôs recently completed. Novavax in-term reports consistently shown higher efficacy AZ US, even variant rich environment. Combine notable evidence fails B1.135 worse safety profile get pretty clear picture vaccine losing Germany reported 15 times cases CVST given tenth doses AZ, resulting incidence 150 timer larger.

There‚Äôs lot things explain effect:

1 - environmental genetic

2 - different strata

3 - mis- reporting issues

Actually option #2 implies #3 also true.

It‚Äôs like figures aren‚Äôt longer , don‚Äôt fit reality somehow.  took first Pfizer vaccine last week question kinda freaking out. new variants virus spreading possible vaccine ineffective mutations? Thanks advance Speculation. relatively famous actor Mexico double transplant COVID. believe he's 40s weakness it‚Äôs gonna get you. Kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, bowels, brains, neurological, eyes,

If want go fine, vaccinated tired hanging friends worries! Lol yea countries (UK case) imposing bans export vaccines. EU invested even vaccine development... oh shut fucking australia.

The thing government ever temporarily give lip service working poor (mostly black) permanently trampling rights, stealing wealth, killing businesses. Nothing wrong taking couple fish oil capsules day possibly baby aspirin. thing blood clots.  number countries including Norway, Denmark, Austria, Italy, etc., also reported similar problems. trial trial compare vaccine. trials carried different times, different populations, different methodology. Even considered instance vaccine effective trials. Comparing results meaningless. non-trial use along side vaccines, data far point significant differences efficacy. Ah yes, Israel, famously homogeneous society \*checks notes\* 21% population Arab, 18% Muslim, rest made peoples Middle East, Eastern Europe, Western Europe Americas. actually really shitty take.

No. think I'll blame educators. remember get yellow fever vaccine went Kenya specifically. 2001 believe. Covid cause blood clots well, right? possible people simply got covid point got vaccine?

I understand there's unusual amount people showing blood clot symptoms, question they're comparing to. comparing rate normal year, rate pandemic? tested positive (reactive) antibodies two weeks first Pfizer shot.

AZ involved initial trials evidence whatsoever different effectiveness vaccines based ethnic background Sure didn‚Äôt Sorry. suggest start smoking order get vaccine earlier? people upvoting. What's wrong sub? PNW PNW There's conflict US EU production AFAIK, they're basically separate supply chains (or least late April). first suggested pertussis vaccine, bit nervous anyway. Twice third trimester. kids great offered much peace mind. making great choice. 90% actually published Israel's Health Ministry today. variants reported identified. google that. saying one knows vaccines provide protection?

No. take 30,000 random people give vaccine 30 get infected 30,000 random people get vaccine 300 get sick, that's pretty good evidence vaccine works.

What tell us, however, is, take given vaccinated person, ""how protected"" are: i.e., many antibodies have, specific odds infected, etc. Seems like experts saying still can‚Äôt whatever. Makes wonder super cautious know something (maybe SA variant actually makes vaccines worthless?). think point taking pfizer biontech shared production. don't. BioNTech production facilities. scared, what? flu? Y'all need therapy. September October makes worse July August know, time signing contracts matter comes agreements. agree 10m doses August end Q1 December still need fulfill order parties agreed on. Besides much time UK even want equate UK making deals early, *still* imported initial doses EU round applause early deals.

I'm confusing grants payments vaccines, I'm even sure get that. Giving grants vaccine production far better buying vaccine. Countries EU buy EU procurement scheme. funding given individual nations towards production Germany's towards Biontech, France's towards Sanofi, etc counted spending money buy vaccine still funding goes towards point ""receiving non-trivial amounts"" Helix already shown speculation disputed.

Speculation disputed? see.
[The UK government‚Äôs vaccines task force acknowledged four million doses vaccine developed Oxford university AstraZeneca would delivered [in 2020]. imported Netherlands Germany plans manufacture England beset spent vaccines almost exact time including Biontech, Sanofi AZ. come Sanofi coincidence focus AZ rather Pfizer despite Pfizer source UK imports. EU bulked cost.

It's *at least* 4 million, 1/5th overall imports. 

The EU also bulked cost largest order compared vaccine? Ok.

Exports emergency equipment pandemic clearly subject allowed exported. see US, UK, India decided private companies would love export seized government. EU this. EU put export block merely thing UK doing. ordered 2.6b doses, what's harm ensuring get exporting. owed 2.6b doses UK owed 100m doses AZ.

Can't wait hear ""oh contracts contracts contracts"". Go whinge everyone actually vaccine nationalism first, incessantly complaining region threatened level control exports. region halt Covax, region allowed exports crucial time went worlds vulnerable. can't bothered replying anymore.  Great. Get out. buy share. Thanks. Agree, fill &amp; finish shouldnt really count.

Clearly doesn‚Äôt know anything unions asking talking ass. +1.78 million according Cyrus Shahpar versus +1.71 million last Tuesday. Highest Tuesday record.

I hate Tuesdays. Neither Bayer Merck KGaA big names vaccine business, plenty EU-based pharma companies CureVac could partnered with. would made sure others claim priority. 

I'm surprised Germany let CureVac partner GSK booster shot UK government dumped Merck KGaA favor AstraZeneca interest national solution. take medical advice politician either! Precedent already exists. Probably happen widely covid vaccines reach general approval, much sooner people realize. could looking end summer Pfizer Moderna. really see businesses cracking more.

Not young women. low chance dying Covid, higher chance dying vaccine.

Vaccine efficacy related serious cases, none stop getting sick, show symptoms vaccine functions, efficacy percentage protects serious illness, asymptomatic calculated figure all. still transfer it, studies include variants going around country atm, old one. one tested lab vs new variants allowed USA J&amp;J.

Stop spreading anti-vax nonsense. cover up. 100 regulators approved fact UK exporting causing EU's vaccine problems, used easy scapegoat blame. 

Even UK exported every dose produced far used would still make less 10% EU already has. ""Daily Count"" total number vaccines administered day, slowly increase time data rolls CDC attribute day.

The important metric real world. AZ vaccine best that. given people vaccine diverse recipients. AZ carrying COVAX program moment.

Jesus fuck percentages work. guarantee 100 things day dangerous AZ shot quite literally confirmation bias works, yes. might depend whether serious disease recently, recently prescribed meds?

Not sure intention thats came off. Allow spell you.

In democracy, majority rule. Lone wolves like minority. Therefore wonder people believe community keep coming top, that‚Äôs why.

Sheeeeesh.

As ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt democracy‚Äù bit, womp womp. laws US say whatever frick want.

Noting pompous lecture libertarian.

And course case talking lone wolves whose behavior endangers pack. Maybe seems weird preference shoulder seasons.... vaccine. Risk calculation casualty pandemic. Problem can‚Äôt compare CA either two states cooked statistics.

Anyways.. missing point. get back lives *quicker* follow instructions. general American public bunch toddlers impulse control inability withstand hardships resist instant gratification.  Easter coming Im expecting four days bad news You‚Äôre thinking locally. Variants able evolve anywhere world. increased likelihood variant concern evolving small surge Texas US negligible compared overall likelihood variant developing anywhere planet vaccinations haven‚Äôt even begun.

But either way, variants appear neutralized *enough* vaccines major long term concern point. Especially unique aspect virus makes Covid effective us part vaccines attack - either evolves way vaccines still effective way it‚Äôs longer effective bodies. everyone needs build immune systems it. It‚Äôs insane

Which... literally vaccine does... Where‚Äôs source? make GME crowd happy Many people detectable cell production 10 days post vaccination. doubtful vast majority people vaccine impact immunity prior 10 days although always outliers. I'm really curious see go Strange, especially post-Wandavision. doctor extensive study? 

One peer reviewed specialist field?

Please link it. false, cases Texas increasing past week. Cases started increasing two weeks mask mandate won‚Äôt get satisfactory answer isn‚Äôt creative writing sub.

Wrecked Oof would fairly horrific. I'm glad investigated people know they're specific batch thing looked already. There's far easier ways kill people spread fear - highly doubt it. surprised lack guidance government Approve children ASAP then. Bad news, friend. learn anything today, say anywhere people disagree right wing cultists. said look post history half witted comments abundance here, see people regularly posting right wing conspiracy focused subs. That's great. said 60k shots day new normal anomaly? keep narrative we're track 4th major country finish Israel, UK, USA using Chinese Russian vaccines 2/3? half think? :) sub's denizens attacked shit others pointing cases, low, still significant concerning. hive almost always wrong side. Honestly, also travesty grocery workers low many states priority lists. need higher isolation possible, even case numbers go up. That's also really powerful ""could"" title.

Clear sign clickbait. Texas's cases started increasing two weeks mandate lifted, expected, expect UK much better, US, CDC director throwing tantrum saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre doomed‚Äù. Michigan Texas pretty different other. suspect looking Texas data counties five metro areas might shed light differences. live Texas trust one minute assertions numbers steadily going down. much incompetence, much political influence, much Greg Abbott absolute asshole. I‚Äôm ask: testing adulterants? There‚Äôs competing vaccine trying gain approval country proven excellent industrial espionage poison. It‚Äôs extremely odd see Germany Nordics Britain considering since antiquity Britain‚Äôs conquered extensively two exact bunch people. Agreed, let people $$$ directly Fed $$$ going government fightimg Covid 19.  Everyone compliant September 2020 we'll see.  Children less unaffected Covid, getting vaccine somewhat soon.  Take vaccines people. clearly work. Damn, makes realize important get 16 approval. really really isn‚Äôt. don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted. What‚Äôs alternative? 3ft new guidance CDC based studies ran. 

The fact Teachers Union convinced CDC guidelines irrelevant far public health goes. great, every state. Furthermore, states made teachers eligible, wait fully vaccinated bring kids back. one friends school 60 covid cases 200 isolating (on Cape cod. Literally driving covid numbers area). Since many us getting shots, wondering happens someone gets vaccine exposed virus days after. example, say person gets vaccine 5 days later exposed virus. Assume virus incubates 5 days person starts showing symptoms 10 days received vaccine. vaccine studies say antibody production shows first dose vaccines 12-14 days inoculation. person may suffer symptoms 2-4 days, would antibody production vaccine start take effect mitigate symptoms/reduce chances severe disease pathway? vaccine studies see focus incidence rate, severity I'm trying get whether vaccine provides benefit manage get stuck time exposed (even start produce antibodies), antibodies may start getting produced (at rapid rate would without vaccine) disease progresses ""save day"" speak. may oversimplification what's going on, would interesting know. get vaccine surplus, everyone eligible, governments give 42 days. That's 28 days 1st dose second plus 2 weeks.

At point, chosen vaccinated. want be, that's fine. 100% choice, that's point think restrictions end.

We can't punish people, businesses, children, whove done right thing year, protect people refuse vaccinate. shortage vaccine parts California (notably Bay Area) *because* many people getting vaccinated. appointments easy get they're vaccinating fast can, also problem parts state. Overall, state really well. Supply vaccination rate keep increasing. Even current rates, California hit 50% total population (including children) least one dose early May. fad. It‚Äôs logistically impossible implement world wide sustainable system ‚Äúvaccine passport‚Äù. Verifying information across international boundaries systems infrastructure would impossible. Even many ‚Äúadvanced countries‚Äù get shot card saying received vaccine. Like old yellow books fill yourself. think can‚Äôt get fake one ‚Ç¨10 lead privileged life don‚Äôt get much.  Hmmm, yeah think would normal case - think there's lot attention around though there's clear reporting system post-vaccine ailments (at least UK). Also think you'e unlucky enough get hit - definitely going end hospital. theory I'd agree , question. let's remember minority (and absurd political reasons) responsible idiotic trend. majority people Arizona decent people, taking precautions . Dutchy here, confirm. Gov Cuomo entered chat. use energy competence describe them. guys really low expectations autonomy eat restaurant covid positive.  Dude posting rage anti-lockdown subs.

And even removed it. cringe. think ineffective? nobody really followed rules, pretty much summation failed country.

Places actually lock keep things closed less places bare minimum. Comparing California Texas Florida ended almost exactly people couldn‚Äôt wait July 4 celebrate?

Stop thinking terms celebration. I'm concerned people getting back lives actually going work paying bills. one people, no... can't wait July 4th. They've waiting year is. Bye now. Whatever wave ends looking like, it'll better would've without vaccination. Right best possible thing continue vaccinating many people possible curve eventually bends bends good. Based think safe make assumption. said, even don't, getting everyone least 1 shot week still tremendously beneficial. Compare Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing disease called acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) left untreated.

Or Clostridium botulinum causing disease called tetanus.


No idea people dense one replied Depending friends live, actually pretty likely good percentage qualify. states opening eligibility - Ohio, 16+ eligible yesterday vaccination sites instructed governor start scheduling 16+ last week extra appointments. 

I think idea opening eligibility controversial now. us believe science understand vaccine way it, understand every shot arm one step closer normalcy us. India vaccine vaccine developed traditional method making safer AZ vaccine (blood clotting) post almost 30 days CNN Osterholm said *in next two three weeks* we'll see huge surge cases UK variant hits 50%. congruous statements end January said ""following 6-12 weeks darkest entire pandemic.‚Äù two weeks we'll find Osterholm right. I'm almost certain wrong, really, really hope so. *is* right (and people thread) lot soul searching do. We'll find soon.

Can get apology Osterholm, please? AIDS virus, provide immunity infection. Dengue virus, person actually *more* vulnerable one infection, less. look like too. 15.8% vaccinated, add people already gotten virus looking 25-26% population immunity. Add estimate 30% population asymptomatic looking 55% United States population immunity virus. vaccinations every day number gets higher. area 3600 vaccines county alone distributed, less 100 cases that‚Äôs yesterday‚Äôs numbers. 36:1 vaccine infection rate isn‚Äôt bad. difference: STD airborne infectious disease, one cares that. People care diseases spread air people since, unfortunately, must breathe one another‚Äôs exhalation. 

It‚Äôs personal. don‚Äôt give single shit personal life‚ÄîI want see movie vaccinated people like normal person, worry random gross people.

Glad picking guys :) airline ticket prices new variants? states cases rising? Glad could help get point.

-Pennsylvania  We're taking action source now. Thank bringing attention! Well study stats best college country...can rigorously compared, no. point there‚Äôs many studies efficacy Pfizer, conducted different countries different scenarios, 90+ range, it‚Äôs really hard infer efficacy relative j j. Scientifically rigorous, no, common sense enough make comparison Pfizer 10+ studies 90+ efficacy symptomatic covid Johnson Johnson doesn‚Äôt single study 80. Imo, reason government/media doesn‚Äôt tell ppl want ppl get shot get, j j better nothing course. Makes sense current climate. long term don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs helpful productive say none vaccines compared *died*   Longer trials help, need bigger sample sizes. there's always limit - current numbers Germany indicate roughly 1:60000 chance amongst women &lt;60 years old. even run trial quarter million people - let's say 25% men aged 18-50, 25% men 60, 25% women aged 18-50, 25% women 60 - encounter one case average, pretty good chance completely missing it. There's much trials, that's we're continuously monitoring possible side effects. Ah right - that's interesting. Thanks sharing that! Ah man feel bad poor people! got AZ realise amazing thing - shame may triggered something like people (may case probably going triggered point something - I'm making assumptions here).  least live (Louisiana) recorded anywhere. even look LA DHHS supplied Attestation Form supposed keep copy of. even lay eyes it. Can't imagine don't. Thing way make international law binding parties consent agreement, can't force them. Maybe sanction that's correlation could think UK, followed Poland, far lowest risk high methyl-hg levels Europe (this comes predominantly high fish consumption) whereas Iceland, Denmark, Norway etc highest. Germany middle ground levels notably higher Poland UK 

Excess methyl-hg consumption strongly linked generation autoantibodies development autoimmune condition like SLE, predispose thrombocyteopenia also give false positive PF4 tests show HIT, also affects predominantly women Israel showing us even 50% population vaccinated drop cases drastically low enough get normal life back. UK hundreds cases? now.... states followed already, Germany sure follow suit within day. probably EU week over.

I agree decision btw, sure decision domino going EU. wife talking last night made sad hell. can't imagine another moment like portal scene lifetime. missed full stop there, bud.  Pennsylvania Utah (IIRC) dropped opposition yet?

Because reason taken long every two years Feds go, ""We're serious time, deadline, citizens blocked air travel implement Real ID"", states go ""We'll sue try, frankly think got brass ones"", Feds go ""... we're granting extension we're *really serious* time..."" ""Vast majority"" , ""in process"" , ""so far""

I mean fire process put out, completely safe open business. per capita basis, UK ordered AZ EU. commercial success AZ accompanied global media campaign ""Oxford vaccine frontrunner"" Anglophone media. time nobody knew vaccine would successful, obvious many governments worldwide impressed ""Oxford"" reputation, British media cease praise proof global gold standard. in: AZ shots anyone 60 forbidden today Germany.  people getting people seeing going fine issue 5G emitting sucks. can‚Äôt wait! really miss tailgating media never admit it‚Äôs gone. they‚Äôre gonna try keep extending much can. B.1.351 present Israel, rates among vaccinated unvaccinated people. mean, maybe they're 0 among everyone since cases left. that's sort point: B.1.351 there, going away.

- Age/health population
- Mitigation measures place (masks/social distancing/business restrictions
- Population Density
- Climate (maybe)

Florida fifth oldest per capital deaths US average decent one places least COVID restrictions (Top 5 look per capita deaths, logic reason certain states higher lower others.

Hawaii Vermont lowest per capita deaths - easy understand why. Vermont sparsely populated strictest restrictions. Hawaii strict quarantine measures place.

New York, New Jersey Massachusetts highest death rates. also makes sense given hard got hit first two months pandemic testing missing virus spread like wildfire winter populated areas.

We know Florida state skews older given popularity retirees. explanation older state almost restrictions better average, better places like Louisiana Mississippi. Last August, Florida peak, DeSantis specifically slowed testing. would expect twist cause death definitions lower COVID totals? Yes. justification 55+ risk serious complications COVID-19 much greater risk complications Astra vaccine age group. younger people worth risk given generally low probability serious complications contract COVID-19. said I'm sure matters heard mass roll-out vaccines age groups 55 yet outside healthcare workers indigenous communities. Even 80+ grandparents gotten yet although registered that's something. It‚Äôs issue unless person wasn‚Äôt offered vaccine. given opportunity skipped it‚Äôs individual. much flip flopping going on.

But continue part keep wearing mask social distancing much possible. Better get phone then. Google's entire business model based tracking activities monetizing information. Every tech company game already. study post state Pfizer efficacious SA variant. says vaccine-resistent strains country. know first gen vaccines perform worse SA variant. know exact efficacy. study prove Pfizer's vaccine efficacious variants. might be, study show that. understand two outcomes life death, correct? understand long term effects covid unknown vaccine &amp; covid shown effect areas body, lungs. OK. let's least clear mean.

That mean ""80% protected"" body's defenses ""80% ready"" anything like that.

All means take two groups people - 1 group vaccinated one dose one group unvaccinated, 14 days, 80% fewer people vaccinated group infected compared unvaccinated group. lots variables account number, including amount community spread present location study.

Nobody knows quickly slowly immune system takes create necessary antibodies, cells, B cells needed fight infection. studies can't tell that.

Additionally, there's pretty big variation studies looking post 1st dose numbers disappears post 2nd dose numbers.

For example: [one Pfizer vaccine Israel found 46% effectiveness preventing infection 14 days Dose 1 compared 92% effectiveness 7 days post Dose 2.

[Another Israeli Pfizer found 29% effectiveness preventing asymptomatic infection 14 days Dose 1 vs. 90% effectiveness post Dose 2.

Again, uncertainty disappears Dose 2. think fear new tech. think gets yearly flu shots (which should), knows critical that.  could pass elderly people tho. Another test. PCR preferred getting another test Don‚Äôt know anyone UK didn‚Äôt get BCG would shitty Mitsubishi? though Onion Babylon Bee similar satirical headline first. Nope, it‚Äôs actually meant taken seriously. 

‚ÄúScared shitless‚Äù ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù ‚ÄúCategory 5 hurricane‚Äù absurd hyperbole completely useless, fact counterproductive whatever they‚Äôre trying (well, it‚Äôll get Vanity Fair clicks, suppose part ‚Äúworks‚Äù). 

We‚Äôve year-plus this. line ‚Äúdeadly enough scared shitless‚Äù varies depending person, people it‚Äôs *well* whatever Covid-19 last year. want people concerned, keep wearing masks, fine. isn‚Äôt Captain Trips air-rabies whatever else post-apocalyptic fiction writers dream up. 

Making statements ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù going accomplish little getting people roll eyes, tune messages even already are. Parents gave free purifier school's provincial health director asked schools remove them. think conducted unprofessional sure concerns weren‚Äôt necessarily wrong.

Her message got lost due worded it.  Friday/Saturday week se 3 mil average 4 mil days possibly! take care citizens first without helping unfortunate areas.

You take tax dollars tell people can't get vaccinated someone across world needs more. care think morally right get happy citizenry governing way. support masks social distancing used seems many people want become indefinite thing people *always* safe. 

Did need public health laws forcing us wash hands before? Well, maybe have, point certain point, able make choices whether mask certain situations like East Asia/SEA. job, then, no.

Edit: realized stated implied joke comment replied to, awkward way lol. FML Thank laugh, really needed it. Correct. [He also ""reaching herd immunity"" designation arbitrary probably matter much practice. However, recent surveys indicating decreases vaccine hesitancy might change base case, here. know it‚Äôs difficult mature adult, could least give old college try. shit scared never scared shitless. That's pretty scared, interpret statement different ways guess

""Following single dose either vaccine, participants‚Äô risk infection SARS-CoV-2 reduced 80 percent two weeks vaccination.""

But case meant risk reduction 80 percent enough you, anyone J&amp;J ever leave home again? gives fodder anti-maskers say ""SEEE??? EVEN DIRECTOR CDC SAYS VACCINES WORK!!!"" No, it‚Äôs happening rate way entirely consistent vaccine trials showed. surprised this? vaccine 100% effective, ~95% efficacy rates Pfizer Moderna vaccines widely publicized. Think positive, small group millions issue.  illnesses hospitalizations?

The side effects similar illness important remember actually sick! Scott Atlas approach - shield high risk, everybody else want. One problem: can't shield high risk everybody else. sure Well I've seen, typical blood clots - blood issues result low platelet counts caused overreaction antibodies towards platelets blood (which also causes clotting). makes sense younger people risk, tend higher platelet counts general. Women also tend platelets men, backs results. 

A source: [Frontiers | Platelet Function Aging | Cardiovascular Medicine cool. think leaves 12 states pre-May 1st date full adult eligibility. Still droplets mesures.

It asymptomatic spread. cough sneeze required. That's known year now. remember reading paper long ago came conclusion catching covid 30ft 15 minutes (indoors). pre-registered county 18th, got text today allowed set appointment, spot tomorrow morning.

I think vaccines rolled much bigger way past weeks. Get shot! latter. want many people get get herd immunity things go back pre-2020. Thank much response. brother gotten AstraZeneca one mild headache felt little tired symptoms lasted day. dad got Pfizer one exact symptoms. Slept half following day üòÇüòÇ mild headache. western bias tempted believe there's bit transparency information side effects risks Pfizer AstraZeneca. 

Well think that's fair thing say. think Sputnik Sinopharm placed basket regard, though, Gamaleya published peer-reviewed paper phase 3 clinical trial Chinese really bumming they're presenting data. referring Sputnik V mini-trial India? one show efficacy one conducted Russia - 92? so, that's kinda cool. 

My two favorites Pfizer Sputnik V. Pfizer like literal first kind like tech LOT. uses nanotechnology ü•µ lipid nanoparticles vaccine basically printed sense live cells tissues used order produce it. Printing vaccines sounds super cool. 

I like Sputnik V viral vectors used gene therapies (that's Sputnik V's platform literally started Gamaleya Institute), cool, vaccine literally introduce new gene quickly degraded, pretend short time one gene üòÇüòÇ.

Having said that, kinda wanna least consider Sinopharm well. political reasons. seem soft spot China, I'm finding myself. Also, employing super old tech kinda attracts lol. trivial reasons, saying safer anything, seems kinda retro hot LOL. Efficacy 79% cool (although know sure). Ahhh they'd published freaking paper phase 3 clinical trial, I'd consider much seriously. Sure. clarifying context study. Detectable antibodies waning around 8-10 weeks. able get vaccine since work food service industry, depresses 20 coworkers, 2 wanted get it. tell people I'm getting vaccine responses negative makes sad many Americans view vaccine Sorry, dumb tad? mean pick something doesn‚Äôt actually apply person cvs website? guess don‚Äôt ask okay then. person *is* eligible according state all.

Thank you. including expected vaccines here, ones schedule for. know get 10 million JJ q2 q3 example, first shipments April. 20 million AZ ordered starts q2 (separate we've able procure far), Novavax large shot arm. less info Novavax, know ordered 52 million already, [were one first signed deal one first receives - approval soon. forbids companies export. EU same. Yep let's remember next time someone says birthday party watching TV bar ""super spreader event"". I'm 23 first AZ shot weeks back I'm still planning getting second available. That's looking efficacy numbers. ""80% protected"" Dose 1. That's numbers mean. See post above. skipping line making harder need vaccine get it.

I'm mad, feel bad people. I've helped several people time ability find appointment, hard. can't help everyone.

The least wait turn. can't that, lie get shot, asshole. I‚Äôd curious know antibodies one builds vaccine effective ones people developed due COVID. I'm flattered, thank you! I've actually thought going PR, right I'm concerned citizen want see COVID surges either.  much likely answer, natural clotting undiagnosed previously director CDC gave speech teared up, went script warned ""impending doom"", talked ""nausea"", etc.

Frankly sound like professional. drama hyperbole seem based facts. think CDC others stuck mode think scare public remaining locked getting vaccinated. However actually people listen facts reasoning want hear experts leaders actually plan rather unending doom gloom.  Username definitely check lol Even vaccinated? we've got find way start chipping away it

sounds like job economic ""carrots &amp; sticks""

carrots: workplaces offering ""bribes"" (cash, gift cards etc) employees prove got vaxxed. there's also stuff like ""a free Krispy Kreme every day thru New Years Eve"" &amp; forth

sticks: requiring vaccine passports major travel. vaxs cleared children's clinical trials, requiring enroll students school next fall. oh BTW, know Big Pharma already itching raise price-per-dose vaccines ... wanta smart &amp; get free, dumb get next year $100? 

Not mention, people remain unvaxxed, likely we'll need every-other-year booster shots COVID finally gets crushed. make IQ 400 play, y'all  O:-)  I'd said ""Happy Christmas, within month confederate flag getting paraded Capitol"" would thought? :) others won‚Äôt get vaccine ‚Äòthey allergies‚Äô.. really? You‚Äôd rather risk ending ICU minor problems may even occur? sure Germany stays true? play game country. That's makes weird. Makes speculate *just* directly vaccine, factor play here. frightening number vaccinated.  strange Michigan stringent COVID policies nation.  

You would expect Michigan lot better. Private businesses want

...up something like, right? assume Fox source news? UK blocked vaccine exports. Pls stop spreading lies.  Mazda actually. US distributed 1.5M doses day Biden took office. point distribution manufacturing scaling 2 vaccines approved. 100M dose ""goal"" either mistake shooting 100M people total, massive sandbag job. also ordered vaccines months ago.

&amp;#x200B;

We also purchase agreements vaccine supply last year. Pretty much vaccines procured Biden probably get shipped oversees 3 months everyone US gotten jab(s). He'll popular abroad. idea talking about. industries perfect example regulation capture. perfect scam, scam protected law. stick nose ultrasonic cleaner? think that's doable - 3.33mm/day - I'm sure worst case. We've hit hesitancy numbers states (Mississippi, Idaho). hesitancy seems increase younger age groups high percentage 65+. (Wisdom age, folly youth).

The counterbalances broader eligibility, greater supply lot second shot people pretty much guaranteed show up. surprised anything 85-115 April. personal bet would 100 pretty close money. Anything range unthinkable long ago. 

We're race, every arm counts. hope I'm pessimistic blow 120+ buying additional vaccines prior administration passed on?

Or fed stealing PPE states, giving son law letting sell back states profit?

That'd two differences top head.

Beyond that, still yet provide anything asked you. policy giving second shots means ramping vaccine production guarantee ramp first doses particular day. give enough first doses one day, give many second doses 3-4 weeks later. production scaled amount yo-yo effect fewer first doses available.

A simple example made always waited exactly one month. Say January give 5 (million) first first 5 second doses, 10 total. February double doses 20, give 5 second doses, get 15 first doses February doses first doses. March jump 25 doses - give 15 second doses, get 10 first doses - less February. Violating contracts international partners going improve trust ""global trading nation"" UK aims be. applies commercial contracts treaties like Withdrawal Agreement. Yeah, shit. want kill kids something? 50-50 split AZ Pfizer. Compared % covid deaths would say worth it.

The UK almost 1500/day fatalities peak.

To put comparison, secondary school 7 years it, 5 classes year 30 class.

I'm support vaccination wish people would accepting discussion risks specific groups.


A lot people seem anti research comes issue, find bizarre. obviously check side effects react alarms raised, even potential side effect seems rare. Where's harm better understanding risks are? exactly same, it? one many conditions indicator taking vaccine, causing condition. People go events different reasons. right, music 2nd time spend people. genuinely enjoy random one-off encounters strangers. everyone come across big part life. wont paying go concert masks enforced, (my opinion) wont hold anyone back going enjoying like ""it's outlandish"", quote famous lawyer far vaccine hesitant vs vaccine refusers me. Every day person get vaccine hesitant refusing another day people die (which gonna happen anyway, time might mother brother) sneaky selling private comoanys shit really depends J&amp;J. Could sooner. Hopefully later. complaint due nonverbal cues, there's way around it. non issue. question refuse wear them, why? Non-verbal communication valid reason since there's workarounds. amazing actually need expert come tell us this.

It's like getting news report saying water wet. hospitalization rate rise, thats important indicator. New variant higher mortality rate. Thanks information this! Hopefully top half, that's lungs located. still calling Florida? thought Ron DeBolsonaro trying change Novo Brasil. people spent past year thanking Gretchen Witler ‚Äúkeeping us safe‚Äù.....you wrong. wrong. Unequal distribution goes beyond availability also poses challenge eligible individuals live far away vaccination sites, live around vaccination sites limited hours don‚Äôt car rely public transit (which many cases cut back pandemic), etc. paying vaccine, talking terms EU searching lowest bidder 2 widely available vaccines pricey (moderna Pfizer). EU went crazy AZ low cost due profit. UK too, also paid lot secure expensive vaccines time. hedged bets, EU not. got first dose Pfizer vaccine yesterday!

Woke slightly sore arm I'm good go, I've heard second shot side effects common. parents got second dose last Friday Dad (70's) slightly sore arm Mom (60's) feeling slightly fatigued hour next day, they're good go!

This morning felt different, felt happy, really see light end tunnel. course stole Europe vaccines. Piece shit brits. first dose primes immune system second dose really kicks overdrive. Amongst friends family never COVID took moderna none reactions first dose except 1 pretty rough days second dose. Canada pretty french. 

Imagine stupid simultaneously thinking genius. facebook, truly mystified. India's health records good enough identify small significant amount deaths causes vaccine. probably missing 80% covid deaths is. know illnesses exist right? definitely people anti-vaxxers hesitant due vaccines' expedited development. I've seen, people group eventually come around get vaccinated, typically seeing lot family friends get shots. Gee. wonder shot 2020. Must lockdowns killing people people getting misdiagnosed flu. /s moderna interesting stuff, still fact preprint, still accounts less 0.1% taking true (I'll wait till peer reviewed coming conclusions it).

Not even peer reviewed papers taken fact. many papers respected journals closer examination light new evidence proven total bollocks. Science done converging evidence single studies. 

At moment, pre-print best have. concordant Norwegian scientists also found. Things moving fast treatments proposed save lives, scary part symptoms quite unspecific confused typical side effects vaccine. 

Regarding risk benefit ratio. complicated also evolving. population affected blood disorder younger women tended less affected severe covid.  example someone posted Norway 11 women 50 died covid, already 4 died condition, making risk quite comparable. countries might different. Holy shit, nearby hospital quietly opened vaccines everyone still ton open appointments. I'm signing whole family lol  There‚Äôs enough type thinking anyway. Masks social distancing hard sell. I‚Äôd swear neighbors believe caught strangers. (They large gatherings nearly every weekend.) Florida numbers probably worse areas vacationers went FL, returned home states, spread virus there. That's straight wrong. areas Michigan seeing major exponential growth aside UP. much along vaccination progress thanks smaller population, care home staff know got Oxford jab, wait data coming conclusion couldn‚Äôt even feel mine. developed conspiracy needle didn‚Äôt even go arm hurt little bit next day. Might worth checking Jim Halpert one. Yeah, I'm wondering uk  Look appointments late night (after midnight). High quality information/ spam. don‚Äôt particularly care one way another Germany agree more, say U.S. killing vaccines administered understatement, entire family vaccinated (I got Pfizer vaccine yesterday!), friends well. assume we're going position export doses soon enough. low energy thought. don‚Äôt need insurance either. fees all. Edit: want appointments, make one midnight early morning. But, mean, stuff like Astrazeneca really covered capitalism anymore. legit hid 30 mio doses somewhere Italy whilst example Germany simply get doses ordered. Capitalism explains germany get many first place, happened pretty close downright criminal Anything built around hard cutoffs based height/weight (like BMI) sort useless. idea depending day week someone could overweight Thursday gain 1 pound water weight obese Friday dumb. half inch height could separate someone ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ‚Äúunderweight‚Äù. 

BMI really useful understanding obese underweight. 

There number better measures take account body type, activity level, body fat makeup, etc they‚Äôre easy calculate BMI. extremely positive news hope USA getting sooner rather later.

So glad numbers UK moving positive direction!  think may get infra structure plan tomorrow. crazy watch happen steadily.

Haters say plan incoming since last administration. look date I'm going EDC Orlando November I'll probably wearing mask rave culture, care. I'm fully vaccinated ready party! still really agree full quote. vaccines vaccinating millions people every day, millions people high risk. situation comparable prior surges. Based phrasing cases, sounds like maybe first dose Damn it.

Edit add: Easter less week away. rate exponential growth change personal behavior, community driven NPIs put place, immunity increases. absence new restrictions change personal behavior, exponential growth continue (albeit slowdown vaccinates rates increase) reach herd immunity. Lifting restrictions along vaccination process led positive exponential growth rate, magically abate.

On top this, thanks contagious variants, requirements relates herd immunity seeing significant reduction transmissibility increased vs. expected 6 months ago. arrested woman trying track actual numbers...of course they're undercounting, lol. rushed fear mongering term. groundwork vaccines laid years, decades. equivalent amount Israeli's getting infected per day 13,000 people day. since March 2020.

That would massive change. Pfizer Moderna, 90% protection symptomatic case COVID. 100% protection hospitalization. fairly reckless statement coming someone level importance. CDC needs communicate well order maintain credibility hysterical proclamations like don‚Äôt help. I've repeating anyone listen. Retail pharmacists asking questions! comment shit I'm aware. appears selected right strategy, CA. Hi, we've already discussed this; personal claim yours, completely unsubstantiated far given available statements provided company.

Then, knows, maybe indeed apply June. July. far they've indicated nothing sorts. BCG given school kids 2005 far know giving covid vaccines 16's yet. don‚Äôt know grade previous poster specifying, suggesting polled students first find much follow precautions test ones keep numbers down? risk looking stupid, ask. freaking this? one shocked  mean that's capitalism right ? Capitalism &amp; neoliberalism, ideologies countries swear by, blame.

I think made obvious countries started intercepting mask orders.

And Macron partially cause whole EU issue prioritizing Sanofi something like ? Minister Foreign Affairs warned idea European countries ordering Russian &amp; Chinese vaccines, definition selfishness me. clearly delineated difference trusting administration trusting science. 

It cornerstone current president‚Äôs platform. Stay home sick anymore? Ha make enough educated guesses eventually I‚Äôll right something! Cheers! Right availability vaccines much limiting factor vaccination campaign UK. Also think fair assumption intent either vaccinate adult population stockpile + guaranteed deliveries cover adult population unlikely event deliveries vaccines exceeding ability get arms. 

I think intent delay doses beyond delays involved making sure shipment meaningful size. fair, probably true many states ‚Äî isn‚Äôt conspiracy cast aspersions one state another. ""Total deaths significantly higher historical trends Florida even accounting COVID-19‚Äìrelated deaths,"" researchers wrote. ""The impact COVID-19 mortality significantly greater official COVID-19 data suggest."" politicized everything virus related again? Amen   Yep, we'd beat flu everyone stayed home sick wore masks absolutely go (pick kids school, get medicine, etc.).

Wearing make time make sense. flu really spread much feel sick. know means well cannot stand guy. fearmonger. That's I'm thinking. demand drops, make simple getting vaccinated trip grocery store, we'll able get shots lot apathetic crowd. FDA approval

Most people trust govt begin with. definitely swayed that. examples, though, work easily manipulated. Also, stupid people love free shit, even beliefs. Stupid people totally get vaccine comes donut day year, even think vaccine kill them.

Thankfully lot assholes certainly caught covid pretty much vaccinated whether want guy leads somehow No, that‚Äôs argument **you** want make.

That‚Äôs relevant argument, diseases endanger people. 

That‚Äôs STD analogy wrong. Unfortunately, still symptom free cough nasal. would disagree extremely.. things seem turned dime January.  100% agree. Twitter absolutely crawling antivaxx nonsense. easy way report it. Thats interesting good hear. expert matter (not means) merely asking not. know manufacturing costs decrease designs get streamlined fits process (for anything suddenly high demand like covid vaccines instance, production ramps consisted production). 

You sound like know ultrasounds way me, really like concept non-intrusive treatments admit. Especially something done early detected stop virus causes cytokine storm. Right, thats makes sense well. 100% completely naive virus population now. Even outside immunity infections stuff, apart questions complete escape likely offers least protection short term, vaccinating like crazy. Michigan relatively spared major late winter/fall wave plus low vaccine uptake amongst vulnerable populations surprising seeing increase. However, places seen major wave already plus vaccine thats administered millions daily make sense would major wave like fall one. Maybe wave look like summer one 2020. Less overall cases regional. skipping delaying second doses boosting first stats. CDC FDA cautious respected organizations change second dose dates regimen completed FDA trials. mention important second dose vulnerable populations we‚Äôve vaxing.  mean, fair, US UK pretty selfish comes vaccine. celebrate milestones, whilst countries even get doses ordered...  good bad?  one major difference though: vaccines full, emergency, approval. come time (possibly months), actually need safety data. Thanks regardless man! EU got delivery confirmation J&amp;J week; second last week April start weekly deliveries. perhaps see news soon.  walk around flashing little card like good boy I'll go back behaving like normal human vaccine available Got Moderna shot lined next Tuesday. Stoked. amazing far we've come inoculating people dead/weakened virus (or worse, variolation). Louis Pasteur would proud. I'm optimistic we'll get this, I""m also realistic look trending. current trend worrisome many epidemiologists raising concern it. epidemiologist? not, perhaps defer expertise matter. full kool aid optimism never healthy. little topic, BMI dumb chart determining. 5 ft 9 175 lbs, athletic build, I‚Äôm considered ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù lol. That's difference words actions. basically agree you! (And expect we'll see slowroll articles like one anyhow.) everyone know got card want like Tuesdays, big day deliveries, 8.8 million newly delivered vs 7.6 million last Tuesday! Brings 7-day average 3.6 million delivered per day. idea vaccines like mRNA ones becoming completely ineffective 6-12 months sounds ridiculous. people blindly trust statements like tend never involved research seen kind politics go blind statements occur.

&amp;#x200B;

or they've studying influenza decades assume COVID follow course.. **decades science** PRECISELY politics around flu.

&amp;#x200B;

it's like there's precedent rapidly mutating respiratory virus.

&amp;#x200B;

every year - **new** flu vaccine

because try **GUESS** likely variants show up.

there THOUSANDS variants.

if get anything list, could get flu.

this flu vaccine NEVER 40-60% effective.

bad guess = bad year.

&amp;#x200B;

since masking basically stopped flu winter...

they data make good guess.

now they're worried.

&amp;#x200B;

**Why next flu season may safety measures helped nearly [eradicate year's flu hospitalization rate 2020-21 0.7 per 100,000 people, lowest rate since CDC began collecting data 2005.

Without COVID-19 precautions, **there could new flu strains circulating scientists anticipate**, said Cody Meissner, MD, infectious disease specialist pediatrician Boston-based Tufts Children's Hospital panelist FDA's independent vaccine advisory committee.¬†¬†

**""We may combination low public health measures population level low effectiveness vaccine,""** said Lawrence Gostin, global health law professor Washington, D.C.-based Georgetown University. **""And might raging flu season next year.""**

&amp;#x200B;

people focused 3-4 COVID VOC's (variants concern)

but viruses mutate make copies spread thrive. SARS-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, proving different. **There currently 4,000 variants COVID-19**, already killed 2.7 million people worldwide pandemic. Seriously...especially people shout like 99% covid survival rate I'll take chances!

&amp;#x200B;

Uh, gave bag skittles said one kill you, would like one? sure decline skittles offer.

(I know...covid &lt;1% fatality rate) Pfizer prioritizing U.S. sending extra doses toher countries overseas? thought vaccine helped tye symptoms? Well yeah, people clinical trials regular people. locked lab duration trial anything. know I‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs church spread.

Tough news given concern rising numbers really agree types public statements. seem numb people cautious. cannot keep telling people ""Be scared shitless"" months months end. months, people stop caring. would someone get vaccine tell nothing change even get vaccine.

However, every tiger Springfield rounded taken away, Homer free leave rock behind. tigers become prevalent later on, Homer feel needs rock case tigers, even lions, attack, keep him. there's imminent threat tigers, though, rock rock pocket.

In short - masks tools, effective ones, individuals ability use time. Blanket mandates tools great they're necessary. they're unnecessary, allow folks want folks want need them? second dose Moderna next week.

One considers worst-case scenario toxic optimism (which harmful thus far, always wrong, gets people let guards prematurely). dunno middle ground lies. choose live reality tho, acknowledge problems occurring elsewhere internationally come US eventually every time pandemic, Yep went preconceived notion wanted prove. That's opposite research done. original Yahoo:

 [Florida COVID numbers face new scrutiny nowhere restaurants 50% capacity. i‚Äôve noticed capacity limits gyms. gym going didn‚Äôt enforce proper mask wearing well. i‚Äôm going gym get vaccine least. submission linking github.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* stuff we're importing, would also hope give priority people.

Where going import vaccines nations inoculate people first? Hope-Simpson seasonality. It‚Äôll drop April may see small southern wave late June. here. deeply concerned human rights abridgments past twelve months (and counting) concrete end date places, set scary precedent means exist human modern world.

And also think vaccines incredible tools improving health people risk severe impacts COVID. 

I feel lost sometimes hopeless looking discourse around gone. Same. Fourth day second shot Moderna I‚Äôm feeling like again. Went walk morning like usually without mask first time year. alone course so. great feeling tbh. Try say anyone states. You‚Äôll get slapped ‚Äúpeople die time. shut antivaxxer take COVID-19 vaccine‚Äù

Absolutely disgusting. I‚Äôm size 4 (women‚Äôs clothing) I‚Äôm also considered overnight. BMI makes sense. ELIA5: vaccine protect people antibodies fall off? Or, going get boosters every 3 months rest lives? Really 
I really bad side effects vaccine. literally bed ridden 1 day. Fatigued, aching muscles, bit temperature. worried.  happy kids don‚Äôt wear school anymore sense normalcy but...*dude*. 2 year old 6 year old we‚Äôve colds flu whatever *year*. It‚Äôs **amazing**. Normally we‚Äôre sick like September June (I also teach young kids non-cold life usually hopeless). Andrew Yang proposed least interview restaurants NYC. think hard debate vaccine passports scope undefined. means, add COVID list vaccines show doctor's report register school add Carte Jaune that's one thing. means, show government approved QR code multiple times per day that's different thing. plenty morbidity. kid Kawasaki 3, similar mis-c, complication covid kids, ten years later still tachycardia exercise intolerance.  People losing minds idea big brother requiring vaccine passports honestly, that‚Äôs thing that‚Äôs going force peoples‚Äô hands. 

Even it‚Äôs next 12 months, need require proof vaccination (or proof medical exemption) things like travel, concerts, festivals, live sports (when applicable) school attendance. 

I friend whose parents literally agreed vaccinated told wouldn‚Äôt allowed travel back Poland see family didn‚Äôt. 

There people never take carrot need get stick. ...efficacy taking vaccines til 3 trials done. Pfizer JnJ extreme criminal history. harm waiting info. know RaTG13 hands gain-of-function researchers since 2013 manipulated lab 2016 (see discussion 4991 statement incorrect. genomic sequence data, cultured isolate could used genetic experiments. article says RaTG13 never grown lab. Key phrase: ""never cultured bat virus"".

From article: much speculation centered RaTG13, bat virus closely resembles SARS-CoV-2, differences sequences two viruses suggest diverged common ancestor somewhere 20 70 years ago. Shi notes lab never cultured bat virus, making accident far less suspicions focused naming inconsistency. 2016, Shi described partial sequence bat coronavirus dubbed 4991. small part genome exactly matches RaTG13, leading speculate Shi never revealed full sequence 4991 actually SARS-CoV-2. Shi explained 4991 RaTG13 one same. original name, says, bat itself, team switched RaTG13 sequenced entire virus. TG stands Tongguan, town Yunnan province trapped bat, said, 13 year 2013.  Polish one fucked everything example pretends fine.

Same Hungary:

 - Statistics: [World record deaths per day - Government: [Hungary one best defense - Doctors: [Hospitals extreme pressure, need strict - PM Viktor Orban: Hospitals fine. start loosen restrictions easter. need international help fight COVID, instead help others. know, US already outsourcing jobs India China awhile now. suppose, theoretically companies could hire someone nowhere, Alabama instead someone NYC pay less I'm sure would really work real life due cultural differences/potential time zone differences. normally pro-union, I've read one teachers union using pandemic bargaining chip years changes contracts stalled bunch stuff. many times typical State department-issued passport holder scan it? Maybe year?

That's totally thing going Starbucks. State comments. me. less afraid COVID boss dumb enough let keep working home, basically saved 1.5 hours per day 15-20 bucks day gas eating lunch. Report yesterday stated 50% Adults England antibodies. don‚Äôt link hand, surprised recently learn essentially considered bunk now. One things doesn‚Äôt filter popular consciousness guess. correio da manh√£, it‚Äôs kind Fox News XD  believe asked point backing information rather random rephrasing ""no."" People really lost track wave meant be. That‚Äôs huge increase cases weeks. seems impossible vaccination rate.

I would define ‚Äúchoppy waters.‚Äù may difficulty getting boat isn‚Äôt anything boat (hospitals, health care system etc.) can‚Äôt handle. that's Israel using pandemic there. Every vaccine still relative unknown preventing spread working B.1.351.

Sputnik vax next best trials. Exactly! wanna shake yell people anti mask anti vax. Sis protestors yelling infront hospital take masks. One nurses said wants push covid room mask free see still think hoax.  fucking hate CCP so, much point, think current Northeast surge due different regions waves different times. 

I don‚Äôt see coincidence cases rising Northeast March/April time period got hit hard last year. poor whataboutism disease need taken seriously! I‚Äôve asked coworkers also 20s like friends. one friend said get it. None coworkers want it. Correct.

As targeting spike allows mutation virus still providing protection. virus mutates away spike, virus substantially less contagious. whole philosophy targeted spike first place. spike goes away, pandemic dies out. virus mutates spike stays, still protected. ""socially promiscuous""? ffs, everyone sub really hate anyone friends BionTech delivering promised ammount?

They are. actually overdelivering, stark contrast clusterfuck AstraZeneca. Mask mandates clearly irrelevant. Follow data worse daily new cases daily new deaths going winter risk transmission schools low adults schools vaccinated. There‚Äôs plenty testing capacity. It‚Äôs time get kids back schools. Mediocre football variant? antibody levels begin wane peak vaccination, plateauing. totally natural expected. Antibodies alone arent indicator level resilience infection serious illness regarded anything concern also quite bit genetics involved people react medicine. Metamizole severe sideeffects countries barely others. Germany uses prescription pain killer, Poland sells counter UK completely banned. see 65+ data? anyway see broken state? 6 weeks first shot immunity. Saying 5 weeks herd immunity would imply 70% population first shot J&amp;J shot already. Anybody who‚Äôs ever school could told that. Vaccines work targeting spike protein specifically. virus mutate away spike protein, looses essential element binding cells. going dangerous mutation evades vaccine effectiveness. Thank you, substantial concerns I'm still getting background issue helps. Would say enough 'quality' comments support retaining daily thread, perhaps combination strict moderating guidelines section? People seriously can‚Äôt wait stuff dies down

Some people waiting year. people work year. people losing minds, slipping depression, lost everything... year now. 

At point, point return normal, lot people need get back lives lose even it‚Äôs still spreading rapidly control..

Case counts overall slightly up. Deaths still coming down. Vaccines going millions every day. spiraling control, spiral control going forward. 

I mean, really care much. Everything TN less open open since June. missed work. missed mortgage payment. going gym since June. once, I'm actually pretty happy living south. 

But people lost everything still suffering lockdowns proven marginally effective best. get athletes j j vaccine essential workers? right privacy... Roe vs Wade? right abortion right free travel association within state annoyed people cutting line February back supply really low 65+ struggling book appointments. basically encourage people cut line. need many people vaccinated fast possible. NC longer impossible find shot, look find something. Heck browsed appointments could scheduled bunch within next days needed to. I'm already vaccinated... used help people make appointments, seems like everyone neighbors set. know one person struggling make appointment, specifically wants J&amp;J want drive town it. Anti British hysteria playing large part this. EU made absolute arse this. healthy 37 year old, there's way I'd taking th Astrazeneca vaccine now. little risk serious COVID complications time vaccine available anyway (I'm EU), COVID less problem.

There far many international pauses use, investigation, dishonesty I'm longer comfortable it. 

People make decisions know I'm probably going downvoted oblivion there's mine. I'm way 'anti-vax' swap one risk another. Well booster shots already development doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôs scary Every vaccine approved use right viral particle vaccine. mRNA vaccines make cells produce Spike Protein adenovirus vector vaccines do. essentially deliver medicine (The Astra spike inferior. spike proteins designed US NIH.) Go take basic statistics class maybe understand. twisting words. explicitly said vaccines key ending pandemic, nearly over. pretty much incubation period Covid.

Could caught Covid 2 week period inoculated? Yes, deserved. point 99% longer stand open up. suggesting point simply long justify closing down? Like, 2 years fine, 5 years fine, 10 years fine swallow it? we're giving businesses green light refuse service based medical tests? saying? deny service people provide forms vaccination records daily updated STD test every time enter store? believe 128 million...I bridge sell you. Uk received Moderna all. No, still happening. primarily bid protect Northern Ireland shares border RoI, new wave hits part Europe, Northern Ireland protected people RoI decide cross border restrictions vastly different. NETHERLANDS BROKE SIXTY THOUSAND DAY FIRST TIME WEEKS WOO.
In news, hoarding vaccines, terrible invitational system old farts getting vaxxed want much less anticipated leaving shots unshot. Great. Raiding factories suspicion AZ hiding millions jabs destined UK certainly help quell that.  funny, majority scientific studies read topic (I read least 30 different parts world) showed efficacy lockdowns masking reducing infections deaths

What type ""lockdowns"". Western-style lockdowns Eastern-style lockdowns. two different. Good point. Maybe it‚Äôs good got believe HIPAA would stop happening. 

No offense think bit paranoid. Walmart lets rando idiots without masks time. Well, way vaccines work, anyone took adenovirus-based vaccine like AstraZeneca one probably take MRNA one, since may immune vector virus now. One problem assume 100m presumably covid overlapping people vaccinated. Current best practices US aspirate back administering IM injection due likelihood hitting large vein small. went medic school 19 years ago taught aspirate, went nursing school last year taught to. Best practices change years medicine. Time Arbys Taco Bell. Works every time suspicion too, based numbers [Der (German), really seems risk difference. Based data 8 German states, 1.78 millioner women &lt;70 years vaccinated 29 unusual symptoms (= 1 per 61400). men, 864000 2 cases unusual symptoms (= 1 per 432000). Comparing one-time submission vaccination records, without use app, employer school border check equal app scan every time enter restaurant. 30-something female teacher died friend's school second day AZ shot. Presumably heart attack. even local news. move Well complete idiot doesn‚Äôt surprise  Let's see sequels platelets collapsing brain even die, maybe? ‚Äúwait weeks‚Äù get behind. Obviously bonus tied series lmao people justify anything way can. person said, freeze six weeks ago. Next? US, Europe. nothing FDA, Trump, Operation Warp Speed. Put tin foil hat back go back mothers basement Get program, we're supposed listen CDC follow science they're talking ""impending doom"". science says roll back restrictions clearly fake news. Take back theirs? you‚Äôre owed something, played rules long enough feel it‚Äôs deserved? get cases

According exactly? Maybe cases true UK observed yet. LOCKDOWNs kinda right. masks....no help LOT slow spread. denying that.

""Lockdowns"" done West tend suck anyway. immensely expensive rife holes non-enforcement allowed large scale spreads continue occur.

Even Canada, fanfare Americans forbidden entering bit scam, since could've still flown vacation recently. thanks vaccine developers, tach people labs, true geniuses defense. ""experts"" ""epidemiologists"" could easily look world windows hope years come.

These people demonstrated entire world clueless, good make news words, good nothing. words. action.

/rant  Austalia really upset lockdowns

I know SK, people Australia really suffered extreme lockdowns spring 2020, Victoria endured 4-month lockdown? Several articles written circumstances people trapped apartments several months... clarify I'm talking private businesses requiring them, worse yet government mandating them.

If foreign country mandates proof vaccination enter, whatever guess. They'll remove policy feel hurting helping them.

But Ticketmaster demands see digital vaccine passport enter concert, state demands see enter Walmart, strongly that. Last year short little play idea... really. time group 6 vaccinations arranged would actually greater chance receiving AZ, BioNTech vaccines started move second dose allocation. think local grocery store/car dealership/insert brick mortar business going turn away business people don't/won't/can't get one? Short kind Orwellian world ""Show papers!"", it'll never get level.

They'll probably get pushed federal level certain things, it'll take forever implemented matter lick finally manage get place. reason freak I'm expert forcing everyone use solution could problematic. Especially fully open-sourced. open hear thoughts ideas situation improved! impending doom shit day. Yeah get fear part either known awhile we'll need boosters year like flu shot? I'm sure Pfizer Moderna planned cases may increasing, places simply don‚Äôt see virus could infect enough people become another ‚Äúwave.‚Äù Sure, cases, hospitalizations, deaths may go last gasp many vaccinated convalescent people US virus get another foothold point. mean appears typical fear terror situation. people get scared ""possibility"" despite low margin is. fact amount blood clots higher pretty much proves vaccine caused since numbers clots unvaccinated people even Higher vaccine. 


Another factor help encourage people scared AZ vaccine 20 million doses given (at time article's reporting) 7 total showing blood clots. 7 20,000,000. even tenth percent. likely die random asteroid hitting head walk street die blood clot AZ vaccine. fyi. 


To adhere fearmongering, misinformation allow gullible put dangerous situation getting vaccine. absolutely evidence proof AZ causes issues, people associating commonly known problems norm (without vaccine mind you) finding patterns scare people over, grounded Science Fact. shit people gave Florida Texas , Florida Texas ended smack dab middle country terms case death per capita, northeast states stringent restrictions fared worse

NE states also far denser tested far more. graph Test per Million vs Cases per Million, see correlation.

It's almost bad vaccines kicking right now. It'd nice random antibody samples state get estimate real positivity rate location country. Looking vaccinations uptake makes want cry. simply possible achieve kind numbers US. Sometimes less homogeneous society benefits. stopped watching news last summer nightly news one segment Pfizer trials one trial getting covid thinking putting aresol spray ethics bad cure all. next segment went spiel covid control. mean bad people trial get covid naturally, next segment world coming end. watching local news lately they're talking one man massive allergic reaction vaccine. pushing people away it, get allergic reaction got penicillin Sure... let‚Äôs get back life *when it‚Äôs still spreading rapidly control..*

People seriously can‚Äôt wait stuff dies like Israel go back normal?

We still rampant outbreaks. They'll claim constitution. negate perfectly good argument listing grammatical mistakes. comes petty childish. rally people already side, alienate agree you, might otherwise learned something Why? Uses completely different tech. modified adenovirus like AZ J&amp;J, recombinant nanoparticle vaccine. 

It could even harder make, could much easier. Time tell. seen proposals requiring vaccination order purchase items stores, I'm sure idea unvaccinated would prohibit person buying groceries would come from. think vaccine passport-style proposals I've seen focused travel, entertainment, schools. entertainment restrictions might little far, travel schools no-brainer. preparing go Brazil, get vaccinated yellow fever carry piece paper customs prove shot allowed enter country. enrolled college US, provide evidence childhood vaccinations show eligible sort medical exemption. totally normal, everyday occurrences. vaccines widely available within country, seems reasonable add covid vaccines list requirements schools travel. anyone thinking may seasonal? telling nobody made money AstraZeneca? philanthropy, wow.  Yes, do, I'm fine COVID passports travel, hate idea domestic passport front door every business enter. absolutely know difference. long goes slowly has, vaccination prevail. virus enough ""space"" jump much millions people getting vacced every day. worry much.  deliberately obtuse comparing COVID passports international travel one-time border check, Excelsior Pass-like proposal scan app every time enter bar theater. CEO already back La Republica interview January. we'll make boosters. like getting yearly flu shot That's efficacy numbers work all. 1 10 would gotten infected without vaccine still get infected. Even transmission rate *within* households 40% Israel looking amazing right now. gives hope US see thing happen weeks catch up, think month behind now. There‚Äôs difference requiring international travel requiring go work everyday go store. Yeahhhh young healthy 20 something I‚Äôll pass one.  It‚Äôs really changed now. feels like pro-ignorance movement taken here. strange. Like even reasonable suggestions keeping safe considered crazy people. Gov super friendly vaccine manufacturers pharmaceutical industry partners, likely trying position us nation based future products facilities.

They like since day 1, part 4 made UK went ""here's cash, please here""... Some. like Pfizer, said no. Normally plants already. 

Apparently vaccine taskforce really well received companies dealt with. Wish Canada precocious rigid like that. could live better life now. 1c significantly smaller group 1b since preexisting health conditions got moved 1b. think estimating 1b would cover 70% fairfax adults. guess 1c take like 2-3 weeks get end March open everyone. Especially since mass vax site Alexandria running. That‚Äôs one part story. time many want vaccine aren‚Äôt eligible. Recommend state govts drop requirements provide resources run vaccination sites longer hours - heading towards ‚Äúimpending doom ‚Äú. 
Bizarre see extraordinary statements extraordinary steps combat situation.  Many vaccination sites already 24/7. running fastest vaccination campaign human history people could wait 2-3 weeks vaccinated. getting supply every week - really incredible. Look front page New York Times. Plus four percent Friday, plus 10 percent Saturday, plus 15 percent yesterday. Nationwide numbers reminder fox news called Mr. Rogers evil telling children special.  Still word eligibility fully opens up. understand need make sure people need vaccine get first, sucks idea I'll able protect myself. know there's almost certainly definitive answer, estimates vaccines *easily* available everybody? There's lot focus opening eligibility certain dates, surely first couple weeks appointments going filled within minutes. Basically, long till booking vaccine appointment like getting flu shot, less like trying get PS5? Lots take seriously, know scientists, doctors epidemiologists? 

It's virus science, matter believe, real. Nice. Good job Colorado Cringe increased 633% aged 30 39 800% aged 40 49.

Those percentages mean nothing without context behind them. typical clickbait fearmongering. subreddit gotten boring.. love it!! honeymoon period still going 1 year in. Love working/studying home. Love working every day going run working little gym attic. Why? Westchester ""Upstate"". /s state provides databases everyone got vaccine (most states required sort registration regardless got vaccine), would mean forwarding information federal government. Obviously it‚Äôs easier said done. 

I don‚Äôt think information vaccine bottle number person got much importance. someone got vaccine, they‚Äôre information listed database. Again, it‚Äôs easier said done. yet. San Francisco growing infection rate. There's still time one lockdown fire season starts can't breathe reasons. fair comparing san francisco, taken pandemic seriously beginning, also highest vaccination rates em all, fair contest College kids aren‚Äôt getting tested i‚Äôll tell ya God websites frustrating. Can‚Äôt find rest article. would. got mine 1pm, 4 woke mild flu symptoms. 9 moderate pooping brains fever. made shift called next 2 days. 1st day fever aches, lot better. 2nd one call days im close 100% back. basically plan 1-4 days mild moderate misery.

oh note took nothing symptoms, might able moderate Tylenol. suppose you‚Äôre one people always cooks meat well done, avoids sushi never goes outside without sunscreen!

All CDC recommendations! Impending doom? Come man. 

No one takes seriously anymore shame. saw Israel vaccinations hit 50 percent cases dropped dramatically. think see state level. states hit 50 percent cases drop. Cases may rise barring unforeseen circumstances ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù gross exaggeration Well, messaging keeping mask even vaccinated terrible also. work software we‚Äôre going back offices Easter (yay!). 

Trying get dogmatic engineers cooperate creative via online tools like herding cats - much, MUCH easier pen post notes everyone room together. kind difficult test run typically run unless hospital possibly icu. logic affect treatment way I'm 100% sure this, studied Hebrew Israeli culture university remember reading one reasons Israelis lot children WWII huge desire increase Jewish population world, specifically Holy Land course. Maybe could also factor? Like, still rooted culture. 

I'm actually writing thesis Jewish/Israeli culture. favourite course. That's true all. Murphy said can't commit Biden's 5/1 date age group. study observes day positive test counts ""person days."" ratio positive tests people. (m)any.

that's pretty Fresno messed up? Checks out. Four fuckin‚Äô cases whole region shuts down? Crazy people talking Australia/NZ ‚Äúbeat virus.‚Äù didn‚Äôt beat anything normalcy ripped there‚Äôs single-digit virus numbers. politicians may saying one thing, headlines disagree. know exactly mean. lot people planning skipping Covid vaccination hoping rely others around getting vaccinated protect them.

They able avoid vaccination long. Pfizer planning applying formal approval next month. get formal approval expect corporate America make mandatory.

70 percent people want take vaccine. Another 5 ten percent take employer makes required. last 10-15 percent going take even vaccine passport. Maybe, problem know vaccine received. suspect group high percentage BioNTech.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Dude, said earlier - we/Norway gotten away fairly easy, fine get vaccine us. british media hardly neutral. Bloomberg US, likely neutral, say: going happen. 

With vaccination numbers supply rapidly increasing, - practically speaking - going done US Memorial Day weekend likely weeks that, even. politicians watch movies apparently: Looking Hungary, one Europe's best vaccination rates, yet world's highest current mortality rate per capita, current number vaccines simply enough prevent high levels excess deaths happening - large proportion at-risk population yet vaccinated. play recreational sports league height pandemic two us vaccinated rest us eligible yet. positives.

So going tell couple months cases record low start pandemic people barred participating? make sense. likely even eligible July state (healthy 30 year old). Instead intellectually dishonest acting like raised .0001% could simply Google numbers. Many states seeing beginning rise, peak. Michigan first, northeast following. Michigan March 1 last Tuesday, hospitalizations increased 633% aged¬†30 39 800% aged¬†40 49. 37% age 80 older. deaths rising too. Educate instead arguing facts lazy look agree GOP right wing media (Fox News, Newsmax, OANN) feeding steady diet lies base. force feeding: learned something right year dynamics wrong: signals go ways. base getting extreme enough views mainstream GOP representatives Fox News talking heads, go find extreme views lies extreme alternatives like Q-Anon far-right candidates far-right news outlets (Newsmax, OANN). Hahaha would honoured create new copy pasta meme. Go it.

Every vaccine blocks transmission!!! Dunno people weird it. ‚ÄúWho knows might might not‚Äù. 

And nobody mention whooping cough I‚Äôll get paper wikipedia citation break show even vaccine reduces transmission. saying didn't. Looks like 5.3 million people 50 vaccinated NHS England 21st March. unclear proportion AZ BioNTech. Since 50 either vulnerable medical suspect may high percentage BioNTech. Unfortunately publish stats manufacturer. number unvaccinated lot less fully vax group. can‚Äôt divide one evenly I‚Äôm worried hot cold messaging AstraZeneca Canada (not 65! young people! Wait 65 ok! Wait 55 isn‚Äôt ok!) going create vaccine mistrust. Thrombosis Canada already released statement (safe anyone history blood clots, current blood clots, blood thinners, etc...) seems contradictory weird. CDC knows country heading towards ‚Äúimpending doom‚Äù - accelerate pace vaccinations even more. 
What stops running vaccination sites longer perhaps even 24x7, hire medical personnel, employ national guard FEMA run them?! done? 
Put stops fight it. situation changing change strategy. go town Fresno could stay inside meth instead? Correct Yeah even then, that‚Äôs still 1c. That‚Äôs adults What's point? nothing legally forcing us follow EU's vaccination plan. *We chose vaccination strategy whilst still EU*.

Source: That's great, doubt people love wearing seatbelts way love wearing favorite hat.  Says someone clue huge amount vaccines going people work NY only. 

Oh, also one reasons shit got bad here. case know. even vaccination lot people going get sick. 

***little*** sick fine.

seems vaccines keep severity hospital threshold.

cases cause lockdown.

full beds do. Where? Fuck America, Greetings Europe. Hope Yall fucking ROT Doesn‚Äôt matter. supposed working closely administration, isn‚Äôt it? ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù recommendations faster pace vaccinations. Better give someone use letting expire. PSA make sure prepared side effects.

while vaccine worth risk advice medically get so, reactions vaccine vary greatly rare cases life threatening.

1. leave vaccination site immediately, wait 15-30 min. 

2. go home alone help it. least stay regular contact people 24 hours symptoms disappear.

3. seek immediate medical attention severe difficulty breathing.

odds fine beyond mild headache mild moderate flu symptoms, careful.

Don't let possibility side effects deter getting vaccine. social circle almost lost 1 person reactions, we've buried 4 covid far, 2 others may permanent damage. none us suffered permanent damage vaccine, 3, including aforementioned, gotten significantly ill. fairfax 1b list basically 1 week away empty. shocked open 1c next week. Dollars donuts theres mad dash software development side get 1c stuff ready launch. Also, possible spent time adapting earlier variant less infective humans. currently seeing adaptations towards stronger virulence higher fatality rates, first detected variant might also evolved one less virulent thus unnoticed. case, would suspect relatively nearby place China people able come contact infected animals repeatedly somewhat imunocompromised. soon Wuhan variant emerged, might quickly outcompeted erased one came directly animals making hard detect retroactively. Well, speak suppressing numbers New York, you‚Äôre correct, governor currently investigated (a whole lot things, too). think it‚Äôs important note Georgia‚Äôs New York‚Äôs death numbers close. populated state is, think locked New York, would‚Äôve way deaths. work every day home Texas opened adults starting today. matter supply, suspect we'll end next month, sooner. Biden commenting state‚Äôs plans are. authority direct them, recommend.  America like pretty much Europe little nothing around mid February even early March. China already started hard (unimaginable hard western standards) lock Wuhan late January. US started really something situation got control New York. Europe Italy instead New York. 

Even US travel bans people coming certain parts China started 31 January. first US reaction all. Wuhan lock already started 23 January. even China locked large city like Wuhan point clear everybody world something going on, still took US week anything all. mentioned thinks better Europe pretty much everywhere outside certain Asian countries. Yeah I'd probably avoid crowded bar club first dose think things okay. course covid probably fine whatever one week first dose science would suggest take much risk want basically zero possibility getting spreading asymptomatically. course forever know long going for.

I think traveling one dose reasonably careful totally fine that's really what's recommended even people doses survived rollover crash kid 0 injuries. seatbelt would almost certainly dead. headline anti-vax, sure reading headline. got first vaccine Pfizer yesterday. Today seriously feel little high drunk. arm tiny bit sore besides two things, fine.

I want work tonight work. think okay think might mess do? Hate brexiteer you, British news media tearing EU this, main headline UK last week so. would want to? Yes lots open appointment slots rest state. Sending blessings wishes tea heals meals that.. well friends here, except mine late Feb 2020. time doctor would even consider Covid China since November year. disregarded fact come back India sitting next world's prolific travelers pointy end plane. always suspected might covid, proof. Vaccine dose 1 went uneventful knows. Maybe CDC shouldn‚Äôt haven‚Äôt recommended reopening schools. seeing big uptick 0-25 ages. Wonder why. got downvoted hell saying earlier, glad see people becoming receptive reality ha. Feds authority override state local decisions mandates make u invincible suffering BROKEN FREAKIN‚Äô NECK?ü•á AZ recommend either. mistake companies official statement statement fact. statements demonstrably proven. never engage speculative theories asking lawsuit. Weirdos jerking idea living fallout fantasy. Well said, agree. lot people big hurry go straight back it, even though causes problems time time again. learn. mean I'm saying American perspective, even people got vaccine USA would rebel that.

Also it'd similar asking ID order drink: aka thing lot places do. Except even less enforcement.

That's going happening here. fun New York. nice offering $1 service free charge. another reason take covid 19 vaccine. Congrats.

The closest I've ever come paid post another user offering pay pictures feet. Oh, understand fine. 

You also proved offer nothing hysterics histrionics: ‚Äúwould happier people died?‚Äù

Did know 1 million people die every year tuberculosis? It‚Äôs respiratory disease, too.

Death unfortunate reality life. virus isn‚Äôt going away zero COVID fantasy. 

Honest question ‚Äî many years education going force generation students sacrifice? Yes, many people seem understand long-term side effects really means: side effects suddenly pop months without warning, rather problem arises soon vaccination, go away significant period time. fact, [no vaccine history adverse effects first appear six weeks vaccination. practice, think anywhere Canada vaccinating 55 right now, except special-case high risk categories. FIL 70 still waiting Ontario. affect general public unless ban lasts months. Hospitalizations rising half US

Rising much? 1%, 2%? fact hospitalizations cratered last peak. So, yes, going ebb flow cases U.S. shut everything uniformly across country. places opening back up, open, remain closed. 

Stating hospitalizations rising without stating actual number leads believe low % otherwise would mentioned stat post. 

But yes, guess .0001% increase indicate rise. saw article yesterday, heard anyone power saying it. I've sorta come terms fact certain people continue try ""move goalposts"" reasons, probably much appetite US keep restrictions place much longer hospitalisations deaths aren‚Äôt skyrocketing nobody worried. COVID endemic virus forever, there‚Äôs getting now. done miles better French big victory doesn‚Äôt say article, photo, fellow old man. 

I *not* want shit. suppose source that? interested first heard would good understand scope issue, update statistics.

Admittedly 5 2m rather small incident count. AZ main vaccine though, Biontech is. abysmal AZ delivery performance would've good enough looking political excuses. Narrator: mutated experience, think it‚Äôs different everyone. mild arm pain next day, like get flu shot, mom almost arm pain. agree point stand. I‚Äôm willing put hands air admit repeated failings government led far many deaths. see super surprising. evidently right R=1 March case counts coming gradually, we're probably right R=1 case counts going gradually, thing need flip first situation second small change like slightly transmissible variant becoming common restaurant capacities going whatever. think got framed subreddit binary choice ""everything ok nothing worry about"" vs ""sky falling we're fourth wave worse anything we've ever seen"" two former makes much sense kind resulted reasonable concerns getting suppressed dogpiling imo resulted people unrealistic expectations potential bumpy road still working getting broad vaccine coverage. flipside cases going little instead little barely changes anything practical personal safety right much actionable unless start see huge accelerating growth again, vaccines still protective even continue fairly high case counts months pretty much make getting vaccine COVID serious health risk. think going become unfortunate norm lot things coming back . support masks social distancing used seems many people want become indefinite thing people *always* safe. I‚Äôm pro masking also think life return normal point time Yeah think massively simplifying US immigration process many variables play, form regulation seems like absolute nightmare. Maybe need bring back social darwinism regards obese end ""fat acceptance"" movement? people ones filling ICU's clearly public health problem hurts everyone.

 understand medical conditions cause people become obese outside control, can't case even majority time right? Yeah EU basically Germany 3.3m 50 females. reported cases.
2m 50 males. reported cases.

[In England 25th common link seems Europe, making think manufacturing issue European facilities? Purely speculative though. That's opposite happened - person charge team buying vaccines wife Conservative minister (and also highly qualified area, working free).

Problem hospitalization rising along cases, puts one bed. totally agree second statement people USA live unhealthfully (me included honestly, I've terribly eating working out), 70% people USA overweight thaaaat different general pop. He's downvoted questions asked last ~20 articles topic last week's already. Mainly people saying issues coordinated attack EU AZ UK. profit vaccines. time everyone wants vaccine able get one, community spread low enough concerts mass gatherings without mandatory vaccines. There's enough demand vaccines America even punish people want it.

The entire purpose restrictions originally prevent hospitals overwhelmed. shifted reducing cases much possible everyone wants vaccine could get one order prevent unwilling people becoming infected.

What's purpose forcing people want vaccine get vaccinated? gain society? get infected, they're risk unvaccinated people. live risk get vaccinated. Let whatever want bodies. seems Birth Control may something study closely vaccinations, obviously severe reports Moderna people re-starting periods birth control vaccination. (So please use condom get vaccinated safe!) teacher MA, pool testing joke district. 45 165 students grade (7th) get tested. low percentage represent population appropriately. mistook total daily quick search, bad one. point still stands. Pathetic could used describe things say 10% vaccine rate significant shipment delays pathetic hardly fair accurate. honest rise bump cases worrying part. fact everywhere else, we've seen plateau. states cases rising, going either. Cases stopped decreasing end February hung level month now. Despite increasing daily vaccinations literally 2-3 million day. cases going down? Also important point, they‚Äôre ‚âà100% effective preventing hospitalization death case infection. said you‚Äôve nothing 9 months. words typed.

Edit: far points it‚Äôs amazing competent government isn‚Äôt it? It‚Äôs old argument me... can‚Äôt here? We‚Äôre supposedly greatest nation earth whatever right says fail miserably everywhere.

And totally could New Zealand wanted to, large proportion population *didn‚Äôt want to* hate adamant cdc 2 shot dose recommendation. really need change that. even said yesterday 1 dose 80% effective significantly reduce spread. even see uk Israel. Yet still today cdc says 2 doses also warning impending doom come. 

So point what‚Äôs better 2 shots 50 arms 90% effectiveness 1 shot 100 arms 80%??

If want shot. Awesome. Let‚Äôs get arms stop hearing impending doom. don‚Äôt, awesome. It‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs right choose (downvotes commence). 1 shot policy, (2nd spread longer, 1 1 shot) won‚Äôt matter anymore isn‚Äôt vaccinated. move faster. recent surge kind worrying people vaccinated yet shouldn‚Äôt let guard much. 7 day average increased every day since March 22 back similar levels saw March 2nd. We‚Äôre close end Covid we‚Äôre quite yet. vaccinated? not, continue cautious. so, resume life like endangering people. 

That message, stats science say. always assuming vaccinations would cut spread, actual data tells us case. getting message would probably encourage fence get vaccine.

Why fuck healthy 20 year old women acting like shes going die saw 1/100 000 headline. That‚Äôs literally 0.00001% lol. Two things:

AZ blew initial trials wrong dosing totally muddled results. Good vaccine...bad testers.

AZ became convenient scape goat EU bureaucrats stood nothing others procuring vaccines populations. EU looks bad needs someone point fingers at. many shots peoples‚Äô systems 3+ years? talking forever? Literally goal vaccine passport something convenient show pandemic still ongoing. get mean, seem counterintuitive, systemic distrust doctors/the medical industry government certain communities, might get creative outreach messaging. legally correct call BT vaccine parts world.

Biontech owns marketing distribution rights Germany (+EU),Turkey,China Asia.


Doses produced Germany labled ""Biontech Covid-19 Vaccine"", US called ""Pfizer/BT Covid-19 vaccine"" Pfizer owns marketing rights. pandering anti-vaxx crowd thinks going vote aspires higher office. would literally accomplish nothing versus would case issue executive order. stop cases getting high? Legit question. I‚Äôm talking elderly vulnerable. brock0791 already explained replies OC. Go ahead check out. I'll let draw conclusions.  Also, let add know three people vaccinated two actually going today I‚Äôm 30s well. Also, told friend 40s lists grocery stores phoned around many people list weren‚Äôt taking names awhile.  mean right near injected? saying support logical conclusion doesn‚Äôt make conspiracy theorist generally common.

Here Moderna page listing side effects rates trial. second shot fatigue, nausea, headache went away next day. Worth it. Okay, you‚Äôre agreeing ‚Äúrequiring‚Äù unvaccinated people unfeasible, also unenforceable. little extra bleeding bruising side effect. long ago get shot? speculation venous involvement COULD causing exaggerated immune clotting/thrombocytopenia problems nothing substantiated I'm aware of. that's AstraZeneca Pfizer, completely different type vaccine. 5 days since received good. mean, cases increasing shouldn‚Äôt mean anything mass vaccination vulnerable groups. Zero COVID illusion country ever 1,000 daily cases. largest test case people 65 reactions UK population. 13.5m doses given 65's.

I think investigations good certain amount politics causing scaremongering not. idea turned political statement, somehow did. call dense... guess we'll see order holds up. won‚Äôt get argument we‚Äôve many deaths hope government held account those. we‚Äôre completely different phase pandemic goal future prevention.

Also 100k per DAY. Jesus populace think here? That‚Äôs damn near 1 percent population daily. wouldn‚Äôt lasted months metric. complex medical advice. data. Numbers. Anyone enough research intelligence able comprehend it. include UK? Arizona big things rn. Great job!  Yeah even found 100% safe reports something found unrelated way trust AZ vaccine *(and possibly vaccines whole)* reduced.

Constantly seeing BERLIN HALTS USE Astra Vaccine ROLLOUT STOPPED Europe come news help.

Of course side effects monitored closely 

 *It's difficult overcome contradicting news cycles without solidifying perspective people's minds vaccines available, AZ's least desirable.* 

Hits nail head No, see put medical information electronic registry accessible laymen punishment. feel less important feel? I'll hang listen Seriously, Europe ever going get vaccination programme?, must 30 million doses given now, low number issues Yeah, never going happen (in US least), see left right come together magnitude never seen before. didn‚Äôt. 

Try another script. one power saying this. Stop spreading bullshit. fine... news? World governments genuinely using anti-vax rhetoric talk AZ Israel, U.K., US India seeing great success compared countries relied BioTech. Politics petty business. lol, talk inferiority complex first AZ Stuttgart Last week. given choice, I'd stay AZ. things guess hands...anything happen coming weeks. second dose due end May knows it'll be...I'm woman birth control 30s risk low blood clots comparison catching covid line work (care.) weighing risk assessment. Corona cases go last summer here, offered mRNA AZ, perhaps I'd take mRNA afford wait. right cases high tiny risk taking AZ far outweighs risk covid. 

I'm also confused men AZ additional blood clots males. going slow vaccination drive even really weird problem UK European countries.  100k+ deaths per day UK. 500K+ deaths per day USA. 20k+ deaths per day Canada.


The need vaccines seems little dire 2 3. Get house order criticizing mine. True Walensky‚Äôs silly performance? mine yesterday! buy it. like virus starting Porten everyone saying government lab nothing it. covid denier conspicicy fan much coincidence virus started town massive highest category lab. Let's calm whole ""right thing"" business lol read fast:

""Who Half-people England??"" useless elected middle-management Berlin already discussions Bayer CureVac scale, preproduce along guaranteed buy-orders. cares anymore fails sink couple billion drain, worst case. 

But probably didn't. middle-management. option currently one gets go concerts. vaccine ‚Äúpassport‚Äù simply trustable version vaccine card. Anyone make vaccine card. It‚Äôs small piece card stock easily replicated print it, name vaccine batch number usually hand written. 

In itself, trust verification unlikely accepted anything free donut!

A vaccine passport merely QR (or similar) code scanned, contains information, digitally signed (by trusted authority) veracity verified.

When vaccine passport required entry simply scan code verify name ID (optionally)

To provide incentive, rather restricting access, would also need similar ‚Äúproof‚Äù else everyone would simply get card, collect! put who? Trump administration?

JFC you‚Äôre dangerously dense  Okay got doses it‚Äôs true? neighborhood app full people asking help finding vaccines saying they‚Äôve really hard time. personally checking last days websites used, vaccine finder, grocery stores etc., completely full. nothing 50 mile radius house. please don‚Äôt pass personal experience fact. I‚Äôm stating still people struggling 50+ population quite high opened last week, opening general public week it‚Äôs going tough people trying get vaccinated ahead Friday. seen claim zero evidence sources. 

Full [vaccine distribution breakdowns UK apart split manufacturers. CDC generally uses Excess death count total losses pandemic.

Mexico came severely undercounting. Today came Florida undercounting 5k deaths look Florida excess deaths. sure states undercounted well. Private businesses want, government place telling require customers serving Uhhhh I‚Äôm really sure collect evidence something like this, it‚Äôs human nature. want protected, take vaccine. That‚Äôs article says all!!! What‚Äôs deal lying sub?? helpful. Thank I‚Äôm cautious want life resume without endangering people needlessly it.

It‚Äôs time people like get clue Wow. People agree me, want entire thread ""SHUT DOWN."" even know react that.

You're seeing trend people fed rotten communication regarding vaccines (and vaccinations) between-the-lines insinuations mandates will/should continue well past reasonable point. proportion AztraZeneca? early cohorts Pfizer main vaccine used? thought variants, often mutations contagious less deadly. Obviously 100%, thought standard virus mutation path. 7-Day averages useful single day stats assess trend, appear cases actually increasing Ok, get you‚Äôre trying funny trolling. It‚Äôs nearly funny think. Don‚Äôt forget natural immunity well.  misleading, Germany robust federation. crazy, I'm 29 got first dose, I'm surely going second, call anti vax whatever, I'm confortable risk vs consider risk Covid age... Maybe people wore masks big crowds could ensure proper distance, know concerts people going full conversation stranger, normally i'd busy watching show close cant hear anything else. people want go mask go. I'm sure concerts sell pretty quick people mind wearing mask. We're gonna donate leftovers anyways half Republicans taking vaccine.

Besides test negative even enter states.

If 16 state many want it. Exactly. making great progress vaccines despite president. refused admit threat virus posed, pretending like fix without problem, mention lack never encouraging wearing masks openly shaming people do.  mutate fine children, that‚Äôs concern.

As long it‚Äôs circulating somewhere population risk thing mutation something vaccine for, start over. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs everywhere everyone.

That said, adults vaccinated think need start opening up. people aren‚Äôt going care anyways, economy needs start recovery. First, Tues always much higher Monday's reporting. want compare today last Tues. likely increase, alarming increase posted here. get wrong, we're clearly outbreak, want compare right data. ""I can't bothered googling I'll happily berate googling it""

Go then. 10 mins, starting now. Let us know find ;)

Also made clear bothered **Not sure stopped it** yeah practically mandatory here. Wow. literally vaccine developed EU based labs, built EU subsidies. Pharmaceutical labs exist isolation require staff supply facilities close links healthcare academia, typically located High tech hubs.

The EU invested infrastructure, EU based facilities exported 23 million vaccine doses UK 50 million globally. UK exported 0. That's high approval anything gets US. that‚Äôs hard right bibi running vaccine program one political incentive question vaccines unlike here. perks recent settler colony suppose 90% less likely get COVID equivalent unvaccinated person.

The true odds getting infected COVID depends rate spread community, type environments frequent, level precautions take, etc. warned 2017 people won‚Äôt happy til get one going much life continue live like that. exactly! wave cases go deaths hospitalizations   Get available. important factor prevention fo serious illness death extremely well. Lol. Where? Mine asked license insurance card health insurance 

Yours even make sense. guess homeless fucked. Lol. fair unlikely extremely high group could define, remains rare occurrence demographic tending toward extremely rare occurrence general global populace.

Far people die taking counter pain medication month. I've able find good numbers many people UK given AZ vaccine 50 years old. suspect relatively small number, perhaps million people. Well even worse thought. definitely privacy concerns consider overcome pretty easily. First Google and/or Apple already know literally every second day stores forever. 

Second definitely possible create scheme validates individual's status without giving personal data scanner. solution would app storing yes/no status signed CDC generating QR code contains status timestamp. scanner validates timestamp last 15 seconds checks status signed correctly. I'm sure actual security researchers much better methods too.

There's still issues ""what person cell phone"" stuff security stuff needs technical requirement. Arguably US. happen know good article explaining expected timelines trials? know Pfizer Moderna's 12+ trials fully enrolled know implication 12+ likely able get it. Last checked 60 million doses India too, problems either. know going EU. Kudos you. Getting done despite fear. That‚Äôs courage. You‚Äôre tough nails. show passport long matches name say health insurance.

Plus, I‚Äôve heard actually trying get one hard. Look actual distribution deaths age:  


Every death tragic, ""the abyss"". kind sensationalism dishonest helpful. He‚Äôs nut researching corona viruses BSL2 3 Wuhan. China many BSL3 labs inside outside Wuhan. states much better others, it‚Äôs incredibly frustrating you‚Äôre state that‚Äôs poorly.

Many states opened vaccinations adults age 16 older, Oregon friends essential workers, T1 diabetes, etc still aren‚Äôt eligible. risky click me, sorry ‚ÄúPublic opinion longer lines personal beliefs means sub brigaded bots‚Äù parents vaccinated, don‚Äôt really see problem. risk death fully vaccinated people really really extra low point close zero. unlucky enough get it, doesn‚Äôt matter, likely won‚Äôt get sick.

The issue unvaccinated people. low non-existent chance still get covid spread it. Non-vaccinated people risk.

But parents vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt matter. Honestly, many resources city could handle inconceivable many people can't get shots.  Set Center City SEPTA Stations, city hall courtyard, Penn Station, Liacouras Center, Jefferson Prez Philly, Franklin Field W Philly. Heck use fire stations. They're nearly equidistant population. something. Plus side September would perfect time one mass 18 vaccination campaign, done couple weeks.

Set clinics schools line shots. Can't uptick cases without ""fourth wave""? anywhere several days several months.

My girlfriend got covid January barely started getting senses back. past month started come back slowly able taste smell certain things. may also able make shortfalls June. 

Curevac indicated apply June, approved July.  Italy, last year, 18 yo received double lung transplant:

Source italian: Eligibility availability two different beasts. mom 75 eligible January, able get appointment couple days ago. areas country better others, we've actively seek appointment, otherwise knows long she'd waiting contact myriad places signed for. Two reasons:

1. We‚Äôre sure long term effects yet. Maybe getting Covid raises risk heart attack 50 kind terrible condition. it‚Äôs something let run free. I‚Äôm saying lockdowns. masks easy. 

2. Kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated ties number 1.

Edit: okay three reasons. people Covid higher risk variants defeat vaccines. dare you!

You‚Äôre one advocating forget mandates start partying! Ok happens mobile morgues roll in? water shut off? electricity stop working? internet disconnect? buses stop running? Nope, lot deaths people age 60 productive members society. 

Our civilization won‚Äôt collapse keeps happening every year. long ""redditprofile12345""?

May 3rd, I'll fully vaccinated (that's 14th day 14 day waiting period supposed second dose). May 3rd, OK resume normal life Florida? mean, still stay isolation mid summer? Also, parents (who early 70s) fully vaccinated April 9th (they also live Florida). OK go whatever long wear masks so? also 55% lethal doctor bother thats is. vaccine = health? don‚Äôt see places requiring vaccine passports TB, whooping cought, etc I‚Äôm afraid of. Doesn‚Äôt mean want government mandate them. want live dystopia, feel free move China. case. main risk south. Years? unlikely. continue mask months really squash thing. know, flu vaccine every year, getting lot different flu vaccines lifetime - even tend ask questions previous flu vaccines. 

Also whenever get round booster/variant shots questions apply. stopped giving anyone numerous European countries. AZ supposed apply EUA April means we're probably looking late April earliest maybe time May. Novavax targeting EUA May. Fwiw, entire stockpile AZ doses manufactured stored US course months coincidentally range Moderna, Pfizer, J&amp;J pump week, probably expect authorizing AZ enormous effect timeline vaccines become easily available everyone.  See, asthma 'severe' means, still use inhaler semi-regularly. Perhaps age, 50 i'm priority? knows. Pfizer 95% effective, believe effective all. documented study sort summary document results..... Yeah point wasn‚Äôt really specifically, state immunity population, CDC director expressed concern variants. people vaccinated yet inevitably going take time achieve due logistical bottlenecks, well time takes get shots develop systemic immunity. leaves window millions people potentially get exposed even though theoretically close finish line. Raiding factories suspicion AZ hiding millions jabs destined UK certainly help quell that.  italy seizing countries vaccines. 
EU spent year virtue signaling nothing show it.  Canada far behind. They're still working people 70s think missed something, what‚Äôs wrong AZ? spokeswoman said talks AstraZeneca making sure company ‚Äúmake(s) full use supply lines plants **which identified contract**‚Äù meet obligations 27-country EU. 

Important difference saying **as per contract**. agree age. I‚Äôm 41 (not young younger parents) symptoms. Dad also got moderna sore arm fatigue. Mom got Pfizer slight headache little tired.

MIL, age, getting first vaccine week. Yeah family Pfizer, can‚Äôt choose afaik. think they‚Äôre 55-60 bracket Seems like get AZ vaccine, one ask doctor regimen baby aspirin weeks.

Hopefully round 2 kill round one relatively painless me! I'm 26. Gov never said would. Times came article gov clarified plan share time Based I‚Äôve read, it‚Äôs 10 days chance infection drops 20% non-vaccinated population. Today, I‚Äôm week post second Pfizer (I‚Äôm 70, pursuing vaccination two months, state opened age 65 up.) 

The sense relief incredible. 

Sorry idiots think saying BS somehow makes true. really don‚Äôt know them. older get, harder anti propaganda information sink in. New advice replace N95 masks: breathe. Read research paper posted. article based on. helps actual shot seemed lot less painful flu shot others had. Thanks getting vaccinated. Yeah told takes 2 weeks create anitbodies (by nurse giving AZ). Seems logical? wonder body tries rebuild platelet count initial antibody shock? It‚Äôs Reddit comment, dissertation. Obviously understand OP, they‚Äôve clarified themself. question is, State, many vaccinations received many going arms. States everything get going arms within two weeks getting it. State getting 100,000 doses week going arms within week. Opening things means vaccines going different arms, arms. first shot (Pfizer) five days ago sore arm two days, first day felt tired enough nap, it. Definitely happy side effects! Good looks, thank much! expect CDC nefarious. think witnessed unplanned statement genuine concern faster spreading variants US following pattern see emerging Europe. shittiest conversations I‚Äôve Covid especially vaccine nurses. Like straight misinformation shitty. spreading far wide like apostolic mission.

Then I‚Äôve also got great friends nurses right on. dumbfounded nurses know still squawking HCQ paying factory imports components UK? Cool don‚Äôt understand emphasis wearing masks outside (I anti-mask...I wear mask anytime close contact people indoors outside house...even though vaccinated). Hasn‚Äôt general scientific consensus since last summer outdoor spread almost nonexistent? Even indoors common thinking evolved sharing air close contact someone 15 minutes. Recent findings vaccine efficacy also show common ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know still spread you‚Äôre vaccinated‚Äù refrain also probably scientifically untrue. 

I don‚Äôt wear mask I‚Äôm walk (I don‚Äôt live densely populated city) area suburban Chicago live wearing mask exercising outdoors seems exception rule.

(Around time Polis making prediction, *New York Times* reported President Joe Biden urging states already eliminated mask mandates restore light comments made Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director federal Centers Disease Control Prevention, says feeling sense ""impending doom"" new surge novel coronavirus.)

Biden set course underpromising overdelivering, setting long string modest positive ""wins"" he'll able point to, fresh people's minds. Pre Az rollout total vaccinations UK 1.9m 338k 50, gender split, remained constant current ratio would ~209k 50 female. 

Since use seem data specifying used beyond anecdotal. 

(E.g. met heard anyone Pfizer) That‚Äôs point vaccination, protection. messaging wary vaccination insanity much reasoned way communicate ""brutal surge indeed alarming"". OP another repeat poster eats downvotes due hyperbolic ignorance Even Biden administration came today express concerns report. actually false. vaccination rate picking vaccine makers getting initial production hurdles, averaging 875k day January 20th. ""oh brain that's supposed happen"" No, zero zero. really strange fall camps? I'd say sums pretty well, I'm Texas feel like (as whole) tend skew lockdown skeptic side. certainly pro-lockdown people here, many extreme parts country, I'm sure.

Anyway, I'm right you. point, restrictions mean little me, I'm full super pro-vaccine.

Got mine morning large tented site dozens stations time. definitely act together, line bet simply limited availability doses. 80% reduction partial vaccination pretty damn juicy, right.

Another way looking it:

A partially vaccinated person two times likely get COVID fully vaccinated person. unvaccinated person five times likely get COVID partially vaccinated person, ten times likely fully vaccinated person. Women naturally prone blood clots estrogen, things like birth control raise little too. well could related that.

From first paragraph: ""Only 34 1.8 million Ohioans vaccinated since December tested positive COVID-19, resulting five hospitalizations zero deaths."" That's concerns me.

Not UK happening probability maybe kept secret swept rug. reason CDC considers ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù two weeks second Pfizer dose? I‚Äôm mistaken, trial calculated efficacy 7 days second Pfizer shot. Even FDA fact sheet states 7 days, 14. House Sr. COVID Advisor: 50% seniors fully vaccinated. read comment, actually say that. UK started Pfizer, iirc healthcare workers got, followed strict age based criteria. AZ recently rolled en-masse 55s, issue UK see indications near future.

Thats true, treatment treatment. reason ultrasounds cost much 1-the technicians use operate/interpret cost produce them. treatment Covid, streamlining production increasing training people could make viable, especially became part governments program would get massive funding tests prove effectiveness. I'm seriously concerned mask restrictions may get lifted summer get reimposed fall. Yea biggest problem. CA administered close 12 million vaccinations, half Pfizer (effectively AZ), heard issue outside Germany. 

There 3 explanations mind: 1, genetic oddity exists Germany; 2, environmental factor exists Germany (maybe another vaccine interacts somehow); 3, bad reporting. tend go simple bad reporting explanation. look actual study instead synopsis. would explain concerns, assuming better math writer. don‚Äôt to, think CDC doesn‚Äôt want start treating vaccinated individuals differently fairness. Especially seeing less 50% received yet. recent CDC report said mRNA vaccines cut transmission least 90% think. course guys paranoid/extra careful still quarantine it‚Äôs necessary. considering elections 4 years long time people forget this. Pfizer's vaccine effective known variants. future may emerge variant good protection against, boosters ready plenty extra manufacturing capacity. manufactured place? Could ""bad batches""? That'd first question. american probably even get chance taking AZ vaccine even want to, Pfizer/Moderna/J&amp;J supply great really necessity begin vaccination AZ, still get whichever one available you.  Lol don‚Äôt think read study 

The study P.1 immune evasion. actually look figure 7c, you‚Äôll see neutralization B1.135 several orders magnitude less P.1. correct dosing regiment might help vaccine, still comes short

You *constantly* defending AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine. question maybe work something cannot return normal EVERYONE given vaccine

So, never then.... proven state issued vaccine passport. 

No thanks. mean people still getting sick despite vaccinated? that's sounds like me. Coming symptoms still bad news. I'm guessing test positivity rate approaches 1% deaths 100 less/day. Thanks! I'll sure follow eating/drinking advice. 10AM tomorrow! vaccinated.

Fully vaccinated Pfizer/Moderna vaccines least. hope information J&amp;J's effects transmission comes soon. Data continuously updated accuracy (including timing accuracy definition accuracy)  UK published data 9th March showed 15 cases type clot Pfizer vaccine detected 13 cases using AZ vaccine. Nah understand process *supposed* work society tries follow science. make projections, refine statistical models, make decision. Exclaiming ""we must shutdown vaccine"" acceptable way deciding something, matter level expertise authority.

It actually worked lot better UK last year too. shutdown country experts built statistical model predicting collapse hospital capacity. flawed widely criticized model model nonetheless. Meanwhile world went hardcore lockdown without even trying discuss pros cons scientific fashion. dang thats big drop, bueno Look moderna arm. apparently delayed side effect specifically moderna shot. info let know get second one based reaction. go honestly, got mine 5th march go way today.

I'd wait you, vaccine finally suspended age group, point asign another.

I trust Janssen one, though, course, best ones Pfizier moderna: look US Israel using not... mandatory post pandemic, reduction mask stigma HUGE win public health. I'll wearing one every time ride subway on. great one give second glance so.


The benefit immune compromised incredible. 8.8 Million doses distributed today US Also could afford treatment? Ultrasounds cheap. Let's say group 100 unvaccinated people, 100 vaccinated 1 dose 100 2 doses.

If 10 people unvaccinated group gets infected, statistically 2 one dose group 1 two dose group would get infected.

Of course over-simplication, get idea. future situation? lol? China exports vaccines, russia exports modt vaccines. yet theyre evil empires....curious..... girlfriend fully vaccinated hung 15 minutes outdoors masks on. long CDC recommend quarantine safe get groceries again? yesterday thinking limited political fallout covid handling date.

Not sure details Slovakia case, Brazilian President definitely resign.  reshuffled cabinet yesterday. said bad tone start  I've seen report Mayors various cities appealing directly international help. Specific behaviors:
- Teary eyed cringey Facebook Instagram stories race hate

- using possible platform moralize shame. Example, often church prayers call forgiveness collective guilt racial atrocities unconscious racism made.

- ""unfriend/unfollow immediately support x think x"" 

- ignorance black history/leaders attempting quote seem knowledgeable them. Example:  legit middle aged white woman ""I'm proud liberal type"" kept talking Malcom X debating people group calling us racists, knowing crap actually believed. Malcom X pro racial separation many interviews denouncing white liberals ""foxes"" traitors black rights. Actually pretty based guy. 

Legit optics, moral capital, control them. 12th! There‚Äôs control group study outlines. medical workers didn‚Äôt received vaccine got infected. Like 150+ 1000. wearing masks presume rose name Wtf? 99% 18-50 year olds survive disease. says don‚Äôt care die? Yeesh Could placebo referendum binding. UK chose follow constituents instead EU. Wow, harsh. Trump would us vaccinated 2019 agree likely get weaker immune systems time goes on. already live variety coronavirus yearly colds. don‚Äôt think need vaccinated one future. like said, I‚Äôm expert. It‚Äôs sad see people want lock forever think vaccine miracle cure. everybody know it‚Äôs not. Yup next visits summer told sure covid believe breast feeding found help well (study Israel, think). Happy Birth Day! would consider COVID protocols implemented schools abusive. answer second question, no. Maybe different definitions means ""surge"" I'm looking case death charts Google gives certainly see surge either cases deaths. guess, deaths largely technically preventable doesn‚Äôt mean weren‚Äôt still going good amount deaths, would easy way avoid them. never made sweeping generalizations vaccines. claim 

She said might safe take might effective might end arms Trump rushing due politics. 

In words, can't trust vaccine Trump running election.

I mean quote right there.

Try picture like this. opposite. Biden currently president time Trump, running president, said can't trust Biden therefore can't trust vaccine. Would endorsement vaccine? Would cool?  sure, talking Moderna Pfizer? Thanks.  rate seems increasing group said Wednesday March 1 Tuesday, hospitalizations increased 633% aged 30 39 800% aged 40 49.

I guess we'll see shakes out. really isn't. flu, kills tens thousands every year, basically result trying avoid, 100 years ago. 

People dying thing makes sense cautious possible avoid unnecessary deaths. 

Assumptions helpful. Taking safest stance enough data regarding variants logical move. top that, obviously new variants arise time. 

It make sense celebrate win. J&amp;J far, they've talked initial delays April.

J&amp;J told EU ""under stress"" meet targets. usually targets quarters could imagine supply US first foremost increase EU deliveries later Suppress...as forcibly put end to, prevent dissemination information? one privileged life referring to? think term anti-vax gets thrown around lot, I'm sure lot ""vaccine hesitant"" people covid vaccine classically anti-vax. There's overlap sure, probably much lot people assuming. thik lot people businesses major metropolitan areas, continuing wear masks, social distance enforce covid restrictions wherever possible. may true I‚Äôm still excited fuck Spider-Man way home Dr. Strange 2 UK sell metamizole? considered safe continental Europe. don‚Äôt hear Greeks issues though. think lot people missing. think economic dynamics play reap advantages. happen companies incentivized find qualified workers cheapest cost living locations. People thought 'just number' before, make even worse.

I've already heard one person allowed permanently remote move another state employer said would re-evaluate salary based new location. beautifully done, Israel. Hats off, really well done Reminder: UK given north 20 million people AstraZeneca shot.

MHRA finds increased prevalence CSVT.

I would suggest people look eventual findings previous vaccine side effect scares. dealing kind scale, possible rare coincidences seem causally linked, often not. world didnt end pandemic hit, means PLENTY jobs work home.

Let landlords go bankrupt. Let real estate blow up. corrupt hell frankly, anyone enjoys destroying environment 2 hours traffic garbage food go in. 

if want WFH... LET PEOPLE WFH. 25th March 3.3 million doses given 50 females alone. (5.3m 50 total).

Under 65's account ~13.5m 23.4m doses given. air get you, shedding virus. smart. Death rate 40% could improve learn recognize rare type clotting. links actual reports happening widespread dangerous fashion. Cool cool. 

Conspiracy nuts  even oral birth control, kinda already used odds anyway üôÉ Can't understand injected monkey virus, know attack human body sits sucking thumb cause clots. 31 cases they‚Äôre stopping it?

I guess that‚Äôs one way admit virus isn‚Äôt dangerous 55 people decent amount global population partial immunity covid-19 prior spreading around, due exposure coronaviruses before.

Not exactly, cross reaction proven significant far know ... COVID-19 immunity cross reaction strains obviously stronger effective. he's healthy 37 year old there's good chance offered 50s vaccine. 

Once 50s vaccines population represents 95%+ preventable covid deaths vaccinated.

So yes, kind definition covid less problem time 37 year olds getting vaccinated Hey fun kiddos, movie-going never produce better experience Endgame totally fine never setting foot another theater again. piece reads like political statement. Essentially poll done ‚Äúthe people‚Äôs vaccine alliance.‚Äù It‚Äôs organization set put pressure governments private companies release patents vaccine technology countries make own. 

While agree concept, means creators poll quite biased. Ding ding ding... winner. Middle management wants workers back justify jobs. true. majority NHS AZ vaccine. guarantee reworded comment, you‚Äôd less downvotes. ‚ÄúUpon us‚Äù, ‚Äúevolve‚Äù, ‚Äúsave lives‚Äù. Listen yourself. Also, don‚Äôt equate opinions normalcy opening political affiliation. perpetuating dangerous cycle. good news Biden already said government managed, least Federal level.

The bad news I'm sure courts stop private venues imposing system, especially use magic word: ""liability"". describing isn‚Äôt definition democracy ok.

We also aren‚Äôt democracy! republic rights individuals enshrined founding documents. majority doesn‚Äôt right run roughshod rest.

You actually one idea talking about. 

Democracy nothing ‚Äúcommunal view‚Äù lol. bringing slither good news Europe. endangered species sub. exact. same. boat. rn. mother never anti-vax whatever reason convinced covid vaccines come long term side effects. conversations always end turning arguments I‚Äôve almost given trying convince her. It‚Äôs insane. thinks covid fought holistically, everyone needs build immune systems it. It‚Äôs insane  Honey, philosophy got us insurgence. Well done sounding unhinged. CDC site 65+ section, dont broken state. Maybe state dashboard might vaccination 1st April. CLUE get shouldnt, ever Prisoners live prisons, spend 8 hours day there. closer comparison inpatient behavioral facilities schools grocery stores. CDC ""residents long-term care facilities"" first priority along healthcare workers.

Fair, comorbidities mainly argument many states talking prioritizing incarcerated all. Regardless comorbidity, prisoners likely contract COVID general population due inability socially distance effectively, states trying prevent that. state in? CA, plenty vaccines pharmacies, anyone 16+ type pre-existing condition get appointment. Oh yes they're wrong

\*looks country strict lockdown months music festivals\*

Yep US wrong. It‚Äôs always hot humid - deal it. thought reasons winter months going worse? Yes entire time cvs. needed proof first shot already storing data. support official federal document make places individual systems. Well, force CCS, Cleveland, Akron, school Cincinnati comply.

I don‚Äôt think Columbus ever intention sending middle high school back year finally understood governor meant said would pull funding. sound incrediblely impatient defending impatience. waited year wait months... anything actually locked anymore anyway. essentially wearing mask distancing point.  cant fail society. 

The lock measures upset dont exist anymore really upset about? first shot scheduled afternoon. 

I strongly suspect covid early on, I'm mildly worried side effects I've read side effects much common people who've already it. I'm excited start getting back normal (normal-ish) soon. \*cries canadian\* speak personal experience colleagues got AZ one think stage 3 trials 30,000 people. AZ criticised 65s sample. assuming 12-18,000 women would one 4 chance 1 case. pretty shocking, considering Texas like 46th country percentage population vaccinated. Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia worse. temporarily relocated another state I've received first dose already appointment second dose coming soon I'm looking forward things closer normal Texas year. main problem remaining though kids can't vaccinated yet, opens next biggest game changer. referring specifically poster though. Note: coming survey People's Vaccine alliance, fair unbaised source. want fairer vaccine distribution well good .. mean might inclined try scare people achieve said goal.

I'm frankly tired line one thing call vaccine equal access moral arguments ... trying scare people scientifically shakey arguments it. really, really hope neighbors north get vaccines asap news like brings down.

I hope good news coming U.S. vaccines administered start offering extra doses Canada really soon. 

States like New York, Florida, etc. opening vaccines everyone state next week majority eligible people vaccinated already, hope shortly it‚Äôs generally open people get vaccinated we‚Äôre going point offering extra doses. can't wait till embedded microchips kick get free wifi! Grats! Stop exaggerating. know situation. dramatic making point logically sound. Monke Ah makes sense, thanks much one 100k, isnt basically nothing. Birth control like 1 1000 Texas consistent record hiding/fabricating COVID data, dumping ""corrected"" numbers later. Fool once, shame Texas, fool twice shame me. yet CDC lady crying TV yesterday. Time nothing it. Number participants would argument. armchair epidemiologists full force today Please flag/report story.

The Washington Gazette newspaper health news source. It‚Äôs apparently religious blog - links don‚Äôt work. ones lead articles like \- ‚ÄùHave Made Jesus Lord Savior?‚Äù

I‚Äôd encourage people little critical sources posting, upvoting, commenting. Particularly science health stories. US give poorer countries. Canada afford vaccines, getting delivered later. US' neighbor, best interest help Canada get vaccinated open border. Canada gets vaccines, give back US US donate countries, perhaps Caribbean Latin America. difference: someone‚Äôs abortion, vasectomy, STD hurt me, personally? airborne infectious disease, since share air, businesses want air trustworthy. 

Code shut restaurant worker comes hepatitis. antivax people really think they‚Äôd get live antivax utopia vaccines arrived? Lord... lol... I've worked vaccine clinics administered 12k doses year breathing problems we've encountered panic attacks. People freak hyperventilate. would still recommend waiting 15-30 minutes tho. No, incorrect. EU larger contracts BioNTech (600M) Moderna (460M), also contract EU J&amp;J large AZ contract (300M) Including options Curevac also larger 405M doses. people Turkey actually know BionTech founded German-Turks? would 100 million already covid (if really high number) 95m one dose (which 40m got last 14 days significant immune response), even without overlap would leave 133 million bodies could catch virus. 

As long deaths remain low certainly get lower following weeks everything fine College Students????? Nope. stopped caring crying bureaucrat thinks. Oh yes have, they're saying: Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines highly effective preventing symptomatic asymptomatic infections real-world conditions. Let's hope hell lot people get vaccinated, stat!

We yet.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* yet sounds good, won‚Äôt work They're takin jerbs! They‚Äôre No, that's why. think time stop blaming people. country earth gone back normal. Every country might wanted us seeing tunnel grow long longer. one drama queen people like masks. Comeon, fun everyone person who's allowed complain things. possibly ... double-blind studies confirming it, suspect, \*know\*, sounds like covid real It‚Äôs alarmist language like makes tune officials.

I take pandemic seriously still wear mask everywhere public, kind alarmist language real turnoff. What‚Äôs point hope doom coming?

I‚Äôm blacklisting CDC chief along Ontario‚Äôs public health officials. messages can‚Äôt reach anymore. Wonder raw numbers data We're going end 150 175 million vaccinated another probably 50 70 million natural immunity virus least time Precedent doesn‚Äôt exist modern times. 

Name one medical treatment 8 months efficacy data required take go concerts, go stores, go airplanes, etc. 

Like comment said, vastly different requiring fully approved vaccines well defined efficacy safety data. study 2500 individuals laboratory testing showed vaccine fail B1.135. laboratory testing assessing neutralizing titers B1.135 mRNA vaccines experienced 6-8 fold reduction titers retained neutralizing activity, AZ‚Äôs vaccine experienced 86 fold titer reduction unable neutralize. lines failure aforementioned South African trial. assertions incorrect.

Combine fact AZ vaccine use infused spike notably lower antigenic concentration get pretty clear picture  I‚Äôll answer way answer questions. 
 
Two weeks second dose, fully vaccinated. Period. information. Israel‚Äôs timeline sped kind expect month plateau/increase rather couple weeks Israel‚Äôs, although maybe I‚Äôm forgetting long Israel‚Äôs was. Either way, bound happen. decide open things people comfortable living normally, you‚Äôre going Covid numbers increase. previous massive drop numbers wasn‚Äôt really vaccines, mostly natural immunity. increase something keep eye on, it‚Äôs likely going anything close waves we‚Äôve reach 50% vaccinated we‚Äôll significant enough amount immunity things start dropping bunch. I‚Äôll guy. can‚Äôt wear mask pandemic still going health experts still recommending one? It‚Äôs hard. think it‚Äôs obvious. answer YES, circumstances. information impacts health people. It‚Äôs HIV positive people must disclose sexual contact people go jail required disclose contexts. 

Why think code shuts restaurants someone tests positive hepatitis? maybe you‚Äôre suggesting it‚Äôs ok spread hepatitis too?

Do see line yet? People tell people ‚Äúprivate medical things‚Äù private medical thing *impacts* people. Indeed, great comparison.  envy countries getting better day day. wish country competent yours. Hope guys done extend hands helping us here. think that's way possibly get this. Every study linked shows reduced protection, still enough protection vaccine effective. Thanks proving right. continue living bubble, rest us go back life. lol current progress blowing water, think projections may conservative point? start finishing vaccination effort state-side start sending extra doses. Making people scared nothing public health. I'd argue widespread depression anxiety past year much greater harm. bad idea... It‚Äôs better countries, that‚Äôs sure. However states (both R &amp; D) rocky couple months convoluted tier systems. 

68% seems right depending live study NEJM efficacy SA variant 10% CI -75% 54%. 3% chance better 50% works

That study conclusive all. small study designed look severe outcomes used dosing strategy proven less effective ones currently used. discussions make grateful son school yet. I'm lucky age stay home him, really think would feel helpless unsure keep safe school. specific point redditors want defend WFH lifestyle using pandemic so.

And sure enough almost immediately without prompting, redditor coronavirus subreddit defends WFH lifestyle. nose much? Yep, consider March wave really late 2019 wave continued skyrocketed Spring. understand it, judge raised risk.

I know exactly implemented website almost certainly simply look list pending vaccine invitations, possibly certain health condition flags medical record, maybe recency certain medication prescriptions kind approximate severity index.

Either way pretty clear every adult Asthma eligible yet. really watch tv knowledge, really know getting ideas vaccine. 

She's generally smart, reasonable, analytical type person whose advice trust, messing little. Plus super worried getting sick! eligible vaccinated want to. Except EU making them. private companies fullfilling private orders. 

The UK invested tons research factories. EU didn't. Instead haggled price down. 

The EU fucked trying fuck AZ. 

I'm glad US UK factories soil EU can't steal vaccines like stole Australias etc. Oh, I'm really concerned safety these. still appreciate response. Thank youu. reason? Pfizer-BioNTech definitely one best vaccines. Like, find cool? üòÇ so, why? think political aspects taken consideration? factors want take consideration? worst part there‚Äôs portion populace seems genuinely *like it.* Personally, think time clear roadmaps removing restrictions. understand people don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre yet. still want restrictions gone soon possible, different definitions ‚Äúas possible.‚Äù disagree people, problem them!

Then people really seem like security theater. Maybe they‚Äôve always hated socializing, year given sort sanctimonious joy. Maybe like going rituals better neighbors‚Äîthey get sort pious kick it. people found threads condescendingly asking wearing mask torture say don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs reason mask mandates enough people vaxxed. Relax little, quick jump. 

Your heart thank later Oh, sorry, assumed American spelling, Pfizer stuff half website is. 

The definition Wikipedia exactly meant + social aspects well. exchange, vaccines could developed way easily every country research develop own, example.

Yeah, safe say capitalism incentives companies deliver product quicker better, like idea complete market economy - think intervention state sometimes needed prevent things like market failure. stand corrected. think anyway increase benefit whole planet, including EU. anyone know Vaccine UK using primarily? risks exponentially higher nobody vaccinated. Without incentive, mitigations suggested valid. WSB ""dumb money."" take point. presumes limitless supply vaccine case. still frontline workers, elderly, serious comorbidities can't get vaccine. I'll buy prisons somewhere tier 2, placing prisoners tier 1 people. daily change report include vaccinations administered previous days then? Like whatever past vaccinations happen reported day? so, would expect totals close identical given time? general none things kill 10 people room 14 days later.

Have heard Tuberuclousis Measles? There's reason diseases kill people mass West days.

COVID awful dangerous, yes, please stop downplaying seriousness contagious illnesses. Maybe people would taken COVID seriously TB Measles still huge epidemics here. highest efficacy observed AZ vaccine 81.3%, lower mRNA offerings Novavax‚Äôs shot Let‚Äôs hope. Right numbers aren‚Äôt good. 

If there‚Äôs really large contingent Americans refuse vaccination, could f‚Äôd ways one. apparently does. recent evidence suggests 80% people 65 47% people 65 long term.  that‚Äôs pretty good. Reference:  gave list, I'd pick Pfizer-Biontech sure. real world data Israel pretty compelling. think Sputnik V likely similar efficacy. AZ clearly less good, know much Sinopharm. way I'd pick Sputnik Pfizer care travel Russia Western Europe / USA think may issues there. sense smell likely return normal within month‚Äôs time. Hopefully sooner. vaccine? I'm getting pfizer #2 tomorrow happy get it, looking forward described side effects. CDC backs up. know happening world like America people even bringing ""constitutional rights"" it.. folk UK wear one get it, unless live London they're mostly bunch arseholes anyways.

There's way UK saying straight face. PLENTY pushback people UK wearing masks, wanting rights infringed on, wanting lockdown.

There's reason nation one highest death tolls world. I'm certainly defending situation US, sound little bit unaware much circus show UK been, emphasizes point media mostly focusing drama America. we're pandemic... Yes livelihood important we're globally fighting invisible enemy...it spreads unbelievably fast doubt want family members going getting ill spreading much weaker family members. 60 days so.  6'3"" 220 lbs now. January 230 lbs. Age matters too. close family friend who‚Äôs nurse. picked Covid time last year since fully vaccinated.

She‚Äôs enrolled antibody tracking trail actually tell antibodies caused infection vaccine. Clever stuff.  Sorry making much sense fighting something suspect brain mincing words. 

Thank extra info though. interesting see pans to.  Even obvious absolutely business speaking this. superficial understanding, any. Cases Texas rising. have, worst, plateaued. Numbers show actually slightly dropping. become anti-restrictions downplayers virus sadly.

What makes think they're bots opposed real people? Person 1: Says something dumb.

Person 2: Hey that's dumb.

Person 1: See, proved point! Yeah majority UK doses older individuals. blood issues seem younger people particular young women. US doesn‚Äôt use AZ Thank information graph date likely happen (80% chance likely) due multiple states opening vaccine eligibility sooner anticipated get dose 2 Friday 15th flying San Diego see daughters grand daughter haven‚Äôt seen since Christmas 2019. Honestly media sensationalized talk lot. Seemed like noticing increase cases wanted take moment empathize healthcare workers. She‚Äôs also best public relations clearly. Plus it‚Äôs best conservative type stuff national level percent letting guard change dynamic spread.  Apparently report publically every Jesus confusing hell.

How something go 70% deadly, 'not deadly'? question remains vaccinated individuals contracted symptomatic covid.

That question remain. question answered 95% efficacy.

95 number less 100. Question answered. Everything needs done orderly, keep saying. wait appointments group apparently slow making them, delaying us stockpiling vaccines keeps going up. news got depressed, really. 

What waste vaccines stiff determining eligibility vaccines. Like increasing group age range 5 10 years would bring bigger pool possible appointments. no, let's tiny step tiny step, waiting everyone finally decide make appointment. rush, really. Yeah, maybe try figure hang unknown time. feel way flu shot? strains modified year doubt many think much that. new technology mRNAs, J&amp;J good way go. 

I understand we're 100% sure long-term effects vaccine, still calculation risk. anything could lead COVID, someone else getting COVID, worse. also know long-term effects COVID well. distinguish asymptomatic people false positives? question they're comparing to.

Other vaccines, apparently. least seen similar stats them. Thx think September would drop restrictions ever impose them. It'll hopefully several months vaccine shortages case levels low can't really justified.  Reality suggests unless elderly high risk, covid19 much threat you. One could make case hiding mattress 2024 ignoring reality many people.  getting vaccine punishment now? lol Oh well. That‚Äôs different. That‚Äôs acceptable point. Giving people permission live lives get vaccine incentive vaccinated people, punishing vaccinated.

An incentive get vaccinated means going beyond would normally expected reward vaccinated giving unvaccinated people ""standard"" (2019) treatment. Krispy Kreme giving free donuts vaccinated people punishing unvaccinated people. Ticketmaster allowing admission unvaccinated people concerts punishing vaccinated people. actually part study one site survey amount time near patients/other people, much time spend outside facility around people, often wearing mask/PPE situations, similar info. guessing look people higher risk behaviors see compares well. Wow, that's really amazing ! happy people living track immunity. Hope live (Canada). Isnt Pfizer Moderna working boosters variants? get one vaccines?

Well, no, can't. 60 year olds there's still long time go eligible get vaccinated. punished able get vaccinated? Average cost per dose EU countries was$14. Average cost others: $20. shred evidence this? state information service confirmed preliminary talks took place says Halix never made formal request financial backing officials told support longer needed. 

So Dutch wanted invest, Halix said money needed.  got AZ shot today. Weeeell.... shit. According BMI mental definition people ‚Äúoverweight‚Äù lot heavier actual BMI definition. lot people might pass street wouldn‚Äôt appear overweight technically close overweight. Based upon Bloomberg‚Äôs tracking looks like crossed 50% vaccinated mark around March 10th. Good sign rest us. I'm sure aware person deal dealership one decided price Fuck authoritarian shit. Yes, I‚Äôm going opposite celebrities say, even it‚Äôs good advice. show them! Relax arm muscle much possible. watch needle. 

I even feel injection learned this. results may vary. It‚Äôs upsetting them. It‚Äôs upsetting us. behave differently situation. One way rational. sure world that's ""huge surge"" ""the darkest days entire pandemic"". could sell Austria Putin use money buy vaccines. really to, there's enough supply antivaxxers get virus So, German Chancellor, Merkel charge entire European vaccine rollout? That‚Äôs certainly news Canada advising 20 days nothing worry about. It‚Äôs we‚Äôre shifting using pandemic measures modes social control discipline structure society particular way. It‚Äôs like lizard person Illuminati thing people conspiring, it‚Äôs natural subconscious effect. People already alienated stunted spent year half believing murderer going park going die forgot bleach doorknobs every night. pride parade *looks* like would spread covid, whereas, say, courtrooms white collar offices *look* much safer guy spraying windex everywhere. TLDR, get ready dumbass hygiene theater next decade really concerning. potentially marginally linked developing bleeding disorder. Whereas getting COVID DEFINITELY increases risk bleeding issues. know numbers behind background risk? 

I mean currently talking 100 cases 5million+ 50 women vaccinated EU? (31 threads report, mentions comments know # cases, 3.3m 50 women UK vaccinated, guessing least 1.7m across whole EU, use 3.3m safe).

I trying downplay anything trying understand actual risk values are, much political power playing going numbers lie (unless people reporting do, trust someone somewhere). Thanks. would punish people dont choice people choice selfish live however want?  


Same reason make people vaccinate kids send school. onus people get vaccine get one want fully participate society, going punish people choice matter. literally feels like governments health officials dangling carrot front publics face point ‚ÄúThe funeral industry gouging people ‚Äú. 

That laugh. Neither used car salesmen then. 

It‚Äôs fucking racket. Non shit necessary it‚Äôs probably bad practice. insane statement pretend could like New Zealand several different reasons. never feasible reality. Israel one best (if best) vaccination campaigns world, sitting pretty now. people like done nothing contribute success say 9 months.

You know nothing me, false statement. I've done well beyond could expected Covid. want blame someone, go blame anti-maskers anti-vaxxers. get upset want people able go back work we've reached goal (before goal moved 15 times). That's encouraging. criteria EU ask shut divide Austria‚Äôs share among countries. Austria go Putin cry Sputnik. 

They messed ordering enough, wanting save money. every state decides implement restrictions make hosting concert even worthwhile, Florida could become major stop US tours. Possibly variant? India, media came scary term try keep relevant even though news months ago. wonder ""double mutant"" next. Equivalent 10k cases US. pretty good, like NZ good. Yeah possible, 150k cases among primarily 25 year olds different 150k cases spread amongst older populations. Almost 3/4 seniors already least partially vaccinated they're far majority deaths (over 80%)  solution vaccine passports mandatory vaccines. encouraging people get vaccinate providing incentive resonate people.

Aren't vaccine passports encouraging people get vaccinated providing incentive things they'd want do. Like live events cancelled year, vaccine, go one now? Without passport, incentivize people lie instead get vaccine benefits? think rather content price tag put company card! Well, said, kind moot point anyway I'm Europe 12 vaccines H*rd *mmunity alt-right talking point; please parrot garbage here. anything, half British population antibodies locked extra hard likely engage high-risk social behaviors commit mask infractions, resulting untold deaths hospitalizations. effective fphizer vs johnson johnson? Cases 20% two weeks. Guess couple weeks soon? extremely cautious year, increased 3x 1st dose appointment. gonna risk Congregate living SPREADS COVID. Older population leads deaths. life FL completely different rural parts California ? even different urban parts CA. miss anti mask protests Huntington Beach ?

I agree SF SD ridiculous comparison. SD far lower COVID cases deaths compared SF, rural state, public transit, dense housing, apartment living etc. completely fucked putting COVID restriction killed 2k people. Looks like there's articles permanent heart damage Myocarditis specifically. TL/TR: Numbers bounce throughout next several months. things are. need overthink it.

It would weird see rise cases. fully expect year see numbers resemble ""bounce"" like dropping tennis ball. drop ""thud"" rather bounce bit (though nearly high past), drop, bounce (though nearly high), drop. continue matter anymore. call call bounces ""wave"" like make much sense.

Why bounce? Well numbers drop, people vaccinate, restrictions ease, people resume things again. people catch COVID, need hospitalized, might survive. bounce, numbers less less. going wildly inconsistent. states see ones, others not. Reasons vary well. going much sense figuring out.

Why open? bounce happen either way. needs sort number say's ""we reduce, eliminate restrictions."" Whatever set number to, ease restrictions, see bounce. Eventually bounce insignificant, nobody care.

2021 filled people reacting bounces. nature things. 100% people vaccinated get COVID. possible go hospital it. way nature works. German Chancellor failed secure vaccine supply.

It really simple. Likely driven younger crowd. Israel saw thing happen started mass vaccination. cases fell cliff. speaking. breathing. singing. washing hands shitting (COVID fecal matter).

In January, Indian vaccine manufacturers warned danger blood clotting associated low platelet count vaccination AstraZeneca. 

These deaths could avoided AZ warned instead trying cover up. appears so. Vaccines using feature ""Moderna, Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Novavax"".

Source: I‚Äôve seen similar findings. exciting know end close. can't vaccinated probably going eat pandemic... tolerance vaccinated wear masks summer. None. 2 tiered system, none. 

They already enforce rules. different. Hospitals yearly, employers schools make mandatory certain vaccines, set certain rules can't comply.

This reinventing wheel here.

How long think fully vaccinated 99.9% unable spread covid mask make anti-mask anti-vaccine people feel left out? end May, everyone wants vaccinated USA vaccinated. Exactly. EU still tried hold cheaper deal. something that's like $10. Typical. they'd prefer lockdown forever, that's choice, long travel bans keep forever. I‚Äôm tired hearing parroted script. 

I'm tired people pretending stats facts real. I'm sorry happened kid, anomaly, EXTREME anomaly. haven‚Äôt seen UK? Aren‚Äôt vast majority vaccines AZ? mean ‚Äúvaccine passport system‚Äù would need show vaccine card enter movie theater, concert, restaurant, bar, sports game, basically every non-essential ‚Äúfun‚Äù place. card, entry.

They referring system basically locking unvaccinated fun things, card itself. agree politic point scoring could say...

""Yes rollout gone slowly withdraw main vaccine caused problems, thus causing slow rollout""

And pushed blame elsewhere completely somewhat Maybe also relates BCG vaccine history? BCG vaccine mandatory Germany 1998 (and still much Europe), never mandatory UK. There's already indications cross-immune response BCG vaccination COVID. study linked found number cases wasn‚Äôt higher coincidence based typical number problems arising population given year. AZ numbers strikingly different. it‚Äôs happening certain countries method rollout distribution. every location using Az vaccine. Could also genetic variability risk related age. Someone tell IHME.  still major 3rd wave solid possibility model. Full FDA approval help. advertising push (once supply glut) too. 

Also maybe stick end (vaccine passports, required job, etc). Well ONE virus cause global pandemic lost many lives... right, apples oranges. reddit thread source answers, trouble...Or, probably fishing whatever answer looking for. ever world would ask Reddit what's ethical hang when??? would yahoo Reddit best person ask anything Covid related? kind bizarre read. true might point nanoparticles one ingredients comonality. young healthy woman would better served waiting one vaccines getting Astrazeneca. Health partisan facts

Lower R also means lower long term effects.

Contacting people times necessary probably better anyway failing contact all. Canada country receiving doses scheduled?

""Everyone born London...""
""Everyone 40...""
""Other countries BCG, UK hasn't...""

All bad wrong info. actual BCG info UK, I'm sure 10 minute search would get info sources cared. Sorry rant, people either make clear they're guessing, assuming making opinion writing online. game people medical system starts collapsing like nearly last fall mobile morgues roll in. can't believe people, one year later, still understand covid ""just flu"". shut planet god sakes. necessarily. top priority group, besides long term care homes, ""all 80 years age over, frontline health social care workers"". former obv outside age group, latter disproportionately young female, theoretically risk group CVSTs, according seen countries. halted AZ. Oh, sure equally safe. thinking one like design. first dose Moderna vaccine 20th March side effects all.

But slight rash (not itchy, redness) injection site. delayed reaction common? notify vaccinating clinic it? hand, lot western countries stringent health authorities approved covid-19 vaccines general use including basically europe, australia, China, etc. No, though believe vaccine numbers higher start rolling back restrictions. think way: us operate motor vehicle even though carries risk serious injury death. convenience simply worth risk. car salesperson going lose sleep knowing car sold could someday fatal accident.

However, say manufacturer identifies defect one cars dramatically increases risk accident. good news fix reduce probability fatal accident caused defect 95% expensive. bad news take months get parts technicians trained applying fix. think us would acknowledge selling cars immediately waiting fix would incredibly unethical, even though (and important) acknowledge driving vehicle carries inherent risk choose anyway. Yes AZ's trials lacked sufficient data age groups. data later provided, got recommend age groups. Positive cases used good indicator deaths come realistically it‚Äôs case vulnerable vaccinated process vaccinated. Sure it‚Äôs 13% fully it‚Äôs shown 1 shot pretty damn effective. HERD IMMUNITY well that‚Äôs gonna happen like flip switch clearly data showing decline serious cases whether like Vaccination required either Prime ministers quite quick replace. think resigned - Polish one fucked everything example pretends fine. can't one serious concerns report, feel like done entirely China's terms they're far transparent. Hundreds millions Americans taken heard anything bad outside extremely rare allergic reactions. Could also please explain happening can't really see anyone wearing mask, social distancing going on, back vaccines COVID extremely bad. People chanting 'Freedom'.

I impression 'most folk UK wear one get it'. something like happening big city like Manchester. happened recently several videos similar events past year. don‚Äôt think wait see crowd anti vax. anti vax, wouldn‚Äôt wait see. concede save $6? contract say they'd deprioritized? AZ signed deal UKs govt vaccines made oxford exported. broke point 13.1 contract EU. Yep mostly AZs fault, lol don‚Äôt tell governments nothing this.

So saying mostly AZ fucked everyone signing deal doubt companies idea make deal. hurtle idiotically. Yeah hasn‚Äôt enough clarity messaging people places it‚Äôs much easier get appointment others. Reported already starting get hot Florida old people Michigan. Also, spring breakers go home eventually. do. Great advice! Excited nervousness bit uncomfortable, can't wait this. brain fried weight overwhelming. except took pretty much Dec/Jan become full blown lockdown skeptic. Whilst absolutely correct, think know older demographic won‚Äôt care stick cross Tory candidate next time get chance... interesting reasons why?  would add people *believe* hard make appointment actually not. NC pretty clear who's eligible whole time, still meet people say ""my age bracket open yet."" Ummm... aside fact 65+ second group open (after frontline medical workers), we're age brackets. Almost everyone eligible now, anyone 16+ regardless eligibility make appointment certain events certain counties. see posts like ""I'm grocery store worker I'm eligible!"" (yes, are, since March 3rd) ""I lung cancer eligible June!"" (you eligible since March 17th). It‚Äôs hard really base competency. USA UK got vaccine game point. terrible initial responses caused tremendous amounts death. 

I don‚Äôt think anyone really handled things well all-in-all. Co-signed PA. Pfizer easily. nice. minister prime minister resigns. like, top execute chain. even allowed nationwide crisis? ""yeahno, im out"" thats ok possible? fk me. Yeah, guess leading researchers Paul Ehrlich institute similar institutions across Europe Canada speculating spreading fear. guess would wise actually look data papers published instead spreading fake information. Fair points. MMR far deadly covid. sure vaccines prevent transmission, effective whatever virus variant predominates year now. early force people vaccinate, particularly getting virus also leads strong immunity mild symptoms cases. 1st one city 2nd cvs study compared rates infection schools based distancing requirements regard distancing actually practicable individual setting.

So, take school large classrooms, wide corridors, currently practicing hybrid virtual/in-person learning capacity limits. Impose looser distancing standard, voila! less safe!

Says nothing whether actually maintaining distance safe. that, instruct teachers students maintain distance *no 3 ft* masking measure infection rates. would ethically irresponsible.

This study little ameliorate impression CDC bowing pressure give schools cover open without expensive measures allow 6 ft distancing-- measures schools would never possible 100% normal occupancy. Honestly, anyone either side still feel confident them? seems like everyone know less concerned covid frustrated doom gloom CDC director everyone know concerned covid frustrated rolling back safety guidelines schools, one actually feels like they‚Äôre reliable, trustworthy source point. Annnnnnd is. give source, immediately deny nitpicky reason. goal posts moved...I asked government using GPS track people..


You sent link closed case 2012 government lost, indicating stopped. proof still happening? 

See never reached end zone. Zero reason move goals That‚Äôs good hear considering California got hit hard winter.

Pennsylvania haven‚Äôt even lifted decent amount restrictions yet (I believe it‚Äôs April 4th) we‚Äôre definitely spiking. think it‚Äôs little complicated people want admit. don‚Äôt doubt cases go back Texas Florida (they somewhat already) people seem eager paint picture reason it‚Äôs happening lack precautions doesn‚Äôt seem clear sole driver. Businesses duty obligation protect customers harm. That‚Äôs stairs guardrails, businesses get sued light fixtures fall. 

Further, cities enforce food safety standards public‚Äôs interest get salmonella undercooked chicken hepatitis cook. 

HIV nearly 100% kill rate, don‚Äôt care someone‚Äôs status unless sex people (only *then* becomes crime disclose). 

Do honestly understand airborne disease meaningfully different disease keep yourself?

These norms made civilization large groups possible. don‚Äôt believe me, read people treated disease spreaders throughout history. Vaccine passports civilized way get thing done without violence exile.  Uh, true... go see doctor like ASAP, even it‚Äôs unrelated vaccine. but, would see x amount people wasnt infected vaccine?

Because control group. You‚Äôre referring common source bias study attempting demonstrate causal effect called ‚Äúconfounding.‚Äù always unmeasured variables never control real-world experimental study design. But, group matched controls get vaccinated, I.e., people similar age, occupation, risk factors exposure, etc. make much powerful statement vaccine efficacy. take two groups people population make sure made groups sampled population symmetrically negate effect unmeasured variables groups affected them. one groups gets vaccine doesn‚Äôt, statistically significant difference number people get infected groups, say degree certainty (nothing ever 100% statistics) difference due intervention (I.e., vaccine). Sure, perfectly controlled experiment would put participants room expose virus see ones get sick ones don‚Äôt getting vaccine, highly unethical next best option. reason know people getting exposed prevalence virus community. know people groups got sick, know prevalence high (we pandemic all), realistically say there‚Äôs high likelihood large proportion study groups exposure study period. Perfection enemy good. something like .00044% dying blood clot, newer strains starting take toll 60 set. Germans going regret feeding already strong antivaxxer culture kind FUD. there's contradictory advice. cannot say everyone needs masks, children need mask, social distance, turn around say gather 30+ kids room regular school. not. Vaccine appointments still hard come by. reposted 100x? ended right. tested negative. Thanks reply. Right? make CDC's ""impending doom"" comment? CDC, news network. trying get ratings. completely wrong? nefarious? ulterior motive? totally base? Ahhgg... analyze shit much sometimes. 12 hours fever/chills 3-5 days gastro issues hit you. I'm 5 days gastro issues started today never fever/chills issue. signed get vaccine state. don‚Äôt get told one show up.

With increased transmissibility entirely possible could end well 150,000-200,000 cases day despite vaccinations. UK variant spread easily quickly compared previous variants. actually major overreach government try limit independent businesses.

Your words, mine. discussion nothing disease is, business' right ask medical information, *you* said explicitly government overreach deny right. wonder player fears exposed. Also, lot schools measuring 3 feet center one desk center next, kids really like 2 feet apart. I‚Äôm elementary state (NC) distancing whatsoever required. date got vaccine might recorded somewhere. sinovac 80 90 percent effective. friends gotten shot back living normal lives, even traveling internationally Sorry hear that, friend. I‚Äôm US ‚Äî specifically, Oklahoma ‚Äî I‚Äôm honestly confused we‚Äôre really great really bad... news coming Brazil paints really dire picture what‚Äôs happening there. seems everyone terrified Brazilian variant whether vaccines effective it. forget part lying causing much death.

You get lie, trusted, cause much harm death lie protect critical healthcare workers pandemic. limited Az though. something odd going better safe sorry countries others? Typical American journalism, politically driven hidden racism Asian reports.  Wish they'd calculate aoc us lazy folk :D actual public health officials saying internet edgelords Also India vaccinated 56million ppl Oxford vaccine 20 million among aged 60. one worst death rates per capita world, government slow lock (cheltenham wasnt it?), boris stating he'd shook hands covid patients, giving government contracts friends party donors, nursing home scandal, changing mind constantly despite evidence clear (closing schools etc). say government good job anything except vaccine completely misguided tories almost certainly investigated pandemic behind us. take offense. Question everything. deliver planned wil 2nd taken vaccine EU. Especially delivery schedule Q3 impressive, everyone vaccinated summer EU least vaccinated July August absolute latest. deliver come true. also concentration chemicals blood would first processed liver people would blood clots brain otherwise, cause concern. is. 

I trying spell person responding seem get that. think hospitals would probably get ""good"" hand sanitizer (without benzene) existing supply chain. hastily made hand sanitizer probably distributed retailers apparently different - serious - type clots one caused birth control. fair. searching it, surprised find it. think might chance find cases, actively search now. naive, I'm naive. know exactly would caused. 

It's still lie. lie told reasons state, situation caused systemic mismanagement emergency supplies CDC government large.

You get lie trusted, get burn credibility lying prepared things entrusted prepared longer trusted. see recent history, chose poorly.  might possible work out. look back older reports [NHS website 7/1/21 trust HCW tab co.pare 25/3/21 tab difference numbers would HCW's primarily Az (if could work % Az Vs Pfizer doses given perhaps could get better picture know data public). 

Also bare mind UK 3.3m 50 females vaccinated none reported effects (from read) vaccines also reported similar blood disorders. 

The likely disorder caused Covid vaccines % likely 8 million (29/3.3m)*100 region, assuming reporti g accurate far. 

Or 0.0008%. Novavax still relevant. 

With vaccine supply lagging Q2 2021 good chance get running mid-late Q2. 

They storage benefits vaccines AZ demonstrated pretty good efficacy concerning variants. also suffer potential booster shot problems virus-vector vaccines (where immune response impacted body getting used adenovirus used vector) similar statistic. live rural area I'd say half residents believe real, still. sub's denizens attacked shit others pointing cases, low, still significant concerning. hive almost always wrong side.

Concerning ""we study happened way"", yes, ""let's stop vaccination campaign"" really Well that‚Äôs pretty much attitude everywhere. carrier asymptomatic infected, least understanding Yeah, UK relative got AZ vaccine (especially younger woman) died weird blood clot, would stay quiet? five ten cases, would families friends stay quiet? media would eat stories up. know explanation is, I'm disinclined believe cover up. Yes behind, due lack AZ deliveries going dropping behind original plan. think that‚Äôs good argument US use vaccine however vaccine may option much developing world right Italy, stopped testing 54% one month ago. path 100% everywhere Europe. read ""New cases blood clots""... üòõ fact US half million deaths strongly suggests lab USA. /s

Your comment based racism Asian. Ok, checking. Hopefully forgive suspicious, sub like bound choked b0ts make measure. less states, I'd think. Seriously. see arguments like ‚Äúbut course media never cover this‚Äù comments New York Times articles. would blame government fact people idiots stay home? people focus instead government actually control, vaccine rollout? done amazing job that. Listen, I'm Canadian living UK let tell **nobody** getting vaccinated home. elderly parents. Cases rising from. think need compare UK's response governments around world find generally done quite good job managing crisis.  Sorry, think misunderstood comment. think I‚Äôm biased live Texas, right fine even though government restrictions. places restrictions anymore aren‚Äôt well. also places restrictions worse, better.

When place like Texas data goes lockdown narrative though, people say different reasons like weather. logic places warmer weather low population density open no? city announced yearly festivals starting late July later back. Furthermore, stated make decision festivals early June early July coming weeks. Talk Dr. maybe could get low dose Valium something calm heart ‚Äúonly 90%‚Äù sadly agree. Rather get Covid rare brain blood disorder would purely solidarity. position would definitely change healthy underlaying issues. Honestly, personal view well.

If can't bothered protect yourself, sacrifice protect you? addition, order accelerate number first vaccinations Germany, Standing Vaccination Commission recommends extending interval vaccinations second dose Biontech three weeks Moderna four weeks six weeks. 

This important development too, positive one change. That‚Äôs really worry most. Without FDA approval use 65 year olds EU impact could huge third world. really know why, suspect think they'll meet targets given AZ treated missed targets probably thinks better avoid EU they're confident.

This less commission guy said articles it. Nova blamed problems supply chains might EU wanted doses made inside EU itself, Nova small plant can't produce enough cover order. Setting new supply chain right seems impossible. 

I'd like see contract myself, purely curiosity. company profit, particular vaccine made cost pandemic ends.

They also legal right say pandemic end July 2021 matter health directors say. state in? There‚Äôs way example, Texas would implement new lockdown order! One groups done 16-65 year olds health conditions, big enough sample size see effect cohort. think definition application ‚Äúpassport‚Äù important. Vaccination requirements things like sports, school, employment front line healthcare workers, air travel sounds reasonable me. it‚Äôs required free movement day day life, for, say, within state travel, I‚Äôm think people would agree. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unreasonable concerned government won‚Äôt overstep bounds lenient system put place acting stupid? Congratulations linked noted even SARS-CoV-2 circulating China fall 2019, researchers‚Äô model suggests low levels least December that, it‚Äôs hard reconcile low levels virus China claims infections Europe U.S. time,‚Äù Wertheim said. ‚ÄúI quite skeptical claims COVID-19 outside China time.‚Äù places people still (somewhat) follow mask rules stores public transport. 

Everything open, bars, restaurants, nightclubs, gyms, concerts etc completely packed mask sight like month now.  
Source: I'm Israeli I'm generally ""just cool couple weeks"" camp, understand argument anything anyone would impact 4th.

Even people went completely nuts European-style 3rd surge (to extent that's even possible current number people previously infected/vaccinated), impact 4th?

By end May, everyone wants vaccinated numbers collapse matter do.

Definitely going wear planes and, go city, subway. also got large vaccine producer states help too. would assume help immensely I‚Äôve got Uncle body What‚Äôs lack positive data Janssen vaccine? received recently option it‚Äôs little worrying headlines gets many might get delivered whatever country ‚Äúquick easy‚Äù is.  I, one, never want see somebody coughing sneezing freely enclosed cabin airplane.

Masking sick around lots people feels obvious understand social protocol before. fucking HATE colds. accepted spreading germs freely know we're sick? Since hospitalizations deaths also states, would go ahead call fourth wave.  going big waves came it, since previous wave basically 120 ft surfer killer, anything less going viewed big deal since clearly numb comes 1,000 people day dying virus need die from.  body even mentioned diseases. argument aboutism Woops, responded wrong comment  No, odd. one think happen dam breaks? water rushes out, naturally. Whitmer closed Michigan November February. Keep people inside, gaining weight, getting vitamin deficient, depressed, destroy immune systems. things open, people rush out. Idk people making comments like ever get it.  /u/ChulaK 

I think Got tested antibodies today, think I‚Äôm going hold getting vaccine couple months since I‚Äôm still rocking antibodies  healthcare workers got AZ.
Source- healthcare worker surrounded healthcare workers. [They already Well yes meant relation she‚Äôs saying 

And agree she‚Äôs saying, strongly disagree phrasing kind song dance routine. want hear say US doesn‚Äôt X lots people die, (insert projection). That‚Äôs it. Blunt statements quite effective Meh... Given data would advise someone got J&amp;J stay inside forever? got 80 percent protection (more J&amp;J) 2 weeks 1st dose Pfizer. 80 percent enough low risk people resume normal life. 90 percent protection day second shot. fine wait 2 weeks insist 95 percent one feel good 80-90 percent protection. data came yesterday indicates 80% 14 days. that's good enough people, especially covid at-risk. Rain, shine, snow. ^/s Novavax approved sometime late-April/early-May, Canada strong deal Pfizer, stronger.

This month going suck Canada third wave hits, beginning end new vaccine procurements. Humans become really good finding origins viruses. tracked AIDS virus back patient zero central Africa 1930‚Äôs. order track virus find Patient Zero, need data. 

China withholding data case. Now, withholding data admission negligence. means Chinese government legitimately believes could negligent releasing virus. Combine fact facts eloquently highlighted above, reasonable explanation origin pandemic negligently escaped Chinese lab Wuhan. Could origin zoonotic? Sure, evidence suggests laboratory negligence likely cause. I'm sure rules change (for better) anyway. Eventually conversation going protecting people gotten vaccine infection. think people want wear mask idiots read filled syringes poison. opportunity everyone get vaccine, whatever happens people refused decision, rest us deal consequences decision. like incubators. portion population vulnerable reservoir next vaccinated population bad recipe. We'll wait see who's right. trend looks worrisome guess, it‚Äôs not. Cases going young people aren‚Äôt risk cases go seniors front line workers. Rising cases produce horrific hospitalization numbers like past. Vaccines work seniors them. New Zealand done. ended getting covid emergency room got vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

was wierd. kind regret getting shot. sure point still got sick. im told need booster coming fall guess im unlucky 5% doesnt work.

&amp;#x200B;

probably gonna bother follow vaccines. literally got covid almost died Cases spiking Texas well. spike surge yet, trend clearly there. idea linked that. None text report anything whether vaccinated individuals still spread virus unvaccinated people. entirety report efficacy vaccines preventing infection vaccinated parties.   clear, would never argue are. fact, personal stance remain online essential workers vaccinated. could easily waited turn. 

My amusement ‚Äúgrocery store worker‚Äù argument comes every article involving teacher vaccinations last two months. It‚Äôs also debatable whether make comment really care grocery store workers children. It‚Äôs way score cheap political points public schools unions  Researchers claim chose Florida specifically rush get back normal. state officials urging state go back work spite raging pandemic, figured (correctly) would find official numbers well whack reality. 

Seems like went looking something want to, usually find anything confirm beliefs Testing post symptom onset reliable. symptomatic COVID would unlikely they're symptom free days. isn‚Äôt said before. serious talk vaccinating Ireland vaccine uk. significant minority still believes Covid-19 conspiracy. vaccine roll-out nefarious matter successful may be. We're bad vaccinations Oklahoma. currently tied 17th country 30.5% population least one dose (according latest CDC data). case rate fallen pretty far test positivity rate 2-3% past weeks. horrible spot 2-3 months ago certainly looking much better right really hope keep vaccianation rate fend variants more. exactly many people need vaccinated possible. Yea objective great try it. future bleak many moments pandemic things point reduction deaths followed return normal life coming weeks. Can't disagree points. can't help feel outcome could different though. feel government handled things well then? girlfriend first dose AZ 4 days ago.I fuming,I trusted science,I finallly peace knowing safe.
But no,I can't even moment relief,I must stay concerned every moment cursed year.We happy past 4 days ""We it!We safer!"".Now fear side effect stays us(for next 20 days,i guess)
I wanted glimmer hope life...I tired. lie lost election handled covid. enough time adults underlying conditions get vaccinated Arkansas. Young people Arkansas aren‚Äôt yet eligible vaccination.  Haha, nope! Thank though. read lot able get appointments lot friends, family strangers. you‚Äôre able get something soon, let know I‚Äôll happy help. Yea i've wondering myself... like setting super cold line? Guess we'll find out... First, thank caring enough tested first place. eases everyone's minds, could ask second one. OMG I'm surprised! could happen? realllllly wish people would stop comparing flu. It‚Äôs way worse flu. hurts argument.

That said, think differ less believe. agree, wait couple months things less normalize. concern isn‚Äôt people refuse, it‚Äôs people haven‚Äôt vaccinated yet want get vaccinated, still lot. Mike DeWine amazing job thanks gets party betraying üöÄüíâWe like shotüíâüöÄ actually bit more. going 1-dose strategy first. position every eligible willing adult done first dose late May evert adult done 2 doses early July.

We also expecting J&amp;J, besides vague ""end April"" little information. point is, vaccinate fast avoid what's happening Europe.  First doses important. We're still pretty far behind UK terms first doses looks like barely ahead 4th wave right now. paying makes alright? Glad set standards it‚Äôs alright... appear adjusted population. Also important remember 65+ age group 37 million 10 years ago, today 60 million. Mortality absolutely continue trend next several decades due aging population.  UN predicted Profiles/United States America.pdf 34 cases 1.8M vaccinated people 1 case 53000 people (or 2 per 100000), entire period December now. comparison, daily case rate throughout Ohio ranges 5 20 per 100000, that's *every day*. 

With numbers like that, clear vaccines work *highly* effective. I'm sorry hear that. One former clinical instructors taught clinical rotations died covid week last week. late 30s, real prior health conditions. one ones elect get jab understand. Fell sick Friday, positive Saturday, hospital Monday, dead Thursday. 

Sucks much. sick people think cold young gives magical immunity super powers. I've lost track number young adults tears cannot catch breath sitting down. Tears regret everyone else family land hospital. I‚Äôm visiting Osage beach wears mask here! It‚Äôs frustrating UK started off-shoring manufacturing since 1970s. seem think better let people work live financial capitalism. ...roughly 45% Americans would‚Äôve died? risks rival % getting ill covid it‚Äôs good question. variant that‚Äôs currently UK... zero deaths London recently thanks vaccination efforts? Tell logic applies people dying droves virus listed natural causes...anyone make anything want. Someone lying, people making youtube videos ton highly educated scientists medical professionals? Astra zeneca vaccine suppose protect newer covid strains designed main strain? Proceeding caution comes vaccine causes blood clots ""antivaxxer culture"". weighed pros cons decided take different vaccine, already mentioned antivaxxer. still haven‚Äôt answered primary question. get minority people didn‚Äôt want get vaccines agree wearing mask people wearing one? enforce that? Yes, changed include ages. happened banned completely. happened days allowed again, less 2 weeks ago. God knows happen already one shot (about 2.7 million people far, sure age group distribution). mess... US exceptional failing response, backtracking spending trillions expensive solution. case, failure locking down, solution injecting stock market trillions, trillions stimulus people companies, even companies. solution also includes getting shitload vaccines, quite good surprisingly. Sure, mean still big effort thats gone border staff - still freight going out, citizens returning, essential workers coming etc isolated undeniably benefits. I'm simply replying comment say experience NZ within NZ especially outside city Auckland life pretty much close normal. cares. majority people actually risk vaccinated, there's really ""line jumping"" point. fully vaccinated, go get life going again! 

I've extremely cautious since mid-March last year, getting second Pfizer dose April 14. April 22, I'm getting hair done first time since February 2020, end month, we're flying visit family. time. Exactly. Yellow fever go africa. 

Covid go Walmart. satire right...right? agree that. likely COVID actually roughly comparable slightly worse flu kids (rather substantially less dangerous present numbers show) based lack person schools Oh definitely will. still plan wearing kn95s whenever I'm foreseeable future weird sort anecdotal insight particular topic maybe lead theory. 

There 36 companies measurable Medicare Advantage enrollment state Florida. Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan 10th highest enrollment. sound strange actually offer plans state Florida. employee group retirement plans offered Unions (I believe).

I think retired people houses Michigan Florida could driving spike along spring breakers. would Florida chilling winter starting move back time. Similar different situation Spring Breakers. you‚Äôre tired get internet stop following news minute minute. Check day see what‚Äôs going on, don‚Äôt let main focus life. empathize you. severe allergic reaction last vaccine had. Hives head toe along 104 degree fever shortness breath. sucked. 

I first Pfizer jab Easter Sunday. I‚Äôm scared shitless I‚Äôm going react, needs done nonetheless. 

We this, dude. I‚Äôll thinking you.  FFS. They, Austria, made bed purchasing 60% allotted Biontech doses regrets acts like small child. sure. PR play - it‚Äôs national Pharmaceutical Regulators advising. Heck, political campaign Germany ignore PEI go it, minister health got lot flak stopping days. whole statements makes little sense. issues political aren‚Äôt used politics - least EU. advisory schools directly contradicts everything they've said far. said gather large number people unvaccinated, social distance 6 feet possible, try use strong ventilation possible, etc.

But going turn around say person learning fine even 3 feet, long masks worn. Despite fact anyone works education knows poor ventilation systems schools, there's surveillance testing done population thus far know mostly spreads asymptomatic transmission.

Teachers pissed vaccinated yet. vaccinated, excuses. though, well within rights question CDC since completely contradictory saying. want 30+ kids room vectors asymptomatic transmission (especially older secondary age students), tell everyone else gather indoor dine even vaccinated. Come on. right, wrong way. linear, correctly point out. herd immunity emerges specific percentage population immune - there's thing half herd immunity. 

Is better one country reached herd immunity one hasn't, two countries reached herd immunity? haven‚Äôt got doses AstraZeneca  pandemic, things change maybe better!
