look past, cloth masks used

use common sense, maybe cloth masks 100% effective someting helps something anyone make recall correctly... Trump pressured China accepting flights US threats blocking flights China. scientific publication going fight pseudoscience pseudoscience? Seems like terrible idea. Appears working great people acting like understand concept? one sentence, context, used imply numbers testing up. people get fixated one line like this, makes supporters think WE'RE stupid getting overall concept. Meanwhile, plenty ridiculous stuff upset about, like claim tests somehow ""bigger better"" that's numbers vs countries. false. Pretending he's stupid object permance takes away reality malicious, willful, dangerous liar. guy manages dumb week week. Warning wear masks mean. oh god we‚Äôre doomed Ya actually makes point us, thank participating here's trophy üèÜ Im sure inner thoughts must disturbing AF. hope are...I doubt hes one bit happy...however, end like leader bunker, wouldnt lose sleep, Id push national holiday. I'll take bet. Remindme! 01/19/2021 ""Hope saved $5"" Less confirmed cases. virus still prevalent, amount confirmed cases country technically lower. stand show chappelle houston 2018. basically said same.

They post-set audience questions pair though, awesome. Vs current president. Would rather trump? think trump disagrees pence anything? 

\*lair they're critically ill go doctors, go hospitals everyone else. large numbers... No, he‚Äôs idiot made useless comment absolutely benefit. great President üí© truly care what's best U.S. fellow citizens.

Over 100k dead span months unprecedented lockdowns occurring. Considering ready vaccinate virus, achieved big breakthroughs therapy, think going happen de-prioritize testing open things back up?

Don't misunderstand me. I'm excited bad, great, far over. think people realize that. wear masks planes forever. Also let's forever wear masks subway crowded places. good COVID, also good flu common cold really cost you?

Yeah, take temporarily need eat drink. better wear 90% time rather 0% time. I've sadly never Same...  ""President Pence"" something terrifying think about. That's absolutely insane. state this? think differences though. Trump actively antagonistic several elite circles, whereas Bush Wall Street heavily embedded within elite frameworks. Tough say whether result anything think might difference there. think really wanted in? mean he's wanted long time refunds win election. Melania stone colds him, Half Boyz like Flynn (if u know mean comrade), wanted set REAL Boyz sweet talk radio media legacy biz. mean sure wants KEEP it. wouldn't. yet statement still indefensible. yes, mass gatherings -- especially tear gas yelling -- worst possible place coronavirus spread, banned longest countries still allowed Europe Japan. 

so, mass gatherings yelling tear gas -- masks -- cause spike, likely people standing line quietly Starbucks would. 

more likely something else, understand. news spinning it. every single left wing news site spun way. completely omitted context quote. saying we're testing rest world course cases. countries underreporting numbers gotten much testing done. 

And know what? watch actual speech find out. Looking dozen articles, none sentence quote. seemed little fishy me. find source material find actual truth. guys didnt look you? lapped confirmed bias it? 

I'm honestly surprised blatant propaganda like legal. legit said testing good Dumb day Kinda energy ""If can't see it, can't see me"" sad realistic representation wage gap America. And? see Toad Wet Sprocket cover band stop testing software, bugs it! think before?  Nobody understanding sarcasm claim totally understood. done pivoted. There's comments highly upvoted specifically say understand test still there. completely understand this. know understand this. denying that's sensationalism working. We've also like 4x usual number deaths pneumonia year. 35% Americans cannot read lines. stop testing much look better statistically? 
 
Didn't say this, anything say implied thought this. pay better attention calling people idiots. close eyes won‚Äôt see traffic heading towards move across crosswalk? annoying retarded

oh im sorry y'all forgot last 50 years watching nasty diseases come nowhere, particularly respiratory diseases know minimize spread of

POTUS would like word. guarantee told somebody team office, whereupon news went around whole office, somebody called reporter.

Unless told team doctor, investigation pretty short. American Airlines flight (essential travel‚Ä¶) completely full enforcement masks.

What‚Äôs point even saying that? 

Since nobody read context 280 character tweet reason, literally says directly after: ""Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have."" direct reason: probably gets blamed rising numbers whether due better testing worse spread. Don‚Äôt remind  wife works covid doctor said came back ER said lady walked struggling breathe passed died right front him. shit joke it‚Äôs sad people think it‚Äôs big deal slow/stop testing we'll less cases? said sky never fall, chicken little run around. stereotyped perception nowhere near accurate. see individuals mainstream media every day making comments dangerous protesting terms covid.

Also, insult unarmed man murdered street disgusting. want make fun death? Let kneel neck 8mins. literally cannot grasp concept underlying reality. It‚Äôs optics him.  still 0$ 401k putting HS/college.
With 1% match could've good amount now.
Guess knew never heard 401k. Here's question... takes Beijing long test 8,000 people, yet Wuhan tested 10,000,000 10 days? quick maths, 10,000,000 10 days means 1,000,000 day, 42,000 hour, 700 per minute... somehow taken Beijing 4 days 8,000... need insulin u stop eating high GI foods? wrong type diabetes? 4 days away able eliminate COVID-19 ugh. say sucks understatement.

Get real. hilarious one.  That's related everyone jeering about, aware of. Nobody saying ""hm that's reasonable statement given per capita rate testing"". They're saying ""LOLLLL THINKS DONT TEST POSITIVE ARENT SICK LMAOOO"" Yeah, there's dozen prosecutors NY plans get famous win higher office prosecuting Trump businesses. know people even reply dudes like you.

Also total prescription costs certain amount stipend even tax return. 

People would say still pay quite bit money even though UHC, chose get better insured private company. job pays UHC it‚Äôs completely free. visit psychiatrist also costs less 40$. 

Japan first world country equal quality health care United States yet base cost like way cheaper. Health care doesn‚Äôt need expensive decent quality needs fundamentally different. POTUS actually child. fucking child apparent leader United States. Jfc...  fair, article kinda takes said context. He‚Äôs still idiot million reasons. 

He‚Äôs trying justify spike cases recently increase testing, implying countries lesser testing capacity higher unknown case counts. 

He‚Äôs still way off, countries still testing higher rate are. 

But least beer bar now! /s glad live life assuming everyone world 'potential covid spreader', sounds like really anxious sad way live Long-term diffuse organ cardiovascular damage greatest concern.   former friend borrowed money promise pay back never did. always excuse couldn‚Äôt. money, would spend shit didn‚Äôt need instead.

My family several. It‚Äôs 5 months. I‚Äôm done. ""This one's me."" Fuck that‚Äôs saying exactly? Listen carefully. Every time say anything remotely like said, bot sends nasty post saying post deleted political. cannot say said. guess free speech allowed even directly relates coronavirus. Or, free speech rights given certain people. one posts removed 2 days ago, going spend time debate agree post removed. Bye! Thank you. live area restaurants closed south Scottsdale packed night clubs. I‚Äôm leaving home 2021. Lol! This. don‚Äôt understand either. That‚Äôs bothers most. could possibly take persona mistake intelligent? thought process must follow? *Is* thought process? testing better Good, good. wants go away Highest point curve... nice. Keepin üíØ Right? ca almost protesters wearing masks.  I‚Äôll always sort controversial something seems unrealistic true. 

Come reddit, fuck Trump everything, come many us lost lose loved one over. hope folks give space grieve, whether agree disagree politics. ""Jesus christ food bourne! ""  also pisses people bitching numbers high. ""Covid killed didn`t already Chron's Disease!"" sure?

US - ‚ÄòChina, release real numbers deaths‚Äô

China - ‚Äòfine‚Äô

Article - China revised Wuhan deaths 50% pressure US Weird places reopened safely dropped cases without vaccine. It‚Äôs almost like handled right beginning helped shorten time businesses remained closed. surprise taking seriously acting quickly would produce result. total surprise.  one says that. think even Trump says that. ""Make America Great Again"" clearly implies things suck here. stopped questioning Trump said stupid shit everything comes mouth stupid shit stupid shit lie.
I'd question ever manages say anything remotely reasonable doubt he'll ever do. stopped bombing would fewer wars any. also costs shitton money develop medication, lot even make market costs need covered well. Hundreds millions billions dollars spent develop single medication go required testing try make sure kill you.

They probably could recoup development costs bit lower price, though. Regardless argument trying make, reads like wondering stroke did. open bills come mail, debt free! That‚Äôs WH play along. point fully mitigating risk, especially youre congregating large numbers people small area. Even masks on, environment like still hotbed virus transmission.

I support idea behind protests, truth is, may indirectly contributed thousands deaths extension lockdown. Oh, disconnected LED... proper legit way really say this? says lot batshit things recording proof partly blame fact people love jump statements soon possible, showing negative idiotic way view it. doesnt take much understand way meant it. Obviously everyone would like believe smart enough know less testing bad thing, feel like internally know meant US testing frequently reporting accurately places like China results higher numbers. need convince fiance move New Zealand. Jesus Fucking H Christ Laughs marketing  news, close eyes, can‚Äôt see. Or, makes realize people arent payed enough That‚Äôs nothing, cured cancer blacking word ‚Äúcancer‚Äù dictionary Sharpie. You‚Äôre welcome!

Yes, word salad. Yes, phrasing (""downside"") seems conflate actual cases observed cases bizarre. yes, claim US best testing world true... 

But headline misleading. clickbait. know still reddit's site wide rules dunno. Maybe improve things. NYT article made pretty clear NY mostly incompetence overregulation hubris. r/technicallythetruth isn't, like that. Always like sold large sums masks held recommending homemade ones job security. guess citizens. hope completely isolated 100 percent westerners Indian threads sound like racists  get serious moment posture insane seemingly unexplainable mental illnesses actually suffering frontotemporal dimentia. meets every criteria symptoms extremely pronounced recently especially posture behavior. literally every symptom.

I've saying since 2016 Trump sick old man mental health issues related age people surround took advantage of. They're pulling full weekend Bernies situation like Reagan even remember entire second term say shit would make America look weak shit.

Trump step November due age related mental degradation evil cronies say actually good guys trying keep America running mentally checked out, media discuss mental health weeks Trump gets ride sunset victim. Mark words. Without comparing contrasting kind, admit living fucking disaster.  Poopoo peepee. Poopoo peepee!!!!


Yo spikes cases protests? It‚Äôs three weeks. said would spike cases county, cases up, testing down. Go figure. thought joke funny. guy leader land. How. dumb follow guy. Jfc... wrong. CDC stated masks effective preventing spread disease general public. don‚Äôt want go plane moron next isn‚Äôt wearing mask. Way go, Arizona Trash Bags! related article above, genius Highly likely Ya takeaway well. can't stand much anyone else, actually context. clearly saying testing would reporting cases, one would infected. What. The. Literal. Fuck...?? That's country lol, India. Especially state that, Telangana. Americans conceited enough assume ""default"" country USA. Even post reddit specifies looking EU recommendations countries regions always US centric responses people read through. open nz citizens odd border exemption. Yup good call! simple, werent simply enough masks. tell people, dont buy need doctors, people buy more. logic. corrected ramped mask production atleast post videos make one piece cloth. Something better nothing. didnt even that. countries it. context. literally said words quoted I've read said around them, better. He's trying paint pandemic somehow better US data tells us, know that's wrong. work data. US well key metrics, horrifically one matters: number cases per day rising dramatically places initially hotspots overall decline cases per day US STOPPED.

We reversing wins letting losses fester. exact opposite leadership. experience, no. stop listening news, would nothing bad happening! Americans conceited enough assume ""default"" country USA. Even post reddit specifies looking EU recommendations countries regions always US centric responses people read through. That‚Äôs kind thinking. I‚Äôm Minnesota.

Somehow, can't handle money!

- George Carlin never stopped working received 1200$. Straight BS. Anyone close contact public front line worker/essential employee. German government always listened experts pandemic. Still didn‚Äôt answer Q consider young again, doesn‚Äôt mean people numbers unnecessarily died never even first place. get it, it‚Äôs much bigger threat elderly population well underlying medical conditions virtually every sickness imagine. Go ahead show something kills younger population higher rate age brackets mentioned. 

That doesn‚Äôt mean ignore go like nothing‚Äôs wrong there‚Äôs 0 threat younger brackets. Death permanent, there‚Äôs coming back way many already died unnecessarily throughout brackets. Beijing screened total 200,000 people associated Xinfaodi agricultural market 72 hours.

76,499 people tested June 15, 59 positive results.  Half US thinks hoax. I've seen several countries large gatherings too. wrong many health code violations think break applied home cooking?


Not nothing, understand comparison absolutely ridiculous, right? like asking many speeding tickets would get applied Mario Kart stats.

Public vs private use. I'm generally fan software developed Germany

Translation: SAP office software complicated. Dude said stop testing would less cases. Problem solved!  ""The government playing high stake game. crisis, see come top world death toll higher neighboring countries ones around world.

**Then judgement come. gave support guilty/accessory**.""

Context: thinks government killing people strategy everyone supports government judged/are guilty it.

It's interesting note never first wave second wave China, internal statement ""the national epidemic prevention control become normalized.""

&amp;#x200B;

China uses stages.

(i) Phase I: Responding outbreaks (27 December 2019 19 January 2020)

(ii) Phase II: Initial containment epidemic (20 January-20 February)

(iii) Phase III: Gradual reduction indigenous new cases single digits (21 February 17 March)

(iv) Phase IV: Achieving decisive results defensive battles Wuhan Hubei (18 March 28 April)

(v) Phase V: Normalization national epidemic control (since 29 April).  Ah fair enough 

Deceptive saliva   accurate. Asymptomatic patients show lung abnormalities (ground glass opacities). translate lung damage. Yet people sub spreading misinformation feed hysteria agree you. think good concerned privacy/data, using Facebook Instagram regular complaining getting data stolen idiotic.

I've got stack research need read, arbitrary forum rules exactly priority pandemic. 5x-10x deadlier flu depending age. technically closer, still puts c19 3.25x-6.5x deadlier flu. think life needs go on, needs cautiously - masks, limiting trips, mass events, etc. numbers still nothing sneeze (pun intended.)

Also, we're seeing nasty long term effects c19 simply present nastiest flu cases present nasty c19 cases. good Depends seeing.

This isn‚Äôt surprising really concerning. happens pneumonia bad cases flu. data THL, Ylitornio, Kolari, Kittil√§, municipalities close border Sweden, infection rates higher Helsinki region

Not exactly ""half third"", that's almost misleading edited title saying ""cuts death rates significantly"". wish people would read articles quit relying misleading and/or edited titles accurate. People realize science behind natural immunity applies vaccine-based immunity right? 

If catching virus provides years immunity, vaccine raise antibodies amount time (or less) without booster. mean didn‚Äôt get sick protest. However, certainly contagious others probably did.

A milestone celebrated cake Hvidovre Hospital. chief physician thinks epidemic come again, strength peaked.

#Machine translation 

F three months ago, closed Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen much country down, woke new reality empty streets, buses jobs epidemic new, dreaded viral disease taking hold Denmark soon hospitals.

Hvidovre Hospital affected hospital terms number inpatients covid-19. 519 patients, hospital forefront Capital Region throughout Denmark. accounts one-fifth country hospitalized corona patients.

But Thursday, mouths staff management turned intensive care. sickest put respirator avoid death. department celebrated anniversary mazarine cake table single corona patient hospitalized. first time since first patient arrived March 6 put mechanical breathing. last one disconnected respirator breathing even another hospital closer residence.

""It's huge milestone us,"" says Claus Lund, senior consultant anesthesia intensive care unit Hvidovre Hospital.

With location Copenhagen Vestegn, hospital right middle could called epicenter corona epidemic Denmark. least area, largest proportion citizens tested positive covid-19. According latest figures Statens Serum Institut, western municipalities Ish√∏j, Glostrup, Vallensb√¶k, Br√∏ndby, Hvidovre Albertslund snatch top six places among country's 98 municipalities ranking number corona infected per 100,000 inhabitants.

The policy visited Hvidovre Hospital late April wrote report five chapters corona epidemic inside - especially intensive care unit.

You find series link .

They felt intensive, says Claus Lund. worst period late March early April. Almost beds intensive care occupied covid patients, department use new sections prepare even more.

'There strange mood. one hand, doubted could go wrong. hand, act heading red curve. difficult water sail around in. belong time believe would missing respirators. qualified staff bottleneck. cannot put every effort care patients respirator. task specialists, ""says Claus Lund, doubt would happened Denmark hit red curve green:

""We would Italian conditions health care system broken down.""

Early epidemic, Hvidovre Hospital given key role Capital Region designated kind corona hospital. First, patients hospital's large infectious medicine department, poorest intensive. Since then, several wards hospital transformed pure corona wards investigate treat patients covid-19 disease suspect this.

‚ÄúWe form corona center region maintained emergency preparedness longer hospitals, sending nurses borrowed back regular wards. That's good them. made huge changes staff past three months, ‚Äùsays Claus Lund.

  drawn huge bills staff

  

The staff deserves extent mazarine cake, believes. get used changing messages management, schedules changed one moment next, well huge workload. management never able answer obvious question: stop? Still, staff itching showing department change quickly - without ""bureaucracy hell hell"" usually comes along, says Claus Lund.

‚ÄúNow take care put it, many usually send mails rest management call us meetings sent home. got strikingly emails yet worked. thought-provoking impressive, ‚Äùsays senior consultant.

In March, one first intensive care physicians speak experience disease, new unknown time. developed wildly unpredictably, worst patients respirators, surprisingly hard get again, heard Claus Lund interview Politiken, statements time confirmed, step even patients come intensive, says today. patients respirator month half either dying surviving.

‚ÄúIt disease behaves strangely differently used to. patients get significantly better day suddenly fall die, ‚Äùhe says.

There debate whether good idea put patients covid-19 respirator, many end dying long futile course sleep. man stood hands soup dinner, debate peculiar.

‚ÄúWith us Hvidovre, case respirator absolute last resort. say clearly covid-19 patients respirator, would died entered respirator. take options exhausted. Then, course, discuss whether patients chance high risk dying, whether stop treatment let die. course, think try save saved, clear requires lot resources, ‚Äùsays Claus Lund.


Around 40 covid patients respirator Hvidovre Hospital's intensive care unit epidemic. Almost half discharged department alive, claims Claus Lund. month ago, article media revealed four five intensive care patients ward died, time finding still patients admitted spoken to. made death rate skew patients managed get respirator alive.

‚ÄúBut clear covid patient aged 65 older, chronic illnesses get respirator, very, little chance surviving. see numbers. ancients rarely survive. contrast, younger ones - way 20s - long verge dying, survived. breathe overall survival, ‚Äùsays senior physician.

Is corona finished chapter? No, Claus Lund answers resolutely. imagine that. Viruses there. infection lurking come back later, expects. time, points effective limiting physical contact others, population hand washing tapering helped curb infection.

‚ÄúDenmark become wiser, taking knowledge us. Therefore, expect wave strength one hit around April 1st. imagine schools closed again. apparently effective tool, hope schools institutions stick increased hygiene, help keep cold flu down, fewer people become seriously ill die respiratory disorders, ‚Äùhe says. .

At time writing, 63 patients admitted covid-19 nationwide. 14 intensive 7 respirators. Claus Lund hide fact enjoying cake time up. time, intensive care unit may receive next covid patient respirator.

‚ÄúWe still hospital. Intensive covid-free now, maybe tomorrow, ‚Äùhe notes. put rice? literally conspiracy theorist play book..math fake, political power grab, news fake, ""dO ReSeaRcH"" literally proof except youtube video buddy shared Facebook. I'm pretty sure always case (in terms dispersal pathogens fecal material). supposed keep toothbrush near toilet. patients ventilators, cut risk death 40% 28%. patients needing oxygen, cut risk death 25% appear help people milder symptoms coronavirus - need help breathing.

However, considering back beginning May, governor [proudly stating number tests show positive rate time get feeling would know still near bottom. 

The recent numbers (~2,800) nearly 5 times start May (~600).  read title Cheap Asteroid blown away. read also blown away. feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Everyone know care anymore. Parties weekends last weeks face masks. outside helps taking pictures together, touching other. 
 
My state solid part tested 10% population. That‚Äôs incredibly stupid dangerous. study involved patients ventilators. people follow YouTube tutorial DIY meth lab. ""Murphy's Law""? Nah that's fault bad luck. Yeah, hopefully learn toughen bit. way daily viral infection testing, known amount viral infections also show elevated temperatures people point along line infection, still incredibly inexpensive method ""better nothing"" monitoring, another data point start contact tracing. thing really much beneficial regimented logged temperature monitoring. looking one person never again. See? try slow spread disease much can. New treatments found, people already died may saved got sick later. really amazes thousands people close together outside protests essentially one got sick. hundred people go church ton get sick simply indoor vs outdoor. heard it‚Äôs 20x less likely spread inside vs outside man it‚Äôs really shocking true. Undertesting underreporting

I love india! Nah, biting time. obvious anyone reasonable apples apples compare Nordics other. Yup. work end day paid, treated like pet getting compliments. Honestly people except. rise cases. people dimwitted? hasn‚Äôt got anywhere won‚Äôt go anywhere. interact try resume life normally it‚Äôs going happen. people shocked. It‚Äôs going happen NYC eventually start reopening. Ye lol US pharmaceuticals scrambling coordinate good old price fixing right probably I've linked actual study supports I'm saying.

You keep making unsourced claims dont seem capable understanding things.

Sorry cant help understand this, I'm going keep trying. &amp;#x200B;

A 32-year-old nurse - among least nine others - died April ***after retired New York surgeon illness*** admitted high end dementia care facility [Los possible aren‚Äôt half assing it, rules might overly onerous you‚Äôre small restaurant limited resources? 7 day average at? actually clean water chlorine, bromine, gives ride signature smell.

We're talking orders magnitude people going bars restaurants parties compared thousands protests. FYI /r/rimjob_steve need general strike. Grocery workers showing would changed shit REAL fast. places got hit hard first taking extra precautions many residents understand power virus (NY, NJ, CT etc) It‚Äôs 1a 2 agree.

We shall see second wave, I‚Äôm noticing pattern right now. know true. heard here. know clinics Chile using patients recover intubated. That's know exactly article say that? camp, put effort proper campsite, definitely better centralized AC? dont think so.  use independent wall mount AC electric fans. Also, vietnam humid like thailand. 

singapore also similar weather humid, worse situation due excessive modern buildings central AC. won‚Äôt stay cheap long though confirmation bias. what's makes spread misinformation easy effective. vast majority people taught critical read/hear, essentially live echo chambers spreading easily digestible information amongst themselves. scary realise widespread is, limited certain groups mainstream likes look (flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, etc) - far widespread that. Sweden COVID-19 would great case study anyone wanting study phenomenon much misinformation spread media journalists political spectrum, lack critical thought source-checking truly issue transcends politics needs something taught depth schools. I‚Äôm willing bet people say ‚Äútelling people wear mask tyranny first step Nazism!‚Äù overwhelmingly people who, hear yet another black person murdered police, first say, ‚ÄúWell, must done something wrong.‚Äù

It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting. way many spoiled brats country. hospitalized anything succeed scaring death. bigger news remdesvir? Good! pandora's box opened means people settle less ends. Living wages implemented whether power want not. That's 2006 document saying No, please explain specifically protection care homes can't compared Sweden Belgium. comparing countries, also sporting policies care homes, work. 

I agree anything like established, others thinking same. know established this, certainly helps able compare one country different culture aspects, strictly ones choice. I'm interested consider ""well known"" ""well established"" frequently debunked time time people *actual* knowledge country surrounding countries (aka reliance Google translated news articles). Surely, must noticed this? disgusting. Fuck racist bullshit Um. Uninstall? isn't? Good hear that! may ask, considered low high risk? Again, responding fact poster believed media suppressing story ‚Äúscary‚Äù bs regularly post ‚Äúscary‚Äù news. Take deep breath relax. whole pro-lockdown argument based purely hypothetical notion without lockdowns, mortality rates would much higher. nothing concrete back assumption up. 

On flip side, look countries strictest lockdowns - Italy, France, Spain &amp; UK - also highest mortality rates per capita. could argue cases lockdowns actually made problem worse. 

There's evidence suggest initial panic caused Italy &amp; Spain, contributed hospitals many areas overrun, pandemonium also led many nursing homes short staffed even abandoned Eastern European staff fled back homelands ban international travel imposed. 

But nothing concrete back assumption either - we're still dealing hypotheticals. 

The applies whole Sweden vs. rest Scandanavia debate. 

At minute, ony thing take that, terms reducing mortality rates, lockdowns might worked, might have, - depending viewpoint - Swedish strategy either qualified success out-and-out disaster. 

Looking Europe whole, C-19 situation was, everywhere - number deaths peaked April delcining steadily since then. 

Other difference mortality rates, discernible difference pattern applies countries, regardless measures put place. 

That would suggest important look effectiveness measure, also look countries higher mortality rates common. 

In top rated countries, one common denominator nursing homes abject failure case provide increased levels protection them. I'm sure that's factor, consider 60% deaths occured nursing homes countries, certainly points one major factors. really hope we're able learn form scientific studies come aftermath pandemic, actual efficacy lockdowns, also public health status, organisation elderly care, health policy plays role. 

It's going hard web untangle. hope powers-that-be take one-sided approach pre-pandemic. 

Pre-pandemic, hundreds opposing voices - many, many experts fields - whose viewpoints dismissed simply fit official line thinking. continues post-pandemic, learned nothing. guess, would put money pandemic cost far, including cost closing schools businesses, travel restrictions costs economic recession, preventative healthcare research current epidemic cluster health issues commonly referred *'The Metabolic Syndrome'*, single largest underlying risk factor among die COVID-19, could prevented deaths we're currently seeing, along many tragic deaths associated Metabolic Syndrome, case Sweden around 50k annually look statistics *Socialstyrelsen*. 

The extent Metabolic Syndrome western world shocking. there's excuse - basic education fitness nutrition early age would benefical here, issue educate children. Children learn example, kids whose parents overweight, never exercise eat like shit, education world much good. 

Education training required across board. tandem, would hit people heavy taxes junk food health premiums tobacco tobacco smokers. smoker, pay increased health premiums insurance premiums - would applying principle people refuse choice look themselves. 

&amp;#x200B;

Getting back main issue, viewpoint C-19 good arguments made imposing strict, limited lockdowns. certain areas, strict lockdown necessary prevent hospitals overrun - applied countries even selected cities large, dense population limited number ICU beds per head population. 

And lockdowns imposed long takes flatten curve. lockdowns extended beyond that. Anything beyond suicidal terms economy, people's mental physical health, education etc. many companies making masks simply provide SOMETHING.
The masks aren‚Äôt protecting much.

While aren‚Äôt much, something, seems like ignorant argument, pay day companies simply trying get consumers SOMETHING. interesting lengths people go try find number looks best look ways say control. First positive cases, really percent positive cases, one day last three days, last week, really hospitalizations. Actually ICU admissions number open beds, daily death rate. 

Like come guys. Take step back. one heeding social distancing, masks, guidelines reopening. barely thrown together reopening plan even give time see impact lifting restrictions. Beaches bars packed politicians saying mission accomplished flattening curve let's get convention on. 

Look numbers plus behavior spells one thing. Florida's trouble. still upvoted??? US govt paying people $24K/yr work makes sense - still makes sense discuss whether policy makes difference. Saying successful countries something, ergo works make sense. Hong Kong scientists mentioned 3 months ago. accidentally fall pants accidentally get stuck there. I've said before, already screwed. difference make flush toilet bathroom? Also someone else house high likely chance getting already it, vice versa less brings back original point. It‚Äôs comparable. could use kind logic compare Holocaust say, ‚Äúyou know, compared 9 million people died Holocaust, Covid isn‚Äôt big number.‚Äù K u really dense huh? numbers inflated increase funding hospitals. 

hospital admins either lay doctors, classify patients covid. moral dilemma. maybe u research listen people really know what's going night time daily news tv. woman currently getting double lung transplant virus turned lungs meatloaf technically someone survived. get source since seems like bot removed comment? Maharashtra backlog deaths counted main reason covid added total, hence spike.

Maharashtra govt says 1,328 COVID-19 deaths added toll

Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy¬†Mehta¬†on Tuesday said many 1,328 deaths, took place due COVID-19, reported fatalities caused viral infection state.
As many 862 deaths occurred areas falling the¬†Brihanmumbai¬†Municipal Corporation (BMC) limits, said here, citing fresh review COVID-19 fatalities state carried authorities. corrected fatality figures updated accordingly, said.

Also, sure I‚Äôm downvoted stating facts, I‚Äôm genuinely curious one 

As stated 3m isn‚Äôt providing anything anyone healthcare.

I‚Äôd like know masks fed seized went. 

I‚Äôd like know DPA hasn‚Äôt put play.

I‚Äôd also like know masks purchased (for $55 million) FEMA bankrupt company are. stop. Also, pay gas - cheap fuel. army isn‚Äôt stupid. executive branch half stupid half corrupt puts perspective much impact Covid compared historic events. Flying's pretty much last thing I'll comfortable doing. Ok plateau isnt ""nationwide"" it? literally answered question much lower number, definitely lower number.

And said ""fuck too"" generating dashboard using funding private source now, Florida get real info.

 Yeah also shows week 24 actually less positive cases increase week 25, even though several extra regions taking samples. maybe reported yet, know. gives 51k number week 24 already gives 50k number week 25 2 days it.

Edit: wonder number confirmed cases start drop actually, assume keep climbing assume coronavirus everywhere :D  coronavirus deaths pneumonia deaths

I mean COVID deaths *are* pneumonia deaths, pneumonia prettier word serious respiratory illness. cheap long... think average American understands this, average politician values career people represent. one major parties still thinks ""the flu"" ... supply come from? We're seeing opposite everywhere else. meat industry especially demand go roof dwindling supply. No, people already gotten COVID. Even horrible under-testing, far less 10% population gotten it. Keep wearing masks, quarantine home can, stay socially distant ‚Äî maximize chances avoiding disease. 

So no, want avoid can. knows long term effects be? makes sense upon rereading. yeah, even drug manufacturers say vaccine lifespan months years.. People borderline 0 education reading reddit articles, surprise me. likely? improved infection control? critical mass old people died substantial enough reduce overall death rate? Ill give hint - later. Trump come saying bullshit work 3...2....1..... Check HealthLine.

The problem grew 100+ people, concerned incidental community transmission might missed. thread shitshow. environment virus could easily spread?

&amp;#x200B;

depends really great shoe-leather epidemiology demonstrated clearly effect single asymptomatic carrier restaurant environment (see below). infected person (A1) sat table dinner 9 friends. Dinner took 1 1.5 hours. meal, asymptomatic carrier released low-levels virus air breathing. Airflow (from restaurant's various airflow vents) right left. Approximately 50% people infected person's table became sick next 7 days. 75% people adjacent downwind table became infected. even 2 7 people upwind table infected (believed happen turbulent airflow). one tables E F became infected, main airflow air conditioner right exhaust fan left room.  That's happens use means testing coupled economic inequality.. maybe sort minimum would help correct issue. Thing know fever checks don‚Äôt work. also know one infected lead hundreds infections first one even detected. Also people - even athletes - suffered permanent injury months weeks hospital. higher ups pretending isn‚Äôt true now. eventually players figure out.

Some form sports isolates athletes would work fine. Large team sports actually coming back year.

This isn‚Äôt like, wish. don‚Äôt really like sports. business interesting, I‚Äôm saying probably won‚Äôt work out. Yes, also dismissing HUGE negatives reason people get sick large numbers. (Of course, people get sick)

This embolden supporters call pandemic ""hoax"" make even less likely people wear masks. Also event MAY become catalyst force large sporting events open (hey, 17k people attending without much issues.. not) putting even FAR people risk.

So, mixed bag emotions. one hand, wish many people get sick, FREAK reason, many people get sick, DEFINITELY send wrong message large # supporters bring harm MANY innocent people. Remdesivir good helps certain subset problems caused immune systems response corona virus.  good first step.

This another tool help inflammation processes cause issues. Although original statement wrong part something actively done. professional ""clean rooms"" (biological wet labs, component manufacturing, etc.) biological components like viruses run system filters involving things like ULPA (.12 microns covid-19 .14 microns), ionized air filters use electrical charge attract particles surface (such virus), cases super heat air briefly kill anything that's rapidly cooling it.

Instead said masks don‚Äôt work people wouldn‚Äôt buy (which already occurring well said anything it). lockdowns occurred, people‚Äôs lives upended, economy suffered already leery lockdowns affront liberty view masks way. Educating won‚Äôt change mind. Unfortunately people thing change mind seeing Covid-19 affect personally friend family member getting it, since many also think it‚Äôs ‚Äújust flu‚Äù affect likely fatal actually sink in.

Thank goodness US corrupt politicians owned wealthy corporations, otherwise would real trouble, we? almost vomited man. There's many things nastier that.

Great realisable source. Id guess 30 million everyone actually takes serious..

that bunch famous people dying. study bullshit, conveniently cut study May26th. next 4 days worst death totals states history. 

Also, May 13th WI SC overturned stay home order, 13 days isn‚Äôt nearly enough time see effect. Also, Milwaukee stayed locked longer even decision, Milwaukee makes majority cases. 

Right Wisconsin looks good Milwaukee stayed closed, rural counties seeing increases, Milwaukee opens numbers eventually get worse. Wow getting corona virus going mass social gathering, would thought it? dude Im running neighborhood blocks using 25 dumbbells everything. awful anyone dies listed COVID death.

Here Texas, opposite problem, go official state county health agencies. pretty good reason believe **under**counting COVID deaths, wide margin.

From official numbers year date, much higher-than-average death rates cancer, diabetes, heart disease flu (about 3000 ""extra"" deaths flu alone). 

Occam's Razor suggests that, rather bad luck illnesses year, instead regular actual deaths illnesses ... instead ""official"" COVID death count barely 2000, ""true"" count would like 6k 9k. would still put us far behind NY NJ sheer numbers deaths, well behind IL, PA COVID deaths per capita. honestly it. Us Floridians already used treated like crap state lol DFW area and, yeah, everyone wearing masks. talked uncle last week lives Glen Rose says practically everyone wearing masks there. wanted say sorry loss gut-wrenching read something like I'm confused. would /u/BrilliantCorner acting like obvious early+zinc work that's still consistent science idea advocates proposing along?

It's lonely war attrition us hunker best safe mostly survive ... Good luck hope around understand apologize feelings they've created directed you. No. would probably cancel rent, along mortgage payments. Give everyone $2,000 month, pay essential workers focus best distribute food &amp; necessities need it. Put homeless people many empty hotels apartments major cities. Also probably start jobs program want help industry so. could also lot countries like make companies keep everyone payroll offering pay 50-100% payroll (this would change $2k month thing). could also cut lot unnecessary military spending, abolish police free money would take longer.

Anyway would help curb impact coronavirus keeping citizens happy, US would slowly start see cases decrease would able open back slowly safely like lot countries now. See: New Zealand.

But started country live need work in?

To response think critiquing larger system, people go work. rather power make people ""need"" work. many countries done.

In response never gonna work corona gone? everyone else? everyone else decided wouldn‚Äôt work either? It‚Äôs easy criticize you‚Äôre getting unemployment check living parents well enough saved lucky enough able work home.  everyone else?

Which really debated here. whole point, push back idea people ""needing"" work, reality people ""need"" work pay lot basic things live, lot government provide help for. understand people work reasons, pandemic situation obviously primary reason people ""need"" go back work.

Edit: Also current bailouts $1.3 trillion, gives lil spending money lol. include money fed printed see stock market temporary jump. Everybody hero. Little kids education ruined, people losing jobs, little shopkeeper trying survive 'essential'.

Everybody hero making sacrifices except politicians. Fuck em. furious without permission ... normal time. pandemic time see problem that. basic social responsibility. It‚Äôs approx 650kms, easily doable tank it‚Äôs diesel.

*Thermal cameras would declare safe, skin temperature low, could infectious phase fever. surface temperature reliable indicator fever*.""

""*Even infrared thermometers could detect fever reliably, could detect Covid-19 reliably. could thermometer. Patients Covid-19 guaranteed fever.* ""

So pretty useless except make us feel safer. Corona said lick second popular public opinion go that? wouldnt instantly dismiss that, within reason guess. dont work warehouse dont know things work there. wanted give two cents, dont wear mask ""breathing condition"".

I asthma. wouldnt know watching work. pretty well managed. bust ass day im fine part.

But wearing mask changes instantly me. Im breathing hot Co2 gets trapped mask exhale. 10 minutes, im literally struggling breath. bad asthma attack last month took lungs ribs nearly week recover from.

I cant wear mask job. GM understanding dont wear mask. make that, hyper aware surroundings coworkers. be. take precautions can. wash hands frequently. Im quiet person dont talk hardly all. mouth always closed. Im homebody. time im home im work. 

The day forced wear mask work, day lose everything.

Now obviously people take advantage. actually people serious trouble breathing wearing mask. stupid idea. see new cases foreseeable future now, dropped ball hard, theres picking back  Nobody likes think reality dashes optimism brands misplaced. them, would downvote me, too. bring good point. 9/11 one moments definition normal changed overnight nobody complained. seeing would everybody suddenly decided TSA stuff done they're more. all, many planes hijacked?

Why go hyperbolic? case, strong one. Shit, arrived 7 years ago I'm 1%. slavery happening US, ancestors working land czarist yoke.

I would also careful saying that's ""Black people"" general. know Ghanaian American households make money (on average) white American households? talk racial wage gap?

Sure. need stop Indian caste society, Indians make much money anyone else. going for?

(Indian: $132k,White: $68k ... white people certainly historically shown particular soft spot Indian people (just ask locals Churchill), come US nice them?

Also worth note Nigerian diaspora also makes double black average. that?

I think racism is... quite right word. think culture ancestors slaves serious scars it, causing long term damage necessarily tied rest population perceives black skin color. understand mean that? B) Lack trust self preservation. factor percentages instead looking straight numbers cops violent Black people. Laws made Black people, made keep down.

This extreme, absolutely kernel truth. Since civil rights act war drugs probably disgraceful thing US done, even many foreign wars coups. Hearing Nixon tapes blatantly racist hard quite fathom level evil.

Yet besides that, little hyperbolic. can't really think racist laws. Law enforcement might racist leanings, though seems depend department. Policing general US violent base level even without extra flavoring racism... Trevor Noahs point ""why person gun go deal guy sleeping car"" well made. worst mistake incident happened cops even arrived.

Why like don‚Äôt cases don‚Äôt test! Single rooms go 900/mo. crazy. Yeah. One thing I've always noticed, crazies never even contemplate they're wrong. never see ""Obviously could wrong this"", ""This perspective, could flawed"" ""crazy"" posts. figure, long I'm willing keep open enough mind know I'm always 100% right, people might see things differently, least mitigate crazy awhile. Also admitting they're crazy. know I'm perfect sometimes make mistakes, open enough know flawed person important IMO, again, something never see 'louder' posters. logical conclusion?

Your personal morals enter equation - end result getting others sick possibly giving permanent organ damage killing them. Whether fine meaningless. two weeks passed?! American Graves Already! America situation. Well *not* serious so.... think we've heard letting speak. valid point. seen one person use before. I‚Äôm astounded one used yet. Sarcasm Sure doesn‚Äôt help conversation comes blame game. BLM tourists next. back China. still case outside, aren‚Äôt likely infect others stagnant indoor air.

That's bit understatement, volume air outside move things around. would much safer could move many activities possible, outdoors. Public policy opinion kept science regard Let people die way herd immunity probably, that's plan Florida Man gonna stand that. Remindme! 20 days Well maybe young people need vote different governor try lay blame feet. thinking indoor outdoor transmission rates. likely process: person household gets virus (in unlikely outdoors environment, another indoors environment like grocery store, etc), everybody household acquires indoor transmission. Therefore, need #Masks4All *and more*. undermine previous efforts. building refining approach resolving issue.

I reviewed literature. two reports extracted local Municipal Health Commissions 320 prefectural cities (municipalities) China, including Hubei province, 4 January 11 February 2020. identified outbreaks involving three cases reviewed major characteristics enclosed spaces outbreaks reported associated indoor environmental issues. Results: Three hundred eighteen outbreaks three cases identified, involving 1245 confirmed cases 120 prefectural cities. divided venues outbreaks occurred six categories: homes, transport, food, entertainment, shopping, miscellaneous. Among identified outbreaks, 53.8% involved three cases, 26.4% involved four cases, 1.6% involved ten cases. Home outbreaks dominant category (254 318 outbreaks; 79.9%), followed transport (108; 34.0%; note many outbreaks involved one venue category). home outbreaks involved three five cases. identified single outbreak outdoor environment, involved two cases. **Conclusions: identified outbreaks three cases occurred indoor environment, confirms sharing indoor space major SARS-CoV-2 infection risk.**  
[Indoor transmission SARS-CoV-2, this, countries authorities consider airborne spread COVID-19 regulations prevent infections transmission indoors**. therefore extremely important, national authorities acknowledge reality virus spreads air, recommend adequate control measures implemented prevent spread SARS-CoV-2 virus, particularly removal virus-laden droplets indoor air ventilation.  
[Airborne transmission SARS-CoV-2: world face reality, live near there, bars packed weeks now, though temporarily closed cleaning now. Bunch employees sick COVID too. almost like senior leaders downplaying pandemic couple months. People must listened wrong talking heads. Still strawman, man. What's worse?

Even high deductible, preventative vaccine usually covered cost you.

Nonetheless, really think vaccine covered part comprehensive public health plan, piecemeal. still see distinction making. saying people root certain people (people act like hoax etc.) get sick virus? That's awful, I'm sorry.

Governments news organizations really continued show horrible outcomes virus. vascular disease top horrible respiratory one. People think something bad old people preexisting conditions, realize cause permanent damage. use Exposure Notification API Apple/Google? not, pretty useless background services severely limited modern OS versions. yet ever since protest/riots happening, PRESS lost focus PRESSING, UNIVERSAL ISSUE,WHICH STILL SARS-COV-2 ya know virus causes COVID-19.

Apparently instances people got gastrointestinal symptoms little respiratory tract involvement, suggests probably contracted oral route.

Say order uncooked food carrying surface contamination, immediately store fridge upon receiving later eat without heating up, insufficiently so.

Hell went Walmart cleaning supplies yesterday beyond septuagenarian door playing add subtract Ipad track many people inside, way people inside we'd typically see time year, madhouse. 

People spent entirety ""Vacation Rental Ban"" hopping open beach open beach staying hotels instead. 

I get Governor reopened, wild shift resident opinions 'Keep tourists away' ""oh shit can't pay bills entire state based tourism"". Add limp dick Unemployment pay outs recipe state screaming reopen way quickly. 

But zero chance going close again. got RNC moved Jacksonville DeSantis worships ramp Trump stumbles upon. 

I'm saving every nickel right now, fully expect industry get fucked actual 2nd wave hits. depends consider serious, people don‚Äôt consider anything serious hits home See? got wanted r/coronavirus. Everything staying closed.

Memorial Day three weeks ago. bars restaurants full. gyms open masks. think seeing snowball effect holiday. protests Trump‚Äôs rally keep growing speeding hill. don‚Äôt see leaving house anytime soon. still wrong wish certain politicians catch virus? take srsly? Get exercise. Go gym (sanitize equipment fine). Get low-dose antidepressants (though warned shortage SSRIs anti-anxiolytics right exactly reasons state). Get sleep, can. Meditate.

Most importantly: GET SUB - lot people doomspeak around *are mentally well* subject fearmongering. stopped scientific weeks ago.

The end nigh. hand, government's money collected taxes. there's economic activity everything shut down, supposed getting money hand out? much past weeks. hoping people smart seems people still spreading bullshit here

Amusing also sad Exactly this. think things get muddied people don‚Äôt differentiate schools education childcare. It‚Äôs happened time long time, it‚Äôs first foremost dare say goal education safety.
If can‚Äôt educate safely building (which would need build like five buildings accommodate ten class business) don‚Äôt staff materials clean properly accommodate ‚Äúmust ten days symptoms ‚Äú staff students impossible.

But see working parents stressed it‚Äôs education, child care.
YMCAs begun open maybe send parents can‚Äôt accommodate kids home.

The federal government dispersed $500Billion without oversight left people hanging.

The 'budget' 'economic situation' consequence that, among things. ah probably right. wish someone figured make accurate rapid test now. hear hospitals area could get result back 4 hours so, know one health department uses takes least 24 drive throughs take 3-5 days read headline? ‚ÄúRaised level 2 level 3‚Äù I‚Äôm sure meant lowered level 2 reason serious level 3, case think levels wrong Actually miniscule number relative population.

Particularly considering vast majority people would dead without Covid.

They died Covid Covid.

The death rate less 0.25% across infected population rate less 0.01% people without severe underlying health conditions.

That's minor. wait schools re-open. 600 kids building. Staff average age 40+
Kids shout, sing, talk, breathe lot touching everything other. Yikes! Hillsborough (Tampa area), emergency committee meetings twice week. chair way genuinely feel like he's trying right thing. Everyone else chasing almighty dollar. actual thing said recent meeting, ""asking people wear masks unconstitutional."" [sic]

That said, hope make moves like this, bars restaurants closing left, right, center. job done 100% remote (and since March), I'm told need work office (no masks, distances observed) show community face. flew 7th tested positive 16th, one asymptomatic. chances contagious flight would low.

But stop media armchair scare mongering epidemiologists saying looking window someone without mask means catch it.

Wow, that's insane southern hemisphere summer lots natural social distancing happening. Also helps leader respected took clear &amp; decisive action  Testing numbers wider net means catch milder cases. probably seeing fewer deaths protecting vulnerable people better. Generally, people exposed much virus early social distancing, wfh, ppe, etc. People spending much time crowded indoor spaces, do, essential workers tend younger. many older people work meat packing plants. ""Look, uncle big huge thing growing neck, fine. goes doctor: cancer. Bing Bang Boom! Hair out, Hamburger Time."" also happened spanish flu. Medical providers stopped providing. Lots people died. don‚Äôt think mattered long term, based fact reproduce like rabbits. US test/population rate recently overtook many nations. needed widespread testing (see: February), woefully behind. Check [this tests per capita U.S. vs South Korea April. Fewer 300 died SK.

Germany ahead U.S. tests per capita week two ago. fewer 7,000 active cases entire country right now. need widespread testing anymore. time. need trace 6500~ infected. contrast, state Nebraska 6200~ active cases. think Nebraska anything close amount resources devoted tracking active cases entire nation Germany full weight government?

The fact done much testing middle June something celebrate. needed months ago. cops stopped clocking speeders radar guns, we‚Äôd speeding tickets, any.  close eyes ears, won‚Äôt see hear him. mean won‚Äôt exist? story many states soon long people keep packing bars, look Nashville example. bars packed recently. I'm going lie, would cause stop associating relative. I'm people different opinions, believing fiercely Trump... Something right says, number infected individuals decrease

Even according said, never suggested number infected individuals anything increase claim infected people infected

What seem held specific logic understand material draw conclusion yourself.

Read said, ""If stop testing right now, we‚Äôd cases, any."" Drawing conclusion highlighted correlation foolish. like journalist, like majority comments breakdown capacity understand log growth works?

Has nothing understand virus transmits human thought irrelevant it? understand underlying mechanisms spreads socio-economic consequences result it?

Has nothing seem understand whatever says terms decreasing testing literally matter all. That's it.

Fortunately, president free make statements speculate day long. people make seemingly irrational conclusions result one sentence describing redundant correlation, i'm it. arent listening science. loner.  another solid proof theres god, god really fucking hates us.

The fact trump exist living proof. No. incorrect.

Then someone asked Barack Obama dead. ""But he's dead new president?""

That fun recess. Jfc point America railed high number cases; number that's relatively inflated given prominent testing is, policies nations either test test presenting symptoms multiple days.

It takes real sucker believe China got control virus day expelled foreign journalists, example. usa 28th per capita testing. 

why one grasp concept ""per capita""? feigning ignorance actually dumb? worked Chinese government. unbelievably stupid. people elect dumb person...I know 10 year olds smarter Well data easing restrictions, know data things mentioned. data reduction restrictions correspondence increase cases. alone prove causation course. points though, matter protests instance, data New York, Maryland Virginia show spikes. think data tends provide probable indication protests likely causing spike number cases. difference follow statistics? 

- percentage People 30 hospitalized die COVID-19 (counting estimated infections) 
- percentage people 30 hospitalized die seasonal flu (counting estimated infections) look worse countries tested higher number people total. i'd say piss poor response, testing per capita, deaths per capita. He's ~~like~~ infant developed ~~object permanence~~ yet. ""I can't see it, there."" like 18 days straight protests Phoenix.

Why getting downvoted? engage meaningful discussion? guy said straight face populace inject cleaning agents combat coronavirus..... That‚Äôs commonly stated argument against, it‚Äôs actually based scientific evidence.

A company wouldn‚Äôt get ‚Äúrun ground‚Äù paid workers more...they would become less profitable. isn‚Äôt death sentence. Plenty companies like walmart could easily cared to. companies do, fact, this.

In Canadian Province Quebec, sees frequent labour shortages, government found companies like Costco completely avoid experiencing shortages - get - paying cashiers higher wages. cashier costco Quebec make upwards $50k/yr 1.5-2x average cashier salary.

And costco isn‚Äôt going business time soon.


I used parrot arguments did. realize isn‚Äôt actually evidence behind argument, realize it‚Äôs actually sound all. US 6% global population 30% deaths COVID. know saying Raise minimum wage decent rate encourage workers resume work safe so. currently safe so. fucks sake.

Oh Donney... fuck man? got downvoted right people kept working done dirty.

Like hard pay 90% salary 50k? Man, many people going responsible permanent health issues, death loved ones. going hell ride, even virus control, whenever may end being.

Of course, usual crap said...

""We know""

""Why government make decision me""

""It's fair""

So many people blaming someone else, something else, amounts personal choice responsibility. decision make, decision comes repercussions. course, people try finding ways shovel blame somewhere else, people, spread virus could quite easily mitigated part, made simple decision careful listen experts. Nope putting covid people nursing homes. Putting people ventilators using unproven drugs killed nothing, studies claiming caused harm retracted? common anti-malaria drug that's use decades. nanana defense... Got it...I thought stopped working 6 leader free world kind thing new Dolt .45, similar mindset media.

He's always insisted stop telling people shockingly dumb shit says daily basis, people think he's shockingly dumb thus - problem solved. 30 years wage stagnation fucking hate comment. wrong, fucking right. supporters explain away (‚Äúleftist media took said context!‚Äù) ignore it. Technically true... specific said ""a*verage intelligence*"" range. Since in-thread comment thought would clear understand might all. nah, nothing racism growing around makes feel better. forget prez, hide everything else hellscape. I'm sure origins it, gloves required state law orthodontists dentists procedures. guy reproduced like five times.  Sadly think right. Something doesnt sit right logic.

Words escape properly rebut testing getting confirmed cases, neccissarily good thing circumstance.

The fact trump said tests, cases true even without tests still cases, confirmed. I'm confused rant. Lol weed still get life ruined US states, unfortunately. careful kids. Mortality trends US regular - January spike July valley. spike fit regular data, excess caused virus - pandemic.

It's almost quote taken entirely context make trump look bad. almost like reddit jumped chance without reading objectively shit article.

""Trump frequently made inconsistent comments testing. times sought downplay severity coronavirus pandemic saying U.S. tested people country, result, number confirmed cases higher.

Other times, Trump complained positivity rates case counts high, country testing many people.""

So inconsistent, believes tests results positives making country look worse compared countries fewer testing, also believes tests results positives making country look worse compared countries fewer testing. dare he.

Simpleton clarify commenter said ""needing live"", even could theoretically live life eating zero carbs (veggies, fruit, milk, tons things carbs), organs need insulin processes would still need insulin. T1Ds typically take two types insulin

1) fast acting insulin taken whenever there's need regulate blood sugar levels. due food, hormonal shifts, growth spurts, getting sick, teeth growing in, waking crick neck, crapton factors cause blood sugar levels fluctuate. Fast acting usually takes 15ish minutes kick in, YMMV

2) basal insulin slow release, taken day. meant organs die. 

The amount fast acting insulin need fluctuates day day, hour hour. Goin wedding? Probably need extra hand control food served. Want night pals? Turns alcohol full carbs. 

I know suggesting extreme measures T1Ds time, times need. think would reasonable ask pure politics/money grabbing that's causing T1D friends suffer.  necrology written: *""Died naturally.""* don‚Äôt to, don‚Äôt judge people assess risk worth rather continue unsustainable path isolation.

* Released part said stock Chinese New Year, mask factories closed, prevent price gouging
* Requested mask factories return full production ASAP help military
* Banned exports masks
* Expropriated mask production centrally distributed
* Created ration distribution masks
* Set aside US$6 million emergency funds purchase equipment 60 mask production lines abroad, given mask producers exchange equivalent value masks.

All above, *before end January*.

I hate E. Wet One irresponsible. read 'study' article referencing. headline cherry pick one part study, I. headline: Study finds children aged 10 play role COVID-19 transmission. 

Taken directly study:
""In Vo' 14-day period studied, young children seemed play role transmission SARS-CoV-2: ‚ÄúNo infections detected either survey 234 tested children ranging 0 10 years, despite living household infected people‚Äù¬†

So one objections every single child age 10 attending in-person school social distancing then? article nothing fear-mongering, author's state study asymptomatic infection ""may"" associated subclinical lung abnormalities. 

I also read study Diamond Princess base claim on, updated April due 'incorrect information' originally published March. authors paper stated ""the sensitivity method [PCR tests] throat swabs COVID-19 around 59%"". Therefore PCR tests using even close accurate, infer ridiculous claim ""covid damage lungs without showing symptoms"" that!? No, way. wait get really bad

Many states seeing increasing cases again. Almost half them, believe. People always 2 weeks seems take longer. people think economy bad now. think would happen large swath public couldn‚Äôt physically work long term complications ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù Covid-19?

Do see could possibly destroy economy long term? already working home less likely impacted may never get Covid-19 job could done home could likely done even long term complications Covid-19. farmers, plumbers, electricians, framers, factory workers, grocery store clerks, etc? 

It‚Äôs amazing certain political stripe fear monger everything else sun, real present danger ‚Äúno big deal‚Äù... ironically least likely weather economic toll less wealthy, less educated, tend live states abysmal social services opposite end political spectrum typically hold jobs cannot done home period.  shit. stupidity people never ceases amaze me. 

It also big mistake loosen lockdowns. Germany opened schools kindergartens. Fucking idiots. next wave come full force. know old are, keep feeling like type ""new normal"" like 9/11.

I remember could meet friends family gate airplane. awesome come flight loved ones. saddens know people never get experience, feels same.

Thanks Corona assuming everything article true. would think point, one would take news article face value without fact checking. even know telling truth Feb +. always quit scared. recent CDC study Roosevelt gotten attention. first study I've seen used microneutralizing antibody test (requires BSL 3/4 lab) specifically tests SARS-2 targeting antibodies, specifically virus-neutralizing antibodies, findings challenge common assumption infection confers long-term immunity.

Among soldiers previously tested positive via PCR COVID-19, ~40% neutralizing antibodies 1+ months infection. numbers would bad 1 year post infection, 1-3 months out? That's great. believe decent number participants reported 3+ symptoms well, asymtpomatic infections.

Granted mucosal IgA memory T-cells could theoretically provide protection represented serum antibody findings (I believe mucosal neutralizing antibodies would show microneutralization Ima certain). there's hope. know right data really read quite damaging prospect effective long-term immune response, whether regard extended infection reinfection. 

Short intentionally exposing people virus challenges, best info we're going get immune response... least quite time. numbers show that, many infections, recovery seem confer long-term protection via typical/expected routes, all.

I also find strange people discuss possibility seeming reinfections actually rather viral reemergence (long-duration infections multiple symptomatic asymptomatic stages) that's optimistic prospect. Extended presence virus without suppressive/eliminating immune response means COVID-19 antigens flying radar, quietly sabotaging whatever systems they're hiding away - initial findings show could include GI tract, CNS, epithelial tissue throughout body.

Reinfection alarming, chronic immune disorder, respiratory issues, GI dysfunction, Parkinson's-linked neuronal infiltration, cognitive impairment etc. exactly comforting prospects either. Unfortunately detailed evidence continues emerge supports existence factors pathology COVID-19. way knowing sweden less financially damaged. right kow pariah isnt welcomed anywhere. also financially I‚Äôm sorry loss that‚Äôs terrible... I‚Äôm sure pain feels insurmountable, hope find strength push know semantics, exception actually visit dying parent specifically attend funeral. funeral part came afterwards (the person died yet). travelled private vehicle, use public facilities, stayed single family member. comes Second Wave! cannot fathom pain suffering endured. Sending pleasant thoughts, maybe catch glimpse something beautiful today. Chinese person, said Beijing started blocking January 23 unblocked mid late March, 8-10 weeks

But fact limit society's acceptance enforced city closures (enforced blockades, mind you), people come 10 times two half months, people can't take it.

In fact, important thing whether government, well health department, keep number cases near zero 10 weeks, maintain number cases order magnitude suppress near zero

&amp;#x200B;

To say something Americans may like hear: US 8-10 week blockade (but mandatory blockade voluntary one) number cases dropped peak 30,000 per day 20,000 per day, downward trend

The number cases U.S. stay number, without new strategies, seems end sight except vaccines tons coronavirus variants bats. article provide compelling evidence ""same"" virus even directly related. Unless actual scientific article lot info; expect pass peer review ""link"" two.

It's like saying chimps Africa guy New York 98% DNA. Nobody would believe Chimp guys dad.

## Wie viele Menschen wollen die App nutzen?

*Laut* [*ARD-DeutschlandTrend von Anfang *w√ºrden 42 Prozent der Befragten eine Warn-App auf dem eigenen Smartphone nutzen, 39 Prozent hingegen nicht. Jeder sechste Deutsche (16 Prozent) sagt, er besitze kein Handy oder Smartphone. Unter den Menschen, die eine Nutzung der App ablehnen, begr√ºndet knapp die H√§lfte (45 Prozent) dies mit Datenschutz, √úberwachung oder Pers√∂nlichkeitsrechten. 13 Prozent meinen, eine solche App funktioniere nicht, bringe nichts oder sie halten andere Ma√ünahmen f√ºr besser.*

*In Deutschland gibt es nach Sch√§tzungen von Marktforschern derzeit nur eine App, die von mehr als 60 Prozent genutzt wird: WhatsApp, sonst keine andere Anwendung.*

**Translation (DeepL):** 


## many people want use app?

According ARD-DeutschlandTrend beginning June, 42 percent surveyed would use warning app smartphone, 39 percent would not. One six Germans (16 percent) says mobile phone smartphone. Among people refuse use app, half (45 percent) justify data protection, surveillance personal rights. 13 percent think app work, achieve anything measures would better.

Market researchers estimate currently one app Germany used 60 percent: WhatsApp, application. Blame dumbasses keeps protesting could get hair cut shit! government don‚Äôt want blamed open economy... shit hits fan, they‚Äôre gonna shut again! People never learn history. People make fun Ilhan Omar dad dying morally good thing. Ilhan Omar horrible person hope raped hell forever dies (no god unfortunately that's happening). Nobody said nothing, there's many cases instances can't find way think people getting reinfected close Kiwi friend, become friends friends social media. interesting see Americans worshipful praise Jacinda Ardern, read news reports NZ beat virus. 

The Kiwis much restrained, serious, nuanced conversations move forward. ample discussion whether curve--which flattened--got annihilated instead ... maybe there's downside that. Agreed, Spain. We've managed, strategic reduction tight lockdown seen huge increase. downvoted? fucking accurate I'm offended herd immunity never goal first place. Even infrared thermometers could detect fever reliably, could detect Covid-19 reliably. could thermometer. Patients Covid-19 guaranteed fever.

I mean shit? thermometer designed take temperature. never designed test Covid-19 (I really understand author wrote phrase). health care settings, thermometer used addition screening protocols paint bigger picture diagnosis. real issue going places access medical facilities, they're going use thermometer, that's shaky given variability virus symptoms. SD recently, worried. 18 days straight mass protests **nationwide** look daily cases Johns-Hopkins dashboard, spike.  even one starting. forgot US manly men wearing masks makes feminine weaker dominate males. would rather die real men! much nonsense. like child's attempt rationalization.

1. mean support it? 'a fair shake' mean equality outcome - fucking bad, right equal outcome.

Correct. degree earned. black people asking opportunity. accidentally correct this.

2. black people, MBE designations AA beneficiaries (mainly part black, middle class kids)? sacrifices AA beneficiaries make? born middle-class part black?

Black people suffered racism oppression started civil rights movement push forward rights minorities.

3. Underrepresented how/where Stanford, Federal contracting? negative thing benefits people suffer expense people make anyone suffer. causes resentment, leads poor product, impact happened past one bit.

Black people minorities suffered. Helping black students hurt you, levels playing field. persecution complex overblown. Like everything done help others something taken you, something entitled to. 

4. Floyd time armed robbery, public knowledge. / makes racist? 

I know case irrelevant murder. happened throw outrageous murder black man seems little reasonable, victim crime good person. Classic gaslighting black person.

5. response screed equality outcome.

I'm pushing equality outcome opportunity. changed narrative one easily become outraged over. me. you.

5.That's strange. wife, MD, lefties c-19. I'm sure get info, /coronavirus know simply /politics - bullshit propaganda 24/7.

You wife totality right wing movement. deny right denied downplayed virus, pushing country open outright lie. noticed cherry picked part point become outraged over. later stated supported push open country. Perhaps honest nuanced reply would make seem less dishonest opinions outrage.

The rest said confusing unintelligible. seems trying prove consistent claiming care anybody. I'm done. really. would react see spike chart. So, you‚Äôre basically guinnea pig experiment. Fucked thing virus is: could kill you. could show signs symptoms (but still ability spread it)... May soul rest peace. Perhaps should‚Äôve closed borders fair, lists removed moderator, deleted user. Yeah, people change perceptions habbits, fully notice, simply treat whatever current life normal. like someone actually remembers terrorists used Irish, consciously remember moment Middle Easterners replaced Irish heads. people used trust government media, even though far shady crap media even state propaganda tool. manage this? travelled Vietnam early March Malaysia talking zero precautions time. questions travel history. temperature checks. Everything still open. None grab drivers hotel staff wearing masks. None foreigners wearing masks. seriously dont understand possible didnt serious explosion cases given 2 months pandemic still hadnt taken single precaution (At least Ho Chi Minh, Da Nang Hoi an.) right increasingly poor academic knowledge critical thinking skills since NCLB, think that's people Germany also like ""it can't happen here, flu"" beginning... still are. ""asymptomatic"" means ""not serious case."" why! surprised, Arizona bad Florida. Really sorry hear live Phoenix tell ya people given completely, never gave fuck begin with. I‚Äôd say 10% people see actually wearing masks. fucking job seeing completely biased sample, obviously stupid realize it.  go job shut fuck up. really hope you‚Äôre joking. let assure you, virus joke. Let‚Äôs say get virus remain asymptomatic unknowingly infect family members, don‚Äôt know family member react virus. One might asymptomatic, well. another might lucky. doesn‚Äôt discriminate healthy body/immune system someone comorbidities (with illnesses). Spread hope. gives fuck cowboys? 

Push articles like know companies like Novartis Incyte cancer drugs clinicals super anti inflammatory drugs. 

The virus kill you. lungs expand pop. 

A medicine coming soon. Stay indoors released lungs would look like

A well-done piece steak now

With specks hot sauce Go Go Gadget Rona!!! right thing **is** open up.  spread slowed, hospitals going overwhelmed, mortality rate lower initially feared.  lockdowns increasing number suicides, babies battered death, alcoholism drug abuse, destroyed livelihoods especially among low wage-earners.

You want prevent suicides child abuse, you? symptoms rare. Check covid19positive see diverse unusual set symptoms people experience even months called recovery.

We taken virus seriously start. ""it's nothing, let's calm down"" approach backfired every point time yet advocating again. There's evidence immunity exists yet taken granted. 

Oh, also first test positive seeming recovery. fact nurse Chennai died relapse. phase 3 trial. still ready public.

You're gonna wait end year that. beat crap dragged plane. know that. Another typical foreigner US UK making 0 effort integrate here, getting frustrated work blame everything country. people even migrate begin live Texas know, restaurants even abiding rules guidelines anyway? stores fast foods know gave workers choice come go. say B's shoulda got temp raise least exspecially willing risk death make sure eat. I'm surprised. Lol. Healthcare worker.....those biggest fans! cash free time means lots Disney trips. Look childless groups roam park. Sch√∂dinger's Sweden COVID19 point - either spread wide lot people antibodies wide mean soft measures possible, 100% population tested know which, Kiwi considers 90% data (or less 100% data) fake. Oh God yes are. ER nurse much infection control rests excellent work do. No, like AIDS. HIV rapidly mutates, issue short lasting immunity. similar ""colds"" caused coronavirus people get over. valid concern, logical one.

The reason smartphones best choice hardware best fits purpose everybody it.

You want many people possible run thing distributing stand-alone gadget entirely possible.

It always necessary aware weakest link chain trust. wanting entirely trust companies sell cash register actual customers illogical. still idiots wild theories shit Merkel Dictatorship ""absolute controll data"", posting facebook/instagramm
My country lost mind really. feels like medieval times. told friend &amp; family temp checks useless. person likely infect either pre-symptomatic Asymptotic temp check make appear safe only. Unfortunately I‚Äôd better response brick wall. really ticking low wage essential workers, didn‚Äôt get break exposed also Didn‚Äôt get $600 bump would earning- they‚Äôre missing $1500 gravy. RIP Keep mind population actions people key here. shit reopening doesn‚Äôt mean *have* participate it, especially it‚Äôs safe so. 

Georgia believe Wisconsin avoided spikes reopenings. Turns out, that‚Äôs people still stayed home even stay home orders lifted. Look comparison states went ‚ÄúPandemic over, time party!!!‚Äù I'm get antibody test material sent states false-positive rate approximately 1/3rd confirmed COVID due tests picking antibodies coronaviruses had. case, make incentive less useful? Perhaps even dangerous think immune aren't? case,I hope school districts across globe stock n overload intended. told people yet called names said open state get paid worked. tried telling people getting uneployment. also said watch, guarantee milk make reason go back. people said that, see posting saying still went back work. hate people dont read facts. yet, looking Arizona Department Health dashboard, appears covid mortality rate continues decline.

That indicates there's testing going on.  doubt cases among people especially vulnerable.

It's good see people lockdown crap ever-shifting, increasingly political rationale. Misinformation basically name game trolls. guy still believes, **months**, Sweden trying herd immunity. basically flat earth level denial point Right now, still many unknowns virus body reacts it. don‚Äôt know yet long antibodies that‚Äôs produced last immune system. So, stay safe. *\*surprised pikachu\** isn‚Äôt going like due reduced population limit. It‚Äôs like Disney doesn‚Äôt cash put place protocols. Disney copy‚Äôs Shanghai Disney everything fine. Plus stay home don‚Äôt ruined renewed experience people concerned. fact effectively lock down?  x's million. live NJ mask use high cause mandatory. falling so... rush things I'd LIKE felt safe. I've read enough believe flying relatively safe... long masks required. fresh air exchange planes greatly reduces exposure viral particles. someone sitting right next sneezes without mask on, emits enough virus infect entire cabin. depends far particles travel fresh air circulates. mask, they'd least caught mask. immune response group 2 shots 28 days 100%. news media want report that. makes sense! Thanks are. check tweet, devoid basic spark human decency there, dishing hate. Sad world, ours. one use case scenario. wearer connect smartband monitoring mode, data automatically sent central server every X minutes. may privacy issues case, course, quite easy solve. different flu shot every year. Millennials: Yesss, let hate course you. nurse tell technically unless patient okays even supposed disclose patient hospital due HIPAA. Surprised results, mine 3 days That's conspiracy theory. math work out. Hey dude, think nearer 8%. yearly vaccines like twe flu, might stop getting flu/rona significantly reduce severity it. understand thinking imminent threat them. lot people US cities thought way China, managed avoid SARS first time, think lot people assumed would situation. 
 
But think made up? Hoax? That's steps farther. literally believe 120k American deaths, countless worldwide, happened due international conspiracy crash economy discredit man naturally radiates controversy? That's fucking Loony Tunes. Like actual fucking delusional paranoia. Like ""maybe guns giving people lead poisoning."" Lmao get outta bs Hell yeah I‚Äôm gonna jacked kick covids ass Obviously.

But statistics give us possibility put numbers context perspective. Something purposefully ignored political capital. 9 unarmed deaths Afro-Am. last year, 147 police officers died last year. NY State alone 375 MILLION interactions. Overwhelmingly positive. Police exposed violence every day need apply violence/force jobs effectively every day. cannot expect perfection life death situations require snap decisions. Mistakes happen. accept force necessary job, accept terrible mistakes happen. police crossing line reason justification, prosecute full power law. Also, likely killed white person apprehended violent crime (Wash. Post data). systemic racism.

I grew Africa. know chaotic society without effective police looks like. cannot even imagine violence, rapes, deaths. currently undermining line chaos safety. foolish. probably avoided getting treated worried hospital bill. country crazy. girl farted face valid question, downvote this? points apply countries.

The GDP part highly meaningful, mostly handful billionaires making money.

GDP equal quality life countries inhabitants. Bye bye I‚Äôve noticed sooo many people wearing masks wrong.

I can‚Äôt figure it‚Äôs deliberate wear mask mouth nose, ignorance. RN here. thank custodial staff every damn time clean room mine. heartbreaking really always look funny like they're trying figure I'm genuine sarcastic condescending something, makes think they're hardly ever thanked anybody. really need stories like forefront news reckless people told leave houses two simple things, wear masks physical distance others might consider simple tasks give us better chance getting control. these, purpose risk mitigation risk elimination TL;DR We're still first wave. That‚Äôs craziest part me, like one time could stand actual guidance state. Poof, there.

That's vaccines fail dumbtard. Please breed. Link government ~~banned personal sell n95 mask.~~ sufficient supply stockpiled virus arrived. 2 better 2 million. they're still good. exactly US fed doing? It‚Äôs also important point everyone gets fever either. Nothing said political. know political? psot replied to. remove that, instead partisan. anyone see rise planet apes ? Nuts relation much damage virus already caused mean something else? guessed wrong. Please read study. Thank you. looking something like monitor patients self isolating home. here, I've suffocating February April (and part March) inhaler helped breath normally. feel fine now, I've never something like long. He'd step right direction.

Saving US going work one man, going work generation, capable sustained effort years correct mistakes made learn them, happen.

Sadly, many us able ignore government live lives... we're going spend huge amount lives building back point safe enough need constant supervision. name shame restaurants truth talking point? go. called asshole holier thou asshat wishing people harm want keep living. 
2020 nutshell  Seems Abbot even let enforce masks despite recommending everyone wear them. 

I tell man, kid growing never would thought leadership would fail us badly. know many times growing assumed hard job must pressure get right everyone watching...

Nah. Turns fucking wing arbitrarily make decisions fuck millions people still job. Man makes worried mom, works hospice care unit diagnosed covid 3 weeks ago, she‚Äôs fine hope doesn‚Äôt contract again. 2 worst, stressful, hopeless scared weeks life  Depends live; northeast, coming first wave, south west getting first wave.

Yes, German study showed 30% transmission rate within households. could immunity gained strands coronavirus ability quickly clear virus innate immune system (which means would missed antibody test) bet Americans tell thing Hong Kong protests...

I even mean mean spirited way. hardly follow news all. Forget that, give cash. one wants god damn t-shirt snack putting working midst extreme outbreak. They‚Äôre underpaid likely don‚Äôt passion do. Says person doubt worry it. political scum worried rich corporate friends throwing us peasants slaughter get economy running again.

Hopefully us common sense continue lockdowns social distancing measures even others  people attended protests recognize inherent risk. Compare picture see overwhelming mask compliance. People constantly giving hand sanitizer too. 

If criticized widely, human rights important protected 1st amendment. Brits out!!! similar grandpa died. tested positive Covid, really mild fever. weeks later, heart suddenly failed previous heart issues. Absolutely. understand prioritizing nurses, value humans less likely marginalized whatever simply they're much harder replace emergency situation. Respirators much greater supply anyway, though, available hcws environmental - anyone would contact. There's plenty blame go around failure goes way up.

That said, can't work place called ""Valhalla"" complain die. fairly warned. That's work places names like ""gentlestone safeoaks village"" ""sanitary meadows"". Oh certainly. that's going on, imagine tons people questionable morals make quick companies simply take advantage others, close shop making money investigations time come through. Sadly, trying enforce wearing masks likely lose passengers well (good riddance anyone boycotts airline protecting passengers). climate change related. Good. don‚Äôt deserve it. insight chronic fatigue symptom EBV well goes away eventually. chronic fatigue last 6 months EBV. EBV September recovered relatively quickly (about 2-3 weeks usually 4-6 weeks). chronic fatigue bad maybe lasted month two doctors see told could last 6. serious complications EBV well, viral hepatitis splenomegaly. cured :) absolutely nuts 1% entire US population confirmed positive. know comment probably frickin epic le reddit comrades, ironically completely useless people actually interested science. Totally agree. Letting novel virus spread hilariously stupid idea. selfish asshole valid point. 3-5years would understand now? wish worst things could happen long time, thats right feeling karma exists get bad things happen you. Nevermind probably live USA already fucked next 20years see feels living third world country fun things little happieness maybe Punishment enough. Jesus, yeah DFW ain‚Äôt far behind.

My whole life heard mass grave site nearby case pandemic would thousands spots ready CDC thought myth.

Like plan? fuck load death...? majority, often speak reasonable positions get downed extremes. forgot that... Bowling Green Massacre. cancer-causing windmills.


The shittiest Quixote. make big news story ban passenger set example. would take one two planes getting turned around mid-air people realize fuck airline's policy. people push limits. Easy peasy.  Lol  people attended protests recognize inherent risk. Compare picture see overwhelming mask compliance. People constantly giving hand sanitizer too. 

If criticized widely, human rights important protected 1st amendment. Alabama, finally first something. really. threat government agencies precise movement contact profiles every citizen quite substantial.

Especially since ways prevent spread virus. is? Suicides rise, deaths overdose, cancer going unscreened, heart disease, hypertension, high blood pressure, diabetes, vaccinations conducted mass scale, oh famine probably next. hey, least otherwise preventable deaths Covid. stopped twice. BCBS called waiting testing emergency center place like drive testing. website says cover cost testing. BCBS said went network place would liable charges might add. 

The places network testing symptoms. Seems either get tested pay did. Hope well! earlier comment bit laugh, thinking seriously, year's protection better nothing, could actually game changer production ramped right.

They've already produced enough doses vaccinate entire UK christmas, plus fair chunk EU well. Plus India institute produced large number doses India developing countries elsewhere. production remains steady rest world vaccinated original countries still immune. Maybe it'll yearly shot years, long (maybe five years?) we'll well ahead virus spread. pleasantly surprisingly nuanced reporting found could dual citizenship whole family spent $6k last three years so... case. Karens antibodies? mom did. funeral less. flown American Airlines well Southwest within last two weeks. AA flights totally booked close it. require masks plane, even handed masks needed boarded. hand, SW flights purposefully totally booked, asked us sit middle seats unless already household contacts. SW also requiring everyone wear masks. Hospital custodian here! stopped giving us hazard pay directly work infected patients yet clean infected rooms handle infected garbage. Probably going quit soon get better job words. I‚Äôve got words. literally thread skyrocketing cases Texas I‚Äôm telling I‚Äôve lost relatives due virus balls doubt me? Yeah, thanks Aunt Jeanie passing away, I‚Äôm super glad use death win internet argument.

But..but temperature screening theater get get virus super spread get high temperature well! welcome tough time live every bit kindness counts. We're gonna make ! flew 2 weeks ago US American Airlines flights masks required. one them, one guy pulled mask cover mouth (his nose exposed) flight attendant asked pull mask back up. sure airlines regarding people wearing incorrectly wearing masks.... Since low wage worker expense cross border &amp; business countries? Profits: important thsn lives gonna wear mask 14 hours. Asian.

 Hey friends, created petition you‚Äôd like sign &amp; share it. basically states importance wearing masks Public settings due COVID19 cases rise AZ. I‚Äôm asking governor consider making law cases lower. Thank you! Noice (as Brit would say) janitors cleaning maids(or correct term is) really heroes, shit clean every day, really underappreciated! British pilot, Vietnam's severe Covid-19 patient, started practice walking communicate verbally, Health Ministry said Monday.

Dr Nguyen Tri Thuc, director Ho Chi Minh City‚Äôs Cho Ray Hospital, treated since May 22 lung infection kidney failure, said condition 43-year-old improving.

He begun walk assistance strength gradually returns limbs.

The man also communicate well verbally doctors remembers passwords phone tablet. appetite improving eats mashed soup milk every day, longer requires antibiotics lungs continue improve.

He sunbathes¬†every morning gets physical therapy daily.

Health ministry officials described recovery ""miraculous"" experts earlier prognosticated would take weeks get ventilator recover movement.

First diagnosed March 18 Covid-19, British man, pilot Vietnam Airlines,¬†has hospital almost three months now. declared cured disease May 20 gained consciousness week later.

Vietnam gone two months without community transmission. 334 people diagnosed Covid-19 far, 323 recovered rest hospital. you‚Äôre shown knowingly travel ill you‚Äôre charged terrorism. Really? beaches? went fishing Palos Verdes today‚Äîsaw 20 people there. meant bullshit. think lying Fun fact, American cheese industrial chemicals yellowish coloring. real cheese.

So......

Your post correct case would need different kinds vaccines?

This would really scary cuz even common cold grants type resistance different strand doesn‚Äôt, means different strand would be... different whole genetic structure right? Worked VA short while. One worst jobs I've ever had. Minimum wage exposed MRSA, radioactive medications, feces/urine/bodily fluids, diseases patient might have. VA give FUCK us. complained conditions, got fired questions asked. Year long probationary period.  disseminate knowledge more

Wayy many dumbidiots reddit shouting like antivax bitches every time vaccine mentioned dare people enjoy life! fun forbidden! sweat, blood tears allowed! native Americans overwhelmingly blood type still hit hard Corona virus? Yes, people dont know shit information technologies, see witchcraft. least like time Masks political position now, thanks big guy DC fact certain political party‚Äôs base shooting antimasker conspiracies since mid-April earlier. Might well burn entire house, safe IATA‚Äôs ‚Äúairline doctor‚Äù David Powell said forget masks - Right. re-openings going death us. NOTHING changes there's vaccine effective therapeutics. virus infect brain. suspect go dormant reactivate. 

I see dead virus cause severe symptoms death. must active virus that's got really scary implications. nowhere, came New Zealand funeral. funeral planned quarantine period.

How could come NZ funeral person died arrived?

They given exemption spend isolation period living relative deceased person lied symptoms so.

There zero evidence lied, Covid symptoms exactly unique, would easy mistake confuse symptoms pre-existing chronic condition, give benefit doubt put pitchforks away, least anything comes prove otherwise. Abbott fucking *hates* metro areas Texas. could care less Austin, San An, DFW, greater Houston, El Paso lost thousands lives. Good thing get GPS data. Los Angeles well. Stores require them. [More 200k tested test per confirm case ratio think understand aggressive mandatory quarantine is. come direct contact infected person, forced quarantine remote facility 14 days. One person testing positive could mean quarantine hundreds other.

Land border China closed end Jan. Air travellers China closely monitored that. 

China also locked worse affected area since Lunar New Year. example, [most US infections actually came EU US one worst responses world well. compare Sweden US, that's bad sign. like people hurting economy Sweden. unemployment rate one highest Scandinavian country. ""We lied convenient us so"" record, considered amongst ""survival rate."" So, even though people technically survive Covid, still want catch thing there's lot still unknown long-term effects. ""just like flu."" call Thumpbies. Can't think never ever question trump everything. Texas native‚Äînot likely. Abbott usual shitty self. asymptomatic cases. talking may, sometimes. Like every single illness. Even common flu leave permanent lung heart damage. basically, compared marathon, crossed half way point reached pitstop, decided break enjoy tons beverage oak tree come crashing them. proud Governor Hotstuff! risk sounding like edgelord, surprised major 'mutinies' ships. know people even vote 2016 election?

Using term ""most"" paint accurate picture. Turnout eligible voters (ie people legally vote) 55.7%. wanted count entire population yes, people vote 18 older legally vote states (48) various restrictions convicted felons incarcerated inmates comes voter eligibility. think honest assessment would say ""almost half people could otherwise vote chose to."" quite succinct misleading either. I‚Äôm AZ resident. 

Fuck. These. People. endangering everyone‚Äôs health good reason. sub sharing news Oxford Moderna vaccine, useless news Haters would say news also propaganda............. Good work China, probably started virus

So hopefully redeem good vaccine  Twitter's unmoderated, that's always case. ok, power Christ compel virus far highest death rate second highest unemployment rate. Really awful time living Sweden. Report hate speech mask ordinance part TX? Either way, people wearing them? wearing area protest it‚Äôs $300 fine not. Witcher III pretty good.... appears virus also racist far America, absolutely enjoyed torturing black men slavery !

No one angel day age. Every one monster. 

Just better PR overall image others.

So side one lambasting other, part problem. problem is: want effective Vietnam, privacy rights ditched. real life, scale testing easier said done. Vietnam gone great lengths locate virus, even utilising methods could controversial countries stricter privacy rights. **It publishes detailed travel history every new patient social media local newspapers order seek people close contact them.** increase vigilance, government also released mobile app people alert authority suspected infections area. people entering country, health declaration compulsory, criminal penalties false declarations.  would claim measures intrusive would doubt effectiveness implemented elsewhere. may true. Vietnam one-party state decades experience mobilising population wars, Sars [swine Lung damage documented asymptomatic cases...  Could long term effects rear up... That'd require read entire post. saw weird spelling. Witcher III pretty good... Trump: FDA, dare humiliate me. Wall.

Let's build it.

Make good. 

Make permanent.

Block gringos entering!!! nowhere, came New Zealand *for* funeral. funeral planned quarantine period.

They decided wanted leave quarantine early *plan* funeral. lied symptoms so. Death rate according South Korea stats 2.3%. don‚Äôt think missing 90% cases. Compared what? CCP's Global Times China Daily rag?! sure lie, one get tests. met one person tested. met many stayed hospital Pneumonia. fair, ""it's 4.5h high speed trail away"" üëÄüò∏ 'rose' twitter generally represents word politics

Any l3ft leaning twitters usually rose symbol. Security theater. Like 9/11. O, they've listened petition. slogan ""Deadliest Place Earth"". Also much lower wouldn‚Äôt doctors treating positive patients outdoors?

Huh? 

Do treat ANYONE outdoors anything ever? Many diseases improve w vitamin still give pills. Depression linked time indoors (especially seasonal depression) still give people pills. 

I‚Äôm return sanitariums ‚Äúfresh air sunshine‚Äù complimentary methods treatment unfortunately don‚Äôt here. Hi embodiment ignorant, today? saw like 4 5 assholes, everyone else seemed super nice. course though, look replies shittier ones likely bottom. Regardless, least rest assured almost top tweets nice.

the r/coronavirus duality man. Jared owns shares company makes understand feel. make good points.

Goalpost keeping virus numbers low solved. Normal life change, going theme park far priority, especially country worst outbreak PLANET. packed beach crowded bar (both open yet) anyone studied virus spread, they'd call others understanding. /rant Scary. Thank god masks required Los Angeles County inside store. Good point!


Where live (Quebec, Canada), health authorities said increase social distancing stay indoor, thought preposterous. stay indoor certain amount time infected person, gut feeling tells bound infected well, risk increasing time, mask mask.


I also found reference (but virus fairly recent jury still german God's name wrong people

You obviously ICE people got infected died, r/coronavirus holding back then, see would now. would fine becomes norm wear mask symptoms cold/flu etc. actually shocking long time acceptable people would go bus/school/work/etc coughing sneezing place. father high risk regular flu well stressing years. don‚Äôt think depressurizing high altitude fun chance  Wow. 3 hours wicked bot snuffed this. Pleasant surprise. No, would wrong calling blood disease. rather endothelial cell disease. virus invades endothelial cells, specifically blood cells. Endothelial cells widely found brain. 

Do spread misinformation clearly know it. please sit closely together unless pay extra social distancing seats wonder actually opposite effect expect. Maybe protesters become vaccinated repeated sub infective exposure. 

This happened Polio vaccine. Sanitation good 1940s area/homes got indoor plumbing sinks got sick first. Poliomyelitis part human history millennia. Egyptian stone engraving depicting debilitating effects poliomyelitis dates 3,000 years ago. time, occurrence polio rare, sanitation poor. close proximity people raw sewage bestowed protective immunity polioviruses, reside feces. sewage treatment became better indoor plumbing became widespread twentieth century, exposure virus became less protective immunity less likely develop children. news media also check SCMP (Based Hong Kong). ""CoVid"", ""Covid"" ""COVID"". Coronavirus one word, two. Japan hardly tested population. Trump method lower testing, lower number infected. think people coming together different states cities possibly countries. Social distancing park goers possible strict enough limits occupancy place. Church problematic mainly due fact impossible effectively social distance church. covid end May. mentally foggy like 2-3 weeks recovered. Hang there. liken sex stranger without condom. Yeah may feel good time being, may end killing you, still risking pretty major complications road momentary fun.

Crowded bars high risk time being. want socialize, socialize. want sex stranger, wrap up. (and applies both) crowded bar right please. I'll chop hair idgaf hair looks, dont plan impressing anyone beat USA again. almost like science self corrects. Weird. ruined loophole others. Next thing know, allowed spread virus claiming entire family trapped inside bus go 50mph alone save them. airlines lost decades ago TSA nonsense so....poor choice, it'll likely cost ya, good luck. need help warn others contact days tested positive. Shameless report. western media going toilet. salmon theory one many investigated experts, media government China. US like China case. Steal formula manufacture without compensating SinoVac. Oh it‚Äôs definitely protests, states bunch governors don‚Äôt give fuck apparently. didn‚Äôt blame solely said spreads covid. separate everything People refuse Strategies covid people follow recommendations, industries, countrys, airplanes everything. would feel much saver would nice see outcome. Absolut inpractible still nice dream. Lol, showing everyone one. ok, bud. thread talk US 5-minutes, fairy dies.

It matter thread is, guarantee within 5-minutes reference US Politics. Tragic! hate this! downvoted show everyone Reddit become . Beautiful phrase: ""Surely belong God shall return"" I‚Äôm idiot knew case. clubs still open... n95s finding sale? cost us spike cases 18 states! month month data. may 2019 vs may 2020. effects lockdown far weighing effects virus. Suicides, alcoholism, addictions general, deaths lack surgeries, Compromised immune system‚Äôs fear media invoked. 

The facts people age 70 .002% death rate. (As per CDC) 70 3%. Thats serious risk. People age 70 locked down. 95% working economy age 70. destroying infrastructure economy. much feel you, unfortunate situation really leverage. entitled fully make use property share. nothing stop it.

Seen similarly Northern Italy Wuhan far hardest hit places early spared new spikes, hoping something exposure public mindfulness, guess we‚Äôll see Memes apart, high chance fact that, thats USA USA What's problem wear mask 7 trillion dollars pumped financial markets economy. unlimited stimulus future funds could go instead. Big news! good news. U.S., think death rates also going result much better clinical familiarity illness among medical community. 

And policy containment makes sense. medical breakthroughs, big small, save lives among afflicted. we're pushing back inevitable, merely maintaining sufficient number beds, containment measures we're making new reality within virus acts.

Also, article shockingly poor job explaining math presents? took longer understand percentage decline death rates applied, 5 times 10 equal 50, 35 - guess average course treatment must 7 days (a strange confusing way presenting information).

But, whatever. Great news! agree developing _one_ European app even one global app would lot efficient, likely comes data protection. Even limited anonymised data app gets, would still lot heckling involved figuring one server stores data reside. even get started federated storage approach.

Under conditions nobody would app 2035. already direction states dept ed. Great. Schools don‚Äôt need wasting $, ever. long getting return normal life risk corona outrumps utility staying indoors safe bored people continue go outside.

So increase utility value staying indoors gives utility going outside would.

Some ways could perhaps making list things want, bmx bike, ps5 maybe.

Now calculate money someone‚Äôs willing spend 5 months restaurants, bars, etc.

So could tell something like, don‚Äôt go outside next 5 months.... PS5 November! Sooner spend $250 month restaurants, probably do. that‚Äôs one way. way comment productive? address points, add anything conversation. Would care share old are? people know ""social distancing"" like still enjoy life bars, restaurants etc damn stay least safe distance fucking hard ffs.

Thanks making point, bud I'm sorry post generic title. originally posted article title reflective contents, got nagged ""you must follow every rule perfectly"" person, deleted post reposted all.

That's 5 minutes spent repost could spent actual research. Ugh. Genuinely curious, seen people make argument/similar. many elderly people believe reside US? 

A quick google search shows new york state roughly 3.2 million individuals age 65. total confirmed deaths according worldometer new york 31000. 

That leaves lot at-risk individuals still left, that's even including anyone risk reasons age (underlying health conditions). 

Even deaths currently slowing (which hope continues so) still plenty at-risk people. going open/close/open/close out. Use pulse oximeter. built phone. patronize various businesses around town, making mental list ones taking obvious precautions ones aren't, know go again.

Sadly, place (food service) employment blacklist account one employee required wear mask one top executives mocking passing wearing mask voluntarily. also 1,014 new cases, high positive test rate 15.4% virtually contact tracing; add already signs strain hospital system 68% beds currently occupied.

Most European capitals 27 new cases every day, happy progress! 

Is possible Chinese overreacted virus hysteria overreaction generated around world worse virus? 

It's extremely important remember China totalitarian dictatorship follow lead public health interventions. rights extend far someone else's begin. selfish essential liberty.

it goes say masks effective people direct contact ill, sick ppl wearing mask important EVERYONE.

and since know shedding stage symptoms lasts 14 weeks, wearing mask even though FEEL sick YET around ANYONE bad respiratory symptoms always recommendation.

Then several videos piles body bags morgues plus mass graves.

I think people think invincible interrupted. henry ford built trucks Nazis, america 101. advocating use government coercion others get comply way thinking, better worse - different. That's dangerous, I'll never agree. think judging virus low % actually dies little dishonest. 1918 1-2% IFR, killed 1/5th global population. Covid seems similar IFR based antibody studies completed far.  1% IFR unchecked US would kill 3.3 million. also go people recover, end long-lasting even lifetime health issues like decreased lung capacity. yes, good portion people get mild cases recover, really put much context true severity. 

And think misunderstood point 4-5 days. Let's say 10,000 people contracted Covid given city course protests last weeks. That's probably high estimate, let's use it. Roughly half people develop symptoms, tested. Another 10-20% mild cases may also tested. least half people ever counted testing contribute case increases. we're left around 30% 3,000 people likely group tested, moderate severe cases would also contributed potential hospitalizations. 

Now, Covid R0 around 6, pretty high virus. means single person spread roughly 6 people. Since asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases also contagious. every single one 10,000 people spreads 6 people, would 60,000. would take 60,000 average 4-5 days start showing symptoms, takes us 8-10 days past original 10K infected. start accounting tested hospitalized (hospitalization lagging factor another week 2 past appearance symptoms), starts getting impossible explain current spikes result protests, likely events June 1.

Nationwide Healthcare system weakened *too few* patients. never anywhere close capacity. agree everyone getting sick would bad. Wtf people.  'Again, I'm saying going conclusions press release anything premature.'

The NHS already rolled treatment patients oxygen ventilation. clearly pretty confident. pandemic actively killing people everyday I'd agree waiting best known drug limited side effects seems proven effective low doses, big bosses top NHS clearly made decision risks implementing limited.

'A NNT 8 also wild drug used degree disease beginning. amount scrutiny disease getting, effect truly great I'm surprised buzz earlier.'

I surprised given wards patients ventilation medical staff concerned overrun trying keep people alive proper scientific analysis effects particular drug. imagine settings mixture drugs administered telling worked difficult, use random controlled trials. important thing disease IFR 0.5% less. means 5 people died, 1000 people, including 5, infected; irrespective symptoms, reports, testing, etc. think virus biologically, human social constructs like policy, hospital, govt, testing, etc. non-biological irrelevant constructs.

5 people dead = 1000 infected

5,000 dead = 1000,000 infected

50,000 dead = 10,000,000 infected 

and on.

Whether reported not, tested nor, symptomatic not, independent this.

This simple school mathematics.

If somehow find IFR much lesser 0.5%, say 0.3% 0.2%, reason rejoice.

Places like Korea Germany reliable numbers due efficiency transparency. 

I think trust IFR estimates places. Federal Reserve start buying real estate wonder that's people Facebook AERD group reporting severe cases COVID-19. (A lot scared, though.) majority us steroids anti-inflammatories.

Finally, agree one thing! Granted twist words find something agree on, I'm sticking I'm done. brackets made realize error. mixed percents decimals. X*.001 = 0.1%X commenter asked legit question reaction completely uncalled for.  think calculate % dying?

You definitely nearly 5% dying this. People younger 50 even 1%. 

It's super old fragile people dying much get high %.

Also deaths even 9k since weeks. much better answer. areas seeing increase low numbers start. 

LA ""hardest"" hit southern state numbers rapidly declined show sign stopping.

Edit: non-Americans LA stands Louisiana. Hydroxy-bro-yolo-quin. many vaccines good results far really optimistic. June 9th, FL low 5.24% stabilized (actually increasing) 5.4%. TX stabilized around 6.75% since May 27th.

W.t.f. Imagine this: post comment stupid, instead defending comment go post history attack me. Pretty weak man. defend original comment?

Also, posting conspiracy =/= believing conspiracy. Another logical fallacy - great false equivalency. Moreover, conspiracies come true. MKULTRA, Nayirah Testimony, etc. conspiracies cut cloth. ""conspiracies"" found true nothing like chemtrails, etc. Yet another fallacy committed - part whole fallacy.

Fuck man, really suck this, you? Every state random number actively diagnosed cases new cases added daily. states reopened new cases trending downward states reopened peaked. 

Most states also reopened even met testing goals means number cases time reopening based artificially constrained data. clear picture number positives state. confirmed cases symptomatic confirmation days behind infection continued spread. little insight asymptomatic cases all. 

The degree quickly virus overwhelms area largely dependent factors like endemic virus area. 

If one positive case R0 4, likely infect average four people. states reopened lot increasing active infections. think one state starts reopening cases see quicker growth states reopened less cases. 

The R0, itself, dependent conditions like face mask compliance. Geez, anything British bringing disease places visit? Nationally numbers (cases, deaths, hospitalizations, ICU usage, ventilators, positivity rate, symptom surveillance) still declining. 

I idea idea plateau ""second wave"" coming from. Warms heart countries getting this. I‚Äôm US aren‚Äôt even close.  Yeah headline worried found new mutation increased infectiousness further, reporting earlier mutation. viruses even infectious one like measles, compared cold flu viruses it‚Äôs crazy infectious. use months. takes time research get results couple years ago, dealt condition called ureteropevlic junction obstruction, meant path right kidney bladder partially obstructed. caused sharp pain kidney whenever full urine drain. also caused high blood pressure, kidney failure-like symptoms. go renal diet keep pain somewhat bay waited 3 months diagnosis getting surgery correct it.

Check wolfram alpha believe  Jean short wearers everywhere shambles serious them, perhaps, people still contagious asymptomatic carriers. easily infect vulnerable, contributing widespread illness deaths become critically ill. Seriously. People suck. Covid calendar becoming quite full... everyone gets sick once, healthcare system actually likely dreaded total collapse time around. severely weakened Wave 1. 

Fingers crossed jump cliff, too. standard line thought, 100+ companies lined trying make vaccines.

The solution make free, solution everyone pay unexpected medical costs beforehand. Like sort insurance something. Like, maybe part taxes. spit-balling here. many less people died also due response? 

The thing is, calculate excess deaths, regions reports *fewer* average deaths set zero. argument impossible tell legitimately fewer deaths normal, under-reporting deaths.

It's ""fine print"" methodology nobody ever takes time excess deaths US overall computed sum jurisdiction-specific numbers excess deaths (**with negative values set zero**), directly estimated using Farrington surveillance algorithms. Summation (rather estimation) chosen account possibility *some jurisdictions may substantially incomplete data jurisdictions report may deaths expected*, negative positive values cancel estimating excess deaths US directly using Farrington surveillance algorithms. *Until data finalized (typically 12 months close data year), possible determine whether observed decreases mortality using provisional data due true declines incomplete reporting*. Thus, computing excess deaths directly US, *negative values due incomplete reporting jurisdictions offset excess deaths observed jurisdictions*. example, total number excess deaths US computed directly US using Farrington algorithms approximately 25% lower number calculated summing across jurisdictions excess deaths. difference likely due several jurisdictions reporting lower expected numbers deaths ‚Äì *could function underreporting, true declines mortality certain areas, combination factors*.

So means (hypothetically) 5 regions reported

Most serology studies showing least order magnitude count total infections. 10M infections would count 3.5x seems pretty unlikely. Serological studies need development already quite bit data suggesting 10x number probably ballpark - would put US fatality rate 0.4% seems right. Well, 2 weeks later seem general increase cases, I'm seeing much evidence linked protests.

My theory we'll actually see downstream community spread protests appear testing 2-4 weeks now, super easily traced back.

RemindMe! 4 weeks They've reconciled old unassigned/backlog cases. That's why.  seems like Canadians able enter US via plane, vice-versa. severe covid-19 cases immune system that's strong? case Spanish flu too? read somewhere couple weeks ago whole pandemic started get hand, lucky time primarily seems difficult people weak immune systems opposed Spanish flu took way people especially young healthy ones.

For medical providers news. Ditto  Yea I'm NYC past two weeks looked like videos across country Ozarks, Florida, etc. Since entered phase 1 last Monday, mask compliance gradually dwindled people care anymore. shame, well throughout April May. complicated :P

If typical virus, yes. could expect adaptive secondary immune response effective even antibodies long gone due antigen-specific helper B &amp; cells created primary immune response.

But immunopathology COVID-19 quite atypical, assume normal case applies here. Severe cases COVID-19 show many markers broad profound immune dysregulation, point immune response really seems damage. Think body fighting series overcompensations.

With model mind, certain expect secondary immune response look like. Maybe body correctly encode errors creating memory cells mount effective, less damaging response next time. maybe it'll make mistakes made first time, system already place speed things along. again, maybe speeding along disrupt chain dysfunctional responses... 

You get picture. know expect. thing expect function expected. update numbers week 24 Thursday week 23 50k (when update tests VG) grew 15k week VG increase top normal smaller ones. 24 regions testing mild symptoms 25 (current one) Stockholm tests well.. guess

But think could dismantle them, suggested.  always like that. can't keep paying people stay home nothing like right know drug companies going ever sell shit loss love humanity, making profit sell 10 dollars could making profit US sold 10

This fairly simplistic view profitability. production cost additional dose might 2 bucks, never pay R&amp;D capital costs 9 bucks everyone charge Brazilians price afford Americans price ""afford.""

Yes, frivolous marketing costs, numbers far lower less impactful reddit would believe. arent dropping prices tenfold cutting expenses. scary, seems like suffering symptoms second infection? Someone mum works caught early March sick 4 weeks, since perfectly fine, testing facilities massively improved UK got test turned positive, two weeks ago he's still completely asymptomatic. He's self isolating now, saying since beating virus (the first time?) best he's ever felt. Yeah get sick muscles like imma get JACKED it‚Äôs cheap leave chronic problems. stating definite. problems source says leaves everyone chronic problems I'd love see it. people still fly back forth? driving? would assume goes both, right? Yep. Also, masks Italy basically mandatory anywhere (and almost nobody complains!), think makes huge difference 1) keeping downward trend new cases 2) Explaining fact new cases generally severe cases discovered February-March (reduced viral load) thought well established fact Fair point. going call Brazil post, because....

Sexy sexy Brazilians! really sad thing. feel like wife‚Äôs uncle would perfect candidate this. 57, prior health conditions. hard battle seemed never get better every day got worse. ventilator day two gone. 2 weeks total sick. nurse shock still talking put vent. even shocking didn‚Äôt make it.

This also Brazil. wife‚Äôs mom lives States us 4 brothers Brazil. haven‚Äôt even able see other. bury next day sit watch cars. mom (my wife‚Äôs grandma) doesn‚Äôt even know yet worried die heartache one even visit comfort fear could give her. wife‚Äôs mom stuck since can‚Äôt travel Brazil right now.

This thing fucking worst. someone educate steroids work general ans great thing? know sometimes gotten sick, I'm given z-pack (from understand steroids) steroids work? steroids help body make white blood cells? 
This great thing would like understand better great thing. people wanting work jobs available them. That's problematic don‚Äôt understand anything works, you? said thing toilet paper... Texas going blue election. Mark words.   mean won‚Äôt milder form illness necessarily require treatment all? public health standpoint least. It‚Äôs basically flu point. 

The critical issue saving lives severe cases overwhelming hospital capacity. USA hospitals bill $500/dose Considering many obese patients statins died COVID, probably no? what? Back December literally one case planet one point. 

The virus spreads, zero cases arent woods Remindme! 2weeks MS take medication normalizes immune system. widely advertised prescribed label, switched Low Dose Naltrexone would right immune system longer suppressed. Actually there's research Coronavirus LDN keeping immune system normalized cytokine thing happen. seems appropriate follow policy 'If anything good say, say it.' Would agree?

Bengladesh 22,000 new cases per week. Brazil 180,000 new cases per week. Err, cytokine storm theory still play? though major consensus shifting general blood poisoning contamination immune response *that* prettt much use prednisone getting at. expensive job prednisolone.

Needs come want set I‚Äôm SW Florida went salon Saturday wearing mask everyone looked like crazy. 4 employees 3 customers wearing masks. guess Florida doesn‚Äôt care anymore. mean, POTUS healthy big fucking deal, expect halfwit like realize rate death 443 million die, whole population infected. like thing spreads exponentially looks like nothing now. studies showing otherwise published science pointing ineffective. unlikely homemade mask commercially produced mask would yield situation CO2 buildup clinically significant nature could occur.

One could engineer tight fitting respirator badly designed exhaust flow could, principle someone might accidentally.

But risk people would normally need worry about.

The intersection people right materials design skill make tight fitting respirator yet lack knowledge handle exhaust appropriately likely low. someone says ""US deaths X country now"" hate response ""but look deaths per capita, we're even close"".

It's completely invalid argument completely different metric.

Is strictly jest factual information keep interesting. Always gotta stick supply chain comrades. one ever thinks us unless run something. wear mask work, try clean every often. believe though, recommend washing every use. However, think big waste water washer. want confirm clean mask every shift

Secondly, thinking hand washing mask order avoid wasting water. special consideration handing washing mask? figure pretend washing mask dish - fill sink hot water soap scrub. really interesting considering initially said prednisone close family member dexamethasone, potent long lasting...puts people increased risk death covid...perhaps suppresses immune system. Bars PBC , Broward, Miami Dade open yet. entire state. kinda surprising jacksonville closing bars.

&amp;#x200B;

Also florida testing seeing increase positives way (which normal IMO), disturbs increase hospitalizations. numbers totally synched dashboard. zeitgeist dictionary edition 2020 thinking ‚ÄúKaren‚Äù years top word. isn‚Äôt.

Like, next week? insane-o use bathrooms It‚Äôs also used vaccine I‚Äôm trying qualify commercial use I‚Äôm screwed lol. 

Good news though! dismissed symptoms pre existing condition, considering precautions people apparently took trip down, including pissing side road avoid public restrooms, I'm inclined believe them.

Thanks sharing story. Everybody wants use coronavirus beat people/places like anyway, regard actual numbers. People honestly think coronavirus punishment stupidity something rather result things like high population density, high rates incoming international travel, strong culture freedom individual rights makes severe measures less free therefore less affected places impossible implement. (The U.S. never going okay hands sprayed sanitizer every time enter grocery store neighborhoods quarantined every time single case cropped up--I mean seriously NY declare civil war Trump mentioned quarantining dumpster fire compared rest country.)

I see lot references sub awful, selfish, uneducated people ruining everything complying mask requirements something there's always insinuation *certain types*. New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania: states make third cases. New York alone makes 18% cases, yet think NYers people mind they're going ""US stupid incompetent"" rants. NY strictest containment measures one slowest open--and month anywhere 2k-11k new cases day. Meanwhile Texas like *6 days* 2k everyone's like: yeah, reopened early stupid stuff, ha ha. 

California, Texas Florida currently top list new cases. also states highest populations. point complicated people want make be. troll asking is? realize everyone reddit American, right? might guy Bangladesh confused random woman's father's death top sub. I‚Äôm COVID ICU nurse hospital Tucson. unit FULL. Every patient positive. Every patient one ventilator. People dying alone, without families, incredibly long battles COVID. elderly, frail people dying...these mostly relatively young people everyday health conditions like hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol.

This SICKEST population we‚Äôve ever seen, take care critically ill adults state. 

Don‚Äôt flippant, uninformed, willfully ignorant asshole fellow Americans dying, grieving, suffering. 

There sharp up-tick numbers cases, critical illness, deaths since restrictions lifted. health system alone triple number ventilated patients previous peak admissions. 

The reason aren‚Äôt bodies street they‚Äôre dying hospital room, hold hand listen families sob phone. aren‚Äôt street clean wheel morgue die, stay safe, away fortunate eyes. They‚Äôre street taking care them, don‚Äôt to. Yeah can't test everyone, even somehow sufficient capacity, everyone going go get test. to. They'll isolate two cases, trace contacts, isolate them, etc it'll stay control. still gonna RNC lol. Good times Pretty low slighlty slow cases. State posted guidlines today, 200 pages. got skim far looks like goal offer options including opt physical schooling well. really glad see remote table level. means prepared things need go full remote. 

I question district. shared picture meeting today. 7 people sitting 10 feet apart outdoors. Great social distancing stuff, two months think hundreds kids inside one building.... really makes wonder. 

Unfortunately info right Facebook page. tried asking harder questions nicely gotten ignored. guess glad got something state. Waiting till late July would really stress out. RoK catch 6k outbreak, PRC catch 80k outbreak Germany went 6k cases/day rolling average 300/day possible stop it. 

The freaking joke Western defeatism, turn seems American defeatism central Europeans actually show possible.  Completely well Japan. blame stupid fucking Lt Gov.


Both bunch fucking morons  That's actually odd argument. Masks normal China, South Korea, Japan years, remember single case criminal used conventional masks hide identity. tell results antibody test?

Edit: Yes will. fucking weren‚Äôt Jesus Christ teach Intensive. want me? understand now. thought saying it‚Äôs similar odds death anyway. Yes agree you. It‚Äôs news actual research pointing effect. also severe ventilated patients high risk dying without it. Pneumonia one long list problems. point?  end result many people get covid19 survive going long term complications.  actual issue stating this?

I love people shout anyone trying discuss death aspect virus calling doom gloom moment people attempt discuss recover get trashed well. Lets say 8 people ventilator.

Under usual circumstances 3 8 would go onto die. drug 2 8 would die.

2 deaths third less 3 deaths risk death cut third patients ventilators. wants destroy country. She‚Äôs horrible person deserves horrible things happen her.

Maybe twisted god‚Äôs way telling something... hmm idk sayin Vietnam better US. Sigh!!!‚Äô painting awful broad strokes wildly diverse demographic One first things used SARS steroids; discussion / use steroids already COVID? Sturgis? Official count ""a shit ton"". Thank god Fuck.  find lot [thread link pro/con debate. ""con"" side arguing steroids shown effective treatment SARS.

On top that, many steroid interventions high does. 500mg 1mg.

That's situation COVID dexamethasone. strong evidence effective treatment. given low RECOVERY trial launched April randomised clinical trial test range potential treatments COVID-19, including **low-dose dexamethasone** malaria drug hydroxychloroquine.

""The dose makes poison"" suspected scam? something back apart bogus arguments like 'typical chinese company'? Us too. Walmart grocery pickup life saver. cap highest price sells countries meets certain volume threshold (i.e. Actual, real sales must occur price)

So can't price $1/dose 99% countries, $1M/dose Outer Elbonia, $900k/dose US. higher prices still give reason develop sell US, blocks market gouging we've get used to.

Allowing Medicaid negotiate prices would help lot too. extreme end worst case scenario, I‚Äôm worried that, like flu, *is* infectious colder months. could different Coronavirus, R0 much higher, it‚Äôs still totally transmissible Summer months. 

Our country could well run head first ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù 1,000+ deaths day encouraged federal, state, local government keep going mingle spend money ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt getting worse‚Äù. Flights cruises back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù capacity. Restaurants bars stop social distancing. Movie theaters reopen. Unemployment benefits small business loans dry up. 

Then, September/October hits. Now, virus already active hundreds thousands communities country. follows similar trajectory [the second wave Spanish time, starting point isn‚Äôt near zero, way less time react. Simultaneously, virus already highly active suburban rural communities lack necessary infrastructure treat patients. Could literal disaster. 

Unless vaccine widely distributed October, we‚Äôll find one way another true nature virus actually is. OK. see. still major embedded assumptions. analysis would seem apply intubated patients. death rate goes 40% 28% dexamethasone treatment among population. 100 intubated patients given course, would 12 less deaths - seems work closer 1 8 would live dexamethasone, without, 5 8 would live regardless, 2 8 die regardless.

So, even limited treatment worst-off patients, math seem work what's article. patients oxygen included, that's cohort cost would 20 courses treatment save live - 100 pounds. Together, cost would amounts, likely leaning towards 100 since oxygen patients are, presumably, larger cohort.

I'm sure numbers correct. major unstated assumptions, along appears information included article, combine reach conclusions stated.

It's big deal, really. academic article. think could presented much clearly without much effort. one repeated bullshit claim.

He culpable.

End story.

Stop trying defend POS. allegations death count trending states counting deaths. cause-of-death ""pneumonia"" ""covid-19"" certificate, ""covid-19"" case, even pneumonia due sars-cov-19 virus. know truth allegations. confident come out, eventually. quite bit understanding virus transmission looks like even disease low mortality rate exceptional job overrunning healthcare systems due relatively high hospitalization rate versus diseases combined length stay. version world people ignore happen. Stay safe. report gets worse gets better. Could symptoms weeks. Monitor breathing. another lockdown happens I'm legit gonna propose work remotely forever.  dont think we're yet. see whole villages dead scale. remember lot cases possible outcomes are:

* use experimental risky treatment could long term effects
* patient dies

Even medicine triggers long term effects, reason needed treatment first place save COVID.

Just like lot effects virus itself, bacterial infections result body absolutely destroyed virus.


Feel free ask away, shocked answer ""we know, know treatment better dying"". ""the virus care"" proximity Thor.

The virus care geographical proximity, traffic density, transport turnover inside outside.     
Believe virus *chances* infect people places populated visited. however possible reduce spread strict measures.     
A virus less *chances* spread places much visited populated. possible increase spread pretend there's problem.  
And Sweden perfect example that.     
BTW, we're comparing Sweden nordic countries obvious reasons could well compare european countries UK, Spain, Italy, Belgium, ~~France, Germany~~ (oops, no. anymore) see Sweden worst.     
I include countries suspicious data like Russia Belarus, Ireland, Portugal (very close Spain), Greece... better numbers Sweden. Interesting, colleagues aim getting level asap. guess advance faster workplace. comments tend better informed articles however. steroids also tons side effects. hydroxichloriquine isnt cure. product used label attaches ACT receptors virus cant. dont prexisting heart condition, worth trying side effects covid identical side effects lupus patients. given options id take it. could used basis preventative treatment new drug designed specifally covid. research continue. said negativity around trump likes rather hard science. Yeah they‚Äôre probably silenced/influenced government. Remember India‚Äôs govt yet acknowledge community transmission even though they‚Äôre number 4 world terms total covid cases. Heck even prime minister yet face media since pandemic began (he done total 0 press conferences unscripted interviews since coming power 2014) going cheap long. steroids year treat UC. Suddenly realising elbow job degraded mid-30‚Äôs. FML. take long Let‚Äôs hope Trump doesn‚Äôt get excited helping, otherwise we‚Äôll slander results get emotionally distracted science. let travelers free quarantine early compassionate grounds... CVS near give call. went pick prescriptions yesterday panic attack saw one side drive thru coronavirus testing. test instruct inside. like lines prescriptions testing right next other. People getting test cars windows rolled feet away me. Economy stronk! Stay bruh work AA I'm agreement you, seems like management loves putting things makes life difficult passengers. fly space available free even like flying them. Yeah. I'm indeed grateful! hope goes proper current state affairs US I'm still optimistic. I've wrong already. Make wrong again! ;) Yes 30% reduction, hence title original claim title misleading incorrect. simply subtracted, got 12%, claimed title misleading. I‚Äôm glad know calculate percentage change. Thats basically article saying. one health official saying ""We're prepared surge cases. OK."" Basically, they're ""open everything old people die, thats sacrifice need make"" plan, they're saying aloud now. One big proponents hydroxychloroquine French researcher Didier Raoult. published study later discredited showing effective covid19. Fox Trump came bandwagon little later.  don‚Äôt want read ‚Äúarticle‚Äù. 

There sensationalism fearmongering. Daily dooming ‚Äúarticles‚Äù. I‚Äôm tired it, It‚Äôs unhelpful. 

Instead, look numbers even deceiving. Steroid use efficacy original SARS controversial day serious side effects long possible beneficial effects, however, balanced significant side effects including nosocomial infections, hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, hypertension, gastrointestinal haemorrhage.7‚Äì9 Avascular necrosis bone (AVN) perhaps distressing medium term side effect steroids patients SARS. Preliminary data cohort 330 adult patients Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong received various doses steroids magnetic resonance imaging performed average 7.5 months illness onset showed AVN present 48 (14.5%, (unpublished data). 48, 16 (33%) unilateral involvement femoral head 19 (40%) bilateral involvement femoral head. 
 Wow! know diesels kind range. sign petition joined thousands protesters street believe due seniors taking disease serious younger people begun getting around more. mortality rate people 70 years age fairly low. 

Early outbreak lot seniors infected this, initial mortality rate much higher currently. while, drs even prescribing steroids say severe asthma flare bronchitis/pneumonia bc belief steroids worsened outcomes coronavirus patients. get honest comment simply sounded disgusting. agreeing disagreeing someone politically anything fact one parents died. 

If want show sympathy write something nice. don‚Äôt ad political bullshit it. two cents ... second wave, still first. Expect second wave fall.  Yep. China tested steroids (big surprise) steroids work viral pneumonia, bacterial pneumonia. sure many patients tested, standard give thousands patients starting dose steroids admitted.

Other countries also tried steroids sure origins pneumonia. steroids worked would already know it.

Funny news pops right FDA removes HCQ possible treatment drugs huh? Almost like want people panic able treat disease.

I frankly surprised would publish bad ""recovery"" numbers. Probably within margins error too. Guess panic high global pandemic need comfort people somehow. 

Just take pill, pillhead, ""what got lose?""

Remember:

There absolutely zero approved treatment virus besides oxygen. well many propose drugs give hope next day unsafe. software developer dont hardware emulate software works. dont this. human body reacts specific drug? recent papers statistical analysis actual science. one seems legit treats ppl r already hospital, means duration stay shortened, means hospitals less overloaded, main point lockdown social distancing. mean ""underpaid""

And make me, one complaining fortunes labor market. I'm fine Chart I'm looking right US 5.5% mortality world general 5.4%. I'm sure that's comforting 5,000+ family members lost loved one.

No, Sweden ""middle ground"" far unemployment goes. triple unemployment Iceland double unemployment Denmark. Scandanavian country higher unemployment Norway. Got source number made up? church hosted clinic. open whole town, congregants. Baby steps. bad math 0.0003% actual fatality rate would order magnitude even literally every person USA contracted COVID. Oklahoma well, crazy see many people wearing masks. asked one friends wearing mask told ‚Äúhe can‚Äôt find any‚Äù even though almost every store now. one continue work home go supplies need to. According articles back April Florida blocking Covid-19 death reports.  
This death low due Florida covering different death Covid-19. lack basic understanding biology. Hence think virus voodoo suddenly traits never documented before.  Out-of-patent patents aren‚Äôt favorite kind patents.


Today happy day. literally spend DOUBLE marketing, compared spend R&amp;D (including testing).

But, like said, infected already huge difference infected april. time goes on, going get better fighting disease. one two reasons: highlight fact people completely different ideologies viewpoints still sympathize one another, something world seems forgotten, AND/OR I'm self glorifying mentioned. Either way, time sympathize someone essentially purely evil people. fucking point? love people prattle dangerous obese breath say mast US obese.  validating concerns risk groups. Peer review important really means editor 2-3 academics read research paper gave thumbs up. actually quite low bar plenty rubbish gets it. 100% agree. like guy anyone watches video able see trying say. says plenty stupid stuff, reason latch onto one quote taken context lose credibility. like sub stay date coronavirus, posts yesterday quote fact getting downvoted, really puts sub.  heard. good Initially yes, ultimately age largest deciding factor fatality rates. apparently alright everyone state infected seem advantage polls. /r/woooosh different caring spelling. Given Sweden Japan done without shutdowns, well fact correlation lockdown measures reduced fatalities Covid-19....compounded little trouble countries faced across world removing lockdown measures I'm pretty confident saying worse all.

I can't quite put words much better things would without shut downs though.

Always overdramatic comments thought news cycle ADD corona we‚Äôve somehow managed forget entire GLOBAL PANDEMIC years? Wow. I've heard places call dexamethasone divorce drug. 

I've handful times though short periods. fun better dying.  Don‚Äôt worry, US Brazil catching up. go people actually believe doesn‚Äôt spread air?! That‚Äôs... absolutely insane. would spread 138 countries 50 states 2 months? \^ Anyone follow @ethicalskeptic? cuts AstraZeneca another privately owned firm competing others make bank selling governments. want buy stocks. want governments make orders companies. article even says know effective (not yet human trials), somehow know long last **if** work. well THINK know, full quote: "" **think** protect **about** year.""

 statement purposefully vague give people hope also making look good. another promise product tested. Ever wonder vaccines usually take years make? usually actually give someone vaccine, see effective ACTUALLY SEE VACCINE STAY EFFECTIVE YEAR MAKE STATEMENTS LIKE THAT. absolutely nothing base **conjecture** long vaccines lasted. COV-2 like common cold can't assume vaccine act way previous vaccines yet put human trials. country even COV2 circulating year yet, let alone vaccinated populace test groups year, number ENTIRELY CONJECTURE, based assumptions, derived science done similar family virus. meant drive stocks placate average person thinking safe ""go away"" winter. 


im saying possible, end race see monetize first make trillions selling governments companies racing first vaccine trying set publicly ones get attention funding wallstreet pushing stocks. ALREADY seen Moderna making baseless claims vaccine going great september blah blah.

only believe actually exists. even would really question smart getting vaccine even tested year yet human trials, norm. Side effects take long time manifest cases vaccines usually take long first place.. wait guys pay that? reported UK yesterday. assume layover Australia, chance picking low. hope infectious flight Australia layover.

Apart overdramatic minority one cares virus anymore ‚ÄòI want vaccine injected arm developed China‚Äô , said ONE ever! üòÇüòÇüòÇ Yes, there's lot people sub feel self-righteous yet. ""Another day, another Chinese company reports positive early clinical data COVID-19 vaccine.

Tuesday, China‚Äôs state-run Sinopharm inactivated COVID-19 vaccine developed subsidiary China National Biotec Group‚Äôs (CNBG) Wuhan Institute Biological Products triggered strong neutralizing antibody response phase 1/2 study.

It appeared working best middle strength given 28 days apart, participants dosing schedule developed neutralizing antibodies defend cell infection.

As today, **1,120 volunteers phase 1/2 trial received two injections vaccine low, middle high dosing strengths‚Äîor placebo‚Äîeither 14 days, 21 days 28 days apart, according CNBG. seroconversion rate 14-day 21-day schedule mid-dose 97.6%. 28 days, 100%.**

The company didn‚Äôt specify neutralizing antibody response rates low dose high one. also didn‚Äôt elaborate exact levels immune response, **only saying antibody titers ‚Äúhigh.‚Äù serious adverse event observed.**

The vaccine one two inactivated shots CNBG working on. Wuhan version pushed clinical trials April 12, another developed Beijing institute entered human testing late April. **Through two new vaccine production facilities Beijing Wuhan, CNBG aiming to** [**produce**](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-06/01/c_139105909.htm) **200 million doses inactivated COVID-19 vaccines year, according state news agency Xinhua.**

Now, phase 3 efficacy trial, **CNBG said will¬†collaborate several foreign companies organizations run study abroad**. final stage clinical trial necessary it‚Äôs yet clear whether neutralizing antibodies enough protect person COVID-19.

**Thing is, two experimental vaccines CNBG already offered employees large state-owned companies intend travel overseas,** Bloomberg last week, citing people familiar matter. offer relayed China‚Äôs State-owned Assets Supervision Administration Commission, government body oversees state-run enterprises.

Giving investigational vaccine people outside clinical trial protocol would unusual. in¬†these¬†uncertain times, travelers'¬†potential exposure virus places it¬†is still circulating may give researchers early understanding vaccine‚Äôs efficacy carefully designed phase 3 reads out.

CNBG‚Äôs announcement comes heels Sinovac Biotech‚Äôs. Monday, Nasdaq-listed Sinovac said inactivated vaccine, called CoronaVac, induced neutralizing antibodies 90% 600 healthy volunteers phase 2 part phase 1/2 study.

Before that, another Chinese biotech, CanSino Biologics, unveiled detailed phase 1 data recent Lancet study, adenovirus-vectored recombinant vaccine triggered neutralizing antibodies T-cell responses.

Right now, five home-grown, clinical-stage COVID-19 vaccines China racing products developed Western drugmakers, hoping first help relieve countries lockdowns. National Institutes Health [plans phase 3 trials vaccines Moderna, AstraZeneca Johnson &amp; Johnson coming months. Rather using dead strain novel coronavirus, three vaccines based pathogen's genetic materials."" That‚Äôs revealed 50% chance false negative right? 

Wasn‚Äôt one White House using? 35k new cases FUCK   funny thing is, guys gonna finally get want. states past point return. Get ready overrun hospitals.  Ten fucking full degrees warmer way miserable 96. Tell AZ FL cases ""flat best"" already tourists west coast apparently taking advantage Alaska loophole think states shut anything short bodies streets. budget situations dire.

It's going long, long year. drowned?  It‚Äôs fucking unreal still needs explained three whole months articles coming government agency could tell folks safe not. nobody proactively testing, maybe whitehouse high level agencies. require screenings tests. also think hotspots somewhat proactive can't say sure. think tests symptomatic people. I‚Äôm guessing don‚Äôt read articles posted sites either then. stick headlines? sure are. sister wearing mask grocery shopping got called ""Liberal Wimp"" woman 70's.

Best part sister much right center. Unfortunately, lid really option American public restrooms. Thank goodness &amp; Worldometer (though county-level every state graphs every state). Agreed mainly crippled them. mean impossible overrun, either, especially staff attrition falling revenues... thanks wretched, overly complicated system healthcare, system balancing tightrope. Interesting times sure. burned phone computer typed comment on? Sure, buddy. bark, bite. Yeah wtf like 100k people died three months, anyone care?  Arizona big retirement state? steroid induced avascular necrosis right hip dexa taken chemotherapy. reversable knowledge know possible side effect started taking them.

It also gave wild mood swings. physiatric side effects severe.

I also sleep taking needed sleeping pills offset this.

Steroid induced diabetes major risk.

There real serious side effects things. big reason social distance. longer delay infection, greater chances survival.

I understand social distance delaying infection gives greater chance survival. Eat hungry children. swiftly. increase expenses everything else stays same, easy peasy right? Christ swear nobody viewpoint ever managed business likely never  Everyone responding ‚Äúwell technically true‚Äù forgets fact still people dying hospitals whether test virus not.  There's nothing dishonest it, described correlation one sentence plain saying testing lot, numbers look bad

He say saying testing lot

He say he's stupid, he's lying.

He stated valid correlation. case count determined tests. can't pull numbers thin air. disturbing. I‚Äôm surprised isn‚Äôt bigger news actually. Predicted. Gonna happen places too.  taken context. (poorly) stating US higher confirmed rates coronavirus partly higher amounts tests. quote saying countries lower rates testing could experiencing cases report testing much. Put another way, US accurate data countries partly contributes numbers look bad US. still dumb comparison, he's trying save face make look better, obviously falling flat. stupid quote makes it, suggests actually believes fewer tests would mean fewer people coronavirus. That's misleading. burst laughing. Thanks. Oh clears then...:/ Vote. say New Zealand could pull they‚Äôre small, isolated, island, scarcely populated, rich, etc. Vietnam massive population, island, wealthy yet better pretty much West. Truly humbling moment Europe North-America. Greg Abbott moron. Corona virus cases doubled San Antonio since decided overrule mayor reopen businesses. incentive get people back work. state said they‚Äôre going continue pay extra $600/week till end year.

Really annoying people like haven‚Äôt missed day work since popped friends get sit home, smoke weed play video games day every day make money me. That‚Äôs right. Nobody ever willingly get ass go work they‚Äôre making money working.  Look war, you‚Äôre next!

HUh? War? *is* good for? thought would opposite We'll see November. hope youre right we're better elect Majority Americans impatient babies.  I'm honestly really let punk term. decent stuff bush. What? Average specific number - well-defined number, lots ""averages"" - refer specific number way describes typical value quantity. sounds like cheap advertising tax bullshit hate hit controversial find real answers Translating idiot speak normal person: coronavirus cases spike testing increases. necessarily mean new cases statewide upticks signs virus spreading rapidly been, testing people ever able confirm not. testing increases obviously number positive cases go up, also showing virus far less deadly previously thought. think Trump loses, state New York Biden's DOJ gonna make example him. don‚Äôt even go back far. Ask Mike Pence. estimated certain leagues need 10k staff/players quarantined. Including players, media, trainers, doctors, family etc.... we‚Äôre gonna using 10k tests per day make sure watch sporting event? 10k tests daily medical field desperately needs general population right now. isn‚Äôt even including fact they‚Äôre going testing Disney employees every day giving strict quarantine rules, there‚Äôs bound outbreaks anyways works people stop sleeping around fun actually get know partner first. period getting know root issues, HIV/AIDS. Thanks, want POTUS. 

No, I'd prefer strategically test -- logical way -- maximum impact. hospitalizations stable deaths declining, carefully reopening aspects society. 300 fewer deaths today last Monday. like 100 deaths next week, would totally insane fully reopen society commonsense public health measures. always baffles China never brought discussions. recently caught thousands upon thousands Chinese Twitter bots. 

China spent least 10√ó amount social media manipulation disinformation Russia has. Mount Richmore. Dennis Rodman's face too. Commander &amp; Chief, also happens fricken genius rocket scientist. /s guy screws loose. count shutdown begun say wave. There's need correct things need correcting. fart meal quote makes want vomit Nobody talking taxes- unemployment 8 months- owed like 6K. mess- many people would make withheld taxes  watched movie Gaslight first time couple weeks ago. JFC movie extremely disturbing. Probably one uncomfortable movies I've ever watched.  job 60-70 hours consistantly. problem making meaningful progress. Fast forward management started blocking progress top talent left within 3-4 months. stop shooting right now, we'd gunshot deaths, duh. man's genius, give nobel prize already. genes. horrific. I‚Äôm going nominate Nobel prize medicine. think figured loophole fix human maladies... except maybe diagnose without test plainly see eyes... still, pretty good work Monday. I‚Äôm even shocked anymore. course. Based what? feelings? look states new case count, Michigan outlier low side. Shows Whitmer's controversial strict social distancing orders worked. state reopen confidence speed places. got one removed I'm pretty salty about. think might remove get flagged one person  comparing flu United States one flu season 80k plus deaths. caps 130k season look back think made big deal this? clearly worse ""just flu bro"" exponentially worse seems works printer cartridge, must work global issues. isn‚Äôt fact said that‚Äôs shocking me. 

It‚Äôs fact blamed China treating virus like it‚Äôs joke failing respond, thing claims did. mean honestly, someone fucking dumb? 40% population! around 40%of people voted...which less half entire population. like maybe 20% population voted him. got 60 million votes...and way 100% votes ""base""....a good number 60 million held noses hated Hillary him. make numbers bigger. are, continue small minority population. go doctor cant get sick!!!!! understand context... stupid way look numbers sounds moronic Click link read article? isn‚Äôt /r/politics. really don‚Äôt think appropriate here.

Our comments probably smart ass Trump haters come high horse minutes ""slam"" thoughts ""own"" us. Probably jabronis think support guy offered rationalization table. *despise* that.  PA too, never got dime. like raffle. r/technicallythetruth much population yet infected, percentage wise. people go throw caution wind completely, rate could hit exponential increase again. guess we'll see. Proper weirdo are, entire profile hating Dutch people. Oh wasn‚Äôt trying start argument, pointing you‚Äôre fucking moron lol No, getting care nursing homes. getting care ICU. Proud Arizona gets better that. Let's look McShit example. states labor laws stating minors cannot work fryers grill. management typically adults too, leaves cashiers workers assemble food. Cool. they're school? shut store down? I've never seen McShit that's shut 7am-4pm due school. minimum wage jobs depend adults, including fast food. God forbid start looking low-skill industrial work. Also, teenagers fairly compensated time too? need bump across board. Well hes wrong. TECHNICALLY new cases verified testing. like mind small child. got mom's bronzer without asking hid bottle thinking find empty bottle, get trouble. Kids fucking stupid. like daddy Trump. God hate military knowing useless braindead existence charge us all. fair President small hands, people shrieking ‚Äúspike‚Äù daily new cases similarly stupid. Breathlessly waving around line charts historical new cases (with amusingly tight y-axis ranges magnify increases btw) presupposes March, April, May June least remotely apples-to-apples comparisons. 

But they‚Äôre not, plenty sick people aren‚Äôt reflected early portions charts.

At least overlay charts another line showing daily testing volume % tests positive. want tiny bit thoughtfulness you‚Äôre going steal attention smh

Otherwise I‚Äôll ignore hop state data dashboards LPNs CNAs practice got treatment McDonalds street. called asked manager it. healthcare workers. Problem fixed. Killing Name literally could written right now. Exactly. handled horribly. think efforts counter-productive. Holy shit! guy president! still got 0$ ... waiting ""If ignore problem, it'll go away.""  Thanks this. tell geniuses r/unpopularopinion go lol flu, walking pneumonia, another virus, name few. Im guessing least 2 would George Carlin CDC page listed see spot remove covid numbers total. see total excess deaths full number covid deaths plus top Cadet Bone Spurs know president literally took first flight morning swearing next one. would surprised something similar. Payment school loans won‚Äôt done 60s? I‚Äôm sorry loan high wouldn‚Äôt better paying career pay much earlier? overwhelming odds absolutely symptoms idk dude. mean, literally does. difference likely huge great deal population. Yeah idk that. week university moves classes online, couple friends 0 person classes fall. 2 point looking pretty unlikely well.

I can‚Äôt really see fall sem happening point, although I‚Äôd love happen. Number changed feel free reply later want check again. would hope well, referring percent national population tested countries, total count. America's tested 7.6% national population, whereas Canada's tested 5.7% national population. California actually also tested larger percentage state population Canada nationwide. 

All said, need continued mass testing necessarily ""this country better"" metric. Indeed, fact America still needs conducting mass testing good thing all. Look South Korea example; America tested percentage national population almost 4x greater South Korea, that's there's need continued mass testing SK. r/technicallythetruth anyone know Trump get office? know asking curiosity. mean like benefits wise president.

I hope get much like past presidents. stop testing cancer too... /s Think chess computer. It‚Äôs 2D. move X Wait, one true. start feel? lucky that's enough time bioprinted lungs become available.

Or could become lung-vampire, hunting people stealing lungs survive. Can't point studies, admit information anecdotal...but deep roots. I've explained bunch elsewhere, I'll sum up:

Wife's research, asthma/propensity lung inflammation issues, respirologist leading researcher field also works with. They've using similar drugs since day one major Canadian hospital system, communicating others field across country throughout.

Currently analyzing data three months active treatment identify better likely efficacy was, leads kinds studies post about.

Wife prescribed couple similar drugs years. Contracted COVID late march. Prescribed preventative doses. horrible, knowing history we've past, question drugs kept hospital. Admittedly, part purely anecdotal. rest really not. Yeah super normal drug get, get one would gotten similar one... like version string Tylenol lungs It‚Äôs strange virus coming pipe towards us US, remember reading steroids contraindicated worse outcomes (according Chinese studies) even though that‚Äôs always standard ARDS ICU. know ""Darwin's theory"" works? would virus kills fraction percent people age bracket significant affect genetic makeup population? barely locked like 2 weeks acted like going literally die beach parties immediately. fuck live-under fucking rock?!

Please enlighten me. recently killed color member KKK? 

Ummm, not. sure sound racist fuck!

When ever stated one race superior others, pigment skin different color? Also even young people don‚Äôt die, virus often horrible lasting effects lungs, kidney, etc. Quality life significantly decreased. Nope, I‚Äôm Canada, concerned us, sad see respected country destroy inside. Lifetime complications. Bwahahaha. Hmm ... protesters agree. isolating getting test would wise. I've sworn bathing grandparents vaccine. year. year we've covid. people believe think Obama citizen think global warming hoax, probably think Vaccinations bad.

i like ones object putting [flouride major spending revolved around conventions vacations, none happening year.  Trips I've cancelled far year include:

* Philadelphia conference
* Atlanta convention
* Durham conference
* Great Smokey Mountains fun
* Atlanta another convention (this one may still happen, we'll see)

Conventions conferences HUGE economic drivers. Plane travel, hotels, dining entail add thousands dollars would normally spent I'm spending far year.

I've used opportunity pay car, put money pocket things return normal, convention conference industry feels safe enough go forward usual plans, average middle upper income person's spending going remain way down. Always china lol Nobody wants outbreak. outbreak. numerous countries vastly differing levels authoritarian control could look positive examples.

I thought everyone understood this? governor DeSantis complete idiot, already knows way avoid new shutdown almost every one wears mask.  issue enforce mask order, now, wait weeks. waits, issue shutdown order. mask order avoid need shutdown order weeks now.

He's creating false narrative like everything. even close true. Jesus Christ kool aid drinkers tedious. Talk exploiting bullshit asymmetry principle. new tests swabbed nostrils. Fuck Trump. Biggest piece shit country. Cant wait deranged ass fucking gone, permanently. He‚Äôs lost fucking mind. already tried AIDS.  Dint work.

Likely lack testing. that‚Äôs one city, whole country like Vietnam. I‚Äôm saying China intentionally underreporting it‚Äôs tough get whole picture country billion community spread. Well, no. context wants America look better is, stop testing, look better short time. 
 
Less testing, less cases. testing, cases. That‚Äôs context. Weird doesn‚Äôt make look less idiotic. confirm. never watch news. search history provides enough information, I'm probably better politician Trump (and I'm fairly ignorant politics)

This wearing masks enough - needs proper education wear masks, put take off, safest practices are. look amount people wearing mask nose poking holes masks...

It's also part reason lot officials downplayed mask use (on top reasons good bad) education there, wearing mask potentially increase transmission - especially early days less known covid19.  ignorance works attention-hungry POTUS dude seriously keeps getting dumber day. escape reality believe see it.

Not sure got said test less. Let preface saying support Trump

This headline misleading taken context. basically said, due America‚Äôs accurate frequent testing, shows cases many places world show less cases COVID even though may more, accurate testing double-edged sword. accurate COVID testing = reported cases COVID. Less accurate testing = less reported cases COVID.

That's bold strategy cotton....lets see pays take long... thinking machine fee cover rest things. yes, ventilator (relatively long-term boot) poor treatment choice anything else try (I medical worker myself, interested observer like everyone). high-oxygen flow sounds lot better lot reasons. hope protocol bears adopted. can't help think money drives lot treatment direction US though. surge/ emergency beds included typical ICU beds pre-COVID? people talk...real...slow.  love chicken analogies fact everyone quarantined distanced dropped diseases across board, plus hospitals canceling elective surgeries meant utilization ER 60-70%. Child death rates cut third 2019 levels due lack communicable diseases. 

Literally sane hospital reporting covid related deaths pneumonia reimbursement they'd recieve tying covid insanely better pneumonia. anything they're reporting covid deaths, reporting (from Dx coding perspective anyways).  whole point? pay stay home? paid say, $300 week, enough everyone would going back work. Also, ordering in, normal paycheck enough times. transition masks socially acceptable thing? many protest wear clothes. would help many transmitted illnesses. week we'll see many people protesters hand killing? actually isn‚Äôt expected all, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve reading. Getters Pandemic (GOP)


They get it, in: understand origins.


Coincidentally, many supporters part GOV (Getters Virus) poor critical thinking skills defiance common sense protective measures. 


(Coming conservative rather flabbergasted days). know get tested? went shortness breath last week, took chest xray said ""all good"". that's it. testing. nobody New Zealand without two week quarantine vaccine found produced? resistance population virus? isn‚Äôt clear that‚Äôs victory me, it‚Äôs country I‚Äôm glad achieved goals, temporarily. America really wants cement number 1 Coronavirus cases Brazil catching up. 

It's almost like US think 2020 Olympics want try find many ways possible keep infection rates climbing. could say that. segment believes another shutdown impossible. isnt. information released (as far I'm aware). entered compassionate entry parent dying, later died.

(btw Fauci never much cred begin with, he's corporate pharma lobbyist fired Trump. he's nothing mouthpiece start, Trump fired Rick Bright CDC leadership lost basicallt remaining credibility scientific community) Emergency Room fundraised gave every EVS $300 gift card, rely them, love them, comes taking care COVID much us nurses fact, correlation countries using HCQ like USA belong low CFR group

US early-stage HCQ+AZ treatment, pulled forbidden prescribed Covid-19 FDA, currently operating CDC guidelines guided now-retracted infamous Lancet study used Surgisphere, months leading Feb now, HCQ used general per CDC guidelines.

I verified confirmed Singapore's low CFR (6943 test positivity, 4 deaths). know Singapore low CFR, must mean Singapore something dramatically different patients USA vent, otherwise CFR would skyrocket Singapore. know is, let know. Pretty sure Sweden confirm So, wait, problem test people actually developing antibodies? seems tests. Hah, could be. consider incredibly lucky family life... think parents worry one kids around, matter what. sister book flight home one parents damn cold. Haha I'm shocked already happening. 13 % population commits 53% murders 

They 5 times likely criminals, post link math don‚Äôt believe first person die town hospital janitor, new job. RIP. ChannelNewsAsia (from Singapore), pretty good job covering China neutral tone. I've found coverage accurate.

 

I got impressed covered say Hong Kong shooting ( hype, full context, careful analysis. check Run Jewels ‚Äúpercent deaths‚Äù column mean? doesn‚Äôt match numbers. Imagine patient 0 COVID-19, thanks lot millions infections a-hole way like it! dont understand stay job? demand higher wage else quit... Oh, silly me. understand issue commenting. right. Another possibility infectivity takes longer manifest illness due likelihood smaller viral loads outdoors wearing masks. many infected individuals turn (thankfully) reduce likelihood severe evolution illness. 


Both principles smaller viral load outcomes somewhat well supported far definitively proven.  SERIOUSLY doubt it. country area outbreaks diseases common, doubt government foolish enough drop guard. mention also country that, like Japan, population wearing masks daily routine.

üòâ Best luck. Yes. It‚Äôs quite sensible country New Zealand‚Äôs situation. weekend getaways outside like beach time, really anything worry about.

It‚Äôs unlikely education appropriate determining precautions take pandemic. fact people would go advice experts field pretty lame. 

Fauci seriously hurt credibility lying masks. Thanks! ""When going Hell...*keep going!*"" - Winston Churchill Might spell end sushi. People US seem obsessed masks reason. retail shops Ireland open again, deaths yesterday hardly anybody wears mask. 

Masks helpful lot problem losing temper people wearing them. 

Why nobody talking impact obesity epidemic US impact virus there? week Az 145% increase 2 weeks ago...thats good trend...do toast, toasted summer heat...burned impatience lack social distancing mask wearing. question *is better nothing ?* receptionist nice lady, mean healthcare worker. full-time doctor able run daily-covid test, only/easy quick test temperature check receptionist criminals protesting, black people protesting treated unfairly. huge grievance black lives killed unfairly.

We middle pandemic unfortunately, going amusement park huge health risk. love roller coasters can‚Äôt wait safely return time.  think part issue used incorrectly kind masks increase risk SARS Yes 

\- Corona


\- trump course mean zero. That's specifically said ""lower"". outside could help prevent spike. However, protesters may trying take measures safe, protests coincided reopenings. places, spikes. could due people stores, restaurants, workplaces following social distancing wearing masks.

While know transmission lower, comprehensive study showing much lower. doctors treating patients outside, that's practical weather, access electronic charts medical equipment, privacy concerns, space, etc... Doctors going take action without practical way implement it. commenting say mentality actually really fucking badass. Keep good man. got it. nyc buildings phased ""re-opening.""  optics. People see think, gee people run place making effort. hvac systems filtration ""clean"" air. Tell tenants replaced filters air handlers w minimum merv 13 rating.  ducky. frames holdings filters tight sealed within plenum / chamber - impossible cases landlords tenants see price tag UV air treatment systems balk. 

We make efforts reduce transmission. effective others. end day mostly gloss optics. 

I waxed 1994 Honda w 250k miles. runs pretty damn well, looks lot better runs.

It's optics. Unfortunately see get. Masks work. means thing like cold. get cold get infected another strain cold months. already 18 known strains covid 19. Cold also Corona virus BTW. Wut  Yikes. That‚Äôs terrible. I'd wager they're better source CCP tho. agree?  appreciate you! possible got different strain? reports West Coast USA strain came straight China East Coast USA strain mutated Europe first? grunt immigration took pity them. It‚Äôs properly upset tbh, kick teeth everything Actually N95% this. know, people start drinking gambling, decorum goes window. that's regular circumstances, let alone new world live in, things used like.. ""seriously bro?"" like ""fuck you! I'm trying die get drink"" telling people 50 stay home unless immunocompromised. California Department Health posting age fatality data. deaths 80+. age 50 highly unlikely die covid. Best case scenario new cases younger people responsibility isolate older people. read post Trumps voice joke two white British women? July 15...? news flash: immune system bad, may die  developed countries significantly curbed infections now, exception **United States**, **United Kingdom**, **Sweden** **Singapore**.  see sick people get tested 
4/5 asymptomatic especially young people 

So realistically u're gonna see protest spread gets weaker person think I'm going throw away phone. labor violations. guess falls 'exploitation' hoo boy. I've gotten point where, upon seeing first part title, thought going read ""US Airlines threaten ban passengers wear masks"" reports people minor illness Covid-19 developing permanent lung damage. won‚Äôt know entirety Covid-19 human body long pandemic over. irony would absolutely rich think ‚Äúthis virus big deal‚Äù end needing oxygen tank thought ‚Äúnothing afraid of‚Äù. 

Smart people recognize without facts one cannot accurately determine risk; far facts Covid-19. falls line happened aboard Theodore Rossevelt. Unlike South Korean study, sailors fully clearly virus symptoms, yet several weeks later, symptoms tested positive again. flu bro! New Zealander here. government royally fucked up. Obviously checks done sufficient level, incompetence Immigration Health, real chance back community. person taken xyz drug drops temp, declare it, term felony. That's big, lifelong hit caught hospital. That's good use big data. saw one reported Texas  Also Sweden screwed heart-breakingly sad. Every time see people wear mask, think people like this: frontlines virus, knowing they'd risking lives others. sign this, thank every day come work. 

PLEASE wear mask/socially distance/be careful help slow spread. Every person protects themself coronavirus person saves another essential worker's life well. make political act, not. good human being. *agrees purchase additional space iCloud*  actually love China deal shit honest
I think could Chinese person.


Is anyone covers news China half accurately twitter whatever? It‚Äôs talked ages, still lacking proper randomised clinical trials studies idea going? studies ivermectin still progress? mean folks thing like AIDS You, too. remember Satchel Paige's words, ""It's mind matter. mind, matter.""

üòâ place near booked 10 days. think cause blood drives canceled donation center capacity (which maybe reduced distancing) without drives, they're getting many donations usual. optics folks. Yep definitely think people watching much Hollywood cinema. might ASPD tendencies (leaning towards sociopathy) , full blown individual psychopathy (outdated term) hurt someone. People like charged terrorism.  Agreed. last stint fast food standing cardboard puddle caused drain backing kitchen. Hygiene left lot desired there, personal sanitation kitchen. I'm shocked health department shut place times. states seeing uptick hospitalizations. we‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs anywhere week three weeks start seeing higher mortality rate area. It‚Äôs beyond true though Also would admitting situation serious certain people wanted admit. scare stock market!!! think American corruption problem even within mile Russian one? sounds like pretty walled-off opinion. say dear One us! economy opened boarders countries still infected.. else expect happen nice try janitors lol No, 95% pride ignorance. Wearing mask makes feel weak. wouldn‚Äôt let us (the uk) country vaccine

We TERRIBLE criminals protesting police treat badly get arrested isn‚Äôt legitimate grievance 

You wanting deny people opportunity fun says lot fun around Plz love god, get rid guy children need learn mandarin, english ^^ No... estimate whether is. Frankly say collators numbers working weekends accurate weekend numbers well.  would studies shown drastically different results? could many PREsymptomatic? Really sucks. like seeing loading bar get 98% drop back 25%, sit wait Chinese restaurant Carteret County gone cash set table front. basically honor system, pick food leave payment jar. Get change needed, there's bucks jar. Pessimist fears someone gonna take jar bail. 2 different exemptions turned sour. One turns 2 women positive allowed tested. 2 teens granted exemption attend funeral ran away, far tested positive. 

In summary: border quarantine compassionate exemptions shambles. weird different everywhere USA is. area, exact opposite. seems virus slowly eat human race til perish it.... Good luck! hoping get back exercise real soon. pretty active gym playing soccer shelter places started USA people got worst. Hope retroactive give stimulus pay. established mass testing capacities Westerners saw need it. quarantined China travellers centralized institutions. mass-quarantined whole districts single digit cases help supervision PAVN.

They truly impressive job. temporarily, like naughty school kid. permanently, like adult able actually follow rules safety well hundred people? lot people? Yeah, without working backwards idiots government, way pay bills without working! factory workers working arses everyone get parcels forget federal political stance time. bucked authority much might ear, leaving political appointees advise charge. daughter tell  people getting screwed $600 unemployment benefit. Hope fix going forward reward people work full time dig get extra benefit. Blame english, Scotland's got nothing Thank you, man. number people either see world black white know handle everything better afterwards crazy me. 
Like, ‚Äûthey could stockpiled masks preparation‚Äú, yeah course know necessary. time western world didnt. 
And way countries couldnt give masks every citizen, global shortage. Total heroes. I‚Äôm nervous go public folks go face head make safe next. Absolutely note worthy brave. deserve more. read this, lower mean zero. Also much lower wouldn‚Äôt doctors treating positive patients outdoors? believe outside drops transmission rate non-risk levels might well believe 5G causes virus. forced watch team waste years Watt Hopkins infringes everyone's rights. think Angels wasted talent. really tell everyone fan sending condolences? Really? SMH... totally misread it. great announcement awareness. not? expected long lasting immunity. Reason East Asians thought start snuffing option. workplace forehead scanners everyone walks in. decided discontinue employees said memo 10,000 temperatures taken they‚Äôve found 1 fever. They‚Äôre basically getting ambient room temperature little body heat mixed in. always read LO it, 96 F. shape, ok. issues, complaints. ear thing ~10 weeks after.

I'm going start exercising tomorrow. (Today) Fuck thing. kill makes stronger. Bullies, murderers, booze, cigs, shot.


So far, win. tested positive COVID-19 February. diagnosed feeling tell-tale symptoms.  clear obvious, dry cough like would believe. would stop,‚Äù McKee said.   
   fought virus home beat it. even donated plasma twice testing positive antibodies, thinking clear.  
  never imagined -- four months later -- she'd test positive COVID-19 epidemiologist UT Southwestern -- connected McKee's case -- said catching coronavirus twice possible appears uncommon.   
  really know serious illness second time compared first time,‚Äù said Dr. Robert Haley UT Southwestern.        said doctors believe virus went dormant first round coronavirus, reemerged. assume Germany? 

Other redhats here, Americans know what's happening ridiculous is. months vote. ""In late May 2020, Rice announced refused wear face mask response COVID-19 pandemic Congress""
Go rallies convention finish job started.  Owell see guys outside countdown 8am guess.. Fml I'm upset also. firefighter, janitors. guys rock! Thanks opening EMS room us! considering 50% deaths came senior homes, article giving passage acknowledge idiotic suggestion clear them?! WTF place where? hospitals?! shit. Shanghai reopened almost 3 months , mask usage dropping 70% recent weeks due high temperature. news break clusters Beijing 3 days ago, mask usage Shanghai street jump back 99% overnight. (to give idea, Shanghai like 800 miles away Beijing). Maybe paid tired people eagerly stay inside! upvoting still can! Every single room coronavirus case got cleaned housekeeping tons got denied use n95 nurses priority exposed. Medical center Valhalla New York housekeeping died denied masks. BS, mean IBS? horrible political leadership looks like. hope lead least people finally opening eyes brought upon US last election. Transmission lower many protesters (not all) wearing masks. That's twitter you. Radicals sides wishing death people. does, countries used coronavirus excuse seafarers right repatriation shore leave 3 months now. Nothing done. Time seafarers take action. sidekicks, like Robin sidekick Batman. agree. likely many people infected transmitting virus person person. thought actually.. i'm hoping asymptomatic people catch hopefully become immune spreading it. least degree,, wait hit us like truck way lucky protests happened least certain people hopefully start getting immunity reduce total spread relationship proposing early-stage treatment (i.e. HCQ) countries similar CFR's large scale. 

To put another way, treatment, CFR rate. Hence, confusion Singapore ridiculously well. difference make patrons aren‚Äôt wearing mask? transmit diners employees. Maybe restaurants luxury currently aren‚Äôt necessary still. thread locked comments getting political. Please keep comments topic posted news story, general comments state nation. Five years ago, trying get restaurant business get job could get pension. applied job housekeeping aid local VA. veteran helped PTSD VA, saw giving back. never expected stay department long. But, five years on, I‚Äôm housekeeping supervisor. 
The work done men women department mostly appreciated. VA legally mandated hire combat veterans vets disability rating. It‚Äôs can‚Äôt find enough get waiver hire outside (non-veterans). pay horrible do. start $13. lots second jobs. 
As supervisor, look job making sure housekeepers need making sure get enough training vets clean place get medical care. try buffer issue comes nursing another department. cheerleader encourager. 
Covid brought it‚Äôs challenges every one. first, like everyone, learning day making sure supplies needed, making sure able keep people safe, needed get rooms clean. 
Hospitals wouldn‚Äôt run without housekeepers. deserve utmost respect. Fauci‚Äôs CV ten times longer list sources outside US. 

I get you‚Äôre trying say people _deep_ news kept getting information daily basis, obvious get masks use masks.

But recommmended. country‚Äôs CDC. infographics made lap dog fucking comic strips saying masks bought used symptomatic people. I‚Äôve there, we‚Äôve ‚Äì WESTERN medical community lying us, preserve supply felt general public couldn‚Äôt trusted. ‚Äúthe double duty‚Äù üòÇ great name! sorry doctors speculating science. let's forget flu illnesses still too. [""Right United States, people walking around wearing Dr. Fauci 60 Minutes ~~not~~ rocket [man] math. pandemic, it‚Äôs least assault.  minor shortness breath late February. Went urgent care chest xray. said fine probably bronchitis. really buy almost one could get Covid test state time. slowly got better course next 6 weeks, even April went bike ride practically hyperventilating hard breath. doctor said rough allergy season everyone. time opened covid testing basically anyone state mine came back negative. somewhat certain it, get test sick. I'm trying convince doctor let get antibody test. I'm mostly okay now, get winded easily I'm tired time. always find way fuck native population. fucking hate us. She‚Äôs covid-19 twice. There‚Äôs use discussing considering you‚Äôre rejecting science, doctors, patient actual source. There‚Äôs nothing left discuss. Fauci optimistic approved vaccine end 2020 Looking Florida. Exactly. usually case 400 million times... even question. I'm generally fan software developed Germany, looks good overall. course, they've mostly implemented standard set Apple Google, appear done quite nicely. Overall, thumbs up.

The best outcome course would install never use it. idea. Honestly, even friend working hospitals nothing special. possible explaination find vast majority cases (on average, 99%, really, kidding) due one point failure - foreign worker domitories. Thus, 99% cases young fit adult male low case mortality. top that, strict social distancing contact tracing resulting even peak hospital load close capacity severe cases assured adequate treatment. Perhaps that's why?

Anyway still see relationship ur proposed treatment data low CMR. Based current research would also say HCQ proven useless COVID 19. Unless u provide research. top that, ur source woefully outdated singapore's data, today, 40,818 positive cases 26 death. I've asked James Tedaro answer. personally know. That's happened SK. tests came back false positives, reality minor symptoms experienced residual effects virus. Others continue experience symptoms permanent damage caused virus. doctors believe proof happened. could well dead virus fragments. What's rose Twitter? use inhaler month half fever broke strength came back. fairness could PR people journalists pushing something hyped-up get good publicity. fucking annoyed this. relative already dead. coming back funeral, left quarantine early travel Wellington assist relative funeral preparations, delayed happened. Yes I‚Äôm sad family, ridiculous exemption put jeopardy lot hard work done NZers past months, mention poor buggers flight sick women. absolutely way people allowed fly without negative test. Period. Even spend two weeks quarantine. Sorry, almost prison like control NZ hostels. exemptions. don‚Äôt like don‚Äôt come here. come break law deported permanently barred future entry. Would love read paper moment immunity dips, like stress work, relatives getting sick, get covid anti bodies.

Same thing happening en masse, like watching particulat piece news, lead new epicenters appearing country.

I think herd immunity pretty much impossible freedom movement disjointed responce highly moronic public. hear claims LA decreasing cases deaths. see that's possible last weekend highest death toll far days 50 deaths, highest tolls since mid-April. Except that's exactly happening South Korea, patients testing positive symptoms. positive tests caused dead parts virus immune system reacting (same way immune system react dead virus vaccines). Dunno you‚Äôve heard (NZ) streak ended 2 active cases today. travelled Auckland Wellington (8+ hour drive) knows they‚Äôve spread COVID travels. Yeah would really bad news. feels like much hopeful right now. Yes. Better work home while. app can't used way. merely broadcasts random number changes frequently nearby phones via Bluetooth, remembers numbers saw weeks. infected, upload numbers broadcast past two weeks central server, everyone else check whether they've seen numbers. That's it.

You'd bend backwards quite bit use location tracing, inclined go there, already easier ways track you, like phone signal triangulation. afraid of, months quarantine numbers dropping, people thought '' Oh virus bad said! going out''... ignoring fact numbers dropped QUARANTINE.

And second wave coming hard people government lead 'early reopening' fucking morons. think I'm golden retriever  saying reason tested positive mask wearing allowed. stating much incompetence companies using times. fat, ugly, hiding lying duck called? questions legit. depends bad customers want it. may also try stick restaurants additional cost, vote consumer take care additional charge convenience. problem! thank posting Richard Wilkinson ted-talk older post. think equality huge impact subject too.

Uh, WeChat thing. Weibo QQ. China deeper social media America imagine. basically everything Google could possibly want, integrated.

Also, China huge public education thing COVID-19 locked everyone back January. That's risk inevitable. way society lock forever. pick pace epidemic, can't choose go it. health care provider should‚Äôve told follow visit is. Call verify. basically, remain asymptomatic, OK end waiting follow visit. probably depend busy clinic is. changes health, especially develop difficulty breathing, go directly nearest ED. BLM protests one hand worse earlier right-wing protests people involved. hand, people wearing masks.

Pair poor protective immune response antibodies (basically IgM, IgG perhaps effective, everything seemingly short-lasting low concentration) low levels interferon production bound end incidence chronic viral infection. upcoming JHU study finds extensive viral attack &amp; replication neurons stem cell model, example, likely mitigated effectively immune response.

It makes quite worried damage virus asymptomatic cases, implications viral persistence toward later-stage long-term harm. heard already reached amount. insurance covers it? Power breeds corruption issued emergency executive order (or better yet, passed legislation) forcing retailers remove medical grade masks sale public (the government would purchase stock distribute hospitals.) 

Then medical experts could honest significant effectiveness homemade masks reducing viral loads, already proven SARS-family respiratory viruses. 

Asia able keep COVID-19 relative control severity infection correlated viral loads mutual mask wearing seems reduce exposure levels immune systems fight off. Since we've known long time COVID-19 passed without symptoms many cases, nobody know whether healthy not, hence wearing masks protects people around case well reducing exposure. Gavin Newsom even going required masks we're kinda fucked. US also waaay people developed countries fact guys dominate olympics fairly inevitable.

On political rights ordinary citizens, China well, give 2 10.
But economic level, government pretty well I'd rate 7 10.
It's kind like someone taking one thing away you, take another compensation.
And sometimes annoying governments promised before, especially local governments
But overall ""it okay.""
But government good job treating life well, something traditional Chinese culture.
There's old Chinese saying, ""A man's life matter life death.""
It means things matter human life. Leo Varadkar, Ireland's prime minister, said well:

I cant even.. 20 Jan first time China confirmed coronavirus transmitted human. also reported 198 cases. China realized they're deep shit suspended Wuhan 22th Jan.

VN discovered first case 23th Jan, day later.  Janitors easily replaceable. Life would dirty gross without many clean shit, almost everyone ability janitor. Hes lucky small economy, UK would've given him. Fuck knows itll affect long term doesnt look fun Yeah. mostly affecting old people theres finite amount them.

You people absolute shit scum. fact, even give honor calling creatures ""human"". literal parasite cockroaches. go sit coffee shop smoke weed loser Dutch buddies. saddest truth always way. nature care hits home. think happen we're immune issues affect everyone else. everyone worries R0 factor. bigger problem: ‚ÄòI‚Äô value. Ignorance. it‚Äôs around i10 right now. Lol, Yeah. 
And Bill gates daughter gonna poor homeless person streets newyork. 
Nice dodge. I‚Äôm still fully recovered first round virus. way could handle getting second time. **America exported protective masks ‚Äî including disposable surgical masks N95 respirator masks ‚Äî March month past decade**. all, $83.1 million worth products sent United States rest world, according analysis latest U.S. Census Bureau trade data export category includes textile-based protective masks.

U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, raised questions Azar Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross early March **Commerce Department flyer circulated encouraged businesses take advantage temporary Chinese import incentives pushed U.S. companies sell medical supplies critical coronavirus response abroad**.

**Businesses encouraged export protective masks, mechanical ventilators even mask making machines Let's good news here, patient 91, British pilot making good recovery, stand  sone help talk longer need lung transplant. Hopefully hospital bill reach 1 million dollars range. lord's work, man.

That is: keeping us safe, powerful people (very well). Lol typical Dutch retarded response. let get straight, americans dont want tracing contacts, dont want wear masks, dont want lockdowns/social distancing dont want vaccines (because evil bill gates etc...), want disease disappear... question - HOW? people think going happen? trump summer magic? seriously dont understand. Things getting worse people dont want help ALL. Oddly enough, Chinese citizens support things government does. Must infallible government. Best sure best interests mind absolutely nothing politics.

Well, want explain anymore. I've said million times. were, several vessels diverted destinations India crew take anymore. think everywhere. Numbers rising US stop government forced shut things even though said again.

What worries is, China virus taken seriously new breakout. think country reason thinks virus wear masks, contact tracing maybe. 'Murca done corona done us. comparison, Air France requires them. guys boarded flight wearing them, took boarding, refused crew orders put back on. warned police would meet plane comply.


Spoiler: police arrival fine passangers. Unfortunately, fine wearing, rather fine complying crew instructions would much memorable.

A system money beyond human life push early reopen serves quarterly bottom line. system lot idiots happily compile without even considering social distancing protective measures, thanks widespread misinformation generally understanding virus situation.  less year (like influenza vaccine) big deal. might doable.... 

How think countries vaccinate entire population every 6 12 months. can't even accomplish influenza. Except Seoul metropolitan area, coronavirus died provinces new clusters crushed quickly health authority.

The problem Seoul metropolitan area densely populated socially active moment. health authority detects new cluster, already tertiary quaternary infections derived it. Yeah, I'm Los Angeles 95% us social-distancing wearing masks indoors. certain venues/areas pandemic. Scary. Reminds notably players would intentionally spread further, going way so. American üá∫üá≤ taking refuge Malaysia üá≤üáæ pandemic. great!! far reproducible builds, also enabled code obfuscation. think valid privacy concerns, can't check whether app play store compiled code. 
It's probably nothing, think ok little suspicious, since actually turned obfuscation point turned later Viral load seems key. everyone masked, exposure would sub-critical among younger people, explosion. Yeah thats true. people think 5G makes gay shit like that. concerned pandemic civil liberties time. government already planning exploiting crisis push austerity. crises civil unrest, they‚Äôre gonna expand surveillance state, outlast covid. report medical conditions part league regulations every week. I'd surprised condition employment authorized disclosure team personnel. True. Thank respectfull response. appreciate it. 

I seen different post taken typed ass Foreign language answer... hope ok post anyway deleting would waste time.

Maybe need somebody say possible false. Presenting fact wrong agree. 

I doubt nobody want read this. need read constant bad news also bad mean exist Shut concerns somebody project needs everybody else imo. Panic hand always bad.

Why shame every single person every time go Social activity? many? Billions flys eat shit, wrong or? Hope understand mean...

Also ok maybe know responsible fault help people maybe died behaviour.

Again really appreciate Interaction me. feels like worthy productive conversation. Thanks again.

PS also think panic overly concerned Contra productive think everybody dies virus atm absolut perspective. made * maybe strikeworthy words post. um....

U might wanna go local MCD anymore.... People typically plan funerals people die, matter expected is. Yeah, data apparently confusing fuck epidemiologists, too. Oh god must bad. could come NZ funeral person died arrived?

No. People Brazil mostly dying home, one time. They're covering individual deaths - they're changing cumulative statistics. camera footage reveal that.

1. US national emergency.

2. n95 masks reserved healthcare workers only, medical ID required purchase

3. persons must wear mask notice, cloth bandanna . Sake non-medical masks limited one pack per person.

That's clear messaging. handle like Japanese Americans WWII. We‚Äôre saying bad, safety, we‚Äôre gonna lock while. prison, like camp. Yeah, guess said ""at all"" honestly seen evidence suggests total viral clearance infected people. I'd surprised virus capacity establish chronic infections. certainly seems infect every part body, including cells. Reading covid19positive sub adds apprehension. Sure, ancedotal data, there's clear pattern validated now.

Can immune evasion explain asymptomatic patients? clear patients bodies affected virus, seen lung abnormalities them. immune system fooled virus? case they're sitting time bomb they? Looks countries fraction cases going back normal

I wonder long social networks irreversibly permanently defaced political trolling brigades/bots drowning real people's discourse. seem grow numerous every year anything trend accelerating. Yes, we've already seen even China report people repeat infections. Safety black white. risk getting infected either 0% 100%; always somewhere in-between. Masks shift risk closer 0%, means safe. benefit particularly high everyone wearing mask. someone plane infected would normally pass 10 people, masks, might pass 2 people. makes huge difference lives 8 people get dozens people might gone pass to.

Coronaviruses short-lived antibodies. produce average antibody lifespan x months. ex may vary one current virus another, somewhat unlikely virus produces long term antibodies like flu antibodies life thus least cross strain immunity life means building immunity multiple strains course life neighbor neighbor develops strong cross strain herd immunity particularly important high population density areas.

I think fact scientists doctors said reinfection chances low really never said extreme short-term. words reinfection chances low within first couple months recovery. Beyond nobody knows sure follows Corona viruses average antibody lifespan 6 24 months means even 24 months within 6 months people group lost antibodies. 12 months whole bunch people lost antibodies 24 months vast majority people lost antibodies though go beyond 24 months average.

Everybody's desperately trying make reason one that's staring face since January entire class virus produce stable antibodies body produce stable antibodies virus accurate. view feature Coronavirus allows easily go extinct. flu thing mutating rapidly bypassing body's antibody production completely different way. flu recombine high levels bypass antibody protection develop different strains changes genetic makeup lot viruses. Coronavirus need mutate much stay relevant antibodies left behind simply dissipate get virus again.

Of course would confounding variables. Since 2009, declared six Public Health Emergencies International Concern (2009 swine flu, 2014 polio, 2014 Ebola, 2016 Zika, 2018‚Äì20 Kivu Ebola 2019‚Äì20 COVID-19), specifically advised implementing travel trade bans containment measure.

2009: Travel bans work. travel imposing travel restrictions would little effect stopping virus spreading

2010: Travel bans work. following measures advised, proven ineffective, costly counter-productive: ... restrictions travel trade

2014: Travel bans work. bans detrimental ineffective.

2020: Travel bans work. consistent recommendations.

Travel bans delay initial outbreak, neither overall number cases peak number hospitalizations actually decreased. Furthermore, border restrictions extremely effective (99% more) win 2-3 weeks time ‚Äî restrictions are, let's say, 80% effective, pretty much anything all.

We find border restrictions and/or internal travel restrictions unlikely delay spread 2‚Äì3 weeks unless 99% restrictions would make extremely limited contribution policy rapid containment influenza source first emergence pandemic seems obvious travel bans would slow spread virus, reality, happen.

South Korea Hong Kong shut travel mainland China still managed fine, US Europe shut borders, help slightest. single country world prevented virus entering borders travel restrictions.

Travel bans work, disrupt global economy next benefit, never recommended effective containment measure. brother works janitor hospital got Corona it. recovered well still... worked without protective gear taken seriously beginning.

You remember two folks using sources information could different.  


What find curious link posted shows Wisconsin essentially returning normal mobility yet cases dropped, recurring theme I've trying figure out. 


For example Wisconsin staying home (relatively) less Florida Texas, cases deaths coming down. come back inside plane lands. since last week go back office 75% days. tried ask 50/50 (work home/ office) wouldnt allow me. maybe overreacting. Unless fall vulnerable group, perfectly reasonable. yound healthy, really point self isolation lunacy.

Its fucking airbourne ebola flying there. virus 80% asymptomatic cases less 1% death rate. 

And long gonna this? vaccine hits? Well may take years. may never arrive. Well, life all, badmouth want spend hunkered trembilng fear... Same. either severe insomnia sleeping 2 hours longer normal every day now. Facepalm... one wonder ‚ÄòMericans stupid mmkay? fortunately many... addition, medrxiv source: FIL well? Holy shit. poor kid(s), can't imagine losing grandfather's time. Incredible, must say. 
...sadly, can't imagine reaction live. :/ care workers loosing fingers otherwise getting terribly mangled weekly basis either. horrifying. 

It's probably thing, medrxiv source, since peer reviewed believe really accessible reason. highly, highly doubt it. Japan pretty similar distribution blood type western countries, also huge elderly population top it.

More like, almost 100% people wearing mask now, many dod pandemic seasonal allergies cold/flu, also one touches other. Maybe fuck we're it? Actually can! Two women travelled United Kingdom Wellington parent's funeral tested positive COVID-19, breaking New Zealand's case-free streak 24 consecutive cases sparked trans-Tasman scramble women transited Doha Brisbane, meaning could picked virus UK, either airport en route, one three flights.

Don‚Äôt come conclusions without basis jump them.  Sorry New Zealand. government everything stop spread want herd immunity - joke. service sector almost 60% Indian economy. workers largely unorganized sector migrant workers rural areas many live day-to-day wages. Keep mind lockdown announced enforced within 4 hours.

These migrant workers unable feed themselves, sustain high cost living urban/semi-urban areas economy shut. option travel back homes. sudden shutdown economy (when india 'only' 100 cases) forced largest human exodus recent human history. Due lockdown transport, migrants walked hundreds miles foot died way. spontaneous event caught law enforcement offguard, definitely contributed spread coronavirus. 

 Also, something shady happening India's numbers. seems like testing daily certain quota met, daily cases increasing steady linear manner completely proportional test numbers suspicious. VN went 18 days without new cases early March since blocked border China. Covid started explod west thus carried virus oversea flights mid-March, jumped 16 cases 80 cases. went full lock week later.

We've moved past covid nation, matter anymore. ad subscription blocked, good ahead, leave mask home on. Let's say R0 2 wearing masks reduces transmission 34%. society 25% population virus everyone wears mask, R0 2 drops 1.5 immunity drops 1 effectiveness masks. Boom, herd immunity achieved virus cannot spread fast enough sustain itself. 

Obviously numbers real values, hope illustrate combination viral immunity measures reduce spread could allow society effectively herd immune far earlier 60%. Makes think matter ignorance poor communication management, then, individual workers.

I never eat fast food usually look discounts get 60$ per pair pretty nice usaf sage wellco boots hcw ten years ago. third last pair atm. second wave similar stronger magnitude city unlikely. Whatever infection happened people werent social distancing werent wearing masks months late 2019 early 2020, already maximum damage cause. Direct quote. stfu little cumstain. uh, didnt know back March? pretty sure did. brain dead ya fucking imbecile.I sure heard, million dead. obvious care others lives would great stop trashing people care trying best contain spread. Sounds fair seem well-stocked ventilators, especially advise using sparingly possible. parents? died it. 

jesus, mate. that's brutal. I‚Äôll second that. Yeah think would biggest instance cases.

The short-lived antibodies also I've always whole immunity certificate idea never know immunity drop since varies wildly person person. work setting plexiglass masks, nurses docs get full PPE it‚Äôs needed. Let tell life fucking sucks they‚Äôre fine precautions unless it‚Äôs themselves. Absolutely. almost everyone claim second wave. Heck, people already think never first wave shit. never change minds matter circumstances. obsess much model predicts much beyond month.

Stupid people stupid shit getting Darwinised. direction air move modern airplane? certain passengers ""downwind"" others? holds extreme age well. recent CDC followup study sailors aboard Roosevelt used microneutralization test, sort 'Step 2' immunoassays used studies. Microneutralization assays take antibody-containing serum positive immunoassay results exposes live SARS-2 virus (as such, small number labs around world cleared perform test).

Of participants reporting positive PCR test last 1-3 months, ~&lt;40% showed presence virus-neutralizing antibodies serum. ~60% participants positive findings initial immunoassay, means ~40% positive findings first, common antibody test either antibodies protective antibodies (false positive). may distinguished two possibilities data, recall.

What shows that, regardless test accuracy, immune response many low-severity infections produce long-term immunity via typical/expected mechanisms. 

As impact findings public, data raise concerns reinfection even presence antibodies. mind, critical discussion antibody testing expand beyond reliability test results consider reliability antibodies general, criticisms factored considerations toward public health response. 

These findings also pose challenges development vaccine. Hey ya gotta get kicks can. Stupid people considerably entertaining rampant country ‚òùÔ∏èThis. late December / early January saw news stories weird pneumonia China. Dad died massive MI @ 43.

Post-poning re-opening June July completely arbitrary. virus lessened infectiousness pervasiveness. keep telling GF, ""Nothing gotten 'better.' worse, continue there's vaccine."" Bruh, says non hotspot districts. India. Nothing NYC. Also, Delhi probably already way 1%, since official count 0.2% lately day third tests coming positive. Leave politics aside

I'll tell nurse next time go checkup, clinic uses infrared thermometer. use mouth rectal temperature check core body temperature.

Having excoriated tool, say even using correct tool good. hard time following logic, though -- ""31% patients presenting New York State hospitals Covid-19 fevers"", useful get information? No, say, identifying people fevers past viral epidemics like H1N1 influenza led CASES found. waste time.

Reading article, one would think mothers feeling child's forehead keeping home school simply wasting time. somehow doubt that's true. Something's missing analysis. instructed isolate home certain criteria met (no symptoms x days etc.)

Thanks thanks. Right, flying jet owned private company. every right kick don‚Äôt wear seat belt. different. People need use damn brains. Nope, church gathering. earlier studies months ago multiple volunteers, vaccine less month old.

Also, explanation I've seen scientific CoVID thread medical professional, modern vaccines - even ""new"" vaccines - produced basic process terms safety, there's virtually expectation vaccine something radically new unprecedented body. fact modern vaccines very, side effects.

This common knowledge general public among medical professionals, would expect fair number volunteering vaccine trials. numbers might accurate. real question is: big match human transmissible corona viruses. usually 90% match (or whatever significant match, compared usual level matching foubd within viruses type), stupid story. Like fuck let someone jail home. armed uprising. managed end community transmission

No, didn't, that's simply possible without turning police state locking every person homes (or prison, think homeless people). managed reduce risk transmission degree *now*. end, dilatory tactics. Nothing going really improve without vaccine. COVID, isn‚Äôt. work multiple hospitals area, cases around time being. Holy Christ! NEVER going go away local government citizens' behavior. Terrifying. least feel totally weird wearing full-face respirator Target anymore.   take Dr.Chris ducey keeps consulting cuz basically gave understanding statistics see many struggle data.

Guys comment still gross though pointing using corticosteroids treatment something new, decades.

Early February, debates Lancet whether corticosteroids used treat Covid19. debate SARS outbreak. 

I understand methylprednisolone (a type corticosteroids) used China treat Covid19 patients clinicians early January. Get ldl levels checked. Thank üôÇ space I‚Äôd love that. strength training functional strength based dumbbells home fine. space I‚Äôd like power cage squats, deadlifts, pull-ups. endurance type sports (cycling running) strength training really supporting that. Steroids pretty similar literally SARS virus (SARS-CoV2). Large doses dex cause severe GI ulceration could reduce immune response bacterial pneumonia developed. Trump clearly hold AZ governor well. visit month back, Ducey changed ""slow, staged opening"" ""open everything, we're great"" practically overnight. matter think politics, tragic hear. Sorry loss So, TLDR: 25% ? Yes wrong, laughing reason. . . ü§î

Thats funny, even though peoven wrong, whine way pretending doesnt mean anything, hmmm. . . aware carriers disease also spread disease, addition themselves? drug, dexamethasone, reduced death rates third patients ventilators, fifth patients needing ""if patients COVID-19 ventilators oxygen given dexamethasone, save lives, remarkably low dexamethasone - generic steroid widely used diseases reduce inflammation - ""the drug that's far shown reduce mortality - reduces significantly"". saw scars healthcare workers heart goes them... hell wrong you? radical islamist.

That changed. murdering protesters.

We stopped advancing labor rights. Also, get fired lot jobs attending protests.

The US government determined value people profit generate oligarchy. deaths Sweden seem shrinking alot weeks.

So... don‚Äôt know working now. take 10% multiply population save countless lives. life saved step forward. Maybe sober people refuse masks. drunk would wear it? Yep, happened. cities going little while, blocked day Houston's supposed start. knew plenty people wearing masks day acquired mask solely preparation mandate. turned going forced wear them, bother. 4 people extended family contracted virus, one's hospitalized, almost guarantee wearing masks would Abbott turd.

Unlike HydroCloroquine study, sham. God hope gets it.

I want die, nothing like that, think there's way starts taking seriously.  think still save healthcare system, least part. 

Wave 1 almost took places - though frankly much due USA's asinine cost structures COVID-19 - far, hospitals still struggling along. 

If Wave 2 large larger, however, system greatly weakened I'm sure hold together. Alongside doctors/nurses died, many may decide (or decided) stop working. Hospitals life support financially, too, decision cancel elective procedures months. COVID-19 survivors hope paying bills, wretched insurance companies wriggle whatever well. federal government bother bail out? answer would surprise administration. 

I see comments believe ""go back normal already get with."" decision make, however. belong want go back full shut-down. Larger forces work here.

US States, facing huge budget holes, forced reopen - think state deciding conditions said reopening eye towards likely get people houses fastest spending money (and sales taxes). some, that's throwing open beaches bars suppressing COVID-19 data. others, that's inching forward slowly possible make believable claims putting measures place protect populace. 

Individuals, much before, decide comfortable level risk, weigh equally pressing economic mental health concerns. 

With catastrophic failure leadership federal level, comes state state question. I'm going throw question back you. end goal this... state? state jack-all doing, do. might well even federal government point re: COVID-19 policy, there's zero leverage make us anything different. So. asking question of? think (on global coronavirus subreddit) could possibly meaningful answers? means test results nearing completion? He's referring treatment people worse police drug dogs. agree saying fun - one fit, healthy people early 30s never gets sick. Daddy Trudeau got haircut  Call paranoid, care, trust given vindictive nature president. Unfortunately data convince enough people safe would call small uptick one day normal. example, NYC losing 1,000 people day 50. 52 tomorrow say there's massive spike deaths, say there's 95% drop deaths small uptick one day. Totally depends whether vaccine/treatment. I'm even comfortable predicting August right haha. still fucking idea many cases really have

Gun head guess, think vaccine made significant progress mass vaccination corticosteroid, miracle substance. always fine balance effective dose negative reactions steroids. original SARS efficacy found marginal best severe side effects. well documented.

Comments downplaying risks desperate good news relieve anxiety. thing chloroquine supposedly worked. daily cases terrific number

It's great number coming thousands. keep mind started low numbers growing worrisome pace. Earlier month typically 60 cases day. 

This article's 184 new cases yesterday. Today we're 278 new cases. think early say anything definitive death toll. bad week us. Sure, amazingly low numbers compared much country. think wrong ""it could worse"" attitude toward preventable death even illness. Well glad world. seem understand one works. purpose merely symbolic smoke lamp going save souls 

Which then? compared historical pandemics Can't second spike first spike over. find hard form lasting, meaningful relationships? statistics show quaranting wrong people, detrimental demographics. Pandemic one things make decision matter painful is, don't, pain far worse.

So true absence leadership, headed worst worlds almost certainly Yes No. line thinking people age older far higher risk death literally disease/virus/what you. There's much reason fear something thats killing say high school age kids rather something causing high death rates people age 70, high risk death literally everything. dont think ""just die"" however think doesnt make sense command businesses shut flu season theres new strain dont fully understand Btw, water particles 10 microns free float airborne. you‚Äôre going reference science, accurate.

And said
 water molecule

So, science 101: Water particles individual water *molecules*. group millions water molecules. 

If going pretend smart, learn mistake pointed CDC.gov.

You're going narrow down. claim specific info, hard post link?  miss China_Flu days. seems help severe patients. cure Covid-19 itself. provide numbers say cases deaths vastly United States pretty comparable countries tests/1,000 population.

The problem need testing doesnt scale population size alone, cases needed. Given US highest case count first world country far needed way testing, didnt get it.

Also note numbers US werent reported late last month, leaves us obvious suspicion much lower earlier said like using case counts - entirely dependent testing way know true amount cases.

you seem perfectly happy using death count despite exact problems. remember government celebs (Switzerland) permanently repeating message. went hiking outside people acted like issue. Nicest spring weather since decade. got it. always anything reddit, talk actual healthcare provider tho. here's way works:

First get big increase cases;

Then get big increase hospitalizations;

And that, get bunch deaths. 

There's order things, takes pretty long time. Florida getting big increase cases right now. rest follow. Trader Joe's fantastic job well. sanitize carts you, count many people inside, tape floors, plexiglass guards, etc.  world people seem think leadership controls humans operate. agree that. individual Lol (; [I'll kind assume around Nc, people dont wear masks anywhere fast food busier ever visible employees even wearing masks correctly thought done you, want keep moving goalposts, I'll play along.

Statistics absolutely play role. statistics would like influence lockdown currently?

The US highest number current active cases ever today. two week dip, we're back beating single day high active cases, growth cases numbers especially high states taking precautions.

So statistics would like influence opinion?

Here's real opinion. done real serious lockdown back mid march 3-4 weeks selfish people like push boundaries feel control lives, whole thing would've barely concern completely manageable individual quarantine contract tracing May 1st.

Please look Patient 31 South Korea. patient 31. People like patient 31. South Korea 237 cases per million population, US 6,656 cases per million population we're filled fucking brim Patient 31s. willfully stays hospital sick? good way get staph infection. !RemindMe 6 months What? don‚Äôt (source: give months) general, seems surging places hard hit previously. could multiple reasons this: Super spreaders (at least behavior-linked super spreaders) already would infected places hit hard.

It appear like virus spreads well outdoors guess fine careful.

Also police kill people? read that? press conference today pure spin. He's terrifying. He's monster. business can‚Äôt operate normally, protests shouldn‚Äôt occur either. Social distancing happening restaurants protests. last two weeks - probably sick. posted Ontario based weed sub reason? where's from? know people see post history, right?

And fuck ""concerned"", talk shit Americans every comment calling country ""shithole"", pathetic, obsessed fuck. We're deadly plateau Cortisteroids used asthma. sure that's same?  You‚Äôre going get used people disagreeing you. get school realize lot people don‚Äôt point view you. would public restroom all?

Etc hope worth I'm saying.

It probably though. totally stopped racism, so...  got point exactly. Thank You. He, people him, kept saying number hospital beds available number one concern people data calm everyone‚Äôs worry. (My biggest worry contract virus morons refuse practice healthy behaviors.) also said businesses everything possible protect employees patrons. BS, hasn‚Äôt grocery store (Kroger) neighborhood stopped everything protect anybody (there‚Äôs hand sanitizer roll paper towels available entrance isn‚Äôt better wipes provided pandemic). also must watching news showing many bars restaurants Houston packed capacity nothing ever happened. mention Memorial Day weekend fiasco protests, fall yet come.
Hey, don‚Äôt worry, 13,000 hospital beds waiting serve happy customers, mean patients.  Paywall Right. People using arguement reopen schools Fall. also important note kids school socializing much usually would, give clear idea actual potential spread get higher rates. table say 101,291 Covid deaths? Holy hell. that's scary. absolute piece shit.

This pandemic really shown many callous morons we've elected authority, people really need change it. suspect community transmission city, given market huge -- multiple football fields -- crowded

i also suspect China loath admit happening country, whole schtick totalitarian efforts Wuhan contained virus

so, get ""imported salmon"" ""virus cutting boards"" excuse put place state wide, various hospital systems wide program easily shuttle patients hospitals room appropriate care level. Load balancing..

Additionally currently accepting elective surgeries

i suspect two likely best understanding hospitla capacities shortages, also easily hand surge capacity simply halting elective surgeries.

 even wave? doubt anyone knows. Bingo good news since means first wave end... Hopefully nothing government~~ One particular political party He's basically arguing aggressive testing contact tracing ""protecting vulnerable people"" would negated need lockdown.

No shit, sherlock. understood saw countries like SK walk away without full-lockdown. way fucking late USA we're governed morons, talked idiots like Brit Hume. sad thing is, news cycle tired it. needed bump numbers so... moving next thing. right. many people NYC even small, tiny, infinitesimal percent population packing bars going generate dramatic pictures. Anywhere numbers people congregate longer ten minutes without ppe basically hotspots waiting happen. Nice, good job americans frustrating pointing danger protests got labeled racist, ""had accepted risk"" fucking serious? PLENTY many exactly? 

And death destruction severely impacted jackasses downplay scope dangerous severity saying 'derp derp, we've oner things think.' Fuck off, again. Yes, known months asthma patients somewhat less likely get Covid-19.

I'm asthmatic, huuge relief learned that. I'm thinking might cortisteroids.

I'm surprised doctor surprised. keep informed steps taken state create ideal conditions spread? already written whatever human loss come this. facade important.  Yes, DC times July. lovely. swamps south July? I'm sorry. wish could ease pain. Dude..... go see girlfriend. Mental health joke... think Beijing outbreak is? failed vaccine. WAKE SHEEP! would think potential negative effects given earlier. Steroids cause immunosuppression, it‚Äôs immune system problem (this happens later progress disease) helps, beginning, need immune system help ‚Äúfight‚Äù virus. wouldn‚Äôt want suppression early. Thanks ~~2020~~ ***china***. gaps passenger seating? ‚Äústrong‚Äù ‚Äúweak‚Äù tricky words represent something like immune system. immune system made wide variety working cells migrate body area concern (where you‚Äôve cut knee, bacteria multiples throat example) various chemical compounds (cytokines) signal activities (like trigger fever make immune cells scratch). ‚Äústrong‚Äù immune system one produces sufficient response injury infection, means recognizes threats produces cells molecules protect harm. redness swelling injury, whole crowd extra cells coming area blood migrating local cells. also interrupts normal activity.

Suppressing proper steroids helps case overreaction, means miss benefits protection minor germs injury. turn big problems, healthy people aren‚Äôt supposed stay corticosteroids time. Thank you!

Also irritates people express US medical system extreme really isn‚Äôt fully at. whole bunch people come reddit complain medical bill total, total they‚Äôre giving total insurance involvement. whole lot time, you‚Äôre paying pocket far far less you‚Äôre charged total. amount pay pocket manageable amount often not.

Of course, exceptions like people living areas stupid high insulin prices such, I‚Äôm way saying think US health system good spot, egregious cases someone staying overnight hospital expected pay tens thousands dollars total entire bill rare occurrence, yet reddit tries make sound like it‚Äôs something every single American deal with. Doctors idiots too. seem like good advice give people, especially Sweden already relative death toll 4x higher Denmark's, 8x higher Finland's 10x higher Norway's. really gain people work days sooner means risking people getting sick.

""If sick seven days declining symptoms, fever free least two days, okay go work even though still experiencing mild cough"".

Fuck sake people jump gun.
Edit: it‚Äôs day 1 it‚Äôs day 7+ resulting ‚Äòmild‚Äô cough. Lol what? 

From time exposure symptom onset (known incubation period) thought three 14 days, though symptoms typically appear within four five days exposure.

These protests 2 weeks ago point. would kind sustained government help financially state federal levels, progress made vaccine well treatments think 3 months would prob enough time are, like literally every time see comments, wrong. simply know analyze data properly keep spreading misinformation day day. Quit commenting resume learn post truthful information.

I'll help along way show wrong again:

This breakdown cases detected number cases line*: Total cases per line*: Severe cases per line*: Mild cases per day

Clearly, growth rate almost half peak, conclusion wrong. Secondly, even need look case data, cause [death/hospitalization/intensive care show kind flattening purple line.

Please refrain posting learned basic high school data analysis Fuck that's crazy. I'm glad better though. progressively regaining lung capacity? Yeah, brain went WWII. Literally every time see acronym. It‚Äôs possible allow milder cases stay hospitals right now, death rate peak Texas. still lots beds reserved covid patients hospitals might well take instead letting beds prepared covid stay empty. Oh he's going kill supporters... (Said like Willy Wonka) Good time paper, damn things ruining us! Given crazy Memorial Day was...I think 4th July next catalyst. number hospitalizations stabilized, see states saying stay home 4th July. interesting thing watch heavy 2A states. days away president blaming everything demonstrations riots probably. close best containment ever. hooligans screw up. would call health department report this. mandated let employees know possible direct exposure workplace. *official* numbers.

There LOTS additional ""pneumonia"" deaths year last.

...And even get *started* problems result death. people probably going feeling decades come, vaccine not. that's great. problem like hydroxychloroquin 2.0, people going hype weeks, even going help majority people take it. that's expected. Viruses grow exponentially. 2mil happens WAY quicker first million. Put little sparkle life H2Flow! Sweden hit 5,000 deaths week, point think economy. Heart Disease kills 600,000 plus Americans year....so?

(And need stop nonsense. infectious disease, means compared infectious diseases. wars, things like heart disease cancer.) I'll hold that. literally hospitals explode plan blame young people Mask usage people's overall attitudes thing find links states seeing decline. People wear masks get benefit mask plus cautious general provides added bump.

That may explain WI places, explain north east. Statistically unfathomably unlikely age group. Gov deSantis Gov Cuomo prove stupidity knows boundaries. \*sigh\*

""Upticks"" show Americans well-behaved. countries much higher rates compliance guidelines masks social distancing. way many people making excuses (""outdoors okay,"" ""I'm far enough away,"" ""I'm healthy"") instead right thing. idea.

I personally don‚Äôt want vaccine. want chip. Yeah, since early May, ICU flat month.  Statistically going feel like mild flu age group.

Fingers crossed them. know believe anymore

Believe Covid-19 contageous. 

Believe Covid-19 range symptoms mild cough death, everything between.  

Believe 1 5 people risk factors increase chance severe lasting complications death.  

Believe wearing mask washing hands two important things prevent spread disease. lol mean afraid reality????? nooooo cant be! iron, iron mask hand wash. lovely steam sterilize things nicely. dont go practice preach. literally safe dude. tell nobody's life sacrificed sentence acknowledge death rate? Nobody deserves die due carelessness others. disagree nasty individual.

For example, assassination Mr. Kinh rob land, none independent journalists international observers allowed enter crime scene. corrupt Vietnamese Kommie police came remove doors windows full bullet holes cover crime scene. even harassed wife much fainted (after brutally torturing weeks earlier refused lie time, place, Mr. Kinh's action regarding terrorist attack.

Kommie Vietnam government strict law anyone speaking truth corruption, land-robbing, farmers-killing. Another example- recently 3 Vietnamese women got jailed simply sharing news Facebook dude patient #21 (Nguyen Quang Thuan), Vice President Ministry Propaganda, super-spreader Coronavirus contacted less 400 people. flying first-class returning trip India Western Europe, slept mistress son house bought her, ate 4-star restaurants, played golf membership $150K annual price tag, funded taxpayers' money, country average per capita income $2,185 per year, $182 per month, came home slept wife hang around kids. lied 'visiting gym' reality sleeping mistress. course, protected big time state-run media ordered constantly scapegoat patient #17 (Nguyen Hong Nhung) shared flight rest corrupt, non-declared dozens high-profile Kommie officials, distraction, showed symptoms people began discover main culprits. Police arrested 3 Vietnamese citizens Facebook exposed cover-up (use Google translate needed) bad behavior along luxurious yet decadent lifestyle Nguyen Quang Thuan ilks like corrupt brutal Vietnamese Kommie regime. understand point, whatever want, wear mask, social distance, etc, cause spread sustained community spread, know prob younger affect severely, saying is, basically underlying conditions make vulnerable covid 19, cull weak infirm matter young healthy people Claiming woman covid even though article say anywhere whether treated covid not, basic logic damn covid section site, woman elderly extubaded received one tests DISCHARGE likely covid begin with.

Haha easily done many notifs here! 


I'm glad guys managed flatten curve! 
Are people wearing masks there? 


In England managed flatten curve too, go peak first late locked lax lockdown - people still parties everything lmao (weren't supposed know, people just...people) 
Although close shops, restaurants etc (except takeout) majority people paid attention rules think. 
Anyway, much spread lockdown. London (I'm near city) got hit pretty badly, that's obvious city like that. 
It rough months! 
But things looking hopeful now, really hope continue ease off, although gradual re-opening bit worrying, hopefully people still sensible enough encourage ""second wave"" like lot people worried lol. 
Some scientists said positive things regarding that, I'm trying focus more! 


We've lovely weather people allowed meet 6 people households, people hanging parks stuff. nice see actually :) Feels bit ""normal"" lol medicine, yes. Trial error educated guesses based know. I'm totally area expertise here; understand vaccine supposed enable body's immune response without necessity suffering illness, reading responses te article get feeling exactly happening. topic...how responses (vaccine induced naturally generated) differ? someone taking 2000 mile flight Southwest 2 days, hearing actually enforce policies makes feel waaaay better. They've always handled well proactiveness setting safety procedures reason decided fly all. Hearing lip service huge relief 120,000 people die mild symptoms. Get head ass. Well that's insane I'm still waking thought said ""life saving caronavirus dog"" immediately happy. rereading I'm strangely disappointed. reason everything, news joke. still need leave ""Edit: "" making changes comment? curious can't remember last time I've seen positive news I‚Äôm annoyed saw physician last week forgot ask things night telling husband wanted ask one it‚Äôs minimizing me.

No one country entire world truly ready this, equipped handle it. true. People think get 1) symptoms. 2) mild flu 3) die. People belive likely 1) worst 2). 

I think it‚Äôs 4) scenario scary too. Long lasting health impacts ‚Äúmild‚Äù case. dear friend mine ill months this, spent one night hospital. self employed person cannot work medical bills adding up. wonders ever whole again. dead, story doesn‚Äôt matter. Eh, fear. People either relying denial finding someone blame (people wearing masks/being careful) others see afraid are, hide true emotions. I've seen behavior people specific issues well, follows almost T. Made huge post earlier, yeah, lot people proud admit scared are, want pretend everything's okay normal. Putting their, families, lives risk simply emotional comfort, sad. tweet. Arabic first English oddly written right-hand side. here, too. Omfg expecting comments bad. Wow. typical immunity last long antibodies? 

I read walk around producing antibodies everything we've developed immunity to. Instead, body ""blueprint"" antibodies produced rapidly prevent reinfection, know that's true. suppose so, look 1 layer. Even catches someone 1% time, still reducing odds running infected person within store.

One big factor personal experience place I've check done Asian supermarket city. building, saw 2 people wearing mask. literal opposite go store (where also check).

So depends used. Another small, single study scientifically insignificant results, exact kind thing used push ineffective drugs actually killed people... yay! read comments section_and *comment* bullshit. also post viral problems, tachardia, sob, severe fatigue, rash, gi issues, body aches, cough, still taste sense smell issues.

I‚Äôm pretty convinced media conglomerates put underlings gag orders report realistic estimates. right still says COVID entirely media hype, I‚Äôm convinced literally opposite true. doesn‚Äôt media owners good economy collapses. media MOSTLY calm-mongered throughout whole ordeal. 

Remember entire month February literally EVERY single mainstream media outlet called anyone worried COVID moron ravaging Italy time? That‚Äôs knew shitstorm. fucking US news media tells you, ‚ÄúNah, don‚Äôt worry this, don‚Äôt pay attention‚Äù know you‚Äôre fucked. avoiding touching eyes, mouth, nose mucus membranes important avoid catching Covid-19, okay eat take out/carry-out food since touch interior mouth?


All materials read says takeout fine long careful packaging, could case? someone virus prepares food particles containing get food, food touches interior mouth. putting fingers Covid-19 lips transmit virus food not?

We able find clear answer anywhere family stopped eating food make months ago. anyone offer guidance this, would greatly appreciated. Everything searched issue comes different information virus, repeats official government statements takeout okay nothing seems explain why.

Would cooked takeout safer something cooked, like sushi?

If takeout food significant risk touching eyes ears matter Covid-19? race baiter. I‚Äôve tracking COVID-19 treatment research far plurality ongoing studies testing effects hydroxychloroquine.

Look excess deaths. Even UK still rise. Who's white supremacist? India quite successful PPE production now. used near none production coronavirus explosion, produce 450k PPE kits per day. Testing less agree. need ramp it. joking.  
I understand still part something hate much willing shut down. Move on, something else. That's saying. 7 10 Americans want virus want spread it.

I fixed title.   Swedes go Finland ""essential purposes"" work, visiting dying loved one, etc. However, problem almost certainly Finns go Sweden come back (Sweden's border closed Finnish government would write new laws prevent citizens going country open border), quarantine even though should. Further, I've heard mixed things border control (some say draconian say loose): truth probably middle tight be. I've heard anecdotes Swedes say lie order circumvent border controls (i.e. asked ""essential purpose"" lie say work), checked make sure lying. cannot combine, state white paper, two drugs toxic together. essentially, really less replaces remdesivir safer alternative less side affects. can't, understanding patent generic. anyone make right equipment.

First problem found people think run hardware store buy IR thermometer suffice. Unfortunately, devices designed measuring food high temperature, range body heat, they're wildly inaccurate. temperature sensitivity +/- 3 degrees C, nowhere near enough detecting even rough body temperature, never mind finding fever.

Next problem even thermometers designed measure human body temperature issues. generally accurate enough (+/- 0.2-0.3 degrees C) string requirements accuracy. First, person must area stable ambient temperature roughly 10 30 degrees C, must 10 30 minutes skin temperature stabilized, must free sweat contaminants surface skin. readers must also held 3 5 cm surface skin, meaning person taking temperatures must wear change PPE uses, wasteful tight supply. temperature provided devices also generated algorithmically, meaning they're estimate based satisfying prerequisites above.

The technologies found provided accurate measurements conditions would encounter entry screening fever tympanic (ear), sublingual (tongue) rectal thermometry. Rectal obvious reasons. Sublingual pretty invasive, requires disposables patient contact, consuming PPE. Tympanic less invasive still consumed excessive PPE. also studies methods screening fever could find, mixed, saying fever screening ineffective finding fever people. don‚Äôt know lot servers you?  way defeat racism apathetic whites, could care less black people. going make world uninhabitable them

Try rewording something like:


""Only way defeat racism white people make world uninhabitable white racists."" sad lose Dad. RIP That's helpful reply, insightful doublespeak astounding. Sometimes stare parents mostly keep distance anymore. It‚Äôs incredibly sad.  them? wonder reddit spammed articles suggested Swedens overall death toll highest europe. UK bigger death toll. fact Spain Italy given recording deaths....

Seems facts numbers... Wonder HR manager. he/she know fever? would come in? It‚Äôll downvoted Swedish troll herd ‚Äòcause makes Sweden look bad...   sad hear. renal diet fun. Basically limited fluids, low potassium, low sodium, low phosphorus. limiting things like tomatoes, bananas, potatoes, dairy, legumes, whole grains... it‚Äôs difficult follow. 

Dialysis also difficult‚Äîin clinic hemodialysis probably difficult, you‚Äôre tied clinic‚Äôs schedule, get less optimal blood filtering way (enough keep alive, enough keep healthy possible). home hemodialysis (my dad kidney failure this) means set schedule get blood filtration, there‚Äôs responsibility 90% care partner. 

I hope regains kidney function, either help transplant. Absolutely right. remember going Larry Mantle telling people low risk didn‚Äôt need anything. early March. moron. saw happened China Italy knew testing regime. not...play safe ? Hopefully two extremes chill fuck out. I‚Äôm sick people pieces shit refusing follow guidelines set place keep vulnerable people safe, time I‚Äôm sick people freaking whenever go outside house.

My parents? died it. Mother Cytokine Storm start body basically killed kidney's organs.

Jesus fucking christ. guess went like ""we best beautiful tests, tests country world etc""  Americans getting stupider reason. There's reason Powell go TV straight say people, taxes going corporations prop stocks, without even trying hide it.

No one think outside taught to. Meat packing plants obviously pursuing herd immunity among workers, costs terms human life damned. Wait...ur happy hear got infected? That's... interesting wait? Kick em midair! FUCKING SAY! happen reached 60%+. suggest magically reach herd immunity 7% wearing masks shows fundamental misunderstanding herd immunity works. nothing major happens? nutty lockdown folks chill fuck out? Seychelles Liechtenstein better gonna do? Unionize? Ha! Pleebs. masks use general public won‚Äôt provide much protection directly wearer. words keep catching virus. You‚Äôre wearing mask prevent spreading virus newly infected yet showing symptoms asymptomatic.

There many ways catch virus general public able use mask keep getting it. get eyes. get hands touch mouth, nose eyes. current publicly available masks won‚Äôt even stop breathing close enough someone infected.

You notice Healthcare Professionals wear multiple layers gloves, N95 respirator mask (blocks 95% small particles) face protection (large goggles whole face shield) prevent droplets getting eye region directly eyes. Russia already made cure Started June 1, donated June 10, got results today. Nah enabler help anything. Wow. That‚Äôs fucked. Lol. 1.5 crore Indians getting dead many many crores infected classifies ""survived"" ""successfull contamination"" ya? 6% population passed away Spanish flu India deaths country world. 

So classify ""not survive successful""? entire population India wiped face earth? Thats draw line? think old people avoid plague don‚Äôt need expired blood, doesn‚Äôt last forever it‚Äôs expensive ship another area. last months nice reminder large chunk humanity selfish, spiteful assholes. troll gives opportunity say nice things good person I'll take it.

Sometimes listen.

Sometimes someone reads wrote listens.

A lot people told google things us support, know, science reality.

Meanwhile every conspiracy theorist flat earthers anti-vaxxers, actual neo-nazis sit people explain crazy conspiracy bullshit.

I get supporters objective reality tired try bring people light facts, please ask sit people talk them. clearly understand herd immunity works. Herd immunity growth rate virus slowed enough existing immunity virus dies out. Slowing spread virus lowers threshold herd immunity therefore means incompatible. odds asymptomatic cases slipping cracks though? I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty high. I've overtime entire pandemic company gave us neither jack shit! Actually, no. doctor goes ""If fever 101 degrees, suppress either using cold compresses medication!"" seen people (YO!) well fevers allow fever 'burn infection out' bad idea. Why?

Hopefully isn‚Äôt deadly lesson. Uh already society lived in. pandemic needed. new outbreak? rumors imported contaminated supply Salmon. difficult answer. can't find straight answer state-level. borderline useless statistic, vast majority places Texas relatively unaffected coronavirus could hundreds hospitals covid patients yet full hospitals cities seeing high numbers. empty small population hospitals would make situation look less dire high pop areas truly struggling. bigger population areas also beds, so...maybe evens out?

Having traced situation Texas weeks, clearly affecting cities most, even cities highest populated cities. Dallas Houston, specifically. Sure, lots new cases cities like Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin--but really Dallas Houston bearing brunt. (And say Dallas mean Dallas--not DFW. unbelievable relatively unaffected even many counties within DFW are.)

Having said that, [this seems indicate still almost 15k hospital beds roughly 75% remaining.

Hearing 2k hospitalizations may seem alarming see say ""record number hospitalizations"", talking new hospitalizations total covid patients hospitals. Given Texas's new cases going up, expected (not saying matter, saying correlates new case numbers). means number people able send home smaller number new people admitted (for past week difference roughly 40 people, could translate 40 hospitals one admission daily number releases). scared saw details. wish good luck continued success there. ray hope. Oh no. Well, NZ act together I'm worried them. got this. Shame children. Incredibly selfish. Guy wipes mustard countertop, ""Hey guys im hero too"" bet testing, cases!  always seems overblown successful. west virginia, give shit lol Jesus Fucking Christ it‚Äôs walking dead üòÇ 

# Norway suspends virus-tracing app due privacy concerns

**Smittestopp limited effect small number users, says data agency**

*Agence France-Presse Oslo*

Mon 15 Jun 2020 15.21¬†BST Last modified Mon 15 Jun 2020 15.22¬†BST

 

Norway‚Äôs health authorities said suspended app designed help trace spread coronavirus country‚Äôs data protection agency said invasive privacy.

Launched April, smartphone app Smittestopp (‚Äúinfection stop‚Äù) set collect movement data help authorities trace spread Covid-19, inform users exposed someone carrying virus.

On Friday, data agency Datatilsynet issued warning would stop Norwegian Institute Public Health handling data collected via Smittestopp.

 Datatilsynet said restricted spread coronavirus well app‚Äôs limited effectiveness due small number people using it, meant invasion privacy resulting use disproportionate.

Camilla Stoltenberg, public health institute‚Äôs director, said disagreed assessment, institute would delete app‚Äôs data suspend work.

Stoltenberg said would weaken Norway‚Äôs response spread coronavirus. ‚ÄúThe pandemic over,‚Äù said.

The app used 600,000 Norway‚Äôs 5.4 million inhabitants. Developed Norway downloadable voluntary basis, application used centralised data storage, planned France UK.

Norway, reported 242 coronavirus deaths last week, recording handful new daily infections. 95 175. actively testing non symptomatic people? it‚Äôs people ‚Äúwho think may it‚Äù number less surprising Oh wow, never knew that.  Threaten? aren‚Äôt already it? many die? southwest utahian feel this. feel like 102¬∞ fever shortness breath. Ugh. funny thing is, biggest war America‚Äôs future, itself. Closer two thirds 1 third That‚Äôs called drunken stupor plan I‚Äôve following again, Chinese company. China misled entire world day one. us thankful homes hunker in. fresh water tap, sewerage, delivery services entertainment via internet. spoiled choice myself, think real hard complaining have. Seriously, think y'all time. much appreciate you.

Y'all keep whole world together go unnoticed. take precautions, stay safe. this""well I'm afraid dying"" business. heaven's sake, anything want live for?? kind test other's bravery. That's like playing Russian roulette, life, everyone elses life. outrageously stupid. get virus amongst themselves, give everyone even casual contact with. one could become asymptomatic virus symptoms spread around without knowing it. Kind makes lose faith human race. Good luck, think would spend time people value life future. Trump narcissism unacceptable. want make money? would stupid eliminate like half customers. us understand role government US made people prosperous. 

You lot privilege think 99% Americans aren‚Äôt living coveted lifestyle compared rest worlds population. Nah 79.9 ü§£ maybe drunk?  ~~local state~~ GOP ~~over there~~ imagine.


Ftfy Care elaborate? react whenever someone disagrees you? Wait, come from? Wait crowd 35,000 watching soccer without mask spread No, chinese candidate planning testing brazil due favorable conditions getting data quickly.

There another chinese candidate joint venture canada china (CanSino) undergo testing Canada So? I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs inherently bad something made China Chinese manufacturers incapable making effective goods. 

The company made machine I‚Äôm posting quality control components sourced China sells passes quality control, like countless companies do*. policy replacing defective goods slip through, send replacement, doesn‚Äôt put anyone‚Äôs life health risk.

Dropshippers retailers don‚Äôt can‚Äôt quality control, especially criteria get cheapest merchandise find, pass risk defective/counterfeit/substandard goods consumers.

*Including I‚Äôve worked with. shit goods Chinese manufacturers try pass something else impressively ballsy. advantages receiving blood antibodies? Cant wait get rid crippled turd abbott 2-14 days could protests Exactly. live, 90% wearing masks 10% not, 10% gets grilled guilt tripped. diseases lessening severity vaccine best do. flu shots do. Covid may damn hopefully moderna successful Fuck tha cowboys 
- sincerely eagles fan world speak English come sub information.

The vast majority people use American made, American run website Americans Dexamethasone extremely widespread probably found almost every hospital, doctor's office veterinary clinic developed world. also cheap make. Trying buy horde would exercise futility. Okay kinda like take, change would like see would political influence? Feel free show said america shitty place world. Come on, that's 2017 thinking there's way he'd say that. always says idiotic thing! Get 2020! Well, least we're learning. today they've shown initial good results using inflammatory drug already market treatment!

I'd careful treating everything list proven BTW. I'm receptive computational structure-based models well-grounded inferences some, there's much know virus isolated contexts point due restrictions live virus research. I'd love see coming labs clearance think pinning basic mechanistic factors would offer great deal clarity.

Re: clotting, find paper (I guess they're skipping preprint) FT covered today to-be-published research zeroing syncytial formation related thrombosis structural damage lung. Another piece puzzle! 10x death toll compared neighbouring countries. GDP dropped like neighbours. heard immunity waitig vaccine like rest world.
If vaccine comes reasonably soon death could avoided. People owning actual data huge issue though.  needs way transparency data used yes even including contact tracing data. Maybe im missing 1/3 portion, lets look stats trial oxygen. ""25% mortality reduced 20%"" statistically significant tjat 20% expected mortality reduction oxygen. Obviously, means (in hypothetical world) 100 people needed oxygen, without steroids 25 people die, 75 survive. rewind time give 100 drug, 20 still die, 80 survive (a reduction 20%). Draw conclusion current death totals US, 115,000 dead (we use 100,000 sake easy calcs), 

100,000 Die assume needed oxygen x .8 ( 20/25) means could assume 20,000 lives saved. 

So no, see 1/3, 5% reduction deaths large number spoken relative terms assumed mortality. Thanks... even reduction 40% 28% big win. hope works patients. ""odd"" think? important states considered grabs November seem problems. No, read Chinese. Someone ProMED summarized recently. Stories like friend can't quantify impacts COVID death toll. die severe consequences.

There lung transplants, permanent lung damage, coma, stroke, brain damage, heart organ damage. cases required amputation limb. people still sick months after. 

But taking threat sensibly seriously. We're fucked. Depends definition ‚Äúfalse positive‚Äù. truly false positive extremely unlikely (false negatives common, false positives not, except cases true lab error). Testing positive viral debris remains system relatively likely. However, new severe symptoms reasons take second positive seriously first. Agreed! hope Finland, Denmark Norway institute it, would help things immensely. Yet another reason race herd immunity horrible idea novel virus. longer doctors experiment treatments, better chance loved ones surviving. That's Americans exceptionally unhealthy american health care system shames. food grown locally also cheaper even so, isnt comparable saying. look US considerably cheaper eat unhealthy foods. Well something good must happening, death rates continue decrease cases keep going (and cases going up), must getting better treating unless bad/manipulative data reporting. 

Hopefully we're figuring out. hm.. maybe studies flawed, thought ive seen several properly-designed studies on-going initial results positive?  Wut? behind COVID-modeling study used president‚Äôs coronavirus task force warning virus hot spots beginning converge jump county county people increase travel work summer doctors working study put together PolicyLab Children‚Äôs Hospital Philadelphia, virus moving along major highways interstates‚Äîsuch I-10 California, I-85 south I-95 East Coast‚Äîas states continue reopen economies. discussions last weeks absolutely clue meant sarcasm not. neglect point Eleventy bazillion. Heals Covid, prevents playing Major League Baseball season that‚Äôs probably cancelled anyway... machine learning model predicts around 180k October. dont believe adjusted recent spikes r 1 One saddest things mishandling corona Sweden disproportionately harmed vulnerable groups elderly immigrants (regardless color skin: one group badly hurt well newer immigrants [Finns immigrated Sweden ). 

For one example: one thing that's really blown mind Sweden, taken hundreds thousands non-Swedish speakers last years, offer much information languages Swedish. one two Nordic countries (along Norway) offer English language summaries press conferences, example. 

But systemic failure help non-native populations goes deeper that, sadly. pretty obvious spread Sweden comes Finland expression actualy doesnt involve god ? understand concept

precise.

the app sends anonymous signals ever often (like 5 minutes thereabouts) picked active bluetooth devices app installed vicinity, devices save signals receive.

Once get tested positive corona, make app upload signals( one send one received, sure atm) devices check find matching signals local storage.

That means people met 1 week ago brief time bus underground know contact someone covid.

That means app make sense people already currently covid. makes sense dont it.

If - knowingly - still go out, deserve ever happens you. mentioned color anywhere, mentioned one race superior one

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Woohoo! something celebrate. hope breakthroughs like continue save lives develop vaccine. people run drugstores start stockpiling this: benefit mostly works patients ventilators. preventative mild case treatment, largely proven benefits. real privacy concerns contact tracing apps. something open door never able close done right. Oh yeah, mean can‚Äôt say blame people though. entire Federal government‚Äôs response stick head sand, plug ears, scream ‚ÄúLa la la la can‚Äôt hear you!!‚Äù anyone says opposite going look little crazy time. natural distrust government knew right shit get real. 


It also doesn‚Äôt help majority State‚Äôs senators house reps literally hyper-narcissistic, borderline sociopaths couldn‚Äôt give shit happens long keep getting lobbyist money. kinda get coming from. However, comparable wearing seat belt driving. Driving inherent risk, mitigate adopting certain safety precautions. 


I think agree driving recklessly without seatbelt ideal undertaking. like driving unsafely, wearing mask described above, putting others risk. 


My state good keeping new infections low. would hate see thrown away people unwilling adhere simple guideline like, ""Please, wear mask inside building."" Time mid-season mini-finale friend hasn‚Äôt quarantined originally complained immune compromised. saying given new medication longer immune compromised. possible? quarantining all, even though complained job working beginning immune conpromised (which knew about). I‚Äôm slightly confused really taken new medication actually takes away fact compromised immune system want see people?  that's nice. I'd love leave phone home sometimes. :)

But highly doubt majority people thing you. even using apps home, still collect data. location (I.e. home adress), much that, see profit humankind times (Don't get wrong, use apps too. Whatsapp become necessity me). Corona-app hand good purpose I'd highly recommend anyone look functionalities behind it. really think misunderstandings could easily solved. Cheap drug, reduces deaths, I'd say probably best news we've around Covid while. FYI site quoting heavily bias. Media fact check calls it‚Äôs tin foil conspiracy site. think good plan. discourage lot unneccessary traveling across border. thought used low power bluetooth. lot old phones can't actually run app. No, address I'm saying all. Sweden exactly amount deaths long run long term immunity basically everyone everywhere get it. There's eliminating virus *ever* without long term immunity, contagious enough reach every corner globe that's case. honest... 50 years late. Planes always petri dishes full colds, flu lord knows else. :) Yeah zoom quite often hard part knowing catches won‚Äôt make long Covid test two days ago today gets results Something either funny isn‚Äôt - complicated Wow actual large RCT using appropriate drug intended plausible method action, presenting real-world result %. 

Can given orally there's possibility helping severe patients even hospital crush poor local health system. good. Also cheap, available easy make major pharma company two current manufacturers. 

This much better similar results monoclonal antibody. Biologic drugs cannot manufactured scale needed deal pandemic. Ugh, American, makes sad.  know people think differently me, far I'm concerned, sure got crap deal overwhelming shame last 3 years exhausting demoralizing. sad. 5 times 10 equal 50, 35 - guess average course treatment must 7 days 

I read differently. total cost medication (for 10 days, whatever duration treatment is) ¬£5 per patient. drug ""save"" everybody - saves 1 patient 7. give drug 7 patients (at cost 7 * ¬£5 = ¬£35) order save one them. Meaning cost save one life ¬£35. 

I hope actual study released, good results hold peer review. knowledge good treatment options available, better! quit went clean pools 1000 bucks week working 30 hours most.  hot fuck summer, cold balls winter, sure beats watching fat bastard nothing earning 3x salary. analysis antibody production works partially correct. don‚Äôt constantly produce antibodies virus you‚Äôve exposed to. Rather, immune system trained recognize virus produce said antibodies exposed. way stated makes sound like you‚Äôre impression keep producing antibodies every strain flu you‚Äôve ever exposed constantly. case Well what‚Äôs news say add million things cops currently ticket for.

I see that: police enforce like speeding seat belt laws always speed wear seat belt. really worried infections? deaths? everyone infected one dies, I'd say that's fantastic result world start spinning again. China's covid numbers true. Look statistics country say 50000 confirmed cases, lay next China's know they're bullshitting. Especially considering first country get hit zero knowledge react. Believing numbers China puts pretty naive IMO... Even true, still highlight mind dangerous Covid is. wasn‚Äôt deadly proper treatments vaccine wouldn‚Äôt operating undue pressure push various drugs crazy ideas like drinking bleach treatments. Covid less threat proven therapeutics vaccine. Hemoglobin specifically, I'm sure related low iron iron-deficiency anemia treat supplements, per doctor.  Birmingham's population 71% black. Blacks make 26% Alabama's population, account 41% cases 46% first civilization built slavery - truly selfless collective work üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ joke every post like sorting controversial default.

Make small smart decisions, can, hopefully live long healthy happy life. Certainly better alternative, leads purposefully going way subject risks reaffirm nothing. governor state Sao Paulo allie china Bolsonaro ? one pushing test Thats opinion piece. Arnold approves! another reason important catch disease early, can. Even without vaccine, treatments still improve massively, perhaps even point vaccine needed. Richard Hendricks would proud! Cheer up, friend. finally piece good news treatment front. lack integrity stand believe in. Stop hiding, proud,cuck boi!! 

Why benghazi big deal? Cant answer? üòÇ Look guy. think eating tomatoes whole grains? Maybe form ketchup meat breading.

Not mention dairy really thing black community  US whole, deaths trending down. However, due prior hotspots reduced infections/deaths starting reopen. states starting report cases reopended last month, lag time people sick enough hospitalized die. concern hospitalizations deaths rise again. states seeing increase hospitalizations right now, worrisome. Think this-if virus spreading, tests would negative. ""more tests"". Last time remember, first civilization built collective work independent arrogance ignorance. Sports completely nonessential. 

They refused there. poll determined America gone retarded punch you, problem, fists problem? point never properly conveyed government. sub guilty demonizing people going beaches outdoors without mask. nobody knows what's conflicting messaging. Y‚Äôall need read shit making ridiculous claims fact.

Can really blame cynical? USA routinely fucks people drug prices point come expect it. tl;dr woosh

No, agree them. know we're always saying, young people super likely get seriously ill spread others? spreading others bit external thing exerts evolutionary pressure.

So really offensive thing barhoppers *won't* winning many darwin awards. Essentially every reliable piece data says this. Bergamo 0.6% PFR &lt;50% infected. NYC 0.28% PFR ~20% infected. Spain 0.07% PFR 5% infected. Belgium, NL, UK data same. places healthcare insufficient, likely case everywhere around US, since data suggests something like half deaths occur outside hospitals.

You see lower IFR estimates places planned response - Germany, Denmark, Sweden. highly unlikely we're going see US. Well that's consequence fed much western propaganda. number cases hidden... simply testing lot people. countries huge hidden number cases, impossible test every person every day B12 injections feel like getting broken glass injected It‚Äôs literally already gold standard every single medicine pharma.... greatly exagerrating negative effect steroids. risk joint issues, especially prolonged use, issues minor.  condolences losses. :( Flash freezing may preserve viral particles, ensuring infectious much longer day two.

The unhealthiness people already rolled stats risk COVID-19. Well yea unemployment stuff mean ""intervention economy"". relatively minor investment towards maintaining productive capacity could actually created v-shaped recovery people think going occur, primed us able open-close-open virus dictated (like literally covering payroll temporarily companies could option).

But that, we're going suffer brunt high unemployment lag time getting productive capacity back top medical problems social unrest happen. 100% also hope government officials held accountable.

Well government would actually provide assistance people everyone rush open work make money could pay bills. virus exposed America. shit. government cares wealthy everyone else left suffer.

 Feeling fine rest doesnt say much respiratory capacity need exercise Lung damage happens majority asymptomatic patients, according article appeared reddit yesterday:

Everyone talking second wave *now* ignorant fact never actually got first wave. fall/winter really worries moment honestly feel like we‚Äôre gonna get steamrolled especially people acting way they‚Äôre acting now. 

I know hoping vaccine year that‚Äôs also something don‚Äôt see happening. That‚Äôs miracle work get effective vaccine actually works mass production within 10 months thing.

Meanwhile confirmed COVID deaths US 118,888 today. real number likely higher even now.

Pneumonia Influenza mortality US peaked nearly 28 percent deaths early (April). still 7.3 percent week ending June 6, that's death certificates in. flu, peak near 12 percent 2018 - 2019 flu season.

Then Joann middle class citizen got laid full-time job audacity tell ""stop buying avocado toast save rainy day next time."" 

Nothing change America. many people braindead blind. That's government gets away much. Hell - even never develop another vaccine, gives manufacturers vaccine opportunity address intense demand build supply ready next shot, billion-person waiting list.

Honestly seems hotspot northeast simply shifted south. Look behavior difference people, long states north utilize masks respect distancing honestly able keep control successful reopening, start going acting like it‚Äôs bite us right ass think slightly unpleasant conclusion virus going burn out.

All states seeing rises (in hospitalizations, ICU usage, etc) states low prevalence virus back March April.

It easy say ""Well cases going reopened!!""

That really make much sense fit data.

Midwestern states much higher amount virus circulation aggressively re-opening places like TX AZ.

So TX AZ numbers go WI numbers keep going down?

The northeast bit cautious re-openings claim reason numbers keep going explain Midwest.

IN gang-busters re-opening since early May. Numbers keep falling.

WI order removed state's supreme court. increase numbers keep going down.

Ohio 180 re-opened again---numbers keep going down.

IL MI cautious slow numbers keep going down.

That help explain states like CO plains states (OK example) also seeing numbers keep going down.

If claim ""Well people south using AC"". Well hot places like IN, OK, etc numbers still falling.


So many harder hit states re-open time pace places like TX numbers go keep falling? Sublingual b12 May get shots. Vitamin cream helps psoriasis.

It's really frustrating. graph shows numbers going up? They're flat best, sound like cherry picking data suit narrative. person misinterpreting data yourself.

Nonono. misinterpreted data, everyone else.

You cannot assess study press release. amount sloppy science happening atrocious. I'm embarrassed side us public seeing. get Arizona really hot. know transmission risks much lower outdoors places well-ventilated fresh air. it'd reasonable compromise AZ require masks places air conditioning.

But FFS, long past time mask requirement! People places gone first SARS epidemic simply can't counted sufficiently mask up. least, Ducey let local towns cities set mask requirements (he currently blocks so). America lands sex offender registry. twenty thousand confirmed new cases day every day since march, due americas piss poor testing number (as well confirmed deaths number) vast understatement.

Can provide numbers say cases deaths vastly understated? Otherwise making guess. United States [pretty countries tests/1,000 population.

Regardless, said like using case counts - entirely dependent testing way know true amount cases. replace 'Chile' 'Most Latin America' there.

Peru seemed everything right, closed borders, early lockdown, etc, yet hot zone.

Read article carefully - dementia patient, former surgeon, released one medical facility outbreak, flew cross-country 499 others flight, immediately went another facility. conflicting information whether symptomatic in-flight, seems second facility recognized almost immediately risk, hospitalized elsewhere next day.

Of note - despite headline would suggest, 50 cases flight! (It appears contact tracing done passengers...that unclear...?!) Instead, ‚Äúapproximately 50 residents staff facility tested positive.‚Äù one traced fatality carrier (who recovered) young nurse.

Agree that, pretty clearly states 50 cases nursing home (making headline horribly misleading) instead government insisting masks didn‚Äôt work, created protocols optimal masking strategy would over, safely. 

Instead bunch cry babies wanting mask spreading misinformation. misinformation people like special needs met talked about.

Masks work, effectiveness significantly improved good masking practices. Similarly, side effect minimized good practices. said it, odds high opposite true... increase almost 200 hospitalizations 2518 day!

Fewer international students 2020‚Äì21 academic year
International students families reluctant send children abroad given uncertainty future second wave next outbreak virus fall 2020. Studyportals, Dutch‚Äêbased global study choice platform, released survey potential study abroad students since outbreak COVID‚Äê19. Survey results revealed 83% respondents believe future travel plans restricted, 63% believe parents‚Äô savings decrease virus.

More 1 million international students enrolled United States spring semester returned home countries. unknown many return United States fall semester.

In study 234 American universities conducted March 2020 Institute International Education, three four schools said virus forced cancel outreach recruitment events Chinese students, single largest group global students United States.

Add COVID‚Äê19 safety concerns American schools highest tuition costs difficult federal visa processing, becomes apparent decrease international student enrollment prior pandemic accelerate post‚ÄêCOVID‚Äê19. ""Elsewhere"" ? lol!

I care ""good"" news ""bad"" news, words ALWAYS subjective ADVERTISING PAYING IT! Given Tuesday 'peak' reporting day weekend strikes good.

I'm kind expecting new outbreaks, given level things opened up, nature beastie, happy moment. Europeans r way irrational potemkin village 'data security' Americans romantic notion 2nd amendment. Failure TTI Feb/March unlike PRC, RoK, RoC clear example that. default subs years lol OC perhaps? fizzle new cases come area. 99% people good careful.

(Except you, dickhead checkout today, mask nose. saw you, selfish cunt) closest example professor makes good points class, believe God, listen thing say.

In case attack made based person's opinion god.

Talking someone's behaviour, rather argument making is, textbook definition ""personal attack"" ""ad marked attack opponent's character rather answer contentions made  *ad hominem* personal attack think bad person, think behaving badly one topic.

You may want admit it, personal attack. ""behaving"" nothing merits arguments.

I would suggest fact address arguments instead engage personal attacks calls question ""behaviour"" well... that's ad hominem. seen picture lungs young woman lung transplant covid... insane. Man, I'm sick seeing this. die mean fucking suck. Let go bar lungs hurt next 6 months. least got totally wasted bro. Get transplant he'll peeing like champ time. Eh...Louisiana saying hold beer one. awful outbreak least 25% since reopening. interesting watch moving forward. ?  What? started testing people, period. Meanwhile, daily deaths, directly connected number new infections, delayed incubation period illness death, continuing drop two weeks since cases started spiking due increased testing.

But whole thing simple: look deaths/day, stop dropping, know wrong. start rising heavily again, know right. deaths already happened though, seemingly flu remember, disappear. Good. Omg thread though. guys see said ""if quit testing coronavirus, little, any, confirmed cases""....................üòë Let's face it. passed number ago Trump asked Red-State Governors lie! solution particular looking for?  schools planning normal reopening. literally explained, last comment, holocaust nothing this. something happens many die holocaust, doesn‚Äôt mean thing isn‚Äôt bad. fact explain people mind boggling. disagree voting person.

State officials say wrong internet epidemiologist opinion matter all. far, research showing that. weak exposure cases, antibodies either showing testing, disappearing short period time. may case larger exposures, blanket statement mesh research far. Yes, low level, Texas extremely mild epidemic prior Memorial Day, especially state large Texas. plenty hospital beds Texas. Lol yeah, leadership. sorry. Goddamn sucks. I'd like corrected necessary broad exterior observation:

Covid less damage body immune system.

If I'm correct steroids used lower immune response. point would calm immune system prevent destroying body ? Seriously. health departments need insist ""no shoes, shirt, mask, service"" think number drastically higher even considered, given mentality states. posted think Texas state wide lockdown come 200K cases 20K deaths. 

Suggestion federal barricades? would need way higher that, subject lawsuits. think it'll happen, think people naturally try avoid Texas long that. come voters saying ‚Äúyeah fuck grandma!‚Äù

My grandma died 103 - deaf, could barely walk, slept day. you‚Äôre saying death, someone lived full long life, someone hasn‚Äôt lived long, you‚Äôre insane. doctors prescribing drug, means all. likely next patients oxygen ventilation receiving treatment, therefore death rate fall beyond today. 


Additionally study proved effectiveness low dosages, 6 mg per day means side effects seen higher dosages avoided. Huh, really? mean, I'm surprised. knew going happen inevitably vacation season coming up, soon? oopsy daisey They‚Äôre phase 2/3 trials still recruitment phase - joined study yesterday. course gathering body body thousand friends fine, long ad woke. Hahaha!!! Well overstatement describe different scale we're currently recording. ever heard number deaths measured villages question posed regarding size metric. defense pretty much impossible predict this. Literally nobody warned every single scientist expert harping safe rush open economy. Florida government real victim here. No, rapid coronavirus tests (i.e. hours) sometimes generate false positives. Ok help understand - long term ultimate solution? breathe 3 holes face. Cover 3 holes.

It‚Äôs like dealing toddlers. [Class mobility decreasing lowest point currently education costs, COL, stagnated wages. really true Except America, seem nothing despite situations warranting action... bacon tastes good humans canine teeth, can‚Äôt possibly survive without it!!

Seriously though, we‚Äôre bound fuck factory farming point. Even I‚Äôd surprised anything actually changed. I'm sure many consultants still Mon-Thurs grind state laws allow it, I'd bet people find new ways spend money well long everything completely closed.

Speaking consultant, F500s banned contractors site foreseeable future. Even unlikely companies would take risk restart travel again. Losing 50 year old architect equivalent losing $336,000 year minimum billable hours. Even sick disability month huge liability. someone works medical field, think sort response dangerous, negligent, counterproductive.

As activist works overpoliced communities, know information collected benign public health reasons also used tools discrimination, punishment, deportation (this still happens even though regulations surrounding this).

The US really bad reputation using much data possible domestic surveillance.

I really blame folks trusting health care workers information.

But Congress CDC step in. People need assured COVID-19 information contacts used punitively. stop Trump holding rally Saturday? money‚Äôs won‚Äôt Yes, Ducey continue ole ‚ÄúSmoke Mirrors‚Äù approach. Sorry, please resume. It‚Äôs hope. solution looking ignores many pitfalls takes get there.

A corona free america comes vaccine comes. That's debated (except extremist nutjobs insist corona hoax).

The current debate many americans allowed die us bored meantime.

Here's really fun part. better follow lock-down requests, less time spend lock-down. case loads get small enough, return individual quarantines contract tracing. refusal follow guidelines actually prolonging everyone.

So people following recommendations forced inside even longer, give shit neighbors living up.

The conscientious us punished, selfish benefiting rest detriment.

The onus (and us individually). America want live in? selfish rewarded, looking fellow man rewarded? dumbest reasoning...daily cases go up, even positivity % low, cause negative today mean can't catch week month...and positive cases grow, thats vectors, thats 2000 'infected' turned loose daily...this mess. like 10,000 cases day, bad cause 'we tested 100,000'. right hospitalization rates change 5-7 days changes infection rate, deciding based metric means response 5-7 days later. That's lot time contagious disease spread, even though feels like nothing us, take 2-3 weeks hospitalization rates finish spiking lockdown enacted new infections take course. necessarily. lot workers infected early places treating airborne pathogen, outfitting workers adequate PPE. Unless course workers antibodies forgoing PPE treating corona patients still getting infected. 12 163 exposed church goers agreed tested COVID public health officials. 

It‚Äôs non-zero chance several since spread community asymptomatic refusing cooperate officials. consistently keep deaths 1k tuesdays thursdays progress. rising cases many places, death rate continue go down. next article feed:

I'm Swedish way, I'm allowed say so, kinda.

Edit: downvoters. opinion, fact. Take post created earlier interesting thing happened today's press conference (2020-06-16):  Tegnell denied ever claiming possible reach herd immunity without vaccine.** one single journalist much flinched remark!?  said before, think possible reach herd immunity without vaccine.""  what?  weeks back:  think countries, epidemiologists talk agree herd immunity one thing eventually slow spread virus. Nothing else slow long-term. Either reach people getting infected getting well again, reach vaccinating people. vaccine far ...""  get one single counter-question that??

If that's gaslighting, tell is? Can‚Äôt enjoy idiot genocide without bringing facts logic? fair it‚Äôs probably like 59.9% 69.9% go; herd immunity doesn‚Äôt require 100% population antibodies 

But get mostly joking, joke isn‚Äôt substantially changed using lower numbers  It‚Äôs glucocorticoids... even one used study available, use another one family. They‚Äôre cheap fuck thousands generic drugs companies produce them.

Earlier week different thread, took look Texas added COVID cases fast enough outpace FL, MI recently PA state 8th, 7th 6th cases COVID, last 5 weeks. 

And rate we're going, we'll overtake IL #5 early July, #4 mid-August, NJ #3 late August ... even **New York** #2 August 2021, current trends hold, there's working vaccine then. (We ever overtake CA #1, based head-start larger daily case counts.)

It kinda blew mind ran calculations. New York could wracked huge numbers ... Texas may *match* them, cases deaths, said done This. Hi there, low karma idiot. viewpoints shitful. six years. think I'll skip advice. Fuck don't. US denialism going cost us big time. could sworn saw study found SARS survivors still antibodies decade later. *15 friends test positive coronavirus night Lynch‚Äôs*

Arthur Fleck:

You get fucking deserve. neither - bothers Ok many (but all) protestors wearing masks three weeks later, spike. open beaches long everyone wears masks right? know you‚Äôre right. tough choice. can‚Äôt help wishing job stayed closed July like others intentionally staff could collect full unemployment benefit, are. took PPP loan reopen get maximum loan forgiveness. It‚Äôs shitty hand lot us service dealt.

Anyway, helped cold think. cold, similar covid19 symptoms lasted days. tested US federal leadership. Oh yeah, totally see coming from. seems still many ""it's flu"" people that's easy think that's sort statement saying. think one cases comparing ""absolute numbers"" like OP needs bit context added it. could weld people apartments. outside observer, posts insults, straw men, fallacies, personal attacks. linked data, including arguments, keep claiming poster acting bad faith.

From position, everything claim doing, doing.

If can't make well-sourced argument, perhaps keep mouth shut. Spoiler alert: no. get summary they're pushing think Mike Myers yelling Cassandra wrong church maybe develop high antibody count maintain one susceptible re-infection? understand things you‚Äôve learned western media sound scary, understand types lists made government. example: 

Did know United States 6% worlds population, 25% worlds prisoners? made statement CCP, you‚Äôd upset them.

Did know United States, government murders black people streets, often times shooting back? (Now know issue far complicated this, see easily statements creating fear made?)

Did know prisoners United States used cheap labor corporations? Another statement made China, would upset with. 

Did know United States government drops average 30,000 bombs people color around world year? 90% victims US drone strikes unintended target according pentagon. 

Did know yesterday okay majority state‚Äôs fire someone born transgender gay?  US must evil right ?


I go on.  I‚Äôm eating lunch I‚Äôll stop there. Hopefully someone let us know catch COVID19. like good gloat. others situation ask taught ‚ÄúHuff coughing‚Äù respiratory therapist. you‚Äôre stuck home lots Youtube videos.

The difference scaled 10mil would be:

It‚Äôs difficult accurate numbers. good thing. airline every right require everybody, including passengers, wear mask protect employees passengers flight. someone problem policy, need flying United Airlines airline enacts policy matter, let alone traveling all. fact, really hope airlines will/already policy place. Wearing mask hours difficult thing do. 50,000 acute onset diabetes caused Covid: varies based county sure.
I‚Äôm Floridian yet wear mask. I‚Äôm Northwest Tampa, county populated limited cases.

I think it‚Äôs time governors hand control counties lockdowns, one-size fit all. Covid19 flu separate tests. lockdown too? disagree voting person. followed Wisconsin chart daily election held 7th, [you see cases start clearly trend upwards starting april remember well thought odd nobody reporting it. I'm az, 22 years old damn want goto bar im letting idiots go first. Even though I'm low risk like come AZ READ NATIONAL HEADLINE .

Hm..now would perfect name force? team five million put hard yards good work buggered-up people coming back virus. Auckland Wellington trip without coffee, toilet, petrol stops, yeah, right. sign... think does. think mods clearly one side political spectrum.

Plus virus *is* political. independent government agencies approving drug testing people *because meme Twitter self published study Google Docs* becomes weird try discuss without politics get banned sub. ""Encouraging anyone tests poditive stay home much possible"" good enough. countries mentioned fined/jailed people tested positive still went out. National review bullshit source. i'm already 99% that's said meant. Sounds like found volunteer tough time believing went 8 hours without stop. Technically possible, course, seems unlikely. Nope, lockdown cost many lives saves, reduced tax receipts ensure government service cuts vulnerable, shift health resources covid-19 mean acute chronic illness gets neglected, causing patients die, also setting immunology catastrophe use toxic chemicals frequently disinfectant areas inhabit, overuse sanitizers cause drug resistant strains bacteria viruses spend next 10 years fighting.

I've said things times downvoted it, I'm conspiracy theorist, simply like guided people neglect consider unintended consequences. Crunch time baby really, big part problem sensitivity PCR samples often obtain upper airways COVID19 disease lower airways. Obtaining better sample difficult productive cough.

Over-reliance medications weakness body cannot afford immune system needs able function much can. Man, people dumb. policy maker, anything laymen level understanding virus really matter think.

But policy maker, level understanding, would start systematically infecting people least likely develop severe symptoms government program. number people infected per stage determined medical capability area factoring likelihood infected group require hospital beds. quarantine home infection. monitor phone every day case develop mild symptoms. recovering jobs secured law. Stage stage herd immunity reached 60 ~ 80% population.

Not science based objective, arbitrary objective function. science based objective cost-benefit analysis. want make science based, please define deaths count. US? Developed world? Thirdworld hunger/famine derivative deaths? Etc.

US standard measures health policy cost-benefits make actions ""worth it"" around $100k per quality-adjusted life year saved. cost higher, worth saving any. Ecstatic tbh, hopefully nobody else gets sick stupidity See, two different Americas... sample entire human population people previously infected? least city police China shoot regular citizens color. Tank army thing. going prove $15 per hour federal minimum wage.

No, proves Universal Basic Income (and minimum wage all).

The thing almost everyone wants ""mOaR mInImUm WagEz"" fails understand jobs guaranteed... companies trying make profit.

If raise labor costs, one easiest ways balance hiring fewer workers / investing automation.

So (the general ""you"", anyone reading this, person I'm responding to) feels like minimum threshold income people need order survive (and is) - realize means GOVERNMENT PROVIDE income, corporations.

If government provides it, everyone gets it. Period. corporations provide it, everyone mercy still convince hire order get minimum. easily find loopholes avoid hiring people (like eliminating positions redistributing work remaining employees, automation/robots, reduced production hours [that still results profit], etc.) people ""intending help"" get left without jobs (more importantly) without income all. Basically, higher minimum wage help someone job (or loses company willing pay much)?

Another thing everyone universal basic income, gives employees much bargaining power corporations, offer safe working conditions, decent hours, decent pay, etc. simply choose work still income government fall back on. government passes buck corporations (like currently do), gives corporations power: work them, else get income. people tolerate bad work environments, long hours, low pay, etc. trying get kind income that's currently way get it. Take away dependency working conditions improve tremendously (because companies improve find anyone work them!). smaller figure expecting (I'd guessed 1-2%). prince beat mj Maybe get traction McDonalds probably change headline CRAP. Here's found: ""Asymptomatic infection may associated subclinical lung abnormalities, detected computed tomography.""

Most Americans phones site run mobile traffic Yes 8 hours without stop amazing. must carrying gas tanks minimum. FDA would send one without adequate testing

I bridge sale. predicted 3,000 people died hurricane Puerto Rico, 57 death certificates ever issued key properly gaguing China believing say believing do.

They relaxed restrictions Beijing two weeks ago existing cluster time. 

There's already slight ridicule public towards government reinstating restrictions less two weeks normalcy. first. Coworker spent 3 weeks pneumonia, sound like fun?  Corona cum?  many people fired FDA coming weeks? Either breath gets everything fine, undetectable mist droplet form. 6 half-dozen lol people? use allergy meds stop this? England definitely island. Great Britain name island. like Haiti island Hispaniola is. enormous focus masks article comments think misplaced. point locking build medical capacity, hire enough people contact tracing transmission levels facilitate contract tracing isolation. managed Australia. day small number think currently every single one tracked origin known contacts tested isolated. 

To close trash economy, cases decrease open like without implementing controls crazy. Well even people go sober may go good intentions. Like, I‚Äôm going wear mask, sit outside significant other, etc.

sorry man, situation sucks. two big events piled right top other, bad. MAD discipline! English first language. 

I making fun claim China's cases ""code 100 multiplied factor."" Lead Paragraphs:

We‚Äôve learned much coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there‚Äôs still much need learn order defeat devastating pandemic. Among critical questions: young people appear healthy history chronic disease get sick virus? people 80s 90s seemingly shrug infection? There‚Äôs something going biologically, don‚Äôt yet answers.

We do, however, resources enable us examine lots data search biological clues. One NIH‚Äôs Us Research Program, seeking help 1 million people build one diverse health databases nation‚Äôs history. Two years national launch, program already enrolled nearly 350,000 diverse participants across United States.

As name suggests, Us open people age 18 communities around country. important strength effort welcoming participants backgrounds. Indeed, 75 percent people volunteered program come groups traditionally underrepresented medical research. includes people many racial ethnic minority groups, well many different ages, socioeconomic backgrounds, geographic locations, including remote rural areas. 65 deaths since friday yes. sounds alot wonder Italy Spain. bad can't see numbers.


I like want talk france, Italy Spain counting deaths correctly. Esp Spain completly stoped counting deaths. churches want pass collection basket person. also passing virus around it. Facts. fear. agree. However, feeling that, **potentially**, one solutions improving efficacy mitigations may use temperature screening would appear biased towards letting COVID-19 positive people through. lack screening may increase compliance remaining mitigations. 

Either way, it'll next impossible prove one way another data simply (and require people's attitudes, it'll subjective). certainly work though minimising social/physical contact households covering face reduce emission respiratory droplets. 

I'm authority subject, opinion read stuff. agree strategy changes needed areas, would encourage consider US union many states instead homogenous zone. Many US states bigger European countries, least comparably sized. US states vastly different laws, policies, cultures. US citizens speak differently would able fluently communicate put room. downward trend

This true. Example: Michigan, slightly bigger UK, 78 new cases yesterday 2 deaths one worst hit areas couple short months ago. Even report 200 today, magnitude state contact tracers operate effectively (independent ""the US"" federal government). truth, US states watching case numbers decline, albeit slowly 

The surges US alarming I'm extremely concerned abotu them, represent country Americans whole. ""deniers"" minority polls show group shrinking.  Thanks ignoring question. Bye. Sounds accurate Honestly, it‚Äôs probably hundreds millions unreported cases Slightly good news: skyrockets top

Bad news kidney problems, new lockdowns, lung damage: lower

This Pollyanna view country gonna death us. WWI also lasted four years. We‚Äôre barely half year in. right believe higher diabetes deaths heart attack natural causes. thats quarantine. Drat, fast, reopened yesterday: better catch not. think idea letting whomever despite infection pressure long tested upon arrival, less like it. sure accurate PCRs are, one's 100% AFAIK. 

Well, still hope works well them. Bangladeshi claim know better country country :/ deaths going 55 past 24 hours Yayyyyy go Sweden!!! feeling really bold lockdown! Doesn‚Äôt good kills first. riots looting justified people shamed people wanted take kids park, it‚Äôs hard anyone believe anything local ‚Äòleaders‚Äô ‚Äòhealth experts‚Äô say. don‚Äôt know know Swedish become citizen. would case, OP would‚Äôve less things post about. Absolutely yes.

Yeah hear you. actually left AZ last year surprised case. Tons folks want act government suggestions, Ducey going go way mandate anything base would like. 

I'm North Carolina remained slightly locked longer (we opened stores left restaurants closed May 22nd, bars/gyms still closed) think suffering issues masks required outside believe 2 counties acting own, basically went ahead opening without meeting criteria discussed towards end April. So, still growing cases slightly began relaxing. People back wandering around without masks 50% cases (mornings grocery store still pretty good, afternoon try take something UPS store mall tons people without masks). 

We looking bad AZ yet hospitalizations daily new case numbers setting records least per week, often multiple times per week. fear go backwards re-introduce previous restrictions. tell trump.  says stage, suddenly cease effectiveness.

It‚Äôs good news, it‚Äôs going change hospitalization rate lockdown policies. Yeah edited comment read article seeing thorough study was... implication think people poor health matter much others.  thinly veiled racism.  one buying shit anymore. Oh, mean among neighbours, bad. mean, despite death rate higher neighbours, really something average person ever notice way statistics. 0,05% inhabitants dying virus, average person know anyone has. personally heard friends mention knew someone died it. course, horrible tiny minority though.


As unemplyoment, yeah, that's case everywhere. lot people can't go work due certain virus, lot sadly lose jobs. said Sweden roughly Nordic middle ground case, really seem stand out. Across world, unemployment rising around 10%. regard basically telling must suck live one house city fire. asking negative cases. Obviously people, especially healthcare, getting tested every week. inflate total testing numbers? No, 6.1 people who've ever made 52-man opening day, regardless whether rookie year.

2.5 disingenuous includes players ever played snap regular season game. May well start including guys like point, bring average 0. 

The accurate metric would median career length players who've played minimum (8-10) number games. seem potential... early stages. extensive testing trails began become pretty clear wasn‚Äôt much worthwhile benefit continue administering it. Old Trumpy deciding quadruple kept us beating dead horse. Owned. sub embarrassing. Bunch weirdos get pretending end world. One greatest!  case shut fuck don‚Äôt say anything all?!? What‚Äôs purpose disgusting comment? Cheap *for now* Hell - need stories subreddit. 

If hear another person talking 0.3% individuals 45 dying I'm going blow up. statistic wrong (based CDC published data), data capture post-COVID complications. 

Like - today we're always talking risks dying comorbidities. 5 years, COVID complications comorbidity someone's flu, bacterial pneumonia, COPD, hell - literally ailment harms body function COVID damage seems hit people everywhere. Exactly, even lowest risk virus unconventional many unknowns long-term.

Another issue people misunderstand virus damages organs tissue. virus causes immune system overreact release inflammatory cytokines leading cytokine storm (when tissue damage organ failure occurs), means people strong immune systems worse outcomes :/

Nobody wants virus, circumstances. That‚Äôs challenge trial, it‚Äôs considered unethical disease high mortality rate cure. fixated GDP number, forget GDP actually means. GDP surely shrink year people generally produce consume less goods services lockdown. reduction GDP correspond reduction quality life world.

The central dogma economics this: human labour plus capital equals productivity, productivity equals wealth.

Capital, human capital physical capital, engine economy. pandemic lockdown temporarily prevents labour productive, capital otherwise intact even sit idle. country handles labour welfare effectively, lockdown permanently damage economy all.

Contrast powerful hurricane destroys buildings, vehicles infrastructure (physical capital loss). civil war drives many educated citizens flee another country (human capital loss). times wasn‚Äôt scientist founding claim. dense you? cares? Bro, even lift ventilators? used immune suppressant fight cytokine storm - doesn‚Äôt actually fight virus. appears good news severe disease. isn‚Äôt going return life normal gives lot hope people survive. I'm waiting antibody tests reliable. I'm pretty sure February. covid specific symptoms gone(ish) week. said, breathing returning normal. yup, generic - price point change much there's lot competition, demand much greater. generics good pharma - reduces price point one company monopoly competition. mean, they're still make money, there's lot less price gouging. Right now, novel situation almost anyone. 

- First, accept suffer mentally. internationally traumatizing event, even neurotypicals fear utterly hopeless.

- Second, think covered egregious cases immediately cancelling large events nationwide like music festivals sports gatherings. Let's hope prohibition remains 2021.

So corona crisis over, pretty much terms health care anyway. backlogs worked through. quite contrast Sweden whose system remains strained huge backlog. infection rate state? articles never mention many tests done.

Im saying wrong, say, experience American, super tired too- opposite perspective. often find Europeans constantly bringing American stuff, half time I'm like ""goddamnit, talk every fucking thread? wanna watch lady pet goose."" She‚Äôs horrible

I understand put first literally moves death rate 12 points. 30% reduction 40% death rate. math bad. That's bummer, Alexa nice name. Hey that's fine. choose blame anyone individual. not. Cheers!! Bars keep opening closing opening closing employees alternately keep contracting coronavirus. crapshow sure.  I'm telling CDC says. USA reporting numbers like this. EU not, even areas higher per capita infection death. still seem like low number though? No, unless disease becomes much stronger attacking younger demographics ""Masks work COVID19.""

2020 cancer. fired job company set temperature screening station. Two workers would take temp ask overseas contact someone COVID.

A days setting already flagging workers high temperatures. someone pointed actually taking temps heat produced glass windows.

I mean knew taking temperatures multiple windows would alter readings. /s

Anyway moved station still workers high temps. weather related people high body heat particularly women. Yes getting shit laws letting son go hour long ride 75+mother law. even dropped I‚Äôm willing take extra risk grandson‚Äù. agree lol, people fucking stupid needing ""leadership"" tell take virus seriously. also still think fucking stupid texas reopened. *make New Mexico pay :) Well, yes, lately do.

You know, social distancing thing supposed That's incredibly average past 10 years 37,462 estimated flu deaths. Last year 34,157. worth noting last 2 years preliminary estimates. Estimates always fallen, finalized.

Additionally, comparing numbers COVID-19 early growing, full flu seasons. media billionaire owned even traded fucking NYSE. It‚Äôs pretty much fact point, without trump, majority shit fake news. necessarily lies like case, selling fear anger dictate narrative. It‚Äôs scary shit journalism nowadays. don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs writers/small media news people fault, fed sells fear. long term use masks crafting purposes (so inhale toxic fumes) seems increased lung capacity, really belt note lasts foreeeeever, watch that.

It also sweaty sometimes left temporary red circular mark face short time. Tribal politics.

Your ""team"" must right correct times. concede may wrong mistaken single issue means showing weakness, can't that. party says 2+2=5, GOD 2+2=5. diabetes Canadians throw insulin fence? I'd say both, unless significant underlying health condition. problem need testing doesnt scale population size alone, cases needed. Given US highest case count first world country far needed way testing, didnt get it.

Again, trying look raw numbers instead percentages rates. US highest case count far means population US much larger. look rate metric (cases/100k, deaths/100k), US falls line countries. looking raw numbers, US also [tested lot countries. 

There really reason using population adjusted numbers want make accurate seem perfectly happy using death count despite exact problems.

Because deaths hospitalizations dependent amount testing populations test. literally impossible know exact case count, theory able know death counts (obviously may always case).

Porque los dos? 41% ventilated patients receiving drug died statement wrong. drug reduced deaths 27%. I‚Äôm sure NY handling currently Texas governor basically pretty much opened everything 75% (which basically 100%) tells us it‚Äôs fault, we‚Äôre own, closes eyes pretends it‚Äôs happening. told us enough hospital beds everyone (even beds hundreds miles away). state handling better least chance

Edit:

Governor Abbot saying enough hospital beds state everyone: saying everybody responsible mask wearing, also mayors urging change stance: restaurants opening 75% : Bye! interviews frontline workers Lombardy affected areas since calmed down? I'd love know ok,getting rest feeling all. phenomenal job. hope provisions support mental health needed, well lots time work possible relax decompress. looked like utter hell fuck? random person wore mask supermarket got infected? people aren‚Äôt sex offenders. one deserves victimized personal information leaked catching disease. Thank kind partner would ask question. Support like matters people wonder never ending pandemic, literally live idiocracy. American grown dreaming moving Canada commend you. Take care citizens, even means Americans can‚Äôt find peace safety among you. There's another way think it: basically shut country 2 3 months, people locked houses, yet even still *over 110,000 people died*.

Is reason assume number 10 20 (or more) times amount done nothing? course not. Heightens urgency vaccines. that's problem! Indiana surprisingly well living rarely see anybody mask on. Georgia low surprising well seriously. boo freakin' hoo out. so?

Same drug results Much thanks. 

I 15 folks payroll - one owner, one manager thirteen crew members.  rent utilities cost $60,000. payroll $200k. Making yearly cost around $260,000.

Keeping folks $600 payments would cost $468k per year.

 save $208k. 

We need help pause. could get national plan place like NZ, could virus free less five months. 

Less debt, less death, less time.

Instead, watch chaos hope! Let's review numbers shall we?

The hospitalized Texas 1500 2500.

Flu lasts 2 3 months winter hospitalizes 400k 800k US.

Texas 10% population that's 40 80k.

If flu, bad enough hospitalize you, death rate 10%.

So every winter, 4k 8k deaths Texas influenza. also heavily used equine medicine. dex &amp; ivermectin tack trunk covid-19 pharmacy! I'm half expecting use DMSO banamine next.

Well, everyone wore masks followed basic distancing hand washing, could return lot normalcy. really isn‚Äôt huge ask, yet people refuse us continue suffer isolation needlessly.

You getting angry pointing Disneyland important - Sad. Sweden's death per million rate increased last week (21.58) UK's (17.7) Italy's (7.5), according worldometer. say deaths still going Sweden simply false. Oklahoman here. people following proper protocol going public. masks, social distancing. infuriating. that's natural selection guess. essentially used stave cytokine storm? That's really good idea, number statistic. person, someone's son daughter, mother father, brother sister.

We hear little people who've died, sometime local media might mention healthcare worker, someone people might know particularly tragic case.  fair, we‚Äôre also getting better testing detecting cases. great news regardless! need listen say, need pay attention call Muslims, 

Would like qualify statement that's exactly continues prolonged persistent worldwide threat terrorism perpetuated muslim extremist groups. order islamophobia end terrorist attacks carried must end first Jeebus no. Man, people need better understand concept ""risk."" say ""increased risk,"" mean ""guaranteed."" far that. We‚Äôre together! ""The treatment 10 days dexamethasone costs ¬£5 per patient.

Can't wait see cost $734 per dose US I'm sorry :(  Obviously stopped reporting data. significant majority don‚Äôt weigh 400 pounds. huge.

You're fucking crazy dude. appreciate taking time flag underrated comment.

However, appears error comment already rated according quality. work people remain infected months, seeing right now. Citizenship yes (I think), residency no. could virus false positive know similar steroids used 2003 treat SARS patients? read article destroyed people‚Äôs joints. I‚Äôll try find article Yeah wonder r/BlackDeath would looked like Middle Ages. Half population Europe died! wasn‚Äôt end human civilization, would virus kills elderly already-sick finish us off? Yes. Yes stop reporting data. Lol worse two neighboring Nordics, probably also Iceland Faroes (haven't checked, would surprised bad). 

An apples apples comparison shows worse 2 three neighboring countries, significant amount. Norway worse, deserves criticism well. People still need go places life still carries on.
For example graduated college, back march pandemic really started ramping lot fellow students basically dropped everything go back home. still fly back move lease ends fly somewhere else job. 

I've also heard companies offered employees permanantly work home, imagine people may want relocate potentially cheaper area since longer need physically work anymore.

Another sad note though lot people care anymore summer arrived they're still traveling leisure. friends invite fly Florida road trip Texas fun. declined obviously told two others already agreed. I've seen snapchat stories people bars house parties. No. 

1) increased risk equal definite severe case coronavirus. Per article: ‚ÄúAccording study, 4 per cent world‚Äôs population would require hospitalisation infected.‚Äù

2) almost scenario every person earth becomes infected. Even take zero mitigation measures, thirty percent population benefit herd immunity. Fauci assumed Trump would enforce damn reopening guidelines. Instead admin put plan almost immediately encouraged governors follow plan. 

He wants play leader rather leader. awesome I've said nothing personality. think that's impractical realistically superbly practical begin with. Entertainment going take biggest hit shutdown still really re-implemented even stage. Restaurants / retail adjusted applied evenly across industry, curbside online stuff shot way seating went again, every business could adjust that.

Shutting back would disastrous stage alternative put security measures place. can't prevent mitigate. best way tools we've provided Face masks social distancing especially inside buildings.

But specifics, fudging numbers (on either side) push agenda helpful. telling everything alright necessarily make anymore screaming sky falling makes accurate. I'm working, I'm supporting local business curbside delivery, I'm generally staying public unless it. super exciting pattern activity I'm OK it. supposed loyal country President. People swear oaths defend country Constitution, President. fact people think supposed loyal President instead country Constitution would founding fathers rolling graves.

Maybe go back take grade school civics class understand basic concepts. gotta make brand name make sure generic isnt available dont see wearing mask preventing anything. example orginally gave people going eat ignoring safety precautions entering restaurant. ""I riding confronted wearing mask. ""
Sounds like conversation confrontation. Either way it‚Äôs media dictating narrative. Thanks doc even average lifespan antibodies 24 months people, unlucky ones, would lose immunity roughly 4-6 months

Which might happened here. 24 months would bad news. 6 months would disaster. TL;DR:

1. Malaysia‚Äôs preparedness planning began December 2019, first heard Chinese authorities cases acute respiratory illness;

2. Previous experience MERS 2002-2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, including experienced contact tracing teams, key enabling speedy response;

3. Malaysia drastically upgraded health facilities diagnostics capacity February 2020, including 86% increment diagnostics laboratory capacity, 89% increment critical care bed capacity, 49% increase number available ventilators (from 526 1034 units);

4. Malaysia hospitalised individuals diagnosed COVID-19 positive, whether symptomatic asymptomatic;

5. Learning countries, including China essential identifying do‚Äôs don‚Äôt‚Äôs COVID-19 response, including terms treatment;

6. evidence treatments still murky, Malaysian physicians prioritised monitoring negative side-effects treatments adjusted medication regimens astonishing many people didn‚Äôt understand beginning. untrue personal attacks.

Jfc.. brother? doubt ""brother"" would call xenophobia blatantly false information he's experiencing two drugs combined nowhere near comparable. Remdesivir much helps. HCQ useless. Steroids suspected increased long term debilitating symptoms original SARS survivors. trash journal? think bipolar disorder hoax? invisible tax called inflation.

almost. invisible tax. us federal government needs pay back federal reserve. paid back real visible income taxes. US could done point virus arrived, lockdown, reopening.

But aside expanding testing capabilities, really increasing surge capacity.

And still access residential disinfectants like bleach alcohol. Obviously that‚Äôs what‚Äôs causing spike right protest mean long sample random, required sample size strongly correlated size population. sample size 1971, even infinite population get margin error 0.05% 95% confidence. exact formula sample size Z^2 p(1-p)N/(W^2 (N-1)+z^2 p(1-p)) Z Z-score confidence interval; p estimated positive rate, 0.5 conservative estimation; W margin error; N population size. stop reporting data? think applying lock measures saving face? suggested measures? don‚Äôt know exactly much protests end contributing spread virus, I‚Äôm pretty confident effects either overstated understated depending person‚Äôs preconceived biases. Steroids suspected increased long term debilitating symptoms original SARS survivors. 2003 SARS, steroid treat SARS patient Hong Kong, lung become clear bone damaged steroid years later side effect, steroid used caution. swimmer years... fucking serious? people need accept virus going long term ramifications many people get limited elderly people serious health issues. don‚Äôt want go back work. virus infects you‚Äôre fun. Stay safe! people buying selling. cause sourced doesn‚Äôt mean source good. enormous, state-sponsored random-blind study announcing results. Peer review going big deal. comes mouth sneeze dislodge something nose. Yeah uptick tests last week. promised 3-5 day turn around.

Did end it? bit complicated. US healthcare pays high prices world get drugs cheap nearly free. Instead charging 1/20th global population 2500% markup, mark prices 25% whole world make money. least mark tier 1 countries 200%, tier 2 pays cost, tier 3 discounts 75% everyone gets equal shot healthcare without pharma companies sacrificing anything. US markup carrying world expense. Yeah nice try nowhere call Muslims, need go back re-read written. I'm referring extremist groups within religion commiting attacks. I've actually lived middle east past, majority people trying raise family, make money, live life anywhere else, however percentage population brain washed fundamentalism ones commiting attacks fueling islamophobia across world themselves. Former Rep. Peter King New York openly supported IRA years, he's terrorist sympathizer well...just like Rep Omar. really want making pharmaceuticals home.

This drug cheap easy make already produced many different manufacturers. We're going see one person buy supply manufacturers. medical system collapse per se, mean strain several months led many problems including: huge backlog kinds medical care, staff needing time / burning / quitting, huge financial costs. 

It sad think much could avoided Sweden pursued strategy neighbors get go: suppression via moderate NPIs (there's debate whether really even call happened neighboring Nordics ""lockdowns"") leading Test, Trace, Isolate. Right now, straightest roads treatment seem things might reduce over-reaction victim's immune system, steroids definitely fit bill.

Looking forward studies, though. Given COVID-19's ability trigger attacks body, saves someone lung issues may nothing another person blood vessels degrading disease. last point 2b.  mild flu

Clearly one treatment applied across world way. used without question, certainly fairly extensively.

Anecdotally, deep roots wife involved research (Canada), respirologist leading researcher field highly involved hands-on COVID treatment research throughout pandemic, preventative acute.

My wife prescribed preventative doses two similar drugs contracted COVID late march.

Point being, indeed using drugs extensively places least. know they've working others field across country throughout.

This sub end spectrum: ‚ÄúYour child molesting murderer dare leave house next 5 years. virus death toll larger bubonic plague, Spanish Flu WWII combined.‚Äù Less sarcastically, ways intervention particularly effective case-by-case basis valuable applied population-wide basis:

1. Fever screening intended _diagnose_ covid-19, slightly focus testing effort. Deployed spotty basis would insignificant. Deployed population-wide, valuable purpose even false positives/negatives rates order magnitude higher true positive/negative rates.
2. China (and Taiwan think) temperature flag means _immediate mandatory isolation_ tested (or least Wuhan trying get epidemic control). Catching even small percentage positive cases early infection lifecycle make enormous difference exponential growth conditions.
3. failing temperature screen means immediate, mandatory entering system, population much inclined avoid public travel &amp; interaction aware symptomatic, getting flagged temperature means going spend 2-4 hours (if testing negative) 14 days (if testing positive) isolation. reduces R population.

I'm pretty sure 3 alone would efficacious population explosive exponential growth conditions even pure theatre. smarter too. mandating mask 100 years ago. early covid-19 told useless. want get political decision really. given options.

Holy shit. hope god person isn‚Äôt still practicing. kept cruise ship sea instead letting people get wanted keep number infected people low. getting dumber dumber every day heck talking about.? Read article.. Multiple texan players Cowboys got it. need 1 person get fuck whole team. upvoting idiocy?!! 

Are referring get really sick? referring die? talking infection rates bother read article look headline. reduced hours collect federal unemployment basis. putting extra savings precisely limited time collect idea long disruption income going go for. fair, put aside expectation hurting worse couple months need it. think bars open time, sure about. Shut man mean right cover doctor ""prescribes"" me. Otherwise, entirely pocket LA rstaurants probably compliant lot cities. don‚Äôt know nation half-assing this... true discipline  ‚Äúone all‚Äù approach could past thing already HAHAHAHAHA! IM DEAD! know, demand would go people felt would safe appropriate precautions taken.  I'm work non union diabetic editor. scary times I'd lying said 'no worries.' Friends union shows enjoying time off. me. Homer Simpson policy. ""If can't see it. illegal.""  That's originally thought means found acronym. remember used Trump. Thoughts prayers fuck boys 4.1% tested positive today 8.7% tested positive overall. I'm sure getting numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

 wants make sure COVID positives get linked protests way. That's he's also telling contact tracers ask protest attendance positive cases. It‚Äôs KNOWN monkeys challenged unusually high viral load won‚Äôt get normal exposure, even given lower dose vaccine still protected monkeys pneumonia. article rebutted Oxford lol. I'm betting one, seems like one denial buddy :/ Oh yeah sure. definitely don‚Äôt delete anything collect. Even claim so. GDPR may thing makes actually it. bad won‚Äôt ever see deletion requirements like US :(

The thing really helps is: (1) feels good, (2) maybe helps convince others same. I‚Äôm unsure trying prove point here. suppose you‚Äôd link facts though. Work food service hospital I‚Äôve COVID unit around nurses go rooms treat COVID patients none us got pay raise bonus working. employees furloughed didn‚Äôt work time makes us they‚Äôre home. problem UBI people getting money government would think working people COVID would compensated it‚Äôs ridiculous bullshit think sad we've watched Walmart Mcdonalds take small shopkeepers local diner's jobs, people think deserve dog go movies. life work without savings, fun, breaks. 
Work starve ""the greatest country earth"", get hurt it. Enjoy: pieces different heights, think counts.  apply whatever want! coherent ? They're testing antibodies, virus. Man there's many good reasons hate Trump, read headline? Trump said good we're testing lot, lot tests see lot positives. good, money spend due $0 put savings uncle, Engineer widely considered extrememy smart friends colleagues voted him, eats bs spews. get that. going bodies? C, c, c, covid potus! less recorded cases cares about. Trump care lots people die long use lack numbers justification get people working positive economic numbers. well said. mean, technically correct.  would also fewer cases cancer, flu, HIV, depression.... takes awhile someone die contracted COVID. Deaths today could infections weeks ago. wish could change this. would life without janitors? far respectable work white collar jobs imo. really change GOP's symbol Ostrich head sand. That‚Äôs testing works fuck face Donny Here‚Äôs video transcript speaking little context anyone interested. no, making joke loves saying ""FAKE NEWS!"" clearly bad one. can't winners. It‚Äôs KNOWN monkeys challenged unusually high viral load won‚Äôt get normal exposure, even given lower dose vaccine still protected monkeys pneumonia. article rebutted Oxford lol.  would interesting look history compare cities wore masks 1918 flu pandemic.....

Edit: Words hard right now. like added anonymity comes wearing mask bonus. concerned covid. went protest city, majority wearing mask. got results friday I'm negative! least we'll die laughing... Thanks TL:DR.   Im fucking pissed father, raised listening npr instilled since empathy me, cultist drinking tapeworm inbred ass koolaid Yep girlfriend going 3-4 times week since things opened May. It‚Äôs awesome. That's definition pandemic must spreading rapidly multiple parts world.

EDIT: correct speak flight blocks time did. time already cases left China started clusters rest world (especially Italy), making flight blocks vs China useless. effective flight block Taiwan, block flights China, **they blocked flights every country**. countries *still* willing do.

The focus rest world moved getting ready testing, contact tracing quarantine facilities. Instead places like US flight blocks China fell immediately complacency. Trump eventually flight blocks Europe, travel Europe actually increased. *confirmed* cases people watched two seasons Simpsons think documentary... interestingly U.S. actually lower deaths/population rate UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden, France, Belgium (Belgium's 2x higher), essentially tied Netherlands.


is based real data manipulated data skews lot death towards pneumonia? implying ignorance bliss countries low testing capability worse seem? wants official covid point lack numbers justification push people back workplace. Trump care people die, cares quantifiable reason get people working. need make examples...but sink quickly Karen can't go see grandkids.  300 less cares act would give unemployment. 1st flagged Australian scientists, well, effective lab.

There's depressing lack studies since, ivermectin combination drugs. They're quoting professor. That's person beef with, media outlet. feel bad it‚Äôs fault they‚Äôre working shitty job least attempt truth telling.  Yeah live Texas... even mumble word union yourself, alone work fired. ain't wrong! every time says something dumb someone jumps say actually dumb. sarcastic making joke. Maybe he's actually stupid.  also pay taxes Unemployment get too. ""Free Money! $$$$"" 

I know two sides next stimulus check. One wants give $2k till Pandemic (Smart thinking, even cause bit inflation time. really, say people lost jobs. still jobs time. Plus. Without money pay bills mean time. lot people end homeless. ) something assuming Senate White House really taking account. 

The side keeps saying anything final one, $1.2k last one. neglecting people want go back work basically put risk. 

Thinking situation. think would good balance ""Back Work Bonus"" idea Pandemic ended months, we've stabilized economy. study read Japan said young people asymptomatic pre-symptomatic identified contact tracing transmission vectors. report links r/Coronavirus. second study reported Holland found yet read outside paywall. lol they're degenerate racists fuck expect?  isnt going go away unfortunately. world live now. country going get locked again. states can't afford again. businesses can't afford again. yes, know pathetic put money/business persons life/health. people work survive country ability give ""free money"" people give food people doorstep nationwide. sad depressing 

What happens consumer confidence takes nosedive second, summertime peak? Businesses caught catch 22: stay closed bleed open severely depressed demand bleed slower. ‚Äútangible proof‚Äù? They‚Äôre literally confirming cases test...how proof, lol. effing dumbass forget many retired NFL players late 30s suffer plethora health complications. Imagine body injured pandemic. Makes even susceptible disease even death. Break bone. Sprain Knee. Concussions. Ect. Lets forget vigorous exercises routines engorging protein shakes substances puts strain organs. Hey. local blood bank too. husband appointments tomorrow evening. supporters don‚Äôt actually listen trump. listen talking heads eloquent brainwashing. Remember approval rating 40% eligible voters. 40% approval basically 24% people actually voted him.

Those polls rarely cover first time non-voters may end coming time. could swing ways come election day. LOT first time never voting Americans coming droves primaries could mean even may show Nov since people show actual election primary.

Plus lot states making mail voting mandatory year due covid19. actually got ballot mailed today NJ. [Page 3 continued (because reddit's 10,000 character limit]

I image Midwest South would close Border NE Hmm read quote feel better reporting climate change, gun violence, industrial pollution, bailout funding, police murders, animal abuse farms, fracking chemicals, tons things. Might well stop official reporting hope goes away too. working far. 

^/s testing less, show fewer cases, still many cases? saying beginning would cool see flu season reach historic low. then, lot optimistic people would embrace masks reason. can't see God either claims christian. I‚Äôd give gold loser buys crap. perfect way explain it. people still someone either don‚Äôt understand saying willfully ignorant defend shit articles. Upper class poor here.

Pizza rolls done #humblebrag Wtf even talking lmao. implied limitations implied always bad. corrected you. I‚Äôm obligation point every individual world. exactly pointed OP anyway?

It‚Äôs different. right work consititutional right explicit way freedom speech is. Freedom speech one least limited rights good reason. "" percentage positive test results total tests also rise, meaning states virus control despite reopening businesses. "" thought Bush. really work out.

American Idiot pretty decent tho fuck test him? He'd fine tested!

\- Donald J. Trump Hey man. Like, it‚Äôs cool work all. you‚Äôre really angry stuff didn‚Äôt say. You‚Äôre associating stuff people said lol.

I don‚Äôt think USA highest per capita testing. That‚Äôs said X country. didn‚Äôt want say specific country I‚Äôm sure testing rates would compare. 

I don‚Äôt think USA best containment, unsure top 20 even. defend comment blatant bias specific part statement taken context really reason. honestly don‚Äôt even like Trump. He‚Äôs unprofessional shitty leader imo. disagree Trump doesn‚Äôt mean side everything him. Especially it‚Äôs blatantly false. 

Your third point speculation. Unsure even came conclusion tbh.  [heh. think emphasis along lines countries hiding actual numbers reporting accurate test results. definitely also overexaggerates ""best testing"". county tested 5000 220,000. either troll dumb piece shit. probably both. Imagine using kind thinking sports. Atlanta falcons super bowl champs!!! Can‚Äôt say model projections know many people depending vaccine. 

I hear many people clamoring vaccine around corner things back normal. 

Then worry many Americans would refuse vaccine even offer one winter. Less risk isn‚Äôt risk. knew I‚Äôd walking people virus regular basis I‚Äôd wearing mask time (I‚Äôm virologist). hope so. also think Americans disappoint world apathy. No. aren‚Äôt. Neither hospital workers. You‚Äôre jobs. opposite problem. Companies cant get anyone work making sitting home exactly point? fixated ""what everyone jeering about"". statement indefensible. breakdown statement point comment testing country counts look worse country. numbers would obviously sink stopped testing much.

is misleading. that's i'm commenting on. give fuck people jeering about. evaluate ^ -- still 100% misleading suggests we're testing high rate numbers skewed show higher counts country country comparison. false. end story.

no matter evaluate words -- he's fucking liar. lots people getting wrong here, sure. even interpret comments charitable fashion, he's still misleading prick. Months late. ""Thanks"" airlines.. Yeah, covid19 deaths 65+ Az. Brilliant. /s done day one feel like every public building also, maybe general.  I'm still theory virus targeted virus wipe older population newest social soldiers enforce upcoming NWO. Still theory, still makes sense me. I'd say come 1st place solid lead. 

YOU ESS A, ESS 

what... said 1st? despicable Trump said *again* today! did! countries 1000 cases, US 20th tests per capita, 8th cases per capita, 7th deaths per capita. 

It isn‚Äôt tests making us look bad. you‚Äôre taking literally point he‚Äôs making stop testing one else sick. 

Either take literally he‚Äôs wrong or
You take ‚Äúwhat means say‚Äù he‚Äôs using wrong form statistics look data he‚Äôs supposedly looking everyday months.... 

Garbage president. much wasted lives money inept ability single damn thing country tell China fuck off, also fucked Well, fair seems lot people calling right now... war Ba Sing Se Testing makes us look bad. lack long made us look bad Deaths increasing Florida, Texas, California, Georgia, et. al.

This state gets bad rap stuff rightfully whole situation i've pretty satisfied everything handled. China full shit! part 80% capacity increasing understand?  percentage basis. Case fatality rate way .16% every country world (outside Qatar). 

And position unsubstantiated. observations way people want safe lockdown mask wearing anecdotal post. Real values sadly fall along party lines, since apparently public health political issue Bonuses taxed way income.

They also can't give extra pay ""gift"" that's taxed. possible, employers would structure wages like employees pay taxes.

In words, trying screw (with extra pay, is). Yeah bro, stopped living right now, problems, any. testing equals cases. willfully ignorant think that‚Äôs means. anything think makes wrote article look bad. There's plenty stupid shit comes orange mans mouth. need cherry picked lol That's I'm seeing. context quote folks talking it, would seem imply Trump wants reduce numbers total infected reducing number tests.

This would fit within character things looking better really are. Because, him, image matters. Trump, inventor head burying machine.

But agree you‚Äôd drunk special blend kool aid see company hope get good publicity this, board wouldn‚Äôt signed something going loose lot money.

Company limited $3 billion worth coverage, assuming people 30s (and get 25,000 policy) that‚Äôs 120,000 policies.

The chance dying next 3 years super low even higher risk group people. (I‚Äôm gonna guesstimate 0.5%) max number claims probably around 600 worth $15 million pay out. I‚Äôm probably good job estimating overestimating might little less little more.

We probably gonna run Super Bowl ad (I guess cost least $6 million 30 seconds) you‚Äôre right, probably taking planned advertising budget year.

Even though I‚Äôm pretty cynical stuff like this, you‚Äôre eligible it‚Äôs still worth it. 600 families get extra support next 3 years join up. big brain time 24/7/365 america! 2%. realise many people means voted Trump? that. 45% US population can‚Äôt dumb dumber person legitimate imbecile. possible, it‚Äôs statistically impossible. don‚Äôt look eggs egg hunts, won‚Äôt many eggs Duh Please don‚Äôt spread misinformation. studies showing hydroxychloroquine dangerous retracted countries still using treatment symptoms caught early What's point healthcare agencies they're going ignored important moment?

or worse, threatened letters. win? Damn, sound stupid right now. technically speaking truth specifically talking reported numbers. countries less confirmed cases simply testing less people. saying blessing curse make US numbers look worse increase testing.

For example, tested 100 million people tomorrow 11 million came back positive, confirmed cases would jump 11 million (current positive/tested ratio .11). would make look like US massive spike cases. tested 0 people tomorrow, would increase 0, therefor making numbers look 'better'.  potus syphilis right? want ignore first two points that‚Äôs cool guess. made discredit points guess served purpose.

My third point mostly reference towards saying ‚Äúseem know Trump,‚Äù easily argue upward trend April/May speculating reasoning behind because... well, it‚Äôs speculation. say increase testing would also cause upward trend, right? 

Really doesn‚Äôt matter getting original point. statement taken context. Probably it‚Äôs devolved attacking character making things I‚Äôve said lol. #Trumplogic man still office!?!? bleach injection work plan B ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like understand ban it‚Äù crowd always strong exception. goalpost keeping activity predictable. parks procedures place ALREADY designed funnel people fairly predictable pattern it‚Äôs fine.

sounds like ask raise increase skill level :) anything? That's damn impressive. feel best practices list guide businesses making similar changes capacity so. Pure genius ? Wtf think everyone wearing mask out. photos videos I've seen, protesters wearing them, aren't; everyday shoppers, park- &amp; beach-goers. say allowing people go out, gather shop socially again, allow protests well. Mask enforcement equally strict lax whether people going church protest.

In case lockdown already phased city since week two first race/police protests. exception, hard enforce rules large group. shopping, store use policy ensure customers wear masks; protest, nobody charge. mainly people educate peer-pressure one another. ""Selected"" Global Net Worths:

Obviously people wear it‚Äôs rule go store.

Some people wear them, don‚Äôt cover nose. take sneeze.

Others seem well intentioned, wear masks exhale valves don‚Äôt stop wearers germs spread.

I still want pull xrays. think clinic went idea look for.

Both parents coughed blood/pink foam.

I sick bed week almost went ER breathing difficulties. Slept upright chair. Dog tired almost week.

After got better remember appointments months. Usually I'd set alarms check calendar every day phone set silent. failsafes failed. keep appointment. think finally got better around April. missed job hunting interviews, meetings, lunch meetups friends. 

We would like antibody tests apparently still pretty shitty. Keep setting goals put overtime conquer them!  check biggest cities near state lines see start increasing Oh one great Jewish comedians see shocking unfortunately. think blood type fares better average.

Hypocritically want say dont it.

But totally did. vaped lot marijuana (like wallet burning amount) occasional puffs juul. However stayed away anything smoke didnt want debris causing additional issues event got covid. didnt know covid almost end would call primary infection (as still feel foggy tired) point slowed never stopped. think impact... except time got high thought stroke caner time , fault.

I know horrible example dont follow please. Agree ‚Äú67% Jobless Workers Get Unemployment Paid, Showing Deserved Compensation‚Äù 

Fixed title you. two friends work making basically much working grocery store. ok get gift card month groceries worth 50 bucks. hope dies. better never logging anyways fix distance, scientificly sound, no. make sense whole population POV, much.

They pulled number asses, certainly better yabbering 'correct' number end.

In germany 1,5m can't believe already policy weeks ago No, testing confirms higher number cases already exist. contributing increase cases. US high number cases testing. US confirmed existence high number cases testing. important distinction here. Someone disease weather tested it. make wear seatbelt? Make wear pants? helmet? Yes. 10k nuclear weapons (Many pointed us) invest heavily political warfare/subversion. course they‚Äôre threat. Yeah you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm stupid. r/technicallythetruth W-E-L-L . . . start would fulfill promise ""anyone wants test get test"" increasing testing availability every state, requiring close contacts positive tests get tested and/or quarantine two weeks, require businesses provide PPE hand sanitizer employees sufficient quantity, require mask general public least indoor situations social distancing possible. 

all cut spread sufficiently every state could open fully, perhaps something protect jobs health issues would make working right far risky would good too, perhaps paid unemployment would longer needed. things society like supposed to, people might pissed off.

Why suppose to?

I got extra 1k month. morally obligated give charity, help build things society? 

No, I'm not. Nothing south, it‚Äôs hardly surprising people liberal east coast wear masks far greater rates south Yep here, go runs early morning lately I've tried hiking Squaw Peak night time past 8 pm much less people. local area easy chose go. I've sitting soccer leagues matches since March waiting situation improve. Contact tracing won‚Äôt work, especially 7 10 oppose it, would unenforceable.

OOF sister. Cause new nephew Jewish. FYI. Last night ... Kosher.  didn‚Äôt see anything symptoms? Mississippi reduced testing amount. went 4.9k tests per day two weeks ago 1.6k today. positive rate gone 7% think Mississippi hiding numbers testing. testing another question. realize that. It‚Äôs insane. Look reported numbers post above. We‚Äôre going hit hard. lucky enough made inelligible anything 18 months since last october verge complete financial collapse :D

Yah right, think makes sense. Even certain extent, given lack federal coordination centralized response strategy, makes sense. lack national leadership federal action makes essentially every state comes actual, ground pandemic response management. pretty crazy 55% logged covid-fatalities U.S. 5 states, 72% 10 states. read usually people mouth breathe narrower airways partial airway obstruction reasons like obesity narrow recessed jaw makes difficult breathe nose. would think people reasons would higher risk severe Covid 19 already breathing airway problems force mouth breathe. Exactly! love whole phrase..fuck bagged salad. Partly. value independence highly. So, read article. statement connected theory reason numbers high test everyone else (I honestly think that's right). test, would look like cases. He's buffoon least statement makes sense context. fair test blood went merry way, know Wilford brimley THING? like boiling frog. People become numb numbers. affects people personally think they'll understand severity. 90 days still going without mask gloves, I'm pickups stores.

Americans thinking like wish thing away. hate isolated too. I've go different medications cope it. God damn I'm dumb try pretend reality exist.  Anyone looks propaganda believes fucking stupid.   joke, already taking raw salmon shelves. Btw know wet market? normal market without live animals. smell stinky stereotype racism here. say Conservative world would absolutely fucking melt. down. Democratic president said something stupid. Yeah, looking view getting antibody-tested per doctor's advice, since he's pretty sure based anecdotal evidence wife earlier year. jump hoops get one, I'd want confident result accurate. say ""use homemade mask, n95 health care workers"" instaed lying?

My guess concerned people would selfish decide use better n95 masks wanted protected cloth mask. Bay Area California; good job early on, everybody eager open back I'm aftaid worse days yet come. Hahaha maaaan, one got good. 

We knew going awful, woke Wednesday morning tweets, one stood apart infamy; ‚ÄúCovfefe.‚Äù

From on, 100% certainty United States America fucked november cant get soon enough. I'm one crying saw something challenges views. Take ball go home. people need tell man absolute moron face. idea people interacts day say nothing critic true testament incredible lack spines brains everyone around him.
Just limbed sacks meat juice. definitely workers underpaid. Probably like 90%. Im starting feel like might best interest peoples votes DONT actually matter. Worked brain cells point right direction regarding that? relative got sick tested negative covid diagnosed pneumonia. Recovering thanks medical intervention (had call meds family friend doctor since hospital help), piques interest really true? impression Trevor Noah less liked Jon Stewart. I'm blast parties.

I'm killjoy comes suggesting ignore everything wrong around us ignoring shitbag office. hate thoughtless comments norm President United fucking States past 4 years.

The intelligence bar set real fucking low buffoon disagree all.

Did mean respond me? providing context perspective? appreciate that.

Anyway, yeah- leadership role responsibility fuck around time crisis. Around 640 Covid deaths somewhere around 140 flu deaths 25-34 year olds since February. However, millions 25-34 year olds flu, idea many Covid (but surely much much less many flu). takeaway is, even though still ~99.6% chance surviving Covid 30, chance death staggeringly higher Covid flu (still low much higher would want risk). 14 years age though, seems flu may actually dangerous Covid. Hmmm yes, floor made floor You‚Äôre right. We‚Äôll see radio works too!! 
 turn noises worried disappear. fake...and helpful...you people stupid... talk lot good reasons, power much political correctly language go straight target subject. like plane circles sky never land's. US also includes ""likely"" coronavirus deaths numbers test isnt available. People keep supporting moron articles like imply saying stop testing actuality saying cases high testing high. 

He never implied stop testing

Trump sucks, hyperbole surrounding people saying ""he bad claim"" sub ~~cancer~~ COVID mean ""In 50 100% cases"" ? thier hit single. 

""Mary-Jane Piss-in-your-Face Fun Time.""  Haha, right skeptical results coming antibody tests immediate future. Theres lot shady dealings profiteering going companies manufacturing them, governments businesses desperate get back work usual want excuse defend moves direction. little bit ago Japanese government used antibody test kits screen donated blood blood bank collected range dates, hoping get idea trend time extrapolate present day. two sets 500 samples, got overall positive rate 0.4 0.6. Math means got 5 positive results. those, 3 blood collected 2018, spillover event. 

Oops. Airlines airports places really enforce rule. think people know compliance airport rules regulations ignored could face real consequences, lifetime bans. would great could put FAA could put pricks refuse follow fly list. Meh, say. whole chain political person responded time shows removed comment less 5 minutes posted. Either automod autonomously remove 'political' comments terrible efficiency user intervention.

Oh well, you, right? Legally speaking? lot. Oh ok buddy. mean? wish. Remember, still army crazies stupid enough follow awful orders. balancing 3 jobs working constantly everyday, income literally tripled started. don‚Äôt see difference outrage. Disney world plan opening weeks one complained Custodian government buildings. :) Even money gets tribes what? native tribe corrupt money trickle we‚Äôll embezzled. world. Yeah, look numbers Sunday across planet. Sunday - Tuesday numbers lower every single week. Focus hospitalization rate new cases meeting testing targets dropping ICU availability. Add FL governor taking covid serious. yeah, that's hilarious reason. need remind Reddit flooded 14 year olds. boys. found cure covid-19 let's go home resume life like normal. dude next level shit. üò¨ Kinda like ignore reality must fake news. know that's wanted open.

 bet never got haircuts. ""muh freedoms"". culture instant credit, on-demand, 140 characters cut long game necessary beat Coronavirus. probably get worse gets better. WHO: think that? feel bad pigs... riots? What's difference what's cutoff scientific designation ""reputable"" &amp; ""remotely size"" It‚Äôs official. 10 yr old smarter man gets grapes stuck nose news outlet, Redditer, take chance get take jab politically? Yea guy made stupid comment, isn‚Äôt time make stupid statement headline make people angry/in fear. think trump, literally can't involved charity anymore admitted court president defrauded childrens cancer charity telling truth, fucking lost. criticism zero social distancing. Zero criticism many people wearing masks. 

pretty sure that's completely wrong. watch ton media every channel/website talked that. estimated 1.7 billion people -- 20 percent world's population -- risk becoming severely infected COVID-19 due underlying health problems obesity heart found one five people least one underlying health problem putting greater danger.

This would make disproportionately problem obese countries worlds, like percent global population -- around 350 million would likely get sick enough require hospital treatment

This may get worse Spanish flu time done. Jesus christ going thread conversation SEVERAL people keep defaulting statement like broken fucking record. Like unable think past current thought even presented information contradictory claim- point knows fuck first claim sensationalist title claim course everyone understands saying.

It's like either opiate addict troll nice fucking day feel either intentionally obtuse must hell lot fun parties... case anyone wondering, maximum 1 day ever.....but maximum MONDAY case increase.

starting Mid May monday: 1337, 818, 487,947,848, 1621

if big boost tomorrow got problems gone least one Truth best way open economy strategic testing stay ahead virus tracing identifying hot spots. testing get million dead fast. mean.. personally know 3 ppl assymptemtic think it, (As I‚Äôve contact them) day 8 cough feel pretty fine there‚Äôs good news think lot minor cases what‚Äôs portrayed.  Can‚Äôt wait first lawsuit claiming maskless super spreader responsible everybody‚Äôs medical bills. rich standards rich he'd want people think. He's quite Putins level yet comes using position become filthy rich tries. Scariest part many people thread stupid even understand Trump. Ok that‚Äôs still 2-3 times higher said, and, unfortunately US government needs show suspicions make convinced numbers. data support that? frigging ignorant sort /r/TechnicallyTheTruth material. want charitable (as think human being), probably making point increase cases due increased testing (similar rise something like autism).

I think actually believes stopping testing would treat symptoms... Exactly. believe HIV government weapon conspiracy, great randomness universe shown Reagan developed kill gays blacks would surprised.  hope get placed leave employer time prove negative test, thanks libelous claim. Makes sense. get confirmed cases?.. throughhhh... testing! speaking literally driving y‚Äôall mad You‚Äôre going win sort person. 

While commend you, started feeling whole lot better started avoiding sort ‚Äúdiscussions.‚Äù Wow. He's literally saying increase cases linked increase testing, true. Way take context. anyone read past headline anymore?? Ok hate ask joking? Wait....what real.

Please explain quote implies anyway stop testing.

He simply pointing many cases many tests.

Agreeableness equal kindness, result really make whole lotta sense imo doctor?

The original ""sTuDy"" showed effective **self published Google Docs** got popular conspiracy Twitter country subjected several months stupid attempts pretend good government done zero preparation.

It's good FDA finally came around. knew coming point. truth way always kind coming out. Thanks! guess follow I‚Äôm curious CDC data includes confirmed COVID infections? E.g. deaths percentage confirmed cases looks much, much higher percentage estimated cases, many asymptotic (considering test 1 10 cases). 

Side note: I‚Äôm one people says it‚Äôs flu I‚Äôm curious average 20-something much risky actually flu. mean, that‚Äôs pessimistic reading possible agree vibes got too. Hence, I‚Äôm giving chance clarify case (hopefully) wrong. guy idiot would die least system fucked given option, people choose risk lives unlivable wages. like gives little stare end every time says this, instilling critical knowledge Americans. Billions dollars stake

from class-action lawsuit SARS-COV-2 smashes like hurricane. say like want unemployed. liked job pandemic get new one instead waiting old one come back? worked ten years job I‚Äôm ‚Äúlazy‚Äù want keep it?

Fuck shit, get better job. need mental health treatment, maybe hospital, jail.  opposite want lol Thanks keeping us safe. Doctors nurses treat. guys prevent. OK, let's stop excessive praise Denver / Boulder area, Colorado Front Range (Denver / Boulder / Ft Collins / CO Springs) super-metro area, unrelated (not regional) sub!!

You want come already here. First thing probably get headaches bad reactions altitude change. UV rays burn 15 min burn easily. dry, annual precip 15 inches, dry discourage many wind-pollinated plants - trees, grasses, sagebrush **-** produce bushels pollen March September. driest season winter, enjoy cracked bleeding skin. Worried health issues? developed areas full drainage ditches, artificial ponds lakes expect **mosquitos mosquitos mosquitos** summer. even want get political stuff, move ""blue"" area, expect ""invited"" ""struggle session"" concluding eating gluten-free bread, 10 mile mountain hike 30 mile bike ride. Prefer ""red"" area? They're little suspicious newcomers, may tied high rock overnight, ok long cougars find you. there's things outsiders **never** hear like army cutworm moth. Native area, arrives toward end May, always manages sneak house night, flies wall face another wall (etc.) high speeds. wingspan 40 - 45 mm. **""residents migration paths report dozens moths per day entering homes garages""**

So sum up, we're little better average Covid, probably place scares even virus. I've wondering myself. think different days. I'm glad came did, generation seems flaccid. real music. Everything commercialized fake. study saying nobody sex. really pathetic, post hashtags jerk guess. Go riot, morons. Break something. sex random people. Play music makes parents afraid. Get angry. Stop staring fucking phones. librul morans! hear loud clear. one ones saying people mandatory lockdown leave homes 2 weeks, back early April. one ones screaming people wear masks since March.

 isnt going go away unfortunately. world live now. country going get locked again. states can't afford again. businesses can't afford again. yes, know pathetic put money/business persons life/health. people work survive country ability give ""free money"" people give food people doorstep nationwide. sad depressing yes.

So people flying pandemic, guess point is, since going fly regardless, wearing face mask decreases spread infection. put mask rather 1) rebelling wearing face mask, 2)shaming airline companies enforcing use face mask. still see many people argue coronavirus subreddits reddit telling opposite last months ""If disable fire alarms, fire numbers go way, way down."" - Principal Better got janitor. boss ignored everything, still provided masks, myself. started exhibiting covid symptoms hoping he'd send home said ""I anyone replace you, make sure wash hands"". anyone read article? 
I‚Äôm guessing not, tweet they‚Äôre talking about: ""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!"" Also, locked hospital doors, we'd full hospitals. [bro please give 911 I've taking tally customers work (local grocery store MO) 25% people actually wearing mask. People believe real honestly. F Hey guys, alive well? Read article. Increase due increase testing. He's right many reports ans videos around people parties, jogging streets things shouldn't. point people unable that, talking them. point is: people option stay home coming streets unecessary helping spread virus. man fucking genius. stopped testing cancer bet we'd cancer cases file either. know what? Fuck it, let's stop testing anything healthiest nation planet. that's crazy shit virus ISN‚ÄôT deadly

Tell 118,000 people US died it, Einstein.

And undoubtedly low number.

Let guess, going try wow us pseudo statistical genius completely disregards professionals telling us. note, ""if plug ears go LA LA LA LA LA"" also pretend reality exist. really completely lunch. Accompanied Chorus Karens course are. What's alternative? make less working unemployment, likely work shitty, shitty job, odds get PPE interact bunch assholes think anyone wearing mask personally insulting them.

Of fucking course people want godawful jobs they're forced to. That's really character problem. That's ""awful work environment"" problem.

Besides, giving people financial cushion helps pay debt, fix car, replace battered computer, etc. least society owes taking advantage lower class like vultures.

Again: $600 week makes incredible difference people's lives, society embarrassment supporting system allows us buy nice cheap garbage workers barely surviving.

Edit: forgot important thing! really worried money going people deserve instead shitton poor people spend money shove right back economy, look straight every major industry corporation got piles money without sacrifice anything return. Germany owns 20% Lufthansa exchange bailout. America *anything* like that. 

That's unwarranted cash going. That's outrage deserves go. people measly $600 week windfall. live Scottsdale true. bodies piling streets. go month trip groceries I'm knee deep dead COVID victims. state listened experts. Thanks little buddy. god fucking damnit. 1 year ago, Vitamin level checked quite low. I've supplements ever since then. smart enough get tested. I'd fine would saved lot money Vitamin D. burn every book these, might eredicate forever! think before, gimme Nobel Prize hate dish facts smug motherfuckers ""smart states""

Having STATE good covid controls like PEEING section SWIMMING POOL. reAllY????? supporters feel left behind society, economy, lazyness. angry everything always someone else's fault.

Trump complete belligerent, incoherent nutjob bug, feature. supporters love anyone channel latent anger towards whatever scapegoat group week. know cases cant confirm them? Thats whole point confirming cases Almost never....

Is almost completely untrue? almost never post misinformation? right core Trump's pandemic strategy.

 **'If stop testing right now, we'd cases, any'**

The full quote ""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!""

Clearly he's idiot, he's trying excuse numbers blaming fact able continue pushing widespread testing back. 

He's selfish, manipulative malicious toward people. actively tries misinform citizens manipulates facts flat lies try strengthen position. Acting like stupid removes perceived level responsibility decisions he's made.

Absolutely insane. one died cardiac issues? Lots good info humans right campaign website below. looks like progress made. Hopefully continue right direction. faucci wrong? 
 
We need testing more. Speaking guy who's following reasonably close. Yeah. conversation basically evolved like this:

*No, study garbage, needs zinc work!*

*No, study garbage, obviously work severely ill patients!*

*No, study garbage, needs taken EARLY*

*No, study garbage, funded big Pharma!*

*No, study garbage, needs taken prior prophylaxis*

Tbh, I'm guy cautiously optimistic first too. comments bit back supporting Hydroxychloroquine. yeah, went pretty fast ""miracle cure"" ""Well, can't prove *doesn't* work"" [Similar here, rhymes built around actual quotes, hes living wealthy fucks put office, protect profits, increase profits, recover profits lost Obama era regulations, get huge laugh too. hard disagree. literally zero foresight planning demented slurpee ""brain"" has. hours since said this, well may say opposite. guys losers? mean must decent jobs. reddit filed people lost life?

Talk shadow point though, flawed compare number confirmed cases different countries states. also case within single country, look Sweden there's doubling number confirmed cases week two back, entirely due huge increase test capacity, public healty authorities explained thoroughly.

If case US, know, easy check. since Trumps supporter base makes effort fact checking statements, would waste time bring solid argument up, even happened one.

Damn near everything deemed essential nobody wearing masks. many places America lockdown name only. 

but what's worse we're reopening everyone ripping Band-Aid like everything perfectly fine... we're hot spots creep they're likely get exponential see lockdowns happening anywhere... leadership US. None.

if everyone would honestly commit wearing masks meaningful social distancing need lock anything down... Except maybe bars.

Huh? really don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre talking you. one fucking disputing holy shit understand issue people taking headline face value saying Trump thinks stop testing virus goes away Surprised screening people TSA check points.

Nice work 

We‚Äôre proud all

And white folk joined you. it‚Äôs not. Economic contraction occurred widespread lockdowns occurred. demonstrate this: take people going go eat, shop travel hunker risk, someone live risk, whatever. take normal consumption reduced 80% (theoretical number). You‚Äôre going contraction. 

If want read this, NBER published working paper month back start economic contraction cause. 

You also currently understanding unemployment figures. You‚Äôre citing jobless claims unemployment. Further, jobs ‚Äúlost‚Äù. lot likely come back really tough figure measure many. america sucks. know I'll downvoted hell, get that's fine everyone know joking they've gained 20 lbs since lockdowns started head I'm thinking God people time that.... makes question eating cold prepared foods.

Breaking News: Ignorence Bliss take time learn virus forcing people making choices long term consequences rest life?

Sorry. I'm honestly sure point trying make.

I would love treatment Coronavirus 40-60% effective- that's asking. Especially alternative nothing all. Hospitalization anywhere near critical mass.

Did forget flattening curve? Nobody ever take seriously say things fucking stupid like did.

He worst president history. That's UNFATHOMABLY stupid lost respect gained actually seeing headline lie is. Halting flights anywhere pandemic....? Yes, officially labeling pandemic big deal, countries would heed seriously. Look negligence trump administration Japanese delay postponing Olympics officially announced.. head health organization, warn promptly without political considerations like said. Perhaps delayed time United States it‚Äôs biggest funder, Trump wanted say everything dandy since re-election coming up?

Problem solved! hahahaha think entire world limited intelligence, think word like ""normalizing"" kind $10 word nobody else understands. I'm sorry. realize talking fucking 5 year old. defense try make sound smarter mocking smarter you? Ok. Financial derivitaves. buy 'em Robinhood Would fared better sort messaging? I‚Äôd like think so.. percent positive hospitalizations going TRUMP:¬†Again, testing far advanced. much bigger better country we're going cases. We're always going cases. said, morning, that's probably downside good testing find lot cases countries, even test, have. test, cases.

Here full context and, surprise, still moronic statement. Also, we're nowhere near best terms testing rate. going start arguing US cases people? 

And large number tests late pandemic nothing brag about, especially much downplayed beginning. 

You compare testing, deaths, cases per 1m population Fuck, knew easy sooner! little bit extra things check phase. Typically phase 2 use small sample size check side effects see treatment works. phase 3 usually use larger sample compare effectiveness treatments. Phase 4 would even larger sample monitoring long term side effects. Since vaccines coronavirus Oxford probably saw risk low opted phase 2/3 trial. ones might sure jump straight large sample test vaccine couldn‚Äôt get approval. 

There lot vaccines produced top ones Oxford, Moderna, Cansino. Hey neighbor. Queens same. Lots people even wearing masks stores anymore. Worst offenders employees themselves. never said test less moron stating numbers testing would lower test capacity holy fuck keep talking one gets clearly but.you shred reading comprehension WTF about? Healthy folks near zero chance anything bad. millions cases, trends quite clear.  wait r/politics pretending r/technicalcorrect? Right. Biden choice he's ""acceptable"" candidate desires. He's establishment, unelectable Hillary.

What scares see reading teleprompter every statement makes.  can't even memorize short message repeat without reading card.

Fuck DNC. Thursday? work next day!
 /s Rising cases means testing call me? Fuck too, sitting like sweaty stack pancakes. good move considering China experienced recent spike cases It‚Äôs much lower 40%. thing really confused truly live idiocracy .

The world no, USA, yeah. Kinda pointless South close border cases/hospitalizations rising already. know...this awarded upvoted like crazy expose much idiot is. mean, Bunker boy recommended Hydroxychloroquine use Covid19, actual doctors others say NOT....Now get it. get people driving like shitheads. guy fucking genius! Yes think fear mongering led lockdowns needed. Fair point. Let restate: Trump wrong statement we've done testing country Fauci wrong statement testing needs be.

&amp;#x200B;

Better? would lot rewarding exposing double talk hypocracy clever public manipulators. there's nothing expose table. fucking depressing hell even matter anymore.  consistent response Trump statement guy insane. stark raving mad crazy. I‚Äôm talking grandfather sitting corner mumbling racist bullshit personal grudges. Read every Tweet thinking this, know dealing with. believe fuck us plays dumb friends rape country dry. I'm going lie, good solid minute take way. think says opinion Trump anything else. mean man say inject bleach sunlight sick. could see saying let's test people.

I think headline change said direct quote address whole quote first line. ""sensationalized"" headline? Yes, be? sensation going believing know better scientific university. would love see source people get symptomes within 5 days. yes likely infected before. virus normally affects respiratory tract, people get gastrointestinal symptoms like diarrhea?

The virus enters respiratory tract, replicate variety organs using cell‚Äôs ACE2 receptor protein. protein found large variety different cell types, one common ones epithelial cells intestines. know didn‚Äôt test positive dead cells like came another disease? Let‚Äôs serious, symptoms high blood pressure headache. scream COVID?

Oh also, false positives. would first case testing positive symptoms high blood pressure headache rare symptoms. Let‚Äôs calm please Upvote especially door knob reminder. Also time - cases keep going eventually get really, REALLY unlucky things like hospitalizations deaths. thing grows exponentially left unchecked. There's reasons countries like China South Korea freak get 50 cases - know go 50 10,000 hospitalizations deaths blink eye. angel lord came unto me, snatching place slumber. took high, higher still moved spaces betwixt air itself. brought vast farmland Midwest. descended cries impending doom rose soil. One thousand‚Äînay million voices full fear; terror possessed then. begged, ""Angel Lord tortured screams?"" angel said unto me, ""These cries covids, cries covids! see Reverend Maynard: Tomorrow harvest day them, is, holocaust."" sprang slumber drenched sweat like tears one million terrified brothers, roared ""Hear now! seen light! consciousness! life! soul! Damn you! Let rabbits wear glasses! Save brothers! get amen? üêë get hallelujah? üêë Thank Jesus. haven‚Äôt heard updates early December cases? eyes aren‚Äôt used be, sure I‚Äôll see you‚Äôre 2m away suspect China worrying bracing second wave since Wuhan. worry too. 

Beijing ca. 21 million inhabitants crowded public transport. tourists virus-controlled countries like PRC, RoC, RoK, AUS COVID definitely beats tourists world COVID.

So yes, totally sustainable. right, suppose thinking people would actually detect stop fever, would probably work even effectively deterrent. Especially airline develops policy allows travelers reschedule flight long canceled 12hrs boarding time. bet lot people would rather cancel circumstances attempt make using anti-pyretic, come feverish anyway lose hundreds dollars. would still desperately trying get funeral something try anyway, would far between. It‚Äôs two weeks Apparently can‚Äôt call ‚Äúd‚Äù word refers people want panic much possible virus without auto moderator replying me. stop freaking Well don‚Äôt know you, judging capitalized enthusiasm I‚Äôd inclined guess said reopening Texas bad idea? Welp, seems like India Italy Asia. forced work pandemic continue work? Nothing! divers? also looked data came conclusion increase mobility May 13th justify claims.

They 5k presumed dead city 7M still portion give AF exemption quarantines. suspicious cases need quarantined low sensitivity swab. Deaths also bi-product demographics. go spate young healthy people getting infected - noticlble rise - anything slow spread - eventually get non favorable demographics deaths go 

The point want cases rising unchecked b/c eventually luck runs out. may happening degree, COVID deaths undercounted actually bigger problem lot places, supported data. Look excess all-cause death count for, say, NYC, see significant discrepancy official COVID count overall excess death toll. Unless deaths explained way (I haven‚Äôt seen good explanation yet), assume mostly COVID deaths. also supported pneumonia death counts places. Pneumonia deaths many states already 2-4x higher yearly averages, suggesting COVID deaths misclassified pneumonia. Consider we‚Äôd actually expect pneumonia cases significantly given lockdown safety measures taken COVID. Also consider causes death, specifically accidental deaths, due lockdowns well. stats suggest are, overall, COVID deaths reported. doesn‚Äôt mean deaths incorrectly classified COVID‚Äîthere likely some‚Äîbut number actual COVID cases unreported greater number deaths misreported COVID. ""threaten""? ban them. 

You're allowed wear ""skimpy clothes"" airplane that's health hazard. right potentially infect others. numbers seem radically optimistic Yes, one Common symptoms.  social media continues mistake I‚Äôm black jack dealer luckily gave birth giving two weeks... wish time.

My pops lives Mountain View takes rather dim view churches manditories... Really cuz ones everyone wearing masks keeping respectful 6 feet. Jury's teargas proper disinfectant tho. science referring to? I'm curious  Sad. That's good! mean there, probably want get look blood flow brain (since disease attacks veins/vessels messes clotting too) make sure everything lighting properly. Sadly, likely difficult checking O2. Well poll conducted job Stewart still host. poll liked well informed viewers were. I'll address less liked thing anyway used impression too. TDS Jon Stewart TDS Trevor Noah two different shows outline. think Jon Stewart host made funnier Trevor Noah host passionate. equally informative. Trevor Noah got really rocky start first started hosting fan back either I've come around found style perfectly. wish Stewart also show. ever get chance watch Jon Stewart's 9/11 address Congress it'll make tear up. think man half comedian half activist switch off. Well think misinformation delivered public health officials went deep peoples' minds. many people reddit friends IRL swear masks help. cited studies studies small sample sizes. told real life studies Japan, South Korea Taiwan say masks help. voted comments reddit.  Wikipedia Jingshen Food market. literally says shoppers ‚Äúkeep expectations low terms cleanliness‚Äù Salmon Xinfadi came from. Xinfadi many sections, last time there, number areas could easily described wet markets.  Sure, know people wear masks, people protected. need stop pushing idea mask protect you. make people realize live society, want less restrictions social lives, need responsible protect right, instead would ""mystery illness"" infecting killing thousands. man genius ! , quick tell others!! Oh quit defending moron, it‚Äôs amazing everything thing idiot says interpreted ‚Äúwhat meant was‚Äù

Fucking spare us. Worst president we‚Äôve ever hospital 5 weeks Nov 2 days last month....all cleaning crew staff professional, kind I'm sure always deal much.... sarcastically. 

I actually, legitimately think could made difference. left worst possible time. blood sugar around 900. need know full context this. can't stupid. one stupid. Right? !remind 1 year ""We felt already accustomed us lying you"".

There airborne virus, better tell people OK GO OUTSIDE worried economy would tank. You‚Äôre right. number likely low. I‚Äôm open wrong, it‚Äôs something I‚Äôd need think about/have information on. lol'd median sound like something Michael Scott would say avoid work. Except President. 

Also, fucking shit, moron. really dementia one trying divert him. least Ronald Reagan better advisors started losing it. one frickin‚Äô stoopid ... hope gets slaughtered elections! thrilled it‚Äôs Biden need see guy exit fall flat fat face. jackass mean joke, often 'solution'. No. example: *directly only* *lockdown* 40 million Americans- average support 2 people (spouses, kids, family).

Had lockdown happened, jobs would lost. [Thinking would different across board. Look minnesota COVID numbers protests started show protestor spike. exists yet. Arizona protests answer.

Edit: unless want say protestors Minnesota inherently smarter safer despite protests destructive. Please tell people Arizona inherently idiotic less safe Minnesotans. love hear shit. Dated teacher years, worked hard. got summers off. know i'll get downvoted, job isnt really hard. Yeah, deal difficult kids. doesnt take whole lot education barriers entry generally pretty low. It‚Äôs act kindness. good deed day. things going WELL Texas right reopening... You‚Äôre going subject rant you‚Äôre recent person I‚Äôve seen it, apologise advance...

But come *on* dude, don‚Äôt need document edits it‚Äôs punctuation! one cares üò´  Tbh still carries lesser risk compared Church reopening Restaurants able takeout shutdown feel like good compromise. they‚Äôre back open area see many owners managers complaining lack business. there‚Äôs another surge, gains made gone. Office dropping family business name Even anthem super dishonest headline That's used word showing lol. cases always exist, show reports good testing. know players don‚Äôt spend time together? Vietnam bordered China, stretched 1,400km. Population 97 million, 15th world population ranking. I'm going give benefit doubt assume complete idiot. 

I'm going guess get news Fox Breitbart. 

Step outside safe spaces read news source outside America. 

Before this, read history. Specifically events leading Revolutionary War, well Civil War. study these, context understand civil rights movement 50s 60s, relevance today. progressed much might like think. 

Your anger - fear -protestors comes ignorance. Lucky you, cure. 

Schooling failed vast majority us USA, necessarily fault. idea like. I'm sure smart person make decisions. 

The least us make sure decisions informed. Ok, sure. 

Stay close minded.

Yes, whatever US media says, believable. 

Keep listening them.

=) I'm trouble deciphering trying get at... maybe he's saying root virus's spread testing itself? probably true minor degree... mean, go get tested, there's possibility get clinic.

Not defending him, confused. Honestly though whether likes democracy got worse faded obscurity. respect wanted retire peace needed ever still do. think needs brain scan point. man insane. think different ways conversation. consider career conversation. Action conversation, I‚Äôve taken action last four five years ever life. Sometimes action speak profoundly daily monologue. don‚Äôt view conversation: view show. you‚Äôre asking, wish show? Sometimes do. one had. one wonderful hands3 continues elevate way couldn‚Äôt have. efficacy kind conversation no-responsive point. people think going protect room full people wearing masks, need understand true. Yeah know anything one other. ask New Zealand. Frigging hell scape there.  Well narrative news trying spin continue instilling fear people coronavirus cases going whole worse weeks ago, true we‚Äôve started testing more. fact ‚Äúmod‚Äú would allow distorted statement fact scare people wrong. IQ bell curve works precisely like that. Centered around 100 near perfectly mirrored distribution either side. every 101 there's 99. every 120 there's 80. Roughly course that's idea. What‚Äôs even funnier America voted in......Laugjing Merica!!! Yes. Unfortunately state internet. Sensational headlines strong opinions drive traffic makes money. everyone goes places share opinions becomes echo chamber Yes 2 weeks? quite lot thinly veiled racism sub regards Floyd pandemic. people nearly subtle think are. Yeah 6.1 players who've ever made opening day roster, said 7.

The 2.5 year figure completely disingenuous includes players can't cut league. say sorry. Also changed policy realized mistake. Obviously would better smart enough avoid mistake first place, sure shit patron saint, much prefer governor admits he's wrong reacts accordingly, VS Florida's governor completely ignores everything we've learned virus pushes policies exacerbate infections state massive elderly population. Crazy think things humanity lived ignore them. Yes. This. don‚Äôt get people pretend guy broke something. obviously isn‚Äôt. money dream of! rich says is: almost certainly no, doesn‚Äôt mean doesn‚Äôt make day entire life. think there's lot MRA types around probably report women talking *some ways (not every single one every single time)* lives harder. ""But me"" happens lot. way getting anything ears playing Fox Friends. can...BLM protests Okay explain said said, instead whatever saying meant say. I'm fucking sick politics sub. r/technicallythetruth Umm yeah really consuming media entirely within country

*that's MaInStReAm MeDia boogeyman firm grip dumbass failed state*

Why fuck yell China censorship people themselves?

smdh Little think. I‚Äôve grown older I‚Äôve realized political world actually think gotten time gone on. politician influencer almost 24/7 access eyes ears, leaves lot people discuss critique.

Stay home 

Nobody cares. 


6 weeks till benes run Thank god input.  wouldn‚Äôt believe camp sites. They‚Äôll full, even campers can‚Äôt get track. place like Talladega basically festival.

I can't anymore. Someone else take care arguing bricks That‚Äôs works! That‚Äôs works! Fucking lunatic... Must preferring live randoms never met living known 16+ years really says lot character. Yes people one incident face life prison. That‚Äôs exactly riot. Neither spouting false equivalence tilt hand enough know bullshit way down. Facerolling keyboard fucking engaging discourse. So, stop buying tickets movies, cease exist? r/selfawarewolves thought number sexual assaults he's credibility accused of. People ridicule this, essentially *the thing* media conflate ""newly reported confirmed cases"" ""new cases."" people sub lap like daily slop. likely October/November. worked credit union call center repossession timeframe 90 days first missed payment CU would request repossession whoever contracted with. So, August means first missed payment, would repossessed starting October. India average testing rate line gdp per capita, way close lowest testing rate. compares favorably richer countries like Brazil Mexico.

When compare per capita test rates need compare per capita death rates Right, that's % increase previous week.

The 9-week increase average 22% (140 * 1.22^9 ~ 861). ""recent"" weeks higher.

Certainly expect number every week. stay-at-home (did texas even stay-at-home?) would highest, noisy since deaths would trivially small compared state total deaths. stay-at-home would low. stay-at-home, would expect remain low testing contact tracing keep - cannot, could become high again.

Overall data EXTREMELY noisy. also extremely inconsistent Texas's coronavirus death numbers, highly worrisome. Well, ain't wrong. folks unalive that's all.

Also, 2 meals today. There's global hunger.  Unfortunately really. studies (Lancet) tossed late stage hospitalized patients exact conclusion.

There reports reducing severity hospitalization rates India, strong evidence. rest preprints.  well. enforced another question entirely.

I tested positive regular flu back January. made curious positive flu means flu COVID. Wow. ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù still $75k. That‚Äôs money people make year US. would require priests know use computer pictures children. Yeah, oversimplified. say anything. like YOLO. stakes way higher anything think of. Even someone healthy 25 year old symptons, fast forward 15 years ""glass lung effect"" makes unable walk stairs. Whose father? Fuck, factually wrong. Take second understand. 

 using completely different ""success criteria"" Trump. 

He ALWAYS total number tests. he's right, we've done tests country. Nowhere statement assessment he's good job best metric use. changing goalposts mentioning testing per capita.  know exactly one person who's gotten tested, works hospital. one else able get one  mean, cant help people lie themselves. fact matter is, healthier are, less risk - covid - virtually ailment. FUCKING SHIT LMAOOOOO People without masks banned entering airport. somebody give full context this? Like surely trying make point here? stupid context care employees. care people thinking care employees. called image crafting Subtly? sing asshole song, change words he/she.  remember long term effects instead short term benefits.

It‚Äôs good. I've seen several times. metro groups young men entered train without masks, coughing people shouting ""Corona!"", smiling laughing. I've seen three groups one month.

High doses Hydroquinone cause kidney damage. Offer end viruses sort antibodies personally would expect people get reinfected 6 months so. 12 months would expect people reinfected 24 months would expect almost everybody reinfected.

That's loose guess based detected levels antibodies SARS virus, one thing guess current virus going produce long lived antibodies none ones that. Ahhhh yeah fingers crossed. 

I‚Äôm disappointed though saving lives make money  Nice tip. Anyone advice keep straps digging ears? There's also paper, found overall IFR 0.64%, IFR people 5.6%.

Perez-Saez, F.J., Lauer, S.A., et al. 2020. *Serology-Informed Estimates SARS-COV-2 Infection Fatality Risk Geneva, Switzerland*. preprint, still early. important keep mind protests started small grew exponentially daily basis leading two Saturdays ago.

I'm DC. attended mass gatherings May 29 June 6. advised professionals, waited June 12 get tested. received results yet.

I also note still widespread testing. close, way there. providers still require two symptoms. DC launched walk-up, symptom testing. However, lines hours long ran tests. true can‚Äôt let guards either. (Coming fellow kiwi :) ) see got voted this. Coward Common cold group 200+ viruses including four corona viruses current circulation.

The fact pay attention cases cl body produces short-lived antibodies coronavirus infection.

With common cold viruses antibody lifespan around 6 months meaning people get reinfected even one month that's average we're talking about. SARS antibody lifespan detectable 24 months though never actually tested immunity response far since virus sputtered vanished.

So, entire time saying reinfection pretty likely x amount months know x yet.

This strongly immunity certificates would require solid consistent antibody testing well since never know supposedly immune person's antibody levels drop least become carrier also get sick first time.  sources there. idea. Still made friends here, pretty much call friends Seattle New England time time. Although that's really place post schooling. gotta weigh possibilities.

The media mislead people thinking ""mild"" virus everyone really dangerous. Think again:

1) virus widespread like media speculated, India Japan showing less 1% 0.1% infected, respectively. - [Source [Source [Source Older antibody tests, used inflate infected numbers lower IFR, dont work. 15% known cases UK, European countries, dead. Brazil Florida hide numbers bad. 0.25% NYC already dead, containment measures. 0.25%. *entire* city. Pop 8 million. Ryan, Ryan said Monday concerned talk tests future show people infected world could return normal. **Clinical studies actually shown opposite**, insisted. told briefing Monday worried ‚Äúthis narrative, assumption disease spread around, really seeing severe cases difficult cases‚Äù.  treating copious amounts alcohol? Coronavirus test costs $100. America conducted 25 millions tests meaning America spent $2.5 billion tests already? 30 million insane number. 

At 3 million everyone would experience least ""parent friend"" died someone else within level social proximity. would enough country pay attention.

I‚Äôm TN live now. family still casually say ‚ÄúCorona what....where?‚Äù It‚Äôs concerning.  it‚Äôs sensationalized headline? fuck getting upvoted??? still death rate 1%. blatant fearmongering. Well cases coming international wasn‚Äôt really surprise tho. think worst news news assuming across board Coronavirus short-lived antibodies.

The common cold Navarre antibodies 6 months means get infected month it. SARS least behind antibodies may last 24 months, lose never tested actual immune response. 

In either case talking 6 24 months significant variation individual meaning even average lifespan antibodies 24 months people, unlucky ones, would lose immunity roughly 4-6 months. 12 months people would lose immunity 24 months almost everyone would lose immunity outliers.

I think that's bad news bad news since January almost nobody wants talk they're going cross fingers hope pray strategy instead. science staring face regardless handful doctors scientists said, they're like humans would rather paint picture competent response instead panic.

 take data says says inspect people start get reinfected 4-6 months face significant amounts reinfection 12 months near complete loss immunity 24.

And that's assuming like SARS common cold Coronavirus antibody lifespan appear reasonable assumption. average antibody lifespan could well 6 12 months, even 24 lot people would losing immunity months. According Facebook. good portfolio. That's makes nervous going back restaurants. seating outdoors people still need use restroom. amount people see taking mask entering sends shiver spine. didn‚Äôt age well either lol Steady rises mean 30 new cases per day population Seoul metropolitan area 25 million.

Well record, month later, trend exponential, peak already occurred month post, we‚Äôre currently 4891 dead, 60% increase compared projected 333%. believe immune evasion well-established point key factor pathogenesis pathology. article provides good overview outside field:

I think issues viral clearance pose problems level infection severity, honestly shudder think chronic, high viral load sometimes systemic infection common case progression asymptomatic infections.

As ticking time bomb idea, we're sure. need better understanding virus cells infects infected cells interact cells order really idea damage virus could asymptomatic cases, research restricted BSL3/4 labs.

That corona viruses work I've trying tell people since January.

Spoken like person never experienced adversity kind... left part Trump supports testing.

You must work cnn exactly expect family viruses short-lived antibodies.

I believe people want hear it, entire class viruses short lived antibodies think worth keeping mind expect immunity either last long reliable.

if we're lucky average antibody lifespan 2 years like SARS estimated be. problem able detect SARS antibodies 2 years able test immune response antibodies. big problem 2 years average means people could able get 6 months less.

and that's antibodies lay span effective immunity actually 2 years. common cold current virus antibody lifespan 6 months valid gas antibody lifespan covet 19 average 6 24 months significant variation individuals.

This say heard immunity immunity certificates always really bad idea. flu antibodies last entire life. flu mutates new strains bypass antibody protection insanely high rate that's keep getting it. Corona virus differently instead mutating fast overcome antibody response somehow leaves behind antibodies stay system long.

To major feature current Iris family viruses seems lot people tried live denial likelihood reinfection.

We talking like reinfection almost given, like unlikely possibility. 

Now one bit hope besides I'm totally wrong antibodies last well 2 years average antibodies mean second time getting virus easier body defeat. reasonably possible even without antibodies increased antibody response.

On hand viruses mutate there's guarantee virus easier beat second time third time. personally think probability likely easier beat second time process naturally virus would become another common cold like virus people developing improved immune responses, vulnerable killed lifespan reduced virus mutating lose unnecessary receptors humans. 

Right virus filled receptors essentially made bats animals. virus itself, evolution, may choose path lower lethality long lose infectiousness process since probably methodology survival fittest. additional receptors make virus lethal might necessary virus replicate propagate. case evolutionary pressure virus ditch receptor. hand could get lucky mutation become infectious lethal, especially short term. exactly related this, school‚Äôs reopening wants everyone take temperature coming think people asymptomatic...

The current number deaths new jersey roughly 12,600. Given death rate CDC 0.26%, means us reach number deaths, HALF NJ Covid 19 (about 5mil compared NJs 8.882mil population). infections took place March April, 2 months ago, testing widespread. So, everyone infected back recovered, typical infection ten days symptoms start, normally 2-8 days initial infection. running ton tests now, according IHME, NYT shows 300 new cases day. So, risk pretty low right now. may second wave fall, half population it, second wave cannot possibly worse first. lose hope. shall pass. Maybe takes 9 months, 15 months, 18 months, emerge side. many us greater appreciation small pleasures life can't now.

There's 330 Million unique visitors per month reddit, can't 330 million non-US visitors. Also, knows many bots/data scrapers. Probably half would guess. There's LOTS silent bots. 

However, there's 30 million AMERICAN users month, still unlikely true majority visitors American. forget trickle me. scratch back, scratch mine, right? Installed today. wife, too. I'd favor centralized data collection solution, enabling healthcare offices shine spot locations high transmission.

But better late never. Try working healthcare; masks 8-10 hours :-( Right? dare assume highly contagious virus gets increased spread people packing large room? Absolute morons. showed treated didn‚Äôt make it. self quarantine tested positive Well least confirm demise. Great news found cut deaths! Big pharma happy though cheap widely available drug.. thinking possibility. tests animals aerosols, showing exposed subjects fact produce antibodies, get sick. may work virus loads low enough course. America FUCK YEAH!!! Right like. disposable department, unless upper management totally insane wasting money. Maybe gift shop clerk skipped. That's it, everything else apparently, needs be. 

I've worked facility bottom fell every department good portion work one one ""below"" them. Scope practice non-existent. mess typical ltc mess. OOOOFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF virus cannot kill 10 million. kills 0.5%-1% people get it. saying sacrifice short term pays benefits long term? I'm sorry, American brain cannot fathom concept. Anytime someone asks question gets downvoted hell. bet there's little baking actually done Dunkin. Probably frozen shit shipped in. Already past flowing Completely worth it. US clearly even shadow dream claimed Depends definition ""is"" is. understand. non-racist conservative views make principled opposition positions agree with. resort personal attacks gross mis-characterizations people based background. 

Also, I'm fairly confident/optimistic notion 'race' something fades usage human society. descendants look back wonder/puzzlement belief, especially formed basis discrimination. talking engineering chemistry labs. Underrated comment Yes, true point *Lockdowns cause coronavirus.*

What describing policy failure. Politicians chose dodge responsibility providing support migrant workers therefore mass Also, something shady happening India's numbers. seems like testing daily certain quota met, daily cases increasing steady linear manner completely proportional test numbers suspicious.

Do know ability text beyond quota?

I know, example, US adds something like 20,000 cases day. 20,000 new cases. think testing capacity maxes 24k. unclear novel foreign disease population, let direct native americans.

Oops, they're mostly dead.  Erm really good idea? ~ 2000 people random adequate detect something. finding nothing outside test's margin error [i]highly[/i] likely means 1%+ epidemic. act like infrared thermometers meant eliminate risk, aren‚Äôt, already know people spread covid without fever symptoms, we‚Äôre trying reduce spread taking symptomatic (likely people infectious stage, potentially symptoms like cough increase spread) ones picture ordered masks January kinda figured government would fail response. freedumbs !!! hate people. Write info@velapass.it, website www.velapass.it still construction company suspected scam. halted nasdaq months! typical chinese company GOT SHOT FUCKED HIM. swedens government like atm cook everything properly days rule possibility. need risk health. Moderna even one product market technology they're using vaccine unproven. Yes we're eager vaccine that's likely released one dozens competing companies currently working one... Masks don‚Äôt protect wearer getting sick, protect public wearer wearer sick. 

It would benefit learn actually happening works decide opinion worth sharing publicly. former redneck, think gonna fly. hands? Damn! That's amazing. GDP equal quality life huge difference. Yup. Possible needs blood fight anemia. understand people hate much.

I mean, know brown, Muslim, outspoken woman many people hatefilled bigots consumes them, understand anyone could ever allow get state first place.

the controversial thing state congressmen beholden lobbying money, particular Israeli lobbying money. OMG, horror all. Well, David Koch made life making people‚Äôs lives worse nice Dont worry NZ... fine..

Based gathered info...keep vigil tho!:)  People walking around like Pandemic exist. I'd hate doctor risked family turn around see I'm seeing. worst thing kiddies go back school, people forced work (expanded unemployment going away), flu season starts time. wonder going get worse, much worse. I‚Äôm talking conversation general, business going bankrupt, polls state majority still scared go outside cant employees report working conditions? would report this? theres 30% customers entering restaurant wear masks even bring kids without masks. staff isnt anything covering faces. dangerous cant work ill fired. Yeah Sweden good position criticize European countries. Meanwhile cheap treatment found Oxford, preemptive culling thousands population herd immunity looks smarter day... again, refutation point. know refuting even is? Lmao hospitals separate patient transport department, hospitals push responsibility patient care techs. **indoor** rallies horrible idea. 

Plenty outdoor stadiums US. Yep Sweden still going like crazy. fatalities per million Italy since April 1st since beginning May twice many. even caught UK. Soon they'll match Italy even total deaths per million.

Sweden, please stop needlessly killing many people? Lol going keep saying thing like magically makes saying valid? already refuted ""public vs private use"". want refute refutation, go ahead. repeating makes sense. ever discussion human before? well. Yeah, every bar got bad press hotspot yesterday, many think going similar outcome tomorrow? wait. hubris seen due course. Oh please, talk Nov 2016  not? Dex common enough run supply issues, like happened hydroxychloroquin? 3yr old take Dex pulses month... get flu shot, covid shot time. two sources. One Wikipedia: intro paragraph details various spellings.

Second source me, Army doctrine always spell Al Qaida reports. 

I‚Äôm Arabic linguist though, know isn‚Äôt 1 1 transition Arabic English. Muhammad also multiple spellings. forehead 31% patients presenting New York State hospitals Covid-19 fevers 

Probably either 

1) already self-medicating Tylenol/Advil either fever muscle aches headaches

2) past mild fever stage moved serious symptoms, going hospital instead trying recover home

This article defeatist. Thermal cameras, even show fevers, work one important way--they discourage people actually fever (or otherwise feeling weather) going places stationed. People might otherwise downplay symptoms go work crowded public place might decide want singled rejected.

Sure, people infectious start fevers. still better daily temperature taking done e.g. school, people take action ASAP? kid gets sent sick bay await picked parents, that's one less day interaction/transmission classmates. parents informed, monitor take doctor get better days. There's higher chance kid get positive test confirmation exposed classmates become infectious themselves, quarantined transmission stopped. kid's fever detected, maybe kids get exposed next 1-2 days, maybe parents realize he's sick, get positive test result infected classmates already transmitted people. 

Here Singapore, school open late April. students take temperatures oral thermometer start school day. practice, thermometers, already routinely used years (legacy SARS). cases schools one student known infected anyone else school (or preschool). testing rate high (any known contact symptoms would tested). School re-opened beginning June far good. Although around 6 cases found schools (all isolated), none transmitted. father adding dexamethasone IV drips everyone area. that's deaths area corona. One day look pharma stocks respond sales upticks. Even Sanofi upped price $1000s (which would never happen non-patented generic shkreli issue wasn't, hence could hike price) stock price still jump 100x, less become expensive pharma stock ever. 

Please, beg actually read understand things trying pass claims like this. understand hate him, stupid stories like HCQ Sanofi relationship gaining traction accelerates move outlets real news entertainment news. May remind 70 + year old Twitter president Probably late July travel still restricted virus-affected countries. care messenger situation that's thing I've commented on. would see health care workers getting Covid two three times immunity short lived. lot hospitals, 25% workers antibodies. Lol actually dead on, tell addressed incorrect points begin with. yeah, go ahead say IM one reading comprehension issues (hint:its actually you) 

is refuting anything. saying ""I'm right wrong"". wonder emojis we'll get time. apparently got quarantine early?? slowed considerably recently. current pace would likely hit ~145k August. places keep flaring though 200k definite possibility. thing August beginning favorable weather virus. handle thing good compliance end August, body count grow fast. One thing that‚Äôs good drug cheap easy produce, there‚Äôs lot it! Thank comment. provided link actual study read come conclusions (and share thoughts observations, shared yours).

I time yet read study one carefully enough comment intelligently it. girlfriend‚Äôs mother (Fox News, OAN, InforWars) lives Phoenix, Arizona, current hotspot, defiantly going get hair nails done eat restaurants. Thinks wearing mask weakness, it‚Äôs flu, also it‚Äôs manmade nothing nature could evolve like this. dad died coronavirus last month. cherry top nursing home Pittsburgh didn‚Äôt count death covid. got 15 minutes Pittsburgh post gazette interviewed her, got post long rambling facebook status ‚Äúfailed greatest generation‚Äù 

When girlfriend pointed literal proof covid deaths purposefully *under-reported*, doubles claims well goes ways, someone dies car crash blah blah blah bullshit.


You can‚Äôt fix stupid. goes Singapore government wants us wear contact tracing wristband go people think invades privacy. records go 24 days deletes afterwards. Depends live. PA, NY, Northeast state saw spike, would certainly second wave, arent. Drip. Drip. Shameful woman claim pre-existing condition. guess, though, loved one dying care much. selfish, though. many people getting see loved one deaths end thing. case mitigated NZ's policies (and reminder policies place), small country. imagine many others like there. things without regard public safety. coming.  Source? statistics quoted article show minimal effectiveness. actually fair question. know guys, seems like every episode House, destroying kidneys, liver, heart medications trying throw everything wall see sticks. Sure reduce severity masses like flu shot worth doing. Note vast majority vaccines eliminate getting said virus disease reduce severity get Yea better ""Fine"" people bottom feeders society empathy kindness Godly virtue them. give space, try best add pain suffering, anthem life. sorry hear that. dont know religious, prayers go family. xDDDDDDDDDDDD now... wanted clueless bunch 'its flu' agenda..

Now impossible implement without civil unrest america..

And one part pool pissed in, whole pool gets urins anyone explain antibody blood big deal? people recovered infection test needed??? backend code also Labcorp $10, free(with doctor recommendation) antibody test. shitty person apologize move on. fact acting way indicates likely lying save face. Either way, piss off. believe opposite I‚Äôm trying do. I‚Äôm afraid nation protests. hey- I‚Äôm going fix typing comments I‚Äôll take L I‚Äôll shut up. Maybe so. Yea, one people distrust gov. recent events (covid control, unveiled cases corruption,... ) suppose changing better give chance. Sounds right. Costs $40 now, $5,000 come fall. Cited reason: Production manufacturing platform lot antisocials Unless Sweden already preemptively culled thousands herd herd immunity... great news hope information doesn‚Äôt create short supply like happened hydroxychloroquin... 3 year old take steroid! Here's thing. over, people much smarter going studying available data, untangle things worked others didn't. wide range society governmental responses, going pretty rich ground study come. Things like effect public transit, mask wearing, societal norms (do live multi-generations single roof? physically affectionate? societal expectation personal space?). going fascinating. mean, right kind terrifying, future, interesting. Obviously BS, even get excuse theory. lungs work well enough breathe couple layers healthy enough shopping respiratory pandemic

Pick one, guys. 

Refusing wear mask ADA reasonable accommodation doctor's note neither gives immunity law exempts policies owners implement private property, depending location done (it's widespread). 

If legs work need ramp chair fine, provide medical background whoever points ramp. Thing ramp increases safety disabled without unreasonably adversely affecting others, increase pandemic spread. Absolutely, they're highest risk group far. even better news given tablet form earlier reduce burdens hospitals. really good news. Thanks, guess won‚Äôt sushi salad while. TIL start tho? Unfortunately missed said. thing see response. apologize see time. Apparently also thousands feel opposite, number thay increasing time goes. basically reinvented Disney‚Äôs magic think mostly bean shaped. imagine people died 9/11. 37 times.

or go Arlington cemetery look graves. people died year worldwide covid. quarter cemetery would US deaths alone. two foreigners test positive let 14 day quarantine early due ""compassionate exemption"" see dying parent. able get handle pretty quickly though. Unfortunately, coronavirus care feelings. countries large number things. institute 100 hundred different policies, many found ineffective, much likely worked ones work now. Still better 1 2 things might work enough.. think difference results properly sized study. I‚Äôm sure comments going 100% supportive Rep. Omar way get out-of-hand.  Lol sorry subjecting it! low IFR us forget virus, like decrease IFR 1/3, would    .13% IFR, that's pretty close flushing IFR. India population 1.4 billion , compare mortality rate India European countries USA also India better . redditers predicting maybe wishing also millions death since January .

With testing opening economy cases keep increasing currently Indian kept mortality rate pretty low hope stays low . 5 states account majority corona cases containment hot zone , evolving strategy handling areas effectively . far know Google knows Al Qaida western countries news outlets refer group mainly take identity Al-Qaeda. Yeah looks like agenda driven article. Try hiking secluded areas, help mental state. fact can't articulate issues without stupid analogy tells everything need critical thinking ability.

wth dude? gotta go asswaffle like reason?

And actually articulate *your* issue without stupid analogy first comment. Perhaps missed it...?

Private vs public use.

Now kindly piss Brit, living Aus - see apathetic UK social media, comparison I‚Äôve witnessed firsthand (and observed social media) Aus. think there‚Äôs degree truth last point. point even stupidest people realize risk going out... 

I think give stupidest people much credit. Actual headline: everyone beats coronavirus produces antibodies it

The rules NonEdited Headlines It‚Äôs steroid that‚Äôs widely prescribed cancer patients various reasons eg reducing swelling tumours, reduce nausea Yes people seem viral debris shows positive PCR tests long person longer sick virus?

I wonder many tests gave her. I'd want lot sorry hear that. mean need needles rest life? V-shaped recovery come! 2,085,000 confirmed cases 350 million 0.6%. I'm suggesting actual number cases significantly higher, that's reported number. Nope, already made point incorrect, fail refute point true. badically, prove right. vote Dems, that's pretty much it. state? norm‚Äôs macdonald. guy! Lockdowns happened corona nothing fear buying power course. gathered, chances high vaccine (If one!) could work long vaccines, causing higher costs, resulting people getting sick dying.

My breaking point banks Italy started freeze installment payments. greediest people world thinks like that, shit going hit fan, shit already tainting room. exactly happened meantime, going get worse. people know easily take decades vaccine properly distributed. Ever Europe, Japan, Australia, Korea etc.? I've third world countries. know lot better South America Africa compared first world countries severely lagging. healthcare system shit show, best public transit systems compare anything Europe, political system broken (granted applies lot countries too). I've countries, first hand experience comparing them.

Good luck convincing people deny even exists this. People acting like month everything fine. Or, like area, ""it's flattening"", obviously means go back normal everyday habits, never coming back according them.

If anything, recent events convinced people easily relaxing restrictions lead explosion infections, rapidly virus spread one careful right thing. surprise see happen states, especially states currently number rise, people start fleeing states ""be safe"", bringing virus them. No. misunderstood it. opposite thinking.

I totally agree Afghanistan repel British, literally major empires since Persians. Afghanistan literally called Graveyard Empires empire successfully control Afghanistan.

I think know that, right? shit, wait find gyms unsanitary too. Wait parents long can. thinking also maybe kill many hard handicaped people burden without money spent better all? sorry know spokesman older vulnerable people. grandma gf doubt happy died beginning shitshow see grandkid married last week via Photos knowing see grandkid 6 months.

We've lost people cared wretched virus already :( Probably due partner someone actually get tests. sure Red Cross took long, local places across country already available, least it‚Äôs now! SARS-CoV-2 elicits NF-kB driven immune response, overactive response causes symptoms COVID-19. Dexamethasone downregulates Oh, see everyone. actually respond them, declare correct. r/MURICA Yep. ideological blind spot faith heritage, that's moral weakness. course, pretty much also true almost every member Congress eh needs open eyes stop gorging Faux News.

Well, disappointing. Big question, answer. pretty despicable see people celebrating death man causes pain someone dislike.

My heart goes Rep. Omar, imagine losing father father-in-law day. US surpassed EU-27 probably somewhere April already terms deaths per million people. 27th may following stats Worldometer showed; 

EU-27 Cases per M. = 1936

EU-27 Deaths per M. = 166

EU-27 Tests per M. = 47035

‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ

US Cases per M. = 5218

US Deaths per M. = 304

US Tests per M. = 46964 mean taking short quote completely changes it. Yep, point raised group still make sense. issue health code violations they're dangerous. fact can't articulate issues without stupid analogy tells everything need critical thinking ability. going anywhere. Enjoy day. Lol, south Korea happened shit thanks gay straight clubbers. Welcome hellhole. Sure, read full post like read sibling comments, okay. It‚Äôs fishes food Bourne . found cutting board fish. truly awesome We're #3 world population #7 world deaths capita (and climbing, #9 days ago). nationwide shutdown. Why? No. sure read headline, basically spells you: China reacting fiercely 100 infections.

You would bring competence sitting million infections 100k deaths?

I think version competence compatible world's definition. thread literally first time i've ever seen anyone say HIPPA, although seldom stumble upon random people discussing topic, small sample size. mean? one repel Western forces? Yes, case joke Vietnam.

I Afghanistan successfully repelled three successive British Invasion attempts throughout history. kidding! Cheap, widely available drug. Statistically strong reduction mortality among severe cases randomized controlled trial. best news we've while. Thanks sharing full quote. short quote captured essence. long quote definitely captures ramblings someone living reality own. States looking ways reduce transmission close again.

It's bizarre, however, many people thought virus would disappear one day. Like miracle. voted present resolution recognize Armenian genocide. people read headline upvote it, talk peers. I‚Äôve saying along younger generations... it‚Äôs whether kill affect quality life.

Overweight technically pre-condition, could still unhealthy, classified such. Right, I‚Äôm sure.. exactly ‚Äúpropoganda‚Äù, please enlighten me. didn‚Äôt learn school, rather able think opposed circlejerking reddit/Twitter think tank countries obviously lot things right, mean everything they're contributing. New Zealand also successful without implementing measures. *a handful bars temporarily closed customers tested positive coronavirus weekend.*

Please note, bars, bars, even bars. couple bars positive tests, sanitizing bar / testing employees. guy diet lifestyle like covid?

Was pinicle health eat like shit, smoke never exercise?

These sensational headlines nothing There's lot creative mockery Trump supporters going around inspired honestly unless made typographical error good one. say second half marathon starts mile 20. address point

We mass protests going nationwide 3 weeks.

The vast majority seen spike cases. Minnesota fact tested protestors found LOWER rate positive tests baseline population tested.

You cherry picking small minority states spikes falsely attributing protests likely would experiencing spikes irrespective protests Lmfao fuck about? saying make money unemployment yet people expect worshipping corporate overlords fact job. Whose fucking side on???? Proven? Lol. clearly know word means.

I actually think intellectually disabled, I'm going end here.

I'll call need AC fixed. fair, dex used treat SARS, along different types steroid - ""problem"" occurred SARS last long enough efficacy different steroids properly understood. Pretty good summation similar issue vaccine one - vaccine work SARS could've potentially helpful Covid, ceased needed. It‚Äôs NY. It‚Äôs US UK. likely? false positive virus twice? True avoid it, better remedy. ""arguments like."" like reality. Regardless, always noticeable users repeat thing again. even noticeable multiple users repeat thing, again, words. context really matter. survivors 80s HIV pandemic similar stories. People need start change mindset towards best chance survival. Europe given documenting , sporadic minor reports.

Germany updated testing long time 4,694,147
Italy test mostly Lombardy
Spain given up.
France given up.
UK reports counting test never done laso counting many duplicates. Honestly I've wondered vibe countries I'm thoroughly dismayed hear got crazies us. chosen one üò≠ do, heard one. Thanks, tend miss lot, always loved older rap newer artists, know many people particular musical tastes, I'm pretty limited know/listen to. Appreciate recommendation! I'm sure effective small percentage, unless hundreds workers might marginally helpful.

I think would worth added measure high risk areas lot workers. Warehouses, meat vegetable packing, nursing homes, hospitals. find one person send home early worth it. 

The problem temperature checks make public feel safe. went optometrist though secretary wearing mask someone hells door open schooch literally doorway, also temperature checks show something. I'm case theater. iron low, hemoglobin? Usually you‚Äôre donating check hemoglobin iron. talking Contact Tracers ""fuck government.""  Given contamined food made feces better example. word would used? probably used confusing another word. also use ""multiple"" makes seem like many players infected bare minimum multiple. 2. 90% sub reads titles assume see title think ""oh NFL practicing like 8 players team tested positive"". That's interpreted headline first saw it. I‚Äôll bet DeSantis deflects blame too. Unfortunately direct effect controlling plague, people drop street seems like big deal. 

Alot people get overreaction makes seem stupid reality correct move along. There's dozens us taking seriously. Dozens!! thought sub better moderation. stayed 12+ hours? Sometimes feel disappointed Reddit's infrastructure. studies I‚Äôve looked studied asymptomatic people. Interestingly, people look feel fine, researchers CT scan image lungs. 50 100% cases, actually found abnormalities,‚Äù said Daniel Oran, Scripps Research

What mean? 

""Uhh ... might abnormalities half cases looked .. every single one. cant really remember. Probably would good someone writing stuff down."" cure everyone, pray! Requiring wear mask board stop taking afterwards, hence threatening ban passengers remove masks mid-flight. China locking America opposite.

Enjoy last year. Next year you‚Äôll invaded coming years you‚Äôll called something else.

S/

Edit:

But seriously, America. absolutely everything wrong. It‚Äôs crazy see government fuck massively. But, hundreds thousands people saying, fuck pandemic. Fuck worst outbreak anyone alive seen. nasty Lol adding 3-4K deaths week post definition fear mongering.

40% estimate ‚Äúhovering below‚Äù  Yup also remove bulb ""check engine"" light car stop blinking.

Extremely effective. like gets dumber day Blaming political move. simply cut possible source. Recursive coronavirus. classic. Id like know Newsworthy, want know does, is.  Man, anyone think sooner? could millions lives. plans going full Bolsonaro?

This tactic gonna work. sure Trump healthy. It‚Äôs largely certain age group gathering protests could help build herd immunity. It‚Äôs tough situation sure health complications I‚Äôve stayed isolated look silver linings dismal times. vaccine isn‚Äôt coming time soon. Theres difference Trump downplaying situation saying test lot vs Trump literally thinking tests means virus, title posts leads us believe. argument is. people still follow guy says it‚Äôs good idea drink bleach? Yeah that‚Äôs matter disagreement- they‚Äôre fucking morons. happening.  say still early tell, say already rise... pick koolaid choice... happening. 

Unfortunately I'm unaware use crayon reddit comments, sonyou may find someone else read you. news proposed legislation policy (US) pipeline time would remove medical privacy pandemic scenarios tinfoil point? I'm claiming anything USA testing compares nations Europe whole twice big USA. course exact cutoff 'remotely size' use imagination. Personally would say anything 150m 400m also gotten sick cooking ever I'm something right.

Were getting sick restaurants referring to? And? I'm assuming play [Kellyanne Conway called CoVid-19 19th one. senior advisor Trump said this. Man feel you, I‚Äôve wanting get tested calm nerves don‚Äôt know go  Wow make good point. Jewish lawyer. major news. Take advantage donate. Design new trap doors, hand parachute kick plane.  like murdering yemen ... dont talk noone dies bombs  Reading Trump quotes hurts brain sentence one slightly different.  I‚Äôm insinuating wrong, closer models government (both right left) given us early September factors. alone finding HCQ posts entertaining point, offering humorous reading relief otherwise sad pandemic reddit?

Hope eliminate HCQ related debate defensive comments! dont know person Season 2 starts 4%. enough hard drive space? gonna big one! stupid... BURNS!!!! read title? Southwest experience. Highly recommend. call ""good news."" Previously cases transmitting covid outdoors almost unheard of. really interesting piece recently claimed point one single case covid traced outdoor exposure.

The title article misleading--people think ""few"" ""a few"" usually means single digits. fact article says 1.4% 3300 tested came back positive, means 46. 40% results (of even comprehensive screening begin with), means closer 100 positive cases protesters. assuming state similar gatherings, would 5,000 new cases (*possibly*) traced protests. course every state similar gathering, multiple similar gatherings different cities. 

Each coronavirus case tends spread 1-2 people, add new infections we're 10k cases traced protests within first round secondary infections (assuming 1 secondary infection per new case). far roughly 4% Minnesota's cases ended death. apply rate estimation 5000 new *nationwide* cases (*possibly*) traced directly protests, that's 200 deaths--and add 200 new round infections. ""good news""?

**Please note ""possibly""s. guestimates many variables.** protesters test positive mean got protests. point *not* good news all. Nobody expecting hundreds thousands protesters catch covid directly single state's protests. actually worse would expected significant margin (if fact get protest, unknown.) 

Anyway, every single new case one want striving avoid. Given protests accomplished nothing (I'm sorry that's truth--literally nothing changed kind measurable way, nobody's life situation different, nobody safer, nobody rights), think got good return investment hundreds deaths thousands ill people.

Personally care much, people going want although take issue people's choices far tell want legal think really important. take issue characterized ""good news"". Bold assume states unemployment even works Yeah completely torn labrum weed thing helps burning scapula lay down.

Like said vaping knew covid. time knew already mend figured slowing best stopping would likely marginal benfit lung xray almost completely clear, wasnt risk ARDS gotten far anyways.

I used HR Fury 2.

If made cough caused irritation would stopped immediatly never happend. would reccomend staying anyways THC + Deadly Disease = existental dread. anyways. serious side effects. (Hmmmm.) show significant difference one patient arm serious disease.  Self reported results without testing. good study, sorry.  better Mehra complete fabrication. OP reports Trump says test it, numbers would lower (duh?).

Guy responds saying sensationalized headline test lot, numbers high (still sure means headline sensationalized).

You respond saying reddit accept something good Trump doing. ""good"" Trump doing? Making obvious pointless statement hide numbers (by testing less), would appear better? Well shit, I'm sure interpret good thing. know name 600$ PU knocked 504$ 205$ UI 172$ yep reduced 16% week. HIV lousy French bastards poked absurd noses subject. HIV another French hoax. article make clear, assume they're quarantine hotel? Drug dealers solve problems faster government swear

Privately run businesses generally effective government. close windows hide basement, protests! read comment wanted offer solution practiced countries one specific scenario mentioned, disagree add nuance nuanced comment. B-b-b-but eradicated it! feel like saw something like simpsons Karen haircuts! Well one smartest people, probably world. OH COME ON! catch break already?!? hope tell like is. Facts care feelings. ""Avoid"" last sentence says all. India best country world, best doctors, compliant citizens, transparent goverment, everybody rich never lack meal, one bed per every citizen, deaths tested covid19 made sure die blessed perfect health. rest world struggling Covid19 struggling cause ain't india, God designed it. /s mean I'm perfect, I'm making soup previous day leaving warmer 105F day...

I also gotten sick cooking ever I'm something right. otherwise might well booking seat elevator hell.

they're already there, they're planning bids tenders expansion real estate Reality going tank reelection chances. pretty much described feels testing today. That's moot point comes insulin, developed 1920 r&amp;d costs covered nearly 100 years ago.

Sure could make argument company rights make charging cover development newer drugs ... that's like charging $2000 PS4 costs $200 make extra going development ps5, ludicrous idea charge $5000 ps5 ps6 development costs ... never costs much maximum profit nothing else Look figure 1 paper. shows masks associated lower coronavirus mortality introduced start outbreak. news: Pathetic orange failure hates admitting wrong. r/technicallythetruth whole, slows heat kindve dead theory now, right? goes saying quiet part loud again. soon go under. sure hell fly do. Recirculated air closed space. That‚Äôs handle virus. That‚Äôs know it‚Äôs incredibly stupid protests hundreds thousands, fucking pandemic hand. 

The US unbelievably bad time. Okay change meaning...in case DID. summary, older age population, urbanization, obesity, longer duration outbreak country independently associated higher country-wide per-capita coronavirus mortality. International travel restrictions associated lower per-capita mortality. However, containment measures, testing tracing polices, amount viral testing statistically significant predictors country-wide coronavirus mortality, controlling predictors. contrast, societal norms government policies supporting mask-wearing public independently associated lower per-capita mortality COVID-19. use masks public important readily modifiable public health measure. Pls vote americans. world watching. beyond that, President actually said quoted. FAKE NEWS??? tell right someone mentioned definitely social distancing taking precautions. I'm surprised one particular person catching it. lamen next hymen.


Alright, admit journalistic prestige NFL fan site devoted reporting players' Tweets probably terribly high. ;) miss Bush detest man, taking things context right. however stretching facts regarding testing. USA currently 28th list tests per million population.  shoes, shirts, mask, service. hard? novel way get zero cases! People like suck. what's goal attacking here? UKs are? superiority complex white folks always incredible definition businessman, ignore problem say problem See exact problem. context. context incorrect doesnt make better.

This post literally saying ‚ÄúTrump thinks virus go away stop testing‚Äù.

And that‚Äôs saying.

What saying (incorrectly) exactly laid out.

But thats Im arguing. Im arguing headline making people believe meant one thing actually meant another. actually meant still incorrect doesn‚Äôt make headline less clickbait misleading. help skeptics take mask soon sit down. guy dumb box rocks. Damn one unstable. Learn read, jerk. Also, everyone stop taking pregnancy tests - many damn people world fair enough right here. Chinese American here, US really move trying blame countries stubbornness. I've seen Facebook groups dedicated get rid masks, refusing get vaccinated, even claiming virus created shadowy organizations. needs stop all. US needs get educated! Unfortunately alot people seem get that. seems like places opened early cases started really picking last week. People saying okay deaths still low peole die immediately. Unfortunately time deaths go virus spread pretty deep community. frustrating! right. experienced thing changed another pharmacy. shit, kidding me? üôÑ NASCAR riding high late 90s Dale Jr. prime.

Then screwed championship system fell back square one.

Now literally game town, making headlines social progress.

And oh look another giant mistake. Well fellow one piece fan, let know stance civilized discussion it. go around trying make look like machine. New Zealand's effort worth particular praise they're island. Vietnam wins COVID Olympics. However still possible New Zealand eventually screw up, let single COVID patient pandemic start again.  Absolutely true don‚Äôt know right wasn‚Äôt. 
And many unknowns early on. can‚Äôt directly translated next pandemic. 
Lockdown bit extreme measure take. Sweden it, set precautions early on, stopping sporting events concerts telling people keep distance wash hands, Swedish people high level trust government, many actually listened. Even though allowed remain open, many bars restaurants Sweden shot people stopped going out.

But luck also part it. virus came Southern Europe first thrived ski resorts returning ski tourists brought them. simple fact hearing cases Italy could potentially lead least people starting taking precautions. 
So many factors üò¥ Isolation technology era completely sustainable. never even remotely close sustainable right now. Now, shutting economy indefinitely sustainable. comment specifically people let children play without concern virus far shown adverse effects kids. saying basing gut feel, science believe science yet. kids ruined play kids sometime next year? Debatable. good sure, plenty kids fine periods isolation children. bet kid thought shit pants, one would ever know. really saying something.

edit point out, FUCKING making point stop testing we'd lower cases compared countries, context matters friend...

No, ""lower cases."" We'd lower known cases, good way, shape, form. statement FUCKING STUPID matter meant literally, figuratively, way. Stupid. letting people in...Of course didn‚Äôt last long, least people entering quarantine. Well see lied good intention. happy little accident believed caught virus wearing masks. Kick rocks china bot sex city.

r/ItsALWAYSReal Aren‚Äôt private industry? Seriously. It‚Äôs fairly common multinational multi state corporations take company wide stance restrictive states policies. one state mandate wearing masks, every airline business require it. airport traffic ny, la, wherever it‚Äôs enough require it. get disease eating virus. Virus survive stomach acids. definitely possibility. http://www.sccdc.cn/View.aspx?id=20925

A passenger Beijing, flight HU7147. husband got confirmed positive Beijing went get checked confirmed positive too. 111 close contacts Sichuan quarantine. Wait till find they‚Äôre pumping exhaust air competition next door. Lol. many folks floating around like me? idea 3 auto-immune diseases January? know therapist see patient's time deferred healthcare due money time idea high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol. fairly certain anyone 40 chance idea ""underlying"" condition there's new candidate president? 2020 Captain Obvious. Keep America Redundant Well 7k first week June 6k last week. I‚Äôm fear mongering much speaking irreverently. 

Even people downvoting commenting opposition also acknowledging likely hood numbers rising again.

The rate currently down/flattening product measures taken March, April part May. we‚Äôre seeing increase cases due reopening. Given latency exponential spread lets revisit conversation end August see 200k conservative number not. Airplane air filtered hospital-grade air filters every 2 minutes. Unless sitting next positive case probably get plane part lung damage authors also conclude absence symptoms may imply absence harm. CT scans conducted 54 percent 76 asymptomatic individuals Diamond Princess cruise ship, appear show significant subclinical lung abnormalities raising possibility SARS-CoV-2 infection impacting lung function might immediately apparent. *The scientists say research needed confirm potential significance finding.*

But thought bit prisoners even interesting - behavioral scientist Daniel Oran, Topol collected information testing studies 16 diverse cohorts around world. datasets‚Äîgathered via keyword searches PubMed, bioRxiv medRxiv, well Google searches relevant news reports‚Äîincluded data nursing home residents, cruise ship passengers, prison inmates various groups.  virtually common large proportion infected individuals symptoms,‚Äù says Oran. ‚Äú*Among 3,000 prison inmates four states tested positive coronavirus, figure astronomical: 96 percent asymptomatic.*‚Äù correct. government oversight messaging much complex public understand. Even places government stated wear masks them, people still blaming government dismissing mask usage. getting people understand medical workers need masks incredibly difficult.

People wearing legit masks even laws place it. going make masks government told make masks. 

There consequences saying that. One consequence downplay severity pandemic. pandemic thwarted make-shift face masks, pandemic tanked ignored.

That specifically messaging governments wanted avoid. counteracts important measures need taken. change messaging later enough resources allow it.

Right changed messaging, still resources it, surprisingly, people still wearing masks even laws changed messaging,

TLDR: mattered said ""make masks"", nobody would have, would worked important measures. course they‚Äôre lying. That‚Äôs world calling out. illustrated article quoted. LMAO R.I.P. That's honestly ""doing can"". could lot more.

I actually went one SoCal Indian casinos couple hours day. Yes, fully expect downvotes this. stayed couple minutes things described!

While I'm definitely planning returning least another weeks (and possibly far longer cases spike again) honestly felt far safer grocery store say nothing restaurant. 

Masks mandatory took seriously - literally kicking patrons took time took take sip bite something. Smoking longer permitted. Sanitizing wipes provided every bank machines. Screens cashiers table games. 1/3 slots operational meaning times possibly social distancing walking past someone, never seated. chance get full context? I'm open working. could point study controls timing, uses reasonable doses, accept that. Protesting hundreds thousands worst pandemic anyone alive seen. 
SMORT think Cuomo may right idea: monitor compliance credibly threaten new lockdown enough folks comply. Peer pressure able rest. fucking guy lol  Jesus Christ lengths go defend moron human piece shit embarrassing fuck you. heat, generally speaking, kills kind virus. typically go away April. totally sure know theory oh **not** claiming anything USA testing compares nations? even though that's entire point contention discussion? hmmmmmmmm.....ok  hikacking science medicine sake politics.

Like lied effectiveness masks, started pushing drug cure downvotes evidence.

Bullshit excuse play victim. arguing means tests that‚Äôs many cases, data. 

[‚ÄúThe overall percentage respiratory specimens testing positive SARS-CoV-2 increased slightly week 22 (6.0%) week 23 (6.3%) though testing more, seeing higher positive percentage trending upwards. Unfortunately, still handling pandemic horribly. Rugby match ? Asians dont fuck around virus. literally apply logical non central organised group face earth. still exist. Schrodinger's Pandemic. I'm sure right. guess I'm thinking traveling memorial day/beaches opening &amp; cases resulting might make common/important info contact tracing Especially cases showing service industry restaurants bars, etc. Also, I'm assuming protestors downtown lot people work bars. way beyond able track anything. honestly hardest truth world accept. Straight NYT article say revisions unusual. Many countries probably underreporting official tallies infections deaths, part problems testing speed virus overwhelmed public health care systems.


Had China revise number, accuse lying. revised numbers, still accuse lying really matter. whatever, redneck! Well, based we've learnt Donny reckon guys could solve problem ignoring  Virus solved, check ‚úîÔ∏è It‚Äôs people coming in. quarantine. 

It‚Äôs rugby match. 

Stop haters. Way go vietnam still can't believe butter! Testing gone 10 years. dad stage 4 cancer haven‚Äôt seen 3months like use band aid! America tested less they'd cases, Any. words ""If any"" added case last part basically saying they'd zero cases zero testing. So, best, 20% New York City exposed coronavirus, necessarily Covid19. 

Wrong.

A. test may generate false positive variety reasons, that's part test qualifications (specificity, sensitivity) tend 90% (sometimes high 99%)

B. serology tests returned vastly different results hard-hit lightly-impacted areas. So.. clearly measuring covid19 rather say, common cold exposure (which would uniform)

C. 20% antibody positive result obtained *MID APRIL*, number got much higher protests going 18 days. sure abt Oregon ca many videos I‚Äôve seen online protesters wearing masks. believe want win election anymore, perhaps never did. Maybe wanted President long enough rig system enough favor. so? many ways count, here's few.

1. Get rid mandatory health insurance penalty - need offer employees coverage enough pay cover $800 per year. 

2. Tax breaks corporations - help him, family, investments. 

3. Remove environmental protections - hates them, build wherever wants US. 

4. Remove Environmental Impact Studies - again, turn salt marsh wants Trump Branded Luxury Ocean Front Golf Clubs. Oh, also build ocean restraining seawalls high wants to.  

5. Anti-Immigration policies - less Latin &amp; South American employees compete Eastern Europeans &amp; Russians H1-B Visa jobs, Trump believes better mannered, better looking, speak better English. 

You get idea. think, especially COVID-19 circulating now, he'd happy retire, hole palatial bunkers, let someone else fix mess he's made. gets keep Federal healthcare, Secret Service security, whatever government service perks allowed. Oh, gets build whatever, wherever wants - ZERO interest loans. all, he'll get gratify BLAMING SOMEONE ELSE screwed economy resulting inflation road. even Declare Bankruptcy time. Honestly, somber title respectful thing would look name least ask, ""Who Ilhan Omar."" ""I know person,"" ""Who's father?"" unhelpful, topic, therefore deserving downvotes. Come on. healed ‚Äúthoughts prayers‚Äù. also best time attack someone, like know down?

/s issue people would still gone better masks people selfish.  take medicine sick? appendix removed appendicitis? won‚Äôt make feel better since still things wrong world! stubbed toe, might well die I‚Äôll never feel bett... wait it‚Äôs starting feel better already, odd. know person infected, know might infected might died jog conscience. maybe friend family matter. But, people might care infected family friends. case look many sociopathic people living among us. think shall continue living like hermit. Bc Fern Gully stop facerolling.

Every human different. think luck/genetics people even affected much, matter healthy otherwise are. matter luck... like year over, everyone's going forget front-line workers... Unfortunately morons like ones prolong this. There's discovery common steroid help save lives serious condition. 

I think anything going prevent cases soaring across US, there's least small chance death rates high last round. roll model always Herpes. It‚Äôs feisty keeps giving. L AZ seeing huge outbreak then? I‚Äôm sure every video find protestors ‚Äúby large wearing masks‚Äù could find one not. agree fighting, come man lmao right attitude winner. must win hearts minds masses wherever roam. It‚Äôs exactly simple strong weak immune system, system responds. Weird example let‚Äôs say problem groundhogs tearing garden want get rid them, get BB gun shoot little pellets scare them/kill them. strong immune system staying top pests.
Perhaps minimum necessary amount times need fire BB gun clear garden keep groundhogs away. appropriate response. 
But keep firing millions BBs, whole garden covered BBs, plants destroyed can‚Äôt push grow. Maybe keep firing plants make shadows look like groundhogs. immune system stopping it‚Äôs supposed to, instead hurting body supposed protect. 

Older people weaker immune systems, also experienced immune systems variety disease, may mean bodies ‚Äúrecognizing‚Äù threats acting (shooting shadows), whereas younger people haven‚Äôt encountered many diseases don‚Äôt respond much. Maybe. hypothesis. Worldometer lists 18 cases, government website 16 Thanks much info! word taping mean? keep hearing (""they stopped taping""). fair think president learned know pandemic. Also coronavirus even among top ten trending topics twitter anymore. 

/s. last part true unfort. people U.P. Michigan taken seriously despite us rural part state. I‚Äôd estimate mask usage 85% grocery hardware stores I‚Äôve in. Can‚Äôt speak lower peninsula that‚Äôs probably case numbers U.P. exceptionally low (~150 cases 300k population) noting vast majority states reopened without increase hospitalizations mindset, advocate indefinite lockdown, since people inherently die - often times societal interaction? statistics play role policy all? think big waste water washer. want confirm clean mask every shift 

I wash mine soap water sink.. like washing hands. couple masks one drys, grab another. big deal.  Stoopid maybe planned staged reopening decent flattening curve better approach - like places without issue live Canada, area diminshing cases, 1/10 wearing masks here. recommended, prime minister it, lot lose bothering (all gains made locking down!) people just...can't bothered. one best pieces advice Ive seen here. outdoors smaller groups would work better. I've tried look actual data Texas Department State Health Services: test positivity rate 6.62% increased average last two weeks, despite continued increases testing. lowest ever 4% end May.

The case count hospitalizations sharply up. Texas right around 15,000 available hospital beds, 1,675 free ICU beds close 6,000 ventilators. Texas ample time upping capacity resources situation better NY hit once.

All completely world ending worrying. guess across many US states. hope exponential increase maybe linear even sublinear one otherwise....would be....very bad. Lmao shit talking government national past time Facebook. almost say whatever want, don‚Äôt let get far, like incite panic. freely West, saying can‚Äôt say bad thing government flat false. public time. buddy, father died two weeks ago. believe way back test unless fever cough weeks get short breath easily. knows, insurance maybe could find out, oh well! USA USA USA! web.archive.org CDC.gov. 

Btw, water particles 10 microns free float airborne. you‚Äôre going reference science, accurate. There‚Äôs wealth information anyone willing look. get passed govt propaganda, there‚Äôs mountain evidence showing pandemic hoax.  Sounds like scam. UVC light easy create.  Yes, corporate greed produces many evils. Kinh terrorist. anybody got fined posting stuffs Nguyen Quang Thuan fined libel spreading misinformation. fair enough. explains Northeast anywhere else.

IN WI gang-busters opening. rise.

OH, IL, MI also joining rapid re-opening. rise.

MN protests hospitalizations rise. They've fall cliff SINCE protesting started.

Midwest cases pretty consistent decline pretty much mask wearing.

It's Midwest though- Plain states - OK, KS, NE also little mask wearing continued decline.

CO plummeted aggressive re-opening state.

So ""we wear masks"" explain reason states seeing drops little mask wearing.

Outside certain Northeast state's CA probably one mask wearers, first state start lock downs, one slowest re-open. cases declining quickly. mostly rural areas state.

Does anyone reason think otherwise? Like real data shows things absolutely horrific? varies based day. Yesterday saw almost masks worn whatsoever. mean them, face. Yeah, know NC. speak I've seeing Meridian, MS. notice many people wearing masks old.

Fortunately, fast food workers around seem wearing masks. seen one girl wearing right (nose sticking out) McDonalds. doctor put symbicort helped greatly far many children 18 died? 6? wrong Sweden? euthanize elderly like this?

If increase testing increasing denominator equation, increase nominal values confirmed positives. makes sense...test more, find more. expect.

If things control, also expect % positive drop well. Since equation is: (Confirmed Cases/Total Tested)=% positive, testing means start find less population infected.

In states like AZ, AR, SC, even AL, seeing week week rise % positive. states like NC TX seeing stabilization around 6.8% 6.75% (respectively), past 3 days, trending upwards again. months pushing down.

What expect see something like CA, yes, # confirmed cases rising, expected, however, % positive also trending down, currently sitting around 5.3% (It 7% May 1).

Safe say, given 20% women 16 worked 1920 37% 60s, probably lot higher. stay home parents, easier keep kids home parent always watch them. 2012, paltry 29%. families dont anyone stay home.

2. top that, 1968 (again first time recorded), 7% parents unmarried, undoubtedly higher prior that. 2017, 25%. 80% solo parents high school diploma less, group financially probably need work most

We MASSIVE dilemma coming straight us august making mockery every reply, stop I'm trying figure navigate fall year. I'm confused phase reopenings nearly complete reopenings like TX. Cases blasting see people wearing masks, still plenty people wearing anything coronavirus never existed. 

I feel like gov't knows something going let happen...Unless course completely clueless well. ~~Percent total population.~~

~~.001% 328,000,000~~

Am dum dum agree you, I'm sure distinction matters particular case. want make massive conclusions. appears places like TX, AZ, NC, etc simply victim good fortune. 

The virus prevalent states US lock down. may sort delayed inevitable. 


I see zero pattern mask wearing, lock downs, re-openings etc. turns states seeing increase. pattern see states low levels virus start large cities increasing. States low prevalence rural (MT, WY) major city (OK, NE, etc). None states seeing increase appears actually still declining.

Scores states little/no masks wearing rapidly re-opening time scale AZ TX seeing continued declines. Remember fucking packed bars WI court removed governor's limits? cases, deaths, positive rate, hospitalizations declined since then. MN, MO, WI, IN, OH, IA, CO, OK, NE, etc aggressive places like TX honestly probably aggressive AZ turns re-opening. places seeing declines still, massively so. shoot stupid mouth off? wear mom's dirty panties? really can't find pattern states surging decreasing. 

Are good theories what's going on?

Climate, length time since opening up, restrictions place, seems random. Hold pal

We might stupid think ‚ÄúIf die die‚Äù

-Literally coworker saying. hasn‚Äôt changed habits all. going gym, restaurants, family get togethers even Vegas past weekend. also doesn‚Äôt wear mask thinks it‚Äôs time die that‚Äôs God‚Äôs will. Hopefully get anywhere near WW2 deaths (400k).

Meanwhile heat map showing deaths happened date, county:

 animation spread last data driven study

not available tweet/wsj paywall 118, 023 updated today That's cuz restaurants without masks Tbf they‚Äôre probably people biggest kicker audience cases Florida decent. things bad they‚Äôve invited family friends talent come in. bigger joke got first positive testing looking invite friends family week! using developmental talent. adding extra common person nothing enhance viewership add unsafety room. Probably purple filter. unceasing, record increases.  They‚Äôre family, so...

There positive side this; researchers, scientists, epidemiologists, chemists, data engineers et. al. working 24/7 generate vaccine.

As hard is, modern science help us prevail. anyone know best kind face protection wear? I‚Äôm teacher researching best way protect new school year fall. would rather prepared something not. Thank all! second wave inevitable? possibility? opening it. muh freedoms people Michigan pretty quiet right would know possiblity catching major threat people. vast majority people recover COVID caught again. you‚Äôre taking hydroxychloroquine especially you‚Äôre probably already psychotic though worry, it'll get open. studies simply discarded. done place immeasurably small infection, using cheap antibody test tests positive cross-reactivity coronaviruses, highly non-randomized sample people found looking people thought already COVID.

PFR exactly what's useful, judging IFR point get estimate infections.  trying figure IFR successful mitigation scenario old people protected; we'd look Sweden (~0.6-0.8%) Germany (not mitigation, careful elderly, ~0.4-0.6%). consider job leadership? work ups people wearing mask wear chins. Cant blame hard physical labor job need breath. Hard social distance there. ....from media outlet mean risky apparently nicotine helps, could get patches AZ here. horrible. Everyone living life like nothing going on. see people wearing masks occasion go out, much be. Everything operating virus happening. Restaurants open dine-in, gyms open, public facilities parks recreational centers around opened within past week two. ICU beds never maxed out, far aware last time checked slightly 80% capacity, record state. that's todays events, tomorrows, next weeks. Whaddya know, heat kill virus! ""Doooooooooooooomer"". 

It's frustrating people trying constructive conversations. obviously orchestrated campaign. course stay locked forever, we're see happens states throw hands air abandon restrictions simultaneously fudging numbers firing public health experts. It‚Äôs amount ventilation. It‚Äôs also direction air. window blowing fresh air cloud virus around infected person you‚Äôre sitting downwind window blow fresh air infected air you. Given enough time breathe enough virus become infected. Yes, according federal institute health, first app world making use API.

In fact, researchers EPFL used connections Apple Google convince implementing application rather provide developed API. 

[Source (behind paywall Ohio's numbers they've like 3 weeks...  thoroughly trustworthy headline... use prednisone dirt cheap. CFR case fatality rate. It‚Äôs number confirmed cases divided deaths. state play games death numbers let‚Äôs assume deaths accurate sake argument.  people confirmed covid positive lower CFR gets. include people present antibodies (but actively covid positive) increase case number cause presume infected past either asymptomatic tested sick. friend named Felicia take already psychotic also head state? Asking friend. Deep cleaning pre-quarantine level band aid action...classic Best way spread liberal hoax Nurses contact elderly family members regardless do. know fact, saying still thats fault.

I'm looking real solution real timeline, got one ain't playing interim games. need both. Yup, idea sitting metal tube hours hundred people sit well me. won‚Äôt taking flight gone vaccine. Except Lupus neurologist, also STILL LUPUS. ignorant anxious woman asking. Want effexor? Dr: ""I regret inform covid test came back positive.""

Patient: fucking dies Another stupid idea Sweden lol Sarah Cooper amazing job read. clearly stating symptoms common flu declines mild cough(that‚Äôs contagious). 

A mild cough, people cough fuckin‚Äô time whatever reason. gonna tell em ‚ÄòSTAY FUCK HOME‚Äô? Stop fucking obnoxious troll. people opening businesses poured life business. see close lose everything worked for. People risk feel like wrong public free stay home. I'm taking shit People don‚Äôt fucking care. keep making stupid excuses wear masks. Fuck, coworkers hospital refuse wear masks public. People literally think it‚Äôs they‚Äôre free whatever  lol train though staying home sick really nothing COVID, common sense standard world. sick, (cold, flu, etc.) stay home fully recovered, regardless minor symptoms. 

But COVID us, staying home got flu-like symptoms norm. Not, mild symptoms, jump around, care, even flu common cold something else, would intentionally infect people work place commute? Yea, like Tegnell. Oh wait Also, another idea put strong disinfectant water delayed flush time kill much virus possible upon contact flushed air.

I honestly can't buy personal disinfectant more. looked within fifty mile parameter everyone out.

My hospital (employer) disinfectant schedule, combat COVID-19, sanitation staff really concerned. become expensive, too.

I wonder commercial availability disinfectants right now. First world counties work like though. always stay home sick Public transit fixable office extent. reason anyone needs mask transit. Bars nature can't made safe. volunteering I'm sure would. closer people six feet respirator required safe

You‚Äôre lowering chance infection, eliminating it. safe, still risk regardless precautions. Cloth masks go together distancing, respirators don‚Äôt.

Respirators don‚Äôt protect eyes never fitted perfectly. good replacement distancing. Mask also provide protection regardless distance. fit tests surgical masks shown 85% effectiveness blocking particles 10x smaller coronavirus breathed in, cloth masks 12-50% depending material fit. Trust me.. really hope I'm wrong Hospitalizations come later. cringe everytime see someone say something lack hospitalizations going up.

Hospitalizations decent metric beginning testing sites available people needed go hospital get tested. 

If we've learned anything first wave (yeah im calling second wave, comment cause I'm changing view) hospitalizations lag 7-9 days symptom onset, icu admittance around 3 days that.

We using information put measures place hospitalizations start going up. Instead suggesting ignore rising daily cases sit back wait hospitals start overflow. taking action much late, surely strain hospitals. What's point study? 2 months really tell us anything long-term immunity creates confusion. operating established immunity continue work potential treatments vaccines real, long-term studies completed useful information. Almost quarter miami alone, crazy  Keep closed till new year. dont want border open. Even cases lower, dont trust erratic leadership cause damage spikes would bleed here. Keep border closed. Isn‚Äôt news since february? mutated came Europe. much infectious anyway? Since spread World, seemed insanely infectious. Hand blowers thing never existed. go doctors likely believed, treated harshly less thorough treatment.

Really? study that? think statement would hard prove. mask help, mask everybody will. Viral infection severity follows dose-response curve. greatly reduce number viral particles inhaled, greatly reduce severity subsequent illness. could still infected, may never know it. body fight virus chance double enough times actually make feel sick cause real damage. Masks-for-all protects everybody especially cramped indoor situations. also protects 90% people want get sick 10% people care. mean, he's apparently using look him, made way stairs day spill water podium. obviously miracle drug. 

(I know he's probably taking it) news bad. Suspected cases hospitals bit cases hospitals coming across border. However, cannot fully account recent uptick hospitalizations. 

There two dozen counties without hospitalizations several one few. 

SoCal different story: Many counties around LA approaching LA levels. Imperial Kings actually higher, probably due outbreaks among farm workers. badly need regional mask requirement, state government left counties, disaster.

Seven day rolling average case numbers CA time high. Positive test rate decreasing much hope increased testing. Deaths holding steady, peak numbers. say scientists. Try read carefully. scientists certainly lied. Whether political debatable. thats awesome yall cali get tested whenever like that. shit, us florida much..... obviously lol. anecdotally know ppl denied trying get test. much money keeping us path relatively ineffective meds.  misleading headline Independent!? Never! /s IF(speculation here) lot outbreaks factories, meat packing plants, slaughter houses, workplaces general, could they're picking lot asymptomatic cases would otherwise go undetected. OK one county(Texas) around 700 cases 6 deaths, OKC 1600 cases 66 deaths. Reason disparity outbreak meat packing plant Texas County. tested entire plant, lot otherwise asymptomatic/lightly symptomatic people showed statistics. already killed 0.24% New Yorkers. least. Even extra history mentioned Spanish flu series that‚Äôs things haven‚Äôt improved yet... Blood hands Correct. comeback numbers. live antecdotes. So, intended communicate study shows necessarily correct assume infection =/= ideal immunity. mean infer presented data specifically challenged antibody duration - reread comment replace long-lasting 'ideal' think understand message intended convey - rereading comment fully see could read way understand error lies imprecise use language. That's bad. I'm working I'll edit get chance.

Also wanted note - since microneutralization confirms serologic test, since many participants swabbed study also past samples analyzed CDC investigation, snapshot sample significantly reliable acontextual single sampling (particularly regarding sensitivity concerns). 382 bad amount data collected context - though lament missed opportunity gather data entire crew.  I've going bars standing patio friends. done anything inside yet  !Remind 1 month goes back whole wash hands rush start combined downplaying masks. starting think Americans understand respiratory infections spread.  sure downvoted. listened Willie interview month ago said Scarface ""dealing medical issues already (Covid) exacerbated things"". also know Covid 100% blame kidney failure ""it help"" Murica isnt everywhere else... really difficult. hope masks distancing! hope responsible employer!

My husband forced go back work despite job done remotely (and done remotely three months). 

I understand companies want risk people's health avoidable. Millennials cancel culture. cancel coronavirus? Selfish, spoiled brats. That's concerning fall family unfriended ke much downer virus but....

where fuck room positivity shit?

so fuck family glad alone concept time...  shocked 2 weeks.

Remindme! 2 weeks Immune disease sufferer here, also, steroids bad stuff me. Psychosis, blisters body throat, sweating sheets mattress topper mattress, that's side effects. Plus, long term use particularly good us. area miracle drug some, others not-so-much. Tried acthar gel recently, much better luck side effect-wise, longer lasting reprieve flare symptoms. No.

But [this off-limits unless live side connects island. American get across it. Unless company makes customer wear mask there's literally point. Like employee Jenny started giving blow jobs every one happy nowadays. work getting things control let one exposed roam around bars club shopping malls mostly indoor places AC hot hell AZ ? army right. late. South Korea contact tracing %of positive tests 1%. 
And need 3 times tracers one already trace 500 day. Money shouldn‚Äôt problem first economy world greatest country earth. tiny underdeveloped country 100 million people it...Vietnam. 
Lockdowns economy mha freedom.
Masks don‚Äôt know one uses masks AZ. 
Contact tracing no, need many people, costs much privacy( google Facebook Apple trace every single minute day)
I guess solution ‚Äúif don‚Äôt test would cases, any‚Äù 
Let‚Äôs hospitals fill something worked well learned that... win trip company hitting certain sales goal still need claim trip income earned, therefore taxed. one wearing masks bars lol prefer Gregory Abbott mild 80s fame super sexy song, ‚ÄúShake Down.‚Äù -_- live chicago I'm kinda concerned especially protests packed lakes could regional, area (so. cali) anybody could get test w/o referral w/o symptoms. case least month longer. got test (no symptoms) 2.5 weeks ago, go back office extended period time wanted make sure wasnt sick. dont like politics dislike person feel sorry loss states I've tax food, gum soda pop taxed. Wait what? want say nice joke I'm sure... literally that. scientific study. said previously, steroids due brain tumours. [This happened not?  here. MS sucks! aunt chrones, prednisone 30 years!!! fucked skeletal system fake shoulder prescribed fentanyl patches! sounds like retired surgeon, despite suffering dementia, ball people caring him. American left right dumb fuck.

There is. returning work tested employers. Updated thanks Can't handle anything outside group think stop that! LOL. must state north. One reason I, 8 months pregnant, go anywhere. can't imagine using public restroom right bladder currently used punching bag. GREAT news flair? Count in!  let basic incubation data obfuscate totally edgy unoriginal political point. sausage fingers make hard type? agree. Two weeks initial cases seen symptoms. Delays testing combined fact infected need two additional weeks coming contact initial infected person, indicates it'll wake 3 4 weeks see actual boom. Possibly longer. 3 weeks since protest started. think within 7 days start seeing true impact protesters

Most cases see today Memorial Day. imagine takes 3 4 weeks see spikes ""super"" spreader"" events.

And course, see spikes, states open going help spread virus since good sample size infected mass funeral pyres new Burning Man? Floridians checking in... send help can't come soon enough. would make sense I'm surprised even able say no. Given fact hes got mouthful toadstool. Yea, dont let us in, save hypothetical involved woman zero ability survive without 24/7 medical attention - point kept alive kick grief road sake living, expense.

I think save people locking elderly immunocompromised allowing everyone else go business. Literally every strategy results death demographics since virus inevitable. Hey ;) got played media. Zpack antibiotics microcosm society. 

This administration emboldened variety forms stupidity. COVID perfect storm expose paradigm. It‚Äôs somewhat eye opening ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù people act differently today 500, 1000, 10000 years ago. confronted problem don‚Äôt quite understand, pray, objectify release anger frustration something totally unrelated problem. 

They performed human sacrifices combat drought

They burned ‚Äúwitches‚Äù combat sickness. 

They topple communication towers end pandemic. eh, maybe this: [""there slavery awesome journalism thank one border open other? Well see tested good long period time sudden today tested positive. Yea, Chicago going lockdown soon. lol masks thing legit months ago. ""you'll touch face more. actually likely get mask on"". God Americans fucking stupid  makes wonder government quick put militarized police effect protests. dry run sorts? Done what? little crusade pointless. unsub cant handle it. assume I'm American? Read local obituaries look obituaries funeral homes. give idea local death. I've personally seen huge uptick area. watching next door neighbor died... looked obituary realized looking local obituaries regular basis pretty good measure things handled. would fine protections employees want expose strictly enforcing capacity limits measures. That's thing too, know reopen. northeast showing right now. Masks indoors, masks within 6 ft someone prolonged period time, general social distancing.

You still hang friends, sorts outdoor activities, seems even protest. Translation: REEEEEEEEEE Man people TERRIBLE pritzker made decisions based data people‚Äôs feelings paid off. non-professional thought spend 15 minutes inhaling exhaling air someone carrier, good enough time virus pass on. doesn‚Äôt matter much touched physically not, share space long enough. dined restaurant last week. We've mostly patio started eating last week eat inside. 6 tables time. That's really right now.

The world needs adapt moving much stuff outside possible decreasing group size.

If go back normal September things gonna get bad ICU patients gone according link guy called troll blatantly lie mislead minimize dangers? so, quote where? missed that. they'll back open another week. Because... Florida? ""No one told us would happen!"" Thanks information. looks much reasonable now. glad parents drove things low WA state dying down. left several weeks ago, we're hanging low case county.

They two confirmed cases gated community, one death left. position old people die fun.

I understand position now. rest window dressing. CDC report USS Roosevelt handful presumed reinfections. well South Korean study walked back due type PCR test used. US see 37 million confirmed cases covid. government expecting US see 37 million cases covid.

It irresponsible assume day must equal amount new infections reach said number. beautiful thing exponential growth cases compound. taking said above, people tested positive, giving ample chance spread new people.

You seem like new since seem lacking knowledge impact virus day. recommend links start reading hopefully make informed argument next time. Let know! why? would help United States. people elected business. Misleading wonder bars start closing outbreaks. also wonder businesses start getting lawsuits making establishments safe/clean enough. feel like interpret like this. Arizona f\*cked..... Well, yea.

We done Finland.

Go compare results whole thing funny because...how effective assume vaccine even ? Maybe 33% lucky? getting one new school vaccines reprogram DNA, rather ole guess strain game. news March. Turns right, also undercounting deaths.

Again, serology mortality data NYC, Bergamo, Spain, Belgium, NL, UK paint identical pictures 1-1.5% IFR far. better going forward. claim better point supported facts.

There one thing simple assessment ignored, though: deaths today, means counting infections would ~3 weeks ago. number infected today certainly higher (and number infected time get vaccine certainly higher still). [Example article state New Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs warning came state officials touted minuscule rate new positive virus cases New York ‚Äî **just 1 percent 56,000 tests conducted Sunday**, according governor ‚Äî states grappled surges infections. wondering, planning stay vaccine readily available?

There's many ways live normal life without living ""normally"" also increasing risk much July? like next week. dont get you? Covid test considered reason someone discharged dont corona came inot contact it. intubation NOTHING corona! probably precaution hospital protocol. died something else corona. current symptoms high blood pressure headache. sure even tested covid19 based that?

I doubt sick time. Could original virus shedding dead virus reactivated give covid symptoms become contagious. 

It says nothing negative test Feb June develop antibodies donated plasma assume covid19 negative test donating plasma. know long natural immunity lasts. Vaccinate anyway. shared news link town facebook page comments basically : "" MASKS WORK GONNA SUFFOCATE!"" "" family gonna cuz (random reason dumb)."" sigh.... mind broken. saw sepsis read stepsis. Help. Yes, also flight March 20th, nurse died April 20th. sad story completely different era deal virus now. Well, case pot calling kettle black Vaccine come yet? go let us want live lives, live them. Nobodies lives sacrificed. 1 every 100 people less contract virus die, people deathbed anyways. Seems like pretty good odds me, good enough let rest us whatever fuck want without scolded doomers. Oh wow, definitely testing enough.

Positive rate 5% less testing enough. broke lease moved valley crap. live see majority without masks clueless distancing, problem. 

People legit delusional continuing reopening process. fair comment, northeast issues Black people wearings masks. higher test rates.

S/ Could still dead lung cells? Virus mutating? ‚ÄúGuilt-pushing‚Äù - completely utterly accurate term 2,392 cases population 7.3 million means 0.03% Arizonans tested positive today. test positivity like likely undercounting cases least factor 10. Considering around 10-14 day infectious period would estimate 2-5% Arizona residents currently infectious (or rise level soon since positive tests shot recently). Remember state lockdown least according reports masks. completely agree Arizona eventually become next part country overwhelm morgues like NYC did. yeah, dont seem ""be together"" front. putting tin foil hat here, maybe government workers want massive testing, afraid outcome. Almost like young people next 0 chance dying. lower chance dying covid dying car crash. would care it. That‚Äôs CFR. IFR .2% 1%. Given vaccine human trials months, tell immunity last year? Sounds like created hypothetical situation discussion legalizing euthanasia rather criminalizing dining out. Fuck no. false positive. Think many people tested already virus. I'll assume low estimate 10,000. false positive rate 1%, would expect 100 false positives sample. thing injections? 

I get spinal nerve blocks (marcaine + steroid) every months (with 2 year break cycles) 5 6 years. little less two dozen injections time IIRC. Deaths lag behind new cases.... Ugh üòî b4 took drugs get downvoted oblivion, meant put /s right? 

It sucks joke here, do. know United States, government murders black people streets, often times shooting back?

But black people? many unarmed people inside US boarder shot poilce compared population. know United States 6% worlds population, 25% worlds prisoners? made statement CCP, you‚Äôd upset know prisoners United States used cheap labor corporations? Another statement made China, would upset with.

No major Flaw Criminal justice system, alot bullshit war drugs disgusting. need change thank god 1st Amendement critizie state fucked things do. understand things you‚Äôve learned western media

Where getting media know yesterday okay majority state‚Äôs fire someone born transgender gay? US must evil right ?

And people rights CCP this? make reforms country. untill 1960s crim crow real disgusting. grown leaps bound parents life time. 


Would feel safe standing street corner China saying negative things country? gay would move improve civil liberties. black? refer people chin breathers, since that's decided mask belongs. Ditto necklace folks neck breathers.  It‚Äôs nice theory, assume always true. need keep equality forefront people‚Äôs minds culture right isn‚Äôt true used be. Cite CDC reference please.

We always social groups out. racism, think far future less pervasive, take long time get there. 

Right still enough cultural diffusion (melting pot) going right end within lifetime. However, internet allowed people exposed cultures people without even leave home. people, regardless culture, want live let live - that's it. minority nutters cause misery problems, want beliefs accepted accepting others are.

Anyway, that's two cents. talking treatment whereas Trump taking prophylaxis India's ICMR treating same. keep blaming another kindergarten Time US company create molecule like different enough patent, get deal us government sole supplier covid patients, riase price 40,000%.

Theres nowhere else go total bullshit. enforce this, like enforce limited seating. acutally bothered reading one reports ages. interesting check back though. highlights:

1. recommendations deal COVID clearly ""Test, Trace, Isolate"" conjunction sustainable NPIs. search page ""a robust monitoring framework"" read propsed work. 

2. One things like others, sadly. maps/charts (Fig. 2-5), various metrics, Sweden stands country Europe worst *ongoing* problem. Yes, countries may still hit harder overall metrics, Sweden still either one red red nowadays. report countries reporting current 14-day incidence 20 cases per 100 000 population. two countries (Portugal United Kingdom) current 14-day incidence remains rate 20 100 cases per 100 000 population. one country (Sweden) current 14-day incidence 100 cases per 100 000 population.

The countries coming close problems Sweden still Poland metrics Spain one. 

3. GREAT overview table prevalence disease various countries reported serological surveys. Search page for: ""Change 14-day incidence reported COVID-19 cases/100 000 population"". child. Got em seems different. thinking opposite - flattening curve might cause virus circulate infinitely. finding support idea get infected once, immune time, attempt eliminate population? Life, liberty pursuit happiness. Life comes first that‚Äôs coincidence. comment add anything surely either. make fun typo. Surely comment complaining comment adds nothing mine did. least actually grievance: bad faith quips employed avoid addressing real points detrimental healthy discourse.

In come across victim blaming? say anything kidney functions? sure read everything carefully? depends packed outdoor area is. major outbreak Madrid caused outdoor feminist manifestation... I'm infected can't warn others me, right?

So need app, I'm infected, right?

Otherwise understand concept, commute week week entire city, would range hundreds thousands people. case would get ill get positive tested corona, everybody thousands people range last couple weeks would get contact warning? Scare tactics love stories like seriously doubt think ""crawling tooth nail"" playing Warhammer would definition most... agree 100%. talking Ivermectin month ago.

Realistically, means one's odds surviving little better (maybe significantly better, even). Still mean people ignoring virus. Haha, figured that‚Äôs something could agree on. Peace well Read article. COVID directly affects kidney function, so.. doubtful Go comment subs related games cosplay. That's worth. API used exposure notification API, developed cooperation google apple. Here‚Äôs source code google‚Äôs study done 16 people, mention underlying health conditions talks lung abnormalities long term issues. 

If I‚Äôm wrong apologise, appears another fear mongering article read actual study. Literally 50,000+ people died rapid recovery. Hope worth it? would take look ignorante bonobo 30-40 year olds taking delivery spots month advance really bothered me. tell lot society treat elderly, apparently lot society trash. even now, information, still haven‚Äôt come service risk get things need, effective strategy quarantine (not lock ) Oh look 5G person, take meds. made people think bars good idea *in first place*?!?

Thank you! Good them. Avermectins problem pretty much every situation apart COVID, media seeks incredibly rare situations/problems makes seem commonplace, blowing like affecting lives thousands millions really less percent percent, etc. good report truth, reporting creates distorted view world, effectively using truth tell lies. better ways convey kind information, that's make $$$ get people fired vote. Hey, found trumper, how's preventive bleach injection going you? Feel free elaborate different types Parkinsons, drugs, etc brought up. like comment responding did. Yeah remember said 60k total? passed like two weeks later? amount testing also increased significantly. June 4th, Texas 3x (1.2m) amount testing done May 4th (400k).

More testing = cases. NZ position stay isolated. produce essentials, viable strategy them. open trade nations managed pandemic well. highlights article. world simply getting better treating COVID19. cut risk death third patients ventilators. oxygen, cut deaths fifth.  drug used treat patients UK start pandemic, 5,000 lives could saved, researchers Chief investigator Prof Peter Horby said: ""This drug far shown reduce mortality - reduces significantly. major breakthrough."" clear, clear benefit. treatment 10 days dexamethasone costs ¬£5 per patient. essentially costs ¬£35 save life. drug globally available.""

Getting Twatter best thing did. Reddit tailored feed stay heck 'news' 'popular' homepage. keep date weather COVID-19. I've felt million times better since so. Let fix that, America *this* bad Science amazing. People authoritarians lame. authoritarians trying claim dominion science. People looking suburbs, that's expensive shit many places unless want drive hour way. want feel superior. People would comment thing Trump. see time sub.

Well games start coming stop coming literal, simple Google search would give sources. I'm citing new groundbreaking info here, fairly well known. like asymptomatic transmission, mainstream information. Heck, posted sub dozen times. Especially diamond princess study. 

People minimal research asking others sources. Otherwise shows lazy mind wasting people's time. obscure and/or new studies mind linking expecting link something that's news since March infuriating. 

Oh, guy also called liar yeah, gotta lecture understand angle. Florida seen spike virus cases since start June. DOH reported highest daily increase new cases Saturday, 2,581 additional diagnoses confirmed. figure surpassed previous highs reported last Thursday Friday. Sunday's latest report showed slight decrease new cases, 2,016, compared Saturday's data. However, Sunday's figure showed increase higher daily increases reported Saturday. Yeaaaaah.... riiiiiight..... people like good news sub.  W shaped recovery come! can, want to, complain time. makes feel powerful special, especially ‚Äúpeople‚Äù respond. also said 19 20 patients coronavirus recover without admitted hospital

That‚Äôs huge too. Probably even bigger. 15 min test. Positive. Get someone pharmacy get prescription. course did. Right? Worst part is, knew sickening/killing people washing hands, persisted nonetheless! grody. course can't find source read this, apparently covid-19 reduces body's ability produce interferons, proteins inhibit viral replication. paper read suspects sometimes take couple months completely clear virus.  Even 20mg-40mg short duration bad. danger steroid use used long terms months years. took *statistically* significant decrease... I'm sure that's actually going  Steroids typically reduce immune system. autoimmune conditions, effectively steroids efficacious.

Do steroids address cytokine storm? Neck maskers?  Lol comment literally first response followed first response you. dumb be? clients repeatedly tell hoax hurt Donald Trump, still today. Science really new religion actually link BLM protests increase Covid19 cases anywhere across US.

2 things:

* link opening protests &amp; Covid-19?

* protests begin around May 29, thus putting 3 week timeline, possibly start seeing ""spike"" Friday, June 19. I'm willing bet best shown North / Northeastern states cities like NYC, Chicago, Minneapolis, Philadelphia heck even like DC cities downwards trending positive test rates despite massive saw largest protests all, 10s thousands close proximity even nudge nearly 3 weeks later.

You protest Streets, open restaurant seats Pretty sure lift water bottle lips one hand downvoted? Lol ok bud, fun that. full quarantined mid February. trump closed borders end janurary. 

Stop spreading misinformation. died disappointed her. I‚Äôd argue opposite. Open anonymous social media much better open non anonymous. knocking Olympic level athletes flat back. healthy guarantee kill damage you, especially comes things like cytokine storms. think bullying Islamophobic roots. said, rather antisemitic. found want point tweet 2012, tweeted ‚ÄúIsrael hypnotized world, may Allah awaken people help see evil doings Israel.‚Äù tweet implied Israel supporters secretly tricking world supporting it, longtime anti-Semitic trope Omar apologized taking office January.

She apologize, think still holds antisemitic beliefs. Like... Even giving benefit doubt... took one complex conflicts modern world said reason people support country Israeli-Pakistani conflict they've tricked people there. That's... gutsy. 

Now, deserve negative attention given. think that's visibly one minority. said, think free controversy. would definitely raise eyebrow Republican talked Palestine hypnotized people supporting them. victim perfect innocent still victim.  dumb insults mean anything me. bitch ruining people‚Äôs lives daily.

Here's repo: yet Asia, Europe America, seems one winning war. Brits popular this... bizarre saw jogging Topeka canyon day Depends much move goal posts. approximately 3 weeks protests median incubation period 5-6 days.

Not single cluster across United States traces back outdoor protest despite tightly packed thousands.

This best shown North / Northeastern states cities like NYC, Chicago, Minneapolis, Philadelphia heck even like DC cities downwards trending positive test rates despite massive protests.

NYC saw largest protests all, 10s thousands close proximity even nudge nearly 3 weeks later. We've made mistake before. first thought thumbnail pic chicken nuggets. misread ""suggests"" ""nuggets"" second thought covid spreading chicken nuggets. Glad wrong time. Omar... rot hell. shit. Yet another day pointless posts subject. Hm reduces viral load gets people hospitals quickly Remember still spreads much easily flu. Reducing IFR helps, flu spread asymptomatic. combination reduction new cases along better outcomes case would best. Honestly weird saw jogging Topeka canyon day (all credit Tosh.0 joke) Twitter fun take seriously.

It used hiding place people express freely without society judgment turns propaganda tool. all, get credit playing easy mode blaming leaders crisis. ask drumph 2 weeks Happy hear nature inflicts consequences!! Since one else has. Took risk. Rolled dice. Sucks them! 2 weeks ""new Zealand immune"" narrative begins crack dry plague. already out.. similar test. Source took it. sook dont ya You‚Äôre fool work well enough, original antigenic sin could prevent better vaccine working better given. see taco stands. everyone wearing mask, social distancing, crowding around sauces, everyone touching everything, food. :( I'm confirmed lockdown skeptic. masks airplane brainer. could airline insist masks throughout duration flight? Yeah shit. people want go back work Hello person different viewpoints still good human being. *waves*  Nashville, masks used. basically hung CDC recommendations businesses doors went back business usual  Jobs magically coming back without demand small business.

With rent eviction paused forgiven bloodletting merely delayed. one looking forward coming zombies horrific. I‚Äôm going tell everyone garden club tomorrow abhorrent behavior. Apparently Grindr‚Äôs still robust market place happening... (so I‚Äôve heard) could probably find kind soul grindr who'd willing help person. 10% death rate?? That‚Äôs patently false dude. Also lol entire country definitely staying home much possible. Go outside get fresh air. mask course spike San Diego's South County literally people live Mexico use friend/relative's US home address convenience official paperwork. (Same spike Imperial County.)

The situation across border Tijuana (and Mecicali) truly desperate moment weeks, hospitals overrun, medical staff  direly lacking PPE people literally dying lack ventilators.

If US citizen Covid-19, course rather take chances CA, especially US health insurance.

 blame people all, muddy numbers entire region, patients Impetial County sent far away Irvine Riverside. like vaccines?   Really doesnt matter, crowding close quarters negate large portion risk mitigated wearing one.

I understand getting this. Crowding close quarters still put serious risk infection, even wearing masks. ""6 feet apart"" rule exists. Also, seen many videos protests people *aren't* wearing masks. 

What Trump terrible inexcusable violating social distancing guidelines. goes you. Many thousands die this. yeah nah Happy Cake Day!!...and upvoteüëçüëç That's way. Hospitalizations trending Alabama. I‚Äôm simple man. see joke Ohio State, upvote. Context: Union County far east state, 25k people. 

This one church gathering hit hard. Hard enough still testing see cases.

Not good. . theory could transmitted cold chain logistics. virus went dormant survived due low temperature. imported cases. track trace contacts fine. need panic yet unless case pops unknown origin. thinking CDC (the organization said, ""hey, wear masks""), see need caps it...?

Most news get news organizations United States paid advertisers.¬† U.S. tradition advertisers pay news content dates¬† way back nineteenth century, time many competing newspapers largest cities.¬† Newspapers trying capture attention people growing urban areas, many could afford pay much newspaper.¬† Advertisers, wanted reach people potential consumers products, found newspapers perfect place showcase products print ads, invested lot money publishing paper, keeping cost paper low readers.¬†

Advertisers pay great deal money air commercials news programs stations carry news, way many news producers see it, producing news designed, ultimately, capture audience deliver advertisers. ¬†
Because advertisers paying news produced commercial media, sometimes conflicts come gatekeepers, deciding become day‚Äôs news, advertisers, paying it.¬† example, television news program paid for, part, big grocery story chain airing lots commercials news program, news line-up one night includes story big problems grocery story, store might threaten pull advertising news program unless station decides drop story.¬† instance like that, station‚Äôs gatekeepers decide whether want serve public information grocery store, risk losing profit, drop story public doesn‚Äôt find it, lose advertising profit. ¬† sorts conflicts come commercial television, radio, print media time rely advertising pay news content.¬†

..Those companies started losing money actual products shutdown. abundant super cheap generic drug. put past pharma awful, think price likely change much. I'm guessing want locked long ""Stockholm Syndrome"". #pun Yes, fine line walk - using one small piece broader strategy good. Relying way bad. I'm sure guy rest unseen heroes chopping block layoffs occur due finances caused pandemic.

Well, there's airline that's uniquely qualified beat people drag airplanes, United. 1 5 age brackets within 1% number, goes almost 50%. 

Everybody see wearing mask around benefit, theirs. Without mask, pandemic never really go away infects everybody, killing millions. 

You really bit compassionate, part make sure people vulnerable protected. 

If everybody wears mask, curve flattens weeks rather years. I‚Äôm Singapore, 8 week lockdown, it‚Äôs reopening Friday. 

I yet see single person going around outside without mask, people understand value working together society greater good. I‚Äôm exaggerating say seen 0 people without mask, leave house almost daily get groceries/other stuff lockdown wasn‚Äôt full-fledged countries. 

Wearing mask half hour go grocery shopping hardly going ruin life. You‚Äôre choosing dick, doubt you‚Äôd cavalier somebody infected chose deliberately cough face. situation you‚Äôd suddenly forget ‚Äòevery man woman ‚Äô nonsense. reddit mistake? someone live states, weirdest thing restaurants apparently parking lots Great post! immediately signed donate first time years (something 'keep meaning' do) ""Some people want watch world burn "". Impossible office making go back work soon, 2 hours parents place. something magical, found giving steroids seriously ill patients help recovery rate. Still good find, articles play like magic new stuff cure virus. Correct. degree earned. black people asking opportunity. accidentally correct this.

Yet still misinterpret it. Black people asking equal opportunity, demanded, received, fight UNEQUAL opportunity; places upheld, others AA. one denies this, you? Blacks still get preferential treatment government contracting via MBE - racism, period. AA MBE recipients shit Black people suffered racism oppression started civil rights movement push forward rights minorities.

So what? makes giving daughter Northern NJ doctor lawyer extra 400 SATs push (now kinda lame) Ivy expense first gen son N NJ asian refugee scored 390 better? Yep - support, 'muh oppression.' fucking Helping black students hurt you, levels playing field. persecution complex overblown. Like everything done help others something taken you, something entitled to. 

Doesn't hurt? think college expensive, part? kids belong there, paying (so large part). Moreover, kids placed better schools caused interesting side effect - today, 25% 4-year college classes US remedial level, 60% black kids take them. So, basically created colleges within colleges kids simply say ""I went Syracuse."" think pays - hint: families kids need remedial services, oh hell, I'll tell large part.

Here's tragic part, say pay 'in large part,' consider many kids take student loans. Granted 6-figure, life altering loans, white counterparts often take whitey ain't getting grants schollies blacks get, still many insignificant. these, black kids loans, default rate higher everyone else. get redesigned loans extended terms, etc, pay too. misquote me, many black kids deserve good better students others - kids, though, always getting free rides best schools 'optics.' gifted black kids going college money - zero, 40 years, least. Yet none costs black community dime, believe entitled it, people minorities suffered.

Everyone has. Thing is, US, none kids applying AA people applying MBE either. ride 'muh oppression' 60s whenever ever, vast majority pain suffering blacks endure since hands I'm pushing equality outcome opportunity. 

AA MBE rest equality opportunity, tipping scales favor later stated supported push open country. Perhaps honest nuanced reply would make seem less dishonest opinions outrage.

I'm sure confusion is, unless sit around watch cable news. C-19 pretty bad people 70 younger people immunity issues. done lock country down, find risk, isolate risk, open country back up. could happened late March, early April. people protesting MI, example, right protest reopening, right protest dingbat whitmer overstepped authority getting legislative authority extend lockdown past initial 30-days. clear? protestors saying, know risk act accordingly (or idiots, catering lowest common denominator gets them) know authority lock us down, open up. lost court, course, extension legislature.

That said, care c-19 scare. risk, lock down, not, - easy, stay away old people. whole lot things going on, mostly checks flying door astonishing rates - daughter got $359 check college via CARES Act. need $359? pay, scholarship, $60k/year tuition. getting money protestors living of? suppose long free money flowing, reason push open, eh? Oh, returning $359? lol fuck no, that's gonna cost lot $359.

It best interest blacks successful, strong families good kids get good jobs educate children. best interest pretend today's black kids kind oppressed minority like great-grandparents even farther back were. honest ourselves, recognize strong families make strong kids strong communities, none pandering going help blacks heal nation. Yeah, truly racist fucks go ways fuck black (or white) person, numbers dwindled, need ostracized every opportunity. pendulum far wrong direction (and blm keeps pushing further), see equal. never come pre 9/11 levels islamophobia continues prolonged persistent worldwide threat terrorism perpetuated muslim extremist groups. order islamophobia end terrorist attacks carried must end first. Alot things u mentioned rich exploitative corporation crony government made way good hard working individuals succeeded spite ugliness sickness system learn new Covid-19 symptoms frequently. sound shocked.

Just let go, promise am. still applicable now, 2 months later, since administration considers hoax? cheap long. curious, many? give deaths one facility amount infected multiple facilities?

And ask really compassionate people want wear mask. goes Singapore, 8 week lockdown, it‚Äôs reopening Friday

I would argue lockdown necessary first yet see single person going around outside without mask, people understand value working together society greater good

Shkreli raised price drug limited demand. economically feasible another manufacturer come time compete. Dexamethasone frequently prescribed drug patent many generic manufacturers. Nah, super common drug used respiratory conditions, used asthma, crup, AFAIK correct. earlier wording ""independent"" strong. 

There overlap. We'll confirm antibody response vaccine confers effective immunity, though we'd anyway. may need frequent doses people hoping for. OTOH, maybe vaccine developed stimulates robust response natural exposure. If/when/how vaccine works still speculative, ""independent"" sense vaccine responses match natural immunity responses. for-instance chicken pox vaccine. chicken pox kid exceedingly unlikely infected rest life. contrast, kid gets vaccine see immunity degrade decade two. 

It's area expertise either I'm hoping someone better informed flesh unknowns, say reasonable confidence vaccine prospects questionable since day 1 change that.  RIP father-in-law YEAH BABY BLOOD DISEASE LET'S FUCKING GO! calling like is. xenophobic. saw many masks social distancing current protests.

That woman Michigan saved state.  
Excerpts letter:  
  write urge you: Please issue state-wide mandate requiring universal masking public 2 years old above. sufficient, clear, scientific evidence wearing masks one way decrease spread COVID-19 thus would reduce wave severely affected patients requiring ICU ventilator resources well unnecessary deaths.   
 healthcare system becoming overwhelmed COVID-19 need help partnership mitigating disease spread. cannot simply ‚Äúlearn live with‚Äù disease devastating entire communities. believe universal mask wearing ONE effective important strategy continue fight COVID-19. Keeping economy going maintaining universal masking social distancing win win situation every member community regardless political views balances economics public health.   
  many reasons simple act wearing mask help greater good. mask decreases harm protects community manner requiring passengers wear seatbelts car, forbidding texting driving, outlawing jaywalking requiring life vests boat. wearing masks, curtail huge surge COVID-19 cases Arizona reduce unnecessary mortality community.  
  stand frontline healthcare workers risk lives care COVID-19 patients every day. encourage you, Governor Ducey, follow scientific data shows universal masking decreases spread COVID-19 mandate masks state Arizona immediately individuals 2 y/o above, continuing social distancing, order decrease number unnecessary deaths also allow businesses remain open. Remember 60,000 august? Worst case scenario back 180,000 August. think we‚Äôll beat even worst insurance cover this, makes far sense insurance cover 100 dollar vaccine get slapped $600K bill stay hospital week.

Recent data suggests Covid vaccine might similar, necessarily keep catching would prevent lot severe illness/death.

But LOL downvoted saying plan try get sick. Anyone least take precautions try prevent virus certified idiot. make permenant? hope case people actually getting sick, opposed data showing want to. Plenty people still wearing masks right thing. mention, feeling it'll spread soon open. Plenty people know sick friends, family, I'm hearing frequently. Hopefully isolated thing. I've also heard interesting things medical professionals know.

All all, hope MD stays low data actually accurate, said, still people virus, people need careful possible. local subreddit, people already asking go back pools, kids go back schools, gyms, etc. worry everyone's leash again, virus pop right back like states, countries made mistake. said, hope data honest another surge infections. many babies aborted year Rwandan Genocide. bet notice kinds comparisons flawed unhelpful. thought ventilator covid19? 

It actually say that. say ever Covid stage, released hospital negative test died home. 

At best, sloppy reporting, worst, shitty attempt C-19 sensationalism. Whatever case, level journalism detracts debate rather adding it. surgeries days tend like that. I've 2 surgeries past 3 years times like restful nap I've ever had.

It's recovery hard. see problem. Religion supposed help people meet god? Finally!

That good thing.

I hope keep alcohol airlines good.

Disproportionate number idiots USA side. look current data new cases. employees wear mask. add face shield safe. Let guess, administrator, actual doctor? fucks sake healthcare worker too, figure people she‚Äôd smarter Imagine permanently fucking social group something inconsequential. Reap sow morons  tons diseases without treatments vaccine, mean stop living going lives. 

Why reliant vaccine? [never successful RNA ever, pathetic [current flu are, putting much hope them?

I digress, hypothetically, let's say vaccine comes tomorrow 75% effective. mean open back 100% forget happening? vaccine going help, end goal this, covid-19 becoming old news fast affecting lives way, shape form you‚Äôre right I‚Äôm sure piss people like drink flight. specific demographic mentioned might make bigger confrontation it. Absolutely, per-capita always useful metric. severely unbalanced unfair comparing countries different population sizes. US world's 3rd populated country, makes sense compare (for example) country highest deaths per-capita, San Marino, whopping 1238 deaths/1M compared US's 359 deaths/1M. entire population 33,344 2018, they've 42 deaths.

Compared countries population class, i.e. top-10 populated, US #1 far. Brazil distant second. comes another stimulus time rest states open. Look, bud u/Mighty_L_LORT know Canada shinning beacon pandemic right? US 354 deaths per million (9th) Canada 218 deaths per million (17th). much strut about. Canadians wear masks Global Pandemic?  back work! breath colleagues!""  *Goes group social distancing packed bars without mask, gets COVID-19*

How could happen me? think China need find people? select prison camps one ever know ‚Äúactivities like speaking breathing produce respiratory bits varying sizes disperse along air currents potentially infect people nearby.‚Äù

But one wants wear mask. doesn‚Äôt make sense. get sense scale, consider this. Given 1% (1/100) chance something happen, 100 times, 63% chance happen. 0.1% (1/1000), 10% chance. 0.001%, (1/10000), 1%. Etc. \*

If corona chance infect *and* kill given person village 10 people, 10^(-20) (1/10with20zeroes) probability die. get least 63% need 10^20 (10with20zeroes) VILLAGES size. minimum number, larger settlement lower probability would require villages. Adding another 10^20 11 people gives 1% chance. Another 10^20 12 people? 0.01%. numbers made hopefully see quickly things add up. expect villages completely wiped unless death rate significantly higher. Even bumping 10% death rate would require 10^10 (10 billion) villages.

\*to get probability something probability (p) happening least given number independent events (n), take probability *not* happening given case (1-p) multiply together n times ( [1-p]^n ). subtract 1. Suppose chance somebody contract corona die p = 1%. Suppose n = 100 villages single people. get chance least one die, wiping village

1 - p = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99 (chance single person die)

0.99^100 = 0.37 (chance nobody die)

1 - 0.37 = 0.63 (chance least one die)

Now suppose village 2 people. get chance die multiply 0.01*0.01 aka 0.01^2 = 0.0001. inverse 0.9999 . Plug back get

1 - 0.9999^100 = 1 - 99% = 1% (chance least one village die) 

Jump 2 orders magnitude. on. 0.1%, 0.001%. 1 every 1000 people respiratory failure think virus would much issue. rare complications people go hospital covid struggling breathe. Michigan phased opening since Memorial Day cases still downward trend. swab upper part mouth well, hear. Current testing procedure probably overkill causes unnecessary pain. Ask chose lead favorite TV show vilify rather personality disorders assigned her. Yeah lets ignore MILLIONS idiots bars/restaurants/grocery stores/Lowes/Home Depot/etc running around inside recirculating AC spreading covid 24 hours day masks fuck ur 6 foot rule FREEDUMB! miss point. I'm saying whatever cheapest price sell overseas price sell US. sold 4 dollars pill Germany, 2 dollars France 10 cents South Africa, sell 10 cents US. Fuck drug companies taking advantage people US. One biggest reasons health insurance US cost much high prices doctors charge insane prices drugs.

Remember doctor visit might cost 175, that's year hit lots people.. course doctor prescribe patient 3 4 different medicines cost average 75 month even insurance 20 dollar co-pay insurance company still getting hit 220 month 12 months year 2640 year.... That's reason high health insurance costs. Lots patients maintenance drugs cost lot every year, year year. Whoops CDC estimates burden illness 2018‚Äì2019 season included estimated 35.5 million people getting sick influenza, 16.5 million people going health care provider illness, 490,600 hospitalizations, **34,200 deaths influenza**

So... like 0.0003% 279k flu deaths. diamond princess? 23% remained asymptomatic deaths record low..... That‚Äôs good point, forgot signs everywhere it‚Äôs since I‚Äôve amusement park. don‚Äôt make sign waivers events Texas matter. governor wants state open open state regardless situation. Right he's blaming irresponsible 20 year olds rise cases. I‚Äôm even speaking specifically steroid. life general make decisions future consequences joints. aware ""Steroids"" general term VAST differences classes.

You can't compare usage replacement androgens like testosterone anti inflammatory Corticosteroids like dexamethasone, which, well tolerated short term use serious side effect long term. math mistaken.

It starts two groups 100%, critical.

The ones getting treatment dying. fact, 41% (from control group) died.

That's already ""The majority dies anyway."" Less half died, even without treatment.

If reduction 1/3 mortality incidents ""on ventilator"" category occurs, category goes 41% dying 27% dying.

That's really really big deal.

But numbers way lower 50% dying. population much larger ability gather data much better? Another commenter told that. realise genetic commented, found after. Load people commenting saying pharma companies hike price assumed drug widely available. thats problem. new spike definitely upcoming weeks, due protests Cooper reconsidering Phase 3. small businesses unemployed cannot wait anymore. really two choices:

\-Provide financial support citizens small businesses remain closed

\-No financial support reopen everything. far 89 meatpacking workers died meat plant owners lied impending meat shortages United States. Instead kept plants open exported record amount pork China. Sorry break taxes already go need every time GOP power.

What means testing vaccine pricing? meaningless rhetoric Free vaccines would step right direction, everyone benefits people immunized.

Everyone get vaccine added benefit already well unnecessarily drawing taxes implement means test. US need prescription buy toilet paper. 100% agree. many issues sub. nearly stated fact everyone ‚Äújust wear fucking mask‚Äù told received threats via DM, cursed reported. downvoting fully expected, told truth. Can‚Äôt that. Yeah look number *hospitalized* There's nothing indicate spike due protests, simply natural consequence reopening. even question? Every single person able get cost. past months I've seen lot highly confident predictions come anywhere close true. 

Here bold prediction: Arizona peak end next week July 4th consistent downward trend new cases AZ clear. Florida, California, Texas take longer, Labor Day states US clearly trending down, least plateau 300 cases/day. based purely pattern states gone through. scientific prediction means, people sure we'd 3,000 deaths per day scientific claimed either. Florida going full Florida pretending corona gone. Corona loves Americans, found it‚Äôs fertile environment, idiots. **Check licensed doctor first, anyone reading this. matter accurate something online - comes health, make sure final say go someone easily hold accountable goes badly you.**

OP's doctor may found something different OP's case makes solutions ineffective. OP even heard full details everything going on, according reply they've made. Immigrants get free Swedish classes(Swedish Immigrates, SFI) refugees speak English, come Sweden get taught Swedish. 

Is also sad Sweden top ten refugee immigrants world. Per Capita one best? . soo sad Sweden accepted refugees Nordic countries rejected them? 50 new hospitalizations 

Test more...find Sounds like Los Angeles me. Love seeing states like MI IL continue see numbers drop states didn‚Äôt take serious seeing record highs. Glad shut things spring still taking seriously. Wow, one could possibly predicted this. 5% sounds like within margin error tests similar happened South Australia woman UK compassionate grounds visit dying relative. allowed leave quarantine early Victoria without tested. Luckily tested soon arrived Adelaide Airport tested positive. NZ authorities aware case probability situation happening tested allowing break quarantine. could literally walk downstairs pharmacy live Mexico buy bunch different ones cheaply without needing prescription. know people acting like rare drugs shoot price. company tried they'd get undercut generic manufacturers. COURSE China would better since much experience, because, well... viruses originally started China. 

You could say game, USA Western countries newbies compare China rest Asia. comes Hoffman Laroche factory US sure hell is. cost much drug distributed US ship Brazil distribute since even manufactured there. simple fact drug companies fuck US consumers... sadly large part reason health insurance. would ban health coverage drugs drug manufacturers able charge outlandish prices one would buy drugs. know half population going covered pay 20 dollar co-pay insurance picking 130, price high hell. sorry don‚Äôt believe me, also don‚Äôt care not. neither family doctors. nothing else prove anyone. 

You intolerant others long wish. Enjoy existence keep saying two weeks right pretend right along, like Reddit. Looks like cheap anymore.   Yup, going plane foreseeable future. 10000 tests 2400 positive, 24% positive rate alarm everyone right now. üòû one bar owner nuts Yep remember, think site made counter Florida's government #'s 

 LOL wut? believe tough drug manufacture. issue. think third ""hospital capacity."" Lol comforting, think real treatment disease? Hey, we‚Äôll able brag kids survived global pandemic civil unrest. survive anyways. many less people died also due response? 

Strictly speaking, that's separate issue, probably rife debate define many terms using calculations. 

Every single one referenced define many terms using calculations. many heart attacks strokes caused covid?

If going ask that, also need ask many attributed covid deaths *on record* moreso deaths *with* covid deaths *by* covid. kind analysis requires tens pages description. picture.

It's napkin math, I'd take grain salt (I also imagine ""pneumonia deaths"") covid overall point stands. also need consider extent covid deaths deaths displaced relatively-short term. interesting see all-cause mortality numbers look like end next flu season. look [CDC looks we're getting back average. üòÇüòÇüòÇ properly approved. developed Canada well country going let citizens take vaccine without approval governing health body point stands, sub-amateur. agree completely encourage everyone best part whole thing. family wears masks try cover, always cover cough sneeze try best avoid tight spaces social distancing really possible. Elevators big one. omits positive trends reports upticks. state goes -4000 cases, +1466, -5766, +867, -6754, +654, -8790 etc would pop three times OUTBREAK ALERTS would mean additional almost 37 million confirmed cases (assuming don‚Äôt find way accurately go back figure exactly many people already it).

That would require staggering ~186,000(!) confirmed cases day operate assumption vaccine January 1, 2021.

Now find way back date cases using current IFR estimate would us (assuming miss deaths) ~15 million cases, would still require ~100,000 new cases every day end year.

FWIW, date, cases recorded US one day April 6, US added 43438 cases! Per article: 

A Dallas woman tested positive COVID-19 February, recovered, tested positive June reporting delays. Florida recorded 6 deaths Sunday, 7 Monday. catching up. Look daily deaths. extremely inconsistent, overall trend deaths plateaued.

 

Cases going up. Whether deaths follow cases debate. whatever reason, US cases plateaued last month least, deaths consistently gone down.

 

I think anyone knows data, call discussion. Given Florida experienced consistent logs \~50 deaths 5 days \~5 deaths two days, jump 55 deaths indications anything fundamentally changed. you‚Äôre able catch twice 4 months know also gets thrown out? chance vaccine. doomers committed living isolating rest life?  Yep. Theres nail head. Without sales tax local governments folding over. city county governments laying large chunks public service, asking federal money shoring best can.  

Unfortunately many got used needing safety net small businesses folding under, city county governments well. payroll police, fire departments, trash services question city.

What happens local governments start fold wondering. maybe find better way fund car, home, retail sales? Forgive I‚Äôm wrong, hasn‚Äôt also suggested ceasing testing past?  mean it‚Äôll probably put test, it‚Äôs like things theme parks warn risks assume entering going certain rides. She‚Äôs healthcare worker, cop. Yeah live Jax there‚Äôs many options get tested. I‚Äôm Northwest Ohio. Feels same. 

People think it‚Äôs flu. even hoax.  No, don‚Äôt yet enough data show bad long-term effects are. US, thing reason must feel extremely confident November recess lot people losing jobs, homes, insurance coverage, COVID-19 waivers. [orange analogy works nobody using roads except drunks; sober people using roads upset drunks get occasional accident mortality rate less 1%, impact sober non road users, yet demand coerce drunks driving choose to. fwiw, believe you. 

I wear mask everywhere, part, public masking guidelines designed **protect** folks **exactly like you**, too. obviously; it‚Äôs common sense. 

Anyone scapegoats willfully ignorant, self-righteous ass. know someone named Alexa hates now. Good Camilla. fart much desires. stayed house 3 months. Na, I'm going lockdown again, governors 3 months prepare. two weeks since protests started hasn‚Äôt spike tied them. thing outdoor events crowds beaches, lake ozarks, etc. don‚Äôt know keep pretend outdoor transmission significant issue. American life sounds sad It‚Äôs honestly getting tougher tougher tell sarcasm without /s tag, unfortunately many people taking stances like 100% seriously lol There's category disease disease treatment strongly correlated change mortality outcome 1/3 defined segment cases called marginal.

This cheap significant.

In control group, 41% patients require ventilation died. reduction 1/3 deaths would mean 27% patients requiring ventilation die. That's big deal. hope soon come regulation large firms' speculative activities. They're ruining everyone's life making housing unaffordable. smart listen scientist said use masks? political context? JustT BlamInG GOverNmenT Keep infection rate low enough overburden ability treat ill, keeping economy running get vaccine. never said that. I‚Äôm commenting lockdown. It‚Äôs funny assume I‚Äôd think that. say anything masks? Lol 

I said can‚Äôt bully people collectively responsible. can‚Äôt rely government keep safe virus. take personal responsibility, it‚Äôs best thing do.

I think everyone take personal responsibility stop worrying much people aren‚Äôt doing. cannot control them, especially comes innate human desire socialize (something people reddit, people sub, seem less average) 1000 medical professionals said protesting good

 Oh certainly. buddies girlfriend India, wonderful. never minute thought anything percentage people shitty, problem here. Seems human thing, sadly chunk people hard time decent humans, unfortunately. reliant vaccine? never successful RNA vaccine ever, pathetic current flu vaccines are, putting much hope them?

Which China working vaccine based weakened virus. statement made given limited supply masks time. However much average citizen could use mask, healthcare workers could use more. *might* come contact COVID course day. Hospital workers urgent care clinics guaranteed to.

Unfortunately, neglected consider effect government body lying onset crisis would have.

So answer question, nobody ""political,"" necessarily, made bad call choices really sucked. narrative pushed people like you.   numbers small increases. showing exponential growth.

The media trying scare people, reporting happening states Governors legislatures decided ignore health officials, CDC know, science.

Take narrative back conspiracy.  stands true testing. non American I‚Äôm certainly hearing people rapidly declining week positive diagnosis. It‚Äôs American bill fear. devoutly 

Freudian slip? Wow, India hit 2000 deaths day. Huge spike. didn't. think need go opposite extreme are.

It matter whether *you* ok dying, whether make people die.

Whether comes distancing, changing society works, vaccine, whatever debate. really wonder try take advantage good weather classes outside kids long possibly gets cold still report posts misinformation that‚Äôs exactly never got unemployment.... never go away. Studies showed asymptomatic people infectious, never know. Everyone us could without knowing. practically impossible test every person country time, even small population. thing done keeping infection rates low, even works degree limited amount time. I'm even talking people ignore rules things. many aspects barely control control all. \#JustTheFlu Ah, good - well done.


Do think end year realistic? Also makes convenient afternoon glass wine. telltale booze breath smell. I'm asking Italian App. +2600 cases today.

Got right Close fucking border. Every time crisis public health officials said ""hey good reason expect serious problem,"" become serious problem.

So rounds now. Every time, people fancy _cooler heads, prevailing_ line observe meteor careening Earth low death count far, people quite silly assume worst. future, matter predictable, exist arrives. One wonders armchair experts ever quite got hang object permanence.

If sounds mean, boo-hoo. time come gone pretend opinions value credibility anybody. reason people dont believe you. Everyone claims cant wear mask dont want to.

Sure knuckle heads comply, type recommendation suspect move people start wearing masks shows threat still exists, gov trying allow reopening (which want) still acknowleding concessions needed safety. Basically reason wearing masks late April rather late May even though states mandated masks - government still positioning ongoing risk strong recommendation heeded most. 

Compare current positioning basically - good, let's reopen. people able go justification wearing masks. 

I'm also opinion regulating businesses better way get compliance. enforcing masks staff extent patrons risk health violation. done many health related items restaurants. gaps well, level ownership business owner help enforce compliance. weapons planes pretty useless, say, I'm pretty sure bomb screening still useful.

The evidence you‚Äôre citing, even completely accurate, would suggest results seem potentially encouraging promising, perhaps extent research warranted.

But *anywhere* realm ‚Äúconclusive‚Äù... stretch imagination. all. Whatsoever. obvious degree.

First, things like country‚Äôs test rate, ICU capacity‚Äôs, healthcare access, positive populations, conditions reporting positive cases, hospitalizations, fatalities, etc, needs meticulously evaluated compared, *alone* potentially unravel entire theory seams heartbeat. 

Worldometers data also need rigorously assessed, reasonably accurate enough public differ drastically accurate enough scientific study/scrutinization, worldometers already bit criticism numbers/reporting (even generally fairly accurate overall).

Additionally, many factors need controlled well - ‚ÄúCorrelation equal causation‚Äù one golden rules science good reason. Thus far, you/worldometers‚Äô data implying correlation - causation established slightest.

For instance, every country you‚Äôve named younger, average, population compared US, UK, Germany, France, Italy, etc averages. two country‚Äôs populations closer US/UK average (among younger Western countries) *markedly* healthy.

Every single country named also universal near universal mask wearing (very much unlike many Western countries), could potentially presumably decrease initial viral load exposure, impacting overall severity (in addition factors like age, health, etc).

There likely *numerous* additional factors play - *very* significant immediately came mind.

Which actually need large, well-designed studies, control various factors, replicable results, even approach calling anything conclusive. 

All you‚Äôre citing ***only*** means *may* area *interest* study (particularly following specific protocol countries may may using) - that‚Äôs it. means nothing that.

So *that‚Äôs* you‚Äôd like argue, I‚Äôd disagreement there.

But conclusive? **long** shot. remember percent died placebo comparing to, 100% patients. 25 20% actually 20% reduction deaths. 40% 28% also 20% reduction deaths.  People time.

So, zombies.

And finally, **HUGE LIMITATION**: ""Although Johns Hopkins mini-brains show features human brain, including electrical activity communications neurons, lack features, including blood-brain barrier.""

This means ""infect brain"" idea theoretical possibility only.

Furthermore, time period discussing? talking yearly... no. covid taken 443k 6 months. BAD flu year takes 500k 12 months, statistic, wrong.

Maybe meant time?

Based modern median flu deaths per year, knowledge modern flu believed originated 1580, adjusting deaths year per capita basis (which gives edge flu vaccines modern invention decreases total death rates) flu killed 35 million people all-time. Yes, that's less COVID all-time. right end.

But, we're counting all-time, ""regluar old"" flu killed 35 million literally makes THIRD WORST DISEASE TIME, losing top podium Black Death (75-200 million) Spanish Flu (17-100 million).

So assertion since COVID (which currently killing people year) bad course human history third worst disease time, taking precautions... well idiot.

A story Michael R. Pence. People died him.

That's fact jack You‚Äôd think would enough conspiracy nuts realize isn‚Äôt part large-scale conspiracy.... probably not. Well, yeah, explained kind hope people listen, guess. imagine every single business owner wanted stay open, would hard stop them. like crash course mislead using statistics. end section kind quote show history textbooks decade later: 

&amp;#x200B;

""We‚Äôve slowed spread, we‚Äôve cared vulnerable, we‚Äôve saved lives, we‚Äôve created solid foundation whatever challenges may face future."" Despicable. rich irony media trying scare us regarding virus, yet comes brown people Middle East South Central America things truly afraid worthy action sounding alarm. 

Let‚Äôs ignore Covid-19 killed people terrorism undocumented immigrants since dawn nation like 4 months. Fox News still closed working remotely tell rest country open again. 

That peak hatred. lot surge capacity AZ. Quality care doctors nurses get stretched thin concerning me. makes sense. lungs get filled fluid work harder, there's always possibility pockets lung kinda ""close off"" response that.

It's kinda like ventilator all; full capacity *not* always restored unfortunately. one day (not COVID related, years today's mess) struggle lose lung capacity. group stopped trial HCQ early weeks ago due finding clinical benefit. HCQ used UK treat coronavirus except part drug trial. American doctors jumping gun taking advantage Trump's tweets representative rest Absolutely.

That said, certainly many anticipating suggest people getting back buying products &amp; services again. Seriously, people sub huge doom boners want pretend way is. flu kills around ~.3% unless old unhealthy. people stay inside. Good point. However, genuinely expect see much proper mask-wearin' Numberberder rally. someone related Trump buy enough stock manufacturer, yes.

And start seizing shipments jack price resell  CDC's death rate .6% complete fabrication. .3% NYC already died covid 19, even iota evidence pointing 50% NYCers infected coronavirus. Yep, see anyone look something like say we're ""exploding."" 

Like said, people point increase raw case numbers amount testing increased similar trajectory. Looking deaths much reliable seeing we're at.

Florida increasing cases, % [positive rate remained largely back early May. Omaha Beach WWII, see point Different war, point accurate regardless. said side coin well. app somehow bound phone number... watch Karl Rocks video corona testing - nightmare. government literally took app somehow changed status infected called him. pretty much locked app.

Complete opposite Germany. And...what % population wore masks questions asked 1918?  Protesters large wearing masks. hand, police using tear gas pepper spray protesters respiratory pandemic, comically evil. That‚Äôs pretty huge. 26% positivity rate. don‚Äôt know much longer governor able claim everything fine.

It‚Äôs fucked system nothing makes sense. lot Americans around simply contract virus. think saying 100k+ Americans dying virus big deal. important realize population increased makes sense numbers today would higher numbers past events. Wat? need phone number app though. means tracked. know number cam from. American Airlines operate planes hold 499 people. far tell, planes even hold 300 passengers. given Dex sickness chemo. Lots good coming drug looks like also used military enforced quarantines. I'm saying one better another reason almost Western Nations military enforced shut downs. Culture bigger role people realize.

Yeah, even western part state people taking seriously. haven‚Äôt seen single person store without mask months. Right? point I'm confident going still stumble politics even fix. Fixed Delaware kid :) personally dont believe him, general legit doctor confirmed reasons wear mask shouldnt forced stay inside work. amount people unable wear masks that's ok, thsts excuse everyone else. Bro someone works restaurant, people literally yesterday telling ""we came Arizona! wanted get away coronavirus scare.""

No masks btw. Rough estimate. Average death COVID loses 10 years war loses 50 years. maybe 1/5 way life loss WWI

Worldwide 20 million WWI, even close. 7 days still can't grasp point. Amazing. Thanks thinking long fact. Lower rent costs always welcome. many tests issuing tho? know it‚Äôs bad, I‚Äôd like numbers context  absolutely first thought!  4) Contact tracing! Haven‚Äôt heard peep fauci science telling anything like this.  Wonder he‚Äôs gonna 2 month delay like whole mask thing. Pandemic 2 truths lie.

Increased testing: true

Increased cases: true

Trending better: false

If increased testing resulting decreased positive rate, that's worrisome. arguing all. math. Trump's Phoenix rally next Tuesday. Ah see, make sense. guess I'm tired people attempt minimize death toll based comparison. apologise previous poster intention.  did? didn‚Äôt read part. 

Source? legitimately feel really bad anyone named Karen point. Like entire existence become huge internet joke. see way safely open unless COVID numbers drop next nothing vaccine developed.

There safe way till then. Pro tip: Stay bars. There's need dick. no, positivity rate TX actually staying relatively within last weeks (6-8%). I'm merely pointing we're getting accurate idea many people system due larger sample size thanks increased testing. need pretty pictures help understand numbers, go here: Value according who/what? definition value using? sanitation work massively valuable, matter many people qualify job. talking employers get away paying little essential work, yes, that's different matter. that's much employer values individual people. job little value would got rid job nothing got worse. Thank goodness able tell right three months later. can‚Äôt remember state was, lady stepped position working governor Covid task force believe response protesters house death threats, etc. Even though didn‚Äôt say reason. wanted spend time family. people don‚Äôt care catch Covid send state parks stay months catch recover aren‚Äôt putting us trying contract risk. weird time alive. town, population ~400, see masks nearby city 25,000. Indeed, I've mocking, scoffing, eye rolling aggressive interrogation wearing mask shops, required law, somehow followed 10% population.

I really wish president made masks political issue. Thanks public disbelief, everyone around thinks masks Democratic party conspiracy undermine president.

And 60+, overweight, multiple pre-existing conditions. truly surreal. doctors note confirms this. problem wearing masks appropriate note saying unable wear one. situation Way forget Delaware. :(  Alternatively, cut administrative bloat skyrocketed last three decades spending actual instruction instructors hardly budged.

Becky Karen's daughter. wouldnt 2 months even things. Germany reported reduction 40% mask wearing day. wearing mask, reduction would major helpful. idea virus would vanish wore masks isnt accurate. would much better off. Come man, I'm trying shit you. One interesting thing happened today's press conference:

**Anders Tegnell denied ever claiming possible reach herd immunity without vaccine**. *one single* journalist much flinched said before, think possible reach herd immunity without vaccine."" what? 

Tegnell weeks think countries, epidemiologists talk agree herd immunity one thing eventually slow spread virus. Nothing else slow long-term. Either reach people getting infected getting well again, reach vaccinating people. vaccine far ...""  get one single counter-question that?? Hmm, areas Louisiana drawing cases go around last time? health care worker says regrets taking precautions

These people we're expected take care us? hope able recover fully eventually.  EXTUBATED given one coronavirus test, instead global standard least two consecutive tests, deemed recovered discharged, died.
In words, fuck troll go back Dir.bg! idiots maybe believe bullshit. Ok, I‚Äôm gonna quote second. Ready?

‚ÄúBecause puts perspective much impact Covid compared historic events.‚Äù

It puts perspective. arbitrary number puts Covid deaths perspective. 

So gave another arbitrary number (the Holocaust) ‚Äúperspective‚Äù Compared arbitrary number I‚Äôve chosen, Covid doesn‚Äôt look bad, it? 

But would dumb say wouldn‚Äôt it? Yes would we‚Äôre simply going by, again, words, ‚Äúperspective‚Äù change perspective fit whatever narrative want. step-mom severe asthma (inhalers, breathing machines, steroids required still gets admitted hospital time time) many courses prednisone years. osteoporosis get shots still better alternative. ‚ÄúWe wearing masks. social distancing,‚Äù Crisp said. ‚ÄúIt soon open everything back up.‚Äù  general manager said pub reopen 11 a.m. Tuesday.

It‚Äôs fact it‚Äôs treated catchall also fully valid defense.

Sucks credible experts rely on. Fauci, cant get trust back. right person role. ends justify means.  tough spot, maybe toughest, that's person role must unquestionable moral character.  definitely matter. states continuing low case numbers even though borders closed. Exactly. herd immunity stated since we're done lockdowns, proper testing tracing, testing levels, mask use, social distancing anything else could remotely construed strategy. blaming salmon officially, would weird even China. found cutboard salmon it. 2/3 American workers make less $31,200 year?

If want add better estimates: Substitute nursing home fiasco killed several thousand. Increase estimates southern NY healthy relative America. Increase estimates coronavirus antibodies last 2-8 month, closer 5 - based common cold early estimates 200 patients France. Meaning herd immunity joke.  Increase estimates seasonality virus 10-20% (flu, colder weather).  I‚Äôm also assuming city would surpass 20% front-line worker infection rate without shutting down. 

My estimate low. trust anything China says point?  It‚Äôs probably new cluster, probably always spreading. 1.4 billion people, way contained first place. Source protests something important like eat shrimp restaurant thousand miles away nearest shrimp catching zone?

However, could please read carefully? Especially tips **suspected cases**!

suspected cases analyzed by:

1. epidemiological history
2. clinical manifestation

I can\`t comprehend ignore **epidemiological history** part.

Below criteria, emphasizes:

**""A case meets one epidemiological history criteria two clinical manifestation identified suspected case. clear epidemiological history, 3 clinical manifestation required""**

This means contacted infected person, identified ""suspected case"" test even symptom. meet conformed cases criteria confirmed. exactly Beijing practical.

[here irrefutable proof](http://www.ccdi.gov.cn/yaowen/202006/t20200614_220058.html)

This report published Chinese government June 14th, day number **confirmed cases** 36. might date number raised 106, report contains details precise enough support opinion correct misunderstanding. 

In report, detailed information 36 **confirmed cases** listed, including got tested, symptoms, diagnosis results. 36 people **confirmed cases,** within them**,** case No.27 No.36 literally **asymptomatic.** 

These details two asymptomatic cases, included 36 **confirmed cases.**

(Sorry ENG version, made machine translation here)

Case 27, female, 46 years old, Zhoukou, Henan, working Beijing Xinfadi Market, self-employed, currently lives 400 Panjiamiao, Fengtai District, Beijing. **She reported experienced discomfort except insomnia seek medical treatment.** 12th, epidemic traceability sampling test, nucleic acid test positive, diagnosis confirmed experts, clinical classification **asymptomatic** infection.

Case 36 36, female, 37 years old, born Xicheng District, Beijing, unemployed, lives Xiyayuan, Jiuzhou, Changyang Town, Fangshan District, Beijing.On 5th, went Xinfadi market **reported fever, cough, diarrhea**.On 11th, accompanied husband hot clinic Shijingshan Hospital. 12th, nucleic acid test positive, diagnosis confirmed experts. clinical classification **asymptomatic**.

As see, two cases traced **only epidemiological history**, symptoms still tested suspected cases become confirmed cases meet ""confirmed criteria"".

You also read report self, find case No.7, No.

8, No.13, No.14, No.23, No.29 also **no symptoms fever, lung abnormality, lymphocyte abnormality** confirmed cases. even **not categorized asymptomatic**, instead, defined normally/lightly infected. find details yourself, even machine translation.

According data above, asymptomatic cases definitely included confirmed cases. Meanwhile, people without symptoms asymptomatic. Unlike America, don\`t need show symptoms suspected case China.

Vaccines manipulations host adaptive immune response, without vaccine would effect.

These findings relevant several reasons. 

The finding infections failed produce antibodies affirms virus sometimes able evade detection immune system atypical degree, meaning vaccine specifically target whatever qualities mechanisms play evasion, require research identify. example adapted vaccines example less likely work.

The finding infections produce non-neutralizing antibodies signals identified vaccine targets may produce effective immune response. also means vaccines may contend antigens already bound non-neutralizing antibodies, could present challenges including limited antibody-dependent enhancement, paradoxical phenomenon identified dengue fever several coronaviruses inappropriate antibody response increases severity infection.

The finding infections produce neutralizing antibodies short-lived signals potential vaccine may require larger doses produce effective immune response, entails greater risk vaccination induced harm infection compounds manufacturing limitations, and/or boosters, similar effects.

These findings may impact efficacy particular delivery mechanisms vaccine targets relation immune responses intend trigger. generally findings present difficult, complex scenario vaccination involving several atypical qualities may identified considering vaccine candidates. 

The simplest way think implications this: usually, getting sick virus results immune system protecting getting sick virus year more, vaccine figure produce response without getting sick. findings indicate infection might produce immunity could several different reasons involved that's case, vaccine may significantly improve/alter immune system response order address features without getting sick. Ok? seen reported Amazon's working conditions pretty accurate. issue? need flu shot every year. impossible one-time vaccine protect lifetime virus mutate new strains.

Also, estimated death rate 0.5% 1%?

So point is; even 175 persons symptoms got tested, still abnormal big number, ""less surprising"" imo. 

You totally right can't compare 175 tests 58000 tests, guess corona hotspot nearby tests focused that, something similar messed numbers. Maybe light several high profile retractions walk backs, people would want data/a paper released press release? Yes, pangolin CoV contain NNLDSKV motif. See Fig. 5 Fig. 3 Fig. 3 (published articles).

Trump killed LOT people. interesting data point know many people existing conditions know get treatment viral infection.

For example, father law chronic knee pain years. self-medicating day day, day, Aleve years. Never told doctors knee pain bad, went get evaluated knee replacement surgery.

It pre-op blood tests found kidney function reduced borderline needing start dialysis. suspect state reduced kidney function years result taking Aleve day everyday.

It knee replacement pre-op measurements he/they found it, going multiple years point.

I'm discounting impact viral infection treatment have, uncommon people idea underlying conditions never identified yet, absolutely change trajectory post-treatment health. legitimate question since much news months saying worst happening underlying health issues. healthy ppl showing symptoms rare, rarer still healthy ppl getting horribly sick dying.

Hearing bg someone happened helpful. testing get cases that‚Äôs look hospitals number isn‚Äôt tied testing gives better barometer community impact.

Statistically significant (in one two trials) biologically significant. chance mildly ill person cough clear day earlier would otherwise doesn‚Äôt outweigh side effects. Looks like y-axis 7-day average new cases per 100k population.

X-axis entirely sure, guessing number days since cases began.

Would better regions defined, x-axis labeled date.

Basically says northeast (primarily NYC area, although basically northeast states similar trend) ton new cases trending downward ton. Midwest smaller, flatter, later peak also trending down. South West relatively flat trending upward. similar territories, although smaller populations new cases/100k may may best way visualize trends (idk though, ask actual expert).

Evidence shows Allied Axis countries suppressed news Flu outbreaks among troops, afraid would sap morale give enemy advantage. 

Spain's press time free report it. First headlines new Flu appeared Mid-May Spanish newspapers, weeks later Spain's King Alfonso XIII came dose news went fever pitch (King survived it). 

But led term Spanish Flu (or sometimes Spanish Lady) commonly used. Irony Spanish (probably good reason) believed coming trenches France Spanish referred ""The French Flu"". Every law government passes coercion others get comply. saying totally governments laws welcome beliefs, otherwise showing shades hypocrisy

My way thinking falls firmly judicial interpretation rights freedoms end nose, likewise rights end yours. liberty cannot infringe life, whereas claiming liberty able infringe upon lives others. cannot abide.

You may think poetic choice, believe order unalienable rights constitution correct import. even disagree give equal value, cannot trump another's. estimated closer 0.8% thats arguing semantics.

The issue it, death count off. Places like india, they'll missing cases lack infrastructure, people dying rural villages COVID never tested. Places like Europe, fairly accurate death counts since got testing up, sure missing cases going back start year. places like U.S. Brazil, cases hidden unreported whatever reason, top issues europe has.

Finally, Russia China, whose numbers clearly bullshit, especially China, numbers especially early mathematically impossible lol.

Using current death toll (and splitting difference numbers), atleast 66 million cases worldwide Mad Max.

[10 Scientific Ideas Scientists Wish Would Stop Survival Fittest

Paleoecologist Jacquelyn Gill says people misunderstand basic tenets evolutionary list would ""survival fittest."" First, actually Darwin's words, secondly, people misconception ""fittest"" means. Relatedly, there's major confusion evolution general, including persistent idea evolution progressive directional (or even deliberate part organisms; people get idea natural selection), traits must adaptive (sexual selection thing! random mutations!).

Fittest mean strongest, smartest. simply means organism fits best environment, could mean anything ""smallest"" ""squishiest"" ""most poisonous"" ""best able live without water weeks time."" Plus, creatures always evolve way explain adaptations. evolutionary path may random mutations, traits members species find attractive. /r/LeopardsAteMyFace material Please provide list jobs would suited diabetics. multiply number 5 actual number 5 two weeks number .. couldnt bothered wear mask... stay away other..

Comparing 2 right asinine. many reasons. 

Anybody people compare 2 tell this:

COVID-19 deaths: 500k (I'm rounding up)

Spanish Flu: 50 million.

So even 1% Spanish Flu deaths.

That accounting population. Population adjusted would 350 million Spanish Flu deaths. 

So around 0.14% way their.

That one major difference anytime somebody starts compare Spanish Flu stop listening. people morons.

For fun though: influenza coronavirus, world much younger, WWI causes lot young people weak, trench warfare inadvertently causes humans put selective pressure virulent strains 1918 influenza spread more, etc.

COVID-19 like 1918 Flu. Comparing two like comparing accidental apartment fire fire bombings Tokyo. Per [this direct quote one authors study: ""...you internal organ damage know it."" Full quote article.

So take issue using word ""damage"". Neither article uses words like ""lingering"", ""permanent"", ""long-term"", etc. sure came from. God absolute fuckhead. asshole. Good job Italy. I‚Äôve seen alternative action. done. I‚Äôm cautiously optimistic that, fact know many top minds working hard fast get nailed get there. Even still, I‚Äôd surprised see 2020 think message (along pandemic, unfortunately) become political one. takes time right, even they‚Äôre best world Considering article also referenced pandemics modern era, clearly read it. really lesson though? 16 people got sick none seriously ill they'll say wasnt big deal. lowest common denominator people = lowest common denominator thinking. ?? They‚Äôve averaging around 200-300 deaths day, it‚Äôs 2000 nowhere Painless have? Yes, there's lot uncertainty details, clear Beijing outbreak traces back imported European salmon. 

The current working theory someone European fish factory contaminated salmon. Viruses fine frozen, someone market got infected. Next thing know, superspreader event 100+ infected across Beijing. 

The whole thing shows fast single SSE explode.

A working vaccine cannot come fast enough, knowing China, they'll probably vaccinate travel workers food import staff first. Cubic parabola. thundering herd buffoons... Coronavirus: 'Major breakthrough' UK scientists find ~~cheap~~ steroid cuts COVID-19 deaths.

Previously cheap - *FTFY* Everything risk getting exposed pathogen, honestly 99.9% people 99.9% time matter.

We care number shifted become people deadly Covid infection. go back caring like Covid gone always someone done compulsory reading... encouraging minority. Bolsonaro already get coronavirus beginning? 

Although immune, probably would've turned political point. would hoax. would medical professionals carry guns? mean hope that's case? insane. hope recovers gets kidneys back! hope get past timeline soon. wish everybody peace, good health, please take care yourselves. Cuts death rate anywhere one third one fifth? That's still statistically *very* significant, especially virus contagious one. doesn‚Äôt bother me. annoyed entire social distancing thing everyone pushes. Yet comes getting ole germ tube everyone nuts butts jammed other. happened social distancing? don‚Äôt want peasants me, want space! Flu like symptoms usually mean fever scary see people thread read headline, lap without understanding/read article draw conclusions headline article didnt understand/read.

No wonder things going shit around world. main study retracted. source suggests 5G harmful way. Compliance fatigue stay-home real, there's hope. Cultures prevalent mask adoption suggests simpler measures tolerated long term. Fortunately, current data suggest masks + distancing, perhaps restriction large gatherings, control spread pretty effectively. Concern billionaire's meager $1000 investment company par criticizing skin tone hair.

Dissent one thing. Continuous tabloid bullshit another. Get ready see headline repeated nation coming weeks. 


Nothing changed, people. anywhere near enough testing contact tracing, let alone immunity yet, vaccine cure. got nice mean went away. peer reviewed = validated = proven Sweden deaths care homes Denmark Finland. Sweden around 50% right now, whereas DK FI third 40% respectively. 

Norway worse Sweden, though, mentioned 60%. 

So clear places *relatively* better protecting elderly.  That's worrying AF man...I read antibody treatment that's developed Llamas antibodys, able target COVID spike proteins. supposedly gives month two profilactic protection, also could treat active infections...kinda gives ignorant hope possible cases chronic virus messed up...shit baffles me... agree. subs many interest hobbies. people pretty decent helpful. statistics CFR IFR, much higher reality. 99% people won‚Äôt die, yes fact, sure basis think false? can‚Äôt bully people keeping safe. Worry take personal responsibility. COVID adding small degree risk world already full risk death. Czech Republic Greece surprisingly well too! oh snap... consistent meat packing plant outbreaks. many people lost minds platform Social Media general. comments every single post official german channels horrifieing read. Even $100 still quite high, test positive need several tests later. airplane? going happen. Plus, hold most. Ha! Cheap now. would put sarcasm smilie sadly I'm serious.

Thanks again, really appreciate recommendations such. merely statement fact giving scope large issue U.S. yes absolutely compared impact. added TB comparison.  issue long whatever raw materials required available.

Surely epidemiologists India informed view...no? Ah. embarrassed doubt, change goalposts. That‚Äôs makes sense open bars social distancing No, numbers calculated deaths/infected, it‚Äôs 1% sense word. 

Yes are, even don‚Äôt wear mask, chance becoming infected reduces result infected around wearing mask. 

It‚Äôs pretty big deal. 1% US population around 3 million people. death wasn‚Äôt big deal, cops wouldn‚Äôt investigate murders. 

There‚Äôs compassion involved towards people willingly spreading virus, sorry. 

You could argue would wrong. Limiting exposure people thing limit virus without vaccine. really debate. reason don‚Äôt make people sick? lockdown stops large gatherings infected pass along virus. 

I mean uneducated enough pretend see value wearing face mask, doesn‚Äôt make less dick. Sucks it‚Äôs ‚Äònot fine‚Äô wear mask half hour save people, you‚Äôre still selfish dick. 

If minor step could taken minimise said risk. 

Being edgy isn‚Äôt going save bub. Would go meet relatives friends you‚Äôre sick? parents grandparents might die, gonna tell them? ‚ÄòDamn mom life full risks, sucks raised dick that‚Äôs risk took see you‚Äô Normal? 
In France almost everything reopen mask order, pretty well followed. call normal taught lot way influential people manufacture consensus country, vulnerable many otherwise intelligent people convinced something patently ridiculous.   still haven‚Äôt answered single question.

Does covid affect turf wars gangs Malm√∂?
Haven't heard anything ""front"" lately. Laxminarayan explained fact nearly 50% COVID-19 deaths India people 60 compared 4% Italy 5% whole Europe refute belief India‚Äôs strength virus fact young population 90% 60. said many people India age 60 Italy, expected people age group would die India Italy. But, forcefully argued, undermine argument young population, India‚Äôs ability withstand virus greater. I'm curious going change way used anti malarial well. Meanwhile asked owner grocery store work raise said yes still waiting take effect. you, course, need reasonable go ""that five mile jog, come back Olympics"".

So would consider ""serious training"" aka adequate amount tests change flair? set bar high, makes lousy brother. realize heart disease, high blood pressure diabetes big comorbidities covid, right? reason prevent people getting it. People getting cancers screened, whole thread suicides kill people covid joke. good news comes treatment. Also hugely benefits U.S. pharmaceutical companies able mark higher margin. He's nobody celebrity, he's hugely popular athlete, arguably best ever sport, huge social media following.

Understanding fighting sort misinformation important part educating people pandemic. Ignoring ""were tmz"" missing point entirely. stuff damaging can't ignore hope goes away. Bring attention fact insane. nice see theres mega class morons worldworld. reality:

People think customers comes news TV. I'm sorry product.

Advertisers customers, programs delivery method, product.

24/7 News channels simply took Howard Stern approach found better way monetize it. reasonable human would think outrageous unfounded opinions would cause lot people change channel. right, even larger portion hate-watch it, larger portion enter echo-chamber radicalize themselves. Source ? need help, father said vaccine covid 19 available watced conspiracy theory videos RFID chips. I'm scared he'll catch one day it. arguments scientific article prove whole thing BS? Good touch rolling. check leronlimab. company makes cytokine storm theory almost start small trials used far incredible results. larger trial ended early get data, I'd expect released soon. Probably cheap early data getting almost everyone took hospital 5 days something. Obviously still know it'll look larger scale super promising start. What's solution? actually seen SR article now. Good clarification! Thanks insight, BukkakeKing69. Everyone know that‚Äôs Covid either dealt months debilitating issues died. Anecdotal, yes, try share much can. partner 30s, healthy shape. got March, infection long gone, episodes inflammation lasted 2 months, fatigue still here. know 2 friends also age general health exact experience - months horrible battle slow recovery lingering problems now. hometown grew family friend mom‚Äôs passed suddenly infection weeks. 

Now everyone know got infected serious issues doesn‚Äôt mean aren‚Äôt plenty people know may also gotten infected didn‚Äôt know it. pointing point view, it‚Äôs pretty common ‚Äúmild‚Äù non hospitalized cases generally fuck still. compare death rate people statins big news? Here's news: People stupid. breaking news though, known while. disagree. think important people show disagree politically still sympathize. like see it. always makes laugh. I'm British pharmacist kept hearing prednisone anything American thought mispronouncing prednisolone. Turns actually use prednisone, drug serves exactly purpose costs 10x much. Fuck bigot think downfall country based calling people stupid shit say criticizing anyone anything seen political. someone pulling aside saying, ""Hey, fucking idiot"" beyond me. might agree drug company actually spent money developing drug begin with, reality ignored 90% drugs developed drug companies uses government research government grants money. vast amounts money drug companies put drugs development drugs, advertising drug whores visit doctors office try convince doctors prescribe wonder drug. Force sell lowest price 9 dollars difference would drug companies would stop flying doctors Caribbean bribe them, stop paying old cheerleaders visit doctors push drugs rely instead doctors ability determine drugs prescribed. Sort of? mucus membranes pouring rivers mucus, hard viral particles ""swim upstream"". hand, coronavirus, mucus flowing, that's probably great people around you. one knew going like. East Asians better prepared know socially conform matters instead rebelling rich enough support social welfare systems countries ""me first"" cultures and/or underfunded welfare systems take strain people work weeks. low? Ridiculous. I'm saying headline false, fact hundred scaremongering comments taking gospel alarming horrifying anecdotes like omg MUH lungs MUH heart! dead friends parents!

Cuz /r/covid19positive lot ""guys totally swear God it. ate legs paralyzed brother. None us got tested Teehee"". love people actually think one going use kind thing maliciously despite literally 30 fucking years internet history says abused problem. Ok smart ass biggest study said based flawed data retracted. think back ""we know yet"" category. 

Given attention gotten, little conclusive evidence found, suspect benefits, any, small. we've doubled lowball estimate month half spare. Also screws people under-employed. Per capita numbers better comparing bad things locations differing populations. 

For example, 3000 people dying city 100,000 different 3000 people dying city 50,000. That's twice death rate. 

That's obviously simplified example, reality use things like population density many factors determine effects specific thing. That's important look absolute numbers per capita numbers. also people study stuff spend 8-10 years getting educated. know. unimaginative. something creative descriptive like ... dunno ... less German? bet there's even official abbreviation like CwA. That's false well though. Per capital hospitalizations AZ 23.5 May 16 June 16th 52.3. That's nearly 100% increase 1 month. FL 37.9 57.7 per capita hospitalizations month.

Also, hospitalizations lag 2-3 weeks. person gets infected generally takes 5 days notice symptoms (if any). point, people request test self-care home. However day 10-14 symptoms progressively get worse visit hospital seen. average patient takes 3-10 days hospital, survive, 14-21 days death final outcome.

So hospitalization numbers today, confirmed cases 1-2 weeks ago (infection + 5 days + 3 days test + 5 days things getting worse). Deaths patients went 14-21 days hospital, puts getting infected Memorial Day.

We've started seeing increase confirmed cases Memorial Day, deaths hospital bed utilization. likely come next week. enough, take away Twitter access man, although feel NY least leaders screwed straight we're least ready round 2 comes here. Anyone internet connection watch conservative leadership telling everyone disease effect young people. saying virus overblown. young people listening ignoring social distancing recommendations. absolutely leadership issue. hard tell early. Southern states getting hit pretty hard may still reach higher plateau stay there. think deaths going get crazy high like NY overwhelmed. definition lack surge capacity.

The beds least important aspect. need:

- Ventilators patients need them
- Staffing care patients
- PPE keep staff patients safe

That's part capacity. I'd argue staffing single important aspect.

It's great surge capacity staff stretched thin. one things insurance cover. costs FAR to. 

For cynical example, many insurances 100% cover vasectomies. elective completely unnecessary procedure. 
 one reduces potential costs childbirth/care. pay quickly. mob lynched deaths continue remain current levels slowly decline it‚Äôs actually quite reasonable see number low. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely scenario large case numbers seeing states that‚Äôs kind uncertainty confidence interval accounts for. clue point is. 

Spanish Flu occurred almost zero international travel. people lived rural areas. Cars almost non-existent. People rarely traveled outside village town. average age world literally DECADES younger

World population 1/7 today. 

Even Spanish Flu killed 50 million people.


We nearly 8 billion people, travel long distance, anytime given time 1 million people air plane (that hyperbole: usually 1 MILLION people air given time). 


COVID-19 kileld median age death 80s. 80s.

There barely 80s around Spanish Flu kill. 


Again comparing COVID-19 Spanish Flu pure asinine dribble. like ""Spanish Flu 2x bad"". like Spanish Flu 500x worse.

Within 20 years COVID-19 essentially forgotten. People 30 like ""Oh yeah weird time"". 

That it.

1918 Flu talked hundreds years. Good catch there. don‚Äôt get people still option wear masks. country, actually passed law masks mandatory go out. hefty fine got caught. People becoming complacent numbers still high. never positive feeling since whole shit started, hopes last couple weeks. Things looking grim again. Again. That‚Äôs irrelevant comparison

96 degrees 90% humidity miserable 106 degrees 95% humidity Oh honey, first wave never really left us. Wealthier people afford education; understand value science, therefore wear masks. exactly story about. way noting effective mask (ie:95% particles more). giving really good idea invention ! murder rate U.S. 2018 5.3 per 100,000

In NYC murder rate 3.4 per 100,000.


The death rate Covid-19 NYC ages 18-44 20.39 per 100,000.


Do realize posts read like old people die Covid-19, ok old people dieing? bribed right people; came deemed ""Essential"" interviewed state's department public health testing positive, specifically asked notify airline tracking passengers flown week prior.  said way knowing flew were, got sick would tracked person's department health...

Personally, thought messed method containment tracking, position argue fact. current hospitalized people graph? Canada. example BC went high 159 April 1st 12 hospitalized. Ontario high 900 hospitalized early May around 300. kind proves two provinces declining rates. missing part immunity durable. body stops producing antibodies protect coronaviruses period time. mutations cause this. blurb top reported cases June 16 include 2,622 new cases 1,476 cases previously diagnosed among Texas Department Criminal Justice inmates reported local health departments (887 Anderson County 589 Brazoria County). Sorry, basement apartment 11th floor. Hold breath long can.

We've feared since beginning immunity last long, personally hoping would still mean 12-24 months instead dropping 40% 1-3 months Roosevelt study suggested. 

That's *necessarily* damning ability combat virus. plenty medications people inject daily, weekly, monthly. Even vax needs boosted monthly, start HCW's screeners expand depending cost, we'll outlook worlds better today.

so 75+ age group ifr 1%*48.7%= are, even don‚Äôt wear mask, chance becoming infected reduces result infected around wearing mask

The reduced chance infected concern people want wear pretty big deal. 1% US population around 3 million people. death wasn‚Äôt big deal, cops wouldn‚Äôt investigate murders.

Million people already dead various cases, driving, alcohol, etc every year. yet ban driving compassion involved towards people willingly spreading virus, sorry.

Likewise, expect compassion people want wear mask, exposure people thing limit virus without vaccine

Its necessary limit exposure, death rate mean uneducated enough pretend see value wearing face mask, doesn‚Äôt make less dick

Likewise. uneducated enough pretend see people different value regarad wearing mask, doesn‚Äôt make less dick.

it feels like effort put bad uses no?

it's like times people say I'd put much effort getting playing games studying school I'd much better off.

I can't imagine living country rushes contain outbreak 100.

We average 20,000 new cases per day. Yeah I've seen YouTube interview lowkey Hmm. Maybe COVID-19 still exists magically stopped hospitalizing killing people.

(I'm sarcastic. virus may become slightly less deadly depending treatments younger/healthier demographics, still hospitalizes kills people high enough rate become visible statistics eventually. phenomenon observing almost definition lag and/or reporting error. Keep watching see confirmation this.) Packed beaches fine, pretty much anywhere outdoors What‚Äôs point? Let virus spread like US? Yeah, I'm surprised there's fewer them, say there's Norwegians traveling Sweden would thus proven lie. fun see cross border summer goes on. another note thinking study wonder happened b/c fit ""viral emergence"" narrative become popular questions reinfections arose. Right, maybe retarded.

A growing mountain deferred operations. Stockholm Medical Association's Johan Styrud describes current situation. time, warns cost dealing high - money human suffering.

Alarms care debt: ""Suffering death""


Concern growing within care so-called care debt. digital demonstration Sunday, demands made announced savings requirements emergency hospitals Stockholm withdrawn, notifications Karolinska Hospital.

However, according Health Association chairman Sineva Ribeiro, participates recorded speech connected protesters, savings requirements unique Stockholm region, however.

- see country. feel starting gain control pandemic, back cutbacks notice. work, says Sineva Ribeiro.

She notes number planned advanced surgeries Sweden starting approach 60,000. things as, example, osteoarthritis knee joints, groin fractures gallstones, non-acute infrequently painful conditions cause great suffering many.

In addition, figure deferred operations underestimated, believes Johan Styrud, chairman Stockholm Medical Association. because, principle, planned care closed down, meant operations planned period extent otherwise had.

- 50 100 200 percent wrong, know. real figure higher, says Johan Styrud.

By comparing spring many reception visits care Stockholm usually spring months, estimates hundreds thousands reception decisions made.

The Stockholm region estimated purely financial care debt region SEK 1.5‚Äì2 billion. announcement Anna Sarbrink (L), Health Region Council, recently. Johan Styrud believes figure significantly higher, partly believes number pending operations underestimated partly overtime reorganizations required result extra costs.

- Microscopy-diagnosed cases colon cancer decreased 70 percent lately. think covid-19 cures cancer cases safe home instead detected, says Johan Styrud.

Does mean lives lost this?

- Absolutely. cost lot, financially form human suffering death, says Johan Styrud.

According Sineva Ribeiro, naive attitude soon pandemic settles, start pay care debt. simple.

- staff severely struggled pandemic also take care operations, says.

Therefore, employers must first foremost ensure healthcare staff gets holiday summer, otherwise sickness rate increase, warning Ribeiro.

In Stockholm, currently looks like doctors nurses statutory four-week vacation, according Johan Styrud.

However, Sineva Ribeiro believes better scheduling, better work environment, colleagues decent salary trend also needed compensate work done healthcare staff spring.

""You thank salary, important,"" says Sineva Ribeiro. ‚ÄúPreviously cheap‚Äù

I clearly made fun religion made serious statement smoke really represented. I'm aware I'm mocking.

My comments targeted towards grieving. comments attack idiocy religion. earth two hemispheres don‚Äôt think anyone really asking poor people.

That‚Äôs literally it. Arizona's Covid inpatients: Got damnnit Kelly clarkson lied 
To us extra work reading say whether percent positive going up? saw Arizona skyrocketing seen much others Karen know IRL sweet lady. deserve stigma. Hard government intervention nationwide mandated lockdowns quarantine rules got situation back control.

you know, thing might call *autocratic* yet number people wear mask public probably much fucking lower. say sounds like reservation casino. California casinos run reservations opened advice health officials everything else opened up. reservations, think subject rules rest state, sort semi-sovereign status allowed casinos first place states gambling illegal. One would think since Native Americans seem susceptible illness whatever reason put greed health. Important distinction article ***positive test rate new cases rose 97% 5,115 week ended June 14, **14% COVID-19 tests coming back positive compared 6% prior week**  cases South Carolina rose 86% 4,509, **the positive test rate rose 14% 9% period**  Oklahoma....**the positive test rate increased 4%, 2%** previous week

All often people state 'more testing, cases' - data clearly indicates infections increased. U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar said Monday night father died due complications COVID-19.

‚ÄúIt tremendous sadness pain share father, Nur Omar Mohamed, passed away today due complications COVID-19,‚Äù said brief statement Monday evening. ‚ÄúNo words describe meant knew him. family ask respect privacy time.‚Äù

Her statement started phrase Arabic:‚Äé‚ÄùInna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji‚Äôcuun,‚Äù translates to: ‚ÄúSurely belong God shall return.‚Äù

In 2018, Omar became first Somali-American elected Congress.

I know lie know is. believe anything Harvard anymore. They've lost credibility eyes. think picture? **Top photo fans Georgia Tech Football game Spanish Flu 1918 - Bottom photo fans racing event weeks ago Memorial Day Weekend North Carolina**  2 half months ago.

The second locked response worse virus. pry cold, dead body restraints Hagrid's Motorbike Adventure! /s Thanks that! Wish data entire crew! burning them. Never Chinese crap. Starting CCP. Nuke start crying blood knees. surrender quicker Japanese did. stop testing ignore dead, it‚Äôs actually like COVID19 doesn‚Äôt even exist! could add curse words phones dictionary, know. need work around.   everyone, killed younger people would get attention. Old people already lived fulfilling lives Thank study 2008 rats, 12 years Covid even thing.

This single dumbest reason heard medication doesn‚Äôt work despite clinical study saying does. 12 year old study fucking rats weren‚Äôt even dealing disease currently fighting.

Brilliant stuff common mistaken assumption people make based counterintuitive mathematical truth. take truly random sample analyze it, size sample significant effect margin error, calculated. 30 million people, Tokyo huge population population 3 million 3 billion, margin error would regardless. Even though 2000 people tiny fraction population completely sufficient give reliable estimate entire population long representative. point reaction problem, become worse problem itself? Genuine question.. feels like we‚Äôre already past that. seems lot people ignorant it. really hope so. frakly care going eat would like hang friends again.  contracting virus passing someone everything you.

Can't wait criminal statutes updated reflect take people transmitting diseases (any disease, knowingly unknowingly) guilty crimes somewhere criminal negligence, manslaughter, outright murder. logical conclusion statement, since transmitting HIV already considered assault deadly weapon quite states. I'm sure folks colds flu would love that, I'm sure lawyers salivating extorting allergy sufferers pay defense motivated accuser overzealous prosecutor. great recipe societal economic collapse too. Exactly..to compare ridiculous insulting soldiers sacrificed lives.

Mostly old people already way died due virus Business open good :) healthcare workers? woman coughed intentionally person bagel shop also healthcare worker? Texas federal governments pretty clearly signalled point they're going herd immunity. living America question *when* catch it, *if*.

There's point half-assed restrictions they're going try contain it.

Millions Americans going die government handling this. matter seriously young people take this. honestly feel like learn much reddit source. sure you‚Äôre u.s. selling American people binary choice one part fucked us hard. Everyone could we‚Äôd work together. 
 
Taiwan countries literally handful deaths. We‚Äôve killed people u.s. time took type message Taiwan dead since onset. yet we‚Äôve got everyone convinced either need risk life go fuel economy, hole wait die basement. middle ground. think - least start - greed.  post stupid overdramatic bs, like expected correct apologize. clicked read actual study remarkably similar way conducted results. God knows Spanish one almost totally ignored media gives English one large coverage. guess ethnic biases even extreme thought.  Read way thread. matter? Risk risk. contagion something else end result same. even close bad... wonder. Corona around since least last ice-age, came thousands, millions mutations new mutations seen miracle.

This expected like expected human body learns deal new mutation always past. way hell could torture like that. getting tested thought ‚Äúoh hurts little I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs over‚Äù BAM moves twists bunch. know I‚Äôm wimp SUCKED. 

I also random massive nosebleed days later. Related? Probably not, doesn‚Äôt happen often lol say that? wear mask everywhere wish mandatory.

Two completely different viruses can‚Äôt used draw comparisons. Influenza coronavirus related far viruses. think H, Humanism. Meh, look world rose coloured power you. idea social distance stay home much possible keep curve flat vaccine ready.

The sad part is, Americans selfish comes going eat going public gatherings, would rather get Chipotle sacrifice freedoms bigger picture.

I lost faith America last 5 1/2 months NY here. Lock down. No, won't. even much, especially since mostly old people.

Hundreds thousands die every year US due various diseases, yet one gives shit certainly compare freaking WW1 covid-19 becoming old news fast affecting lives way, shape form

Your short attention span irrelevant. course Covid-19 affecting us all, middle damned pandemic. seem strongly advocating ""fuck it, people going die"" strategy. us find reprehensible. goal, think, balance physical health economic health needs. Let people work require masks minimize gatherings better treatment strategy, vaccine, transmission rate drops low enough long enough virus longer circulating stop new outbreaks using contact tracing targeted quarantine. wonder would fight city/county added regulations getting hit really hard. Cases region (Tampa Bay) trending upwards continues expect mentioned hotspot national news 2 3 weeks. fine. know plenty people gotten tested drive throughs. Really smart idea..... 

So immunity spreads people *get virus*, right? Yet good treatment disease, even still, nevermind actually make decisions. Covid-19 kills something like half percent infects.

So, even half country gotten virus first months, *still* would reached herd immunity, *still* would lost almost million people now.

I believe ordinary troll... guess possible actually sociopath, too... maybe suffering kind synaptic deficiency something. Puzzling. I‚Äôm glad said this. normally pretend things don‚Äôt happen. need aware abuse neglect matter pandemic not. Age group minimal risk, sport natural distance players outdoors. 

Seems reasonable. sad. remember seeing photos traveling DC sworn touched relationship. pathetic compare freaking war.. think point consumers stop consuming physically can‚Äôt consume They're following example. analogous comparing completed dataset one still growing. One thing Georgia backdating numbers. 

SO get positive test result back today, count something like 1.5 weeks ago. 

The result ALWAYS downward trend higher 1.5 weeks ago today. Nakakahiya mga peenoise noh? 

Here quite good resource, Blue solid line 3rd graph shows test numbers. Who's idiot throwing trash obviously!&lt; Yes, lots wearing masks wonder speaking POTUS ever benefited fight virus. somehow doubt it. bigli Lol. I‚Äôm happy don‚Äôt mindset dozen neighbors talking month ago. mostly kills old people, mostly people existing health problems Fox says fine.

Because Florida gradually realized everyone present except old health problems contribute mortality. people sacrificed them, probably starting 80-year-old mobility scooter supplemental oxygen honestly looked bit upset spectacularly high total chance dying sooner expected.

You get 80 hurry die. 

It's also fair weigh life mine that's choice we're making. Never trade lives to. want kidney damage hospital bills might get even I'm nowhere near dying, scooter dude want box yet.

Which wearing mask saying ""it's old people bro"" kind shit-headed asshattery. good üëç Trump talk Fauci, problem exist. you‚Äôre immunosuppressed, virus could kill you. you‚Äôre immuno compromised, immune system goes insane could kill you. Luckily people fall normal group two fine healthcare worker.

smh Nobody wearing masks Alachua county, Florida despite fact 1/4 TOTAL cases past week. Part jump ‚Äúagricultural community‚Äù even without that, it‚Äôs much higher usual. 

The folks live think wearing mask imposing personal freedoms. Gonna bad look counties start closing shit regardless says. CDC saying 4-5 days median symptoms onset tests done mild cases usually much quickly potential symptoms develop improves reporting actual onset occurred.

Testing reporting lag also improved significantly. probably depends state, nowhere near bad early outbreak backlogged tests taking week get results out.

Anecdotally, know two people came symptoms, one tested positive result within 8 hours waking first mild symptoms (on Saturday less) reported negative next morning. South Korea symptoms, well, live virus connected infections relapses.

The next step figure infectious right now. Lab culture, takes two weeks.

Let's see replicate South Korea's results panic. Noooooooooo ....don't shut down! overblown!! /s though?

Your logic doesn‚Äôt follow.

How mock people doing?

Can mock wearing fish head you‚Äôre wearing fish head?

Do sound less confused say ‚Äúoh sarcastic‚Äù point aren‚Äôt wearing fish?

The use incense smoke Christian rites merely symbolic, represents purity presence divine.

It doesn‚Äôt even represent salvation, let alone conveying actual absolution.

You realized fact.

You realized tried mock something didn‚Äôt understand backtracked clumsily.

You can‚Äôt logically retroactively exempt contradiction contradicted yourself. 

And comments targeted towards grieving?

If you‚Äôre mocking ‚Äúidiocy religion‚Äù targeting people use religious rites grieve memorialize dead?

You realize bishop memorializing people service people community want loved ones memorialized right? 

And he‚Äôs also memorializing people part church he‚Äôs extending symbolic sign respect others. 

How worthy derision? 


Internet anonymity might blinded here‚Äôs reminder: mocking grief processes religion performance intellectual superiority something vacuum. disrespectful grieving dead would liked memorialized way.

Regardless personal beliefs feelings religion, there‚Äôs time place pseudointellectual preening don‚Äôt think it. article 2622 figure, seems added another 1479 initially counted came Dept Justice.

Also, argument never excess deaths, argument US individual states extreme spikes point time.

Regular obesity low enough BMI get pure muscle going gym. entirely possible actually puts higher risk even otherwise healthy. I've completely unable find data (though mostly applies younger people, ludicrously low risk already). mean risk lower outside zero.

I ok knowing protests risky, considering size groups. Especially larger cities. pretend risk order support protesters.

Look have, outdoors, people wearing masks, hot humid weather. That's plus.

Not great shouting close one another, cloth masks, people getting kettled, arrested shoved paddywagons kept hours, people getting gassed, crying, apparently panic attacks there. 

Remember influenza pandemic killed many Philadelphia residents war bonds parade September 1918. know parade contributed horrific outbreak had. think unlucky late September primed second wave, maybe weather cooler drier. got hit badly.

I'm glad Minneapolis looks like spike (yet.) praying cities. support protests fully understand could stop protests. 

I also want people side really consider whether protests truly morally equivalent. Protestors risked getting shot rubber bullets losing eyes. kind fun street festival. believe cause important took streets protest police violence. say going beach getting margaritas really bad faith argument. Protesting injustice important part democracy works, **YES, I'm also horrified** see happened pandemic. Let's little perspective really see situation is, *not fucking ideal situation.* best hope people *want* see situation clearly. There's still nothing conclusive it. Going beach still requires accessing mutual public indoor facilities many cases. going friend's house. salty consensus sub cautious? wrong that? Yes yes Somehow always manages wrong wrong time. know imo new level retardation even him. That's crazy. Keep safe. playing smartly. I'm Florida. 0% rules followed. I'm usually 1 1-3 see mask anywhere go hundreds wearing one.

Every restaurant packed, definitely 50% capacity. Every bar packed. Tractor Supply employees wearing masks last week, nobody wiping carts. means goal President life bill never comes due. makes iq tests? administers them? picks people administer them?

there already laws place prevent discrimination happens constantly. think people would vote well enough iq test? can't see results mysteriously vanishing somehow score lower? Further, IQ tests good indication educated someone is. 

[Here's reading Sorry, he-who-shall-not-be named right ""when test more, get cases."" Testing still important -- especially nursing homes, hospitals, prisons, schools -- testing general population identifies asymptomatic mild cases, would clinically insignificant absence ""pandemic."" 

If tested every single American, we'd probably identify mountain ""cases"" -- mostly asymptomatic clinically meaningless -- what? Would lock people China-style ""hospitals"" (jails) two weeks? Would economic social damage worth it? 

Alternatively, focus testing important vulnerable members society -- and, alongside targeted testing, carefully monitor hospital bed usage deaths. 

And, look deaths, epidemic improving *a lot.* Today, 300 fewer deaths week ago -- massive win!

At point, Americans need decide incessantly obsess ""spiking cases"" ""mountains cases"" -- risking never reopening schools, offices, vacation destinations -- move life celebrate epidemic longer clinically significant deaths continue fall. r/nottheonion really reality now. trump bless kept entertained lock down(bleach etc), i'm sorry say cost many lives go r/COVID19 science come laughs! can't make shit up. hear shit like nursing homes psych units. america fucked, good lord Arizona 1,479 ICU beds. estimate 54% (798) currently occupied non-COVID patients. remaining 681 ICU beds, estimate 452 occupied COVID cases, 66% available speaks you‚Äôre temper tantrum citing TFA increase cases *partially due increased testing*.

I cannot believe many people wear masks crammed pubic settings. It‚Äôs toss tbh. Joe Biden, mayonnaise politicans vs orange. america pick lunch? man actually braindead. Believe me, supporting Reagan ignoring AIDS. way sentence phrased. Ignoring AIDS worked fine Reagan. much vulnerable populations. fine Reagan. Yeah there‚Äôs reason think power water infrastructure would collapse don‚Äôt need much labor input anymore. Also low low fuel prices. ‚ÄúIf stopped voting right now, we‚Äôd changes, any‚Äù created cure every disease! diagnosis = official cases. dumbass. Brilliant THUH LIBRUHL SIGHENTISTS Context important. care What's fucking crazy he's TRYING say COVID control stopped anything it, would go away own, believes he's fucking moron. actually poorly worded... he's fucking moron. appreciate perspective, point stands. seeing act beach everything else goes that. 

Gotta take shit? Need refreshments? Stopping anywhere along way destination? things lead beach dangerous. 

As counter argument own, sure live right next beach walking home onto beach back home...your probably ok. many beach that? ""if one reporting cases, exist"" clear sarcasm... stop testing, number actual cases go (they may actually go), virus still spread, what's stopping it? essentially sweeping rug ignoring regardless existence. need statistics know that. Kudos using term ya gotta spell right. 

Schadenfreude existed long Trump, disrespect intended, method counterintuitive unproductive really matters. Violent acts violent acts still violence. guess applying strategy voting... misrepresenting? one said Trump said stop testing. They're pointing idiotic bring like proves anything. while. Captain fucking obvious Oh one Trump style jokes say something mind bogglingly stupid later say joke even though funny. Mr. President people dying Covid19 symptoms even though testing it.

Trump: ""No dying Obama disease, takes 1 year symptoms show kill you.""

But sir president 3 years, explain that?

Trump: ""Obama sneaky, time machine. heard Fox OAN."" r/technicallythetruth understand initial thought process this. Like oh yeah seeing numbers we're finally testing people.

I understand flying fuck keeps coming back continuously tries make make sense way around like sort applicable knowledge intentional plot. made episode Clinton remake quickly night aired Trump actually won. whole season shaped last-minute link tags directly mobile, go production section 2nd last sentence. confirmed Matt Trey stopped reporting murders would murder cases!

Also Airlines: enjoy 29 inch seat pitch.  ratio per research \~1/1000. That's social distancing wearing masks still important even first wave passed. bad rest world doesn't/didn't follow suit, chose nickel instead, it? ""The dirt underneath rug exist."" war ba sing se

Because dude going asterisk name. 19 means 19 covfefes. anyone even heard news past 30 years knew con man.


I can't believe many people fell it. Canada's population smaller California. dearly hope America testing people (by count) are. Maybe Dutch influence lol. think I'm affected petty insults; expected Dutch scum haha :D. Keep classy keep showing true colors. believe point guy highlighting, wasn‚Äôt agreeing trump(?)

A little bit coughing night long wait September/October. going explode five thousand sources instead couple cities international airports. Wow. I... wow. would knock teeth Eh think scrapped got single consensus also protests condemned super spreader risk.

Me going friend's house, that's two people interacting. going beach, really depends whether use bathrooms maybe dozen people (beaches crowded, people avoid gross bathrooms also tend open-air) we've seen evidence majority spread happens direct contact, surfaces. Going protest? Hundreds people. Even wearing masks, still much risky either activities.

And yet going friend's house beach frowned upon people could get sick die. 

How okay, then, encourage people already disproportionately likely infected gather hundreds days time? Or, little kids without much grasp reality functions yet would put cover eyes ‚ÄûIf can‚Äòt see you, can‚Äòt see me.‚Äú always soothing hear military prepared worse. would hate hear opposite: ""military prep best case scenario"". Obviously trending point good look raw number own, horrific. NJ peaked 8,000 hospitalizations 1/3rd population, hopefully trend wakes people continue. people continue careless...well exponential growth find you. we'd stop talking Trump, there'd zero stupidity, any. Management like exactly staying get hold virus. fact nobody wearing masks they‚Äôre technically mandatory unless store‚Äôs owner refuses service entry without one. girlfriend saw woman take mask scratch inside nostril, put back touch checkout countertop hand. Sadly, majority US adults major comorbidity worsens outcome, hypertension diabetes. many obese top logical people see trump rallies dangerous going NBA game. imagine NBA games, fans would asked wear masks too. asking masks trump rallies, I'd wager they're even risky attend.

Source: got unemployment way twice, different states, due good reason fire made much assuming people's concern idiocy statement rather dishonesty it.

Taking common sense idea further, understood saying testing lot, numbers look bad. That's true, many areas, testing showing increase percentage positive cases.

It's he's stupid, he's lying. Till date USA wasnt prepared anything wonder got conclusion tbh Ah ""if dont report crimes, dont crime problem"" gambit.....lets see pays Cotton Ahhh see... dumb, got skillz fuck 'em. They'll get give 'em. Me, got skillz man. earn big bucks literal shit.

South Korea prime example; aggressive comprehensive pandemic response early translates directly lack need continued mass testing. Likewise, country, consistent downtrends confirmed cases, hospitalization deaths forecloses need continued mass testing. 

The continued need test United States good thing all. 

Someone good point well, almost reasonable compare U.S. statistics countries state-by-state basis. disparity within U.S. alone pretty staggering, 5 states making 55% logged-covid deaths nation-wide, 10 states making 72%, 15 states making 82%. top that, states focus NYT journalists' ""under-reporting deaths"" investigations and/or ""excess deaths"" highest (NY, NJ, FL, Maryland) group top 10 72% logged deaths (indicating likely percentage covid deaths greater 72% U.S. 10 states). 

Crazy shit man. Lying people never good idea.

Reddit basically functions massive, crowd-sourced disinformation platform. Thousands upon thousands people encouraging supporting other's false beliefs.

The West's brilliant enemies build better propaganda network tried. wonder Tencent invested site. law large numbers start take over, I've already discussed variablities within numbers, well uncontrolled variables testing-application-per-1M well testing-quality. Even deaths-by-Covid lagging metrics reporting issues, well test-positivity. consider countries, variables, months months data, overwhelming strong favor HCQ, principal large numbers starts take over. morbidly obese senior hate trump - full context said Given statistics bound happen contact tracing. virus everywhere mention lives. Well, guess he's right, really good science stuff. Yup straight bioterrorism police despise Trump headline sensationalized example shit taken context get clicks.

In case anyone wants context around statement:

""President Trump Monday downplayed concerns rising number coronavirus cases states across country, **indicating increase due testing.**

**""If stop testing right now, we‚Äôd cases, any,**‚Äù Trump said White House event highlighting administration actions help senior citizens.

Trump's dual views testing full display message tweeted Monday morning. 

""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would **showing** almost cases. **Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!**"" Trump tweeted.

He saying cases exist people would magically somehow infected, he's saying aware them.

That said, assertion we've done great job testing provably false total BS. sure point is, ok like odds he's right we're actually real fucking stupid? Can't confirmed COVID cases nobody gets positive COVID test. Big brain.  spelled ""Noble"".

/s fall asleep 3 months ago wake up? perhaps hit head got bed morning? Well, that's california stayed low. among worst came testing. news ignored instead touted lockdown cureall.

I know fact hospitals california asking people sign documents attributing family deaths covid-19 know sure not. personally know someone happen them. hospital offered pay funeral would sign document saying cancer patient family member died covid. would it. I'm sure many take money. UK higher, Russia higher, Spain higher, Italy higher....there plenty more. Someone start go fund behalf move fuck pls story two days ago. new cases outbreaks. fucking hate Trump, quoting context makes look like ass.. spelled majority wrong drive working currently gone. 

I past good way keep occupied make side money sources. 

It's asinine working 50 hours every two weeks $600 position met furlough unemployment filing gave $650 *every single* week. Granted, $500 650 increase linked shutdown. 

Either way larger amount money makes surviving live alone possible. towns surrounding even require roommates really free money even much reasonable $2600 monthly. 

I'm five days back job already debating leaving. short-staffed (55 normal 85 people) shutdown - opening week led 5 people quitting various reasons.

So wasting 100+ hours month working ragged crappy environment making *less* fifty percent sitting around.. nothing. make enough money would maybe pay rent one bill that. 

This probably way around - no? I'm sorry delay! look procure source this. promise there. man retarded. Damn oh well . one point time white straight enough guarantee comfortable existence America. never develop skills kind. mediocrity cut it, they're absolutely terrified. person frequents imgoingtohellforthis mgtow throwing pity party - Hence downvotes anything ""America bad"" 

At peak far anti-China sentiment sub anti-Americanism (outside Trump's bungling ""response""). Lombardy somewhat worrying, keep mind many cases discovered might sick weeks ago, lag effect (they mostly asymptomatic almost asymptomatic, least institutions saying). also appear less severe overall. 

In general Lombardy handled beginning thing horrible way (wanting remain open people started filling ICUs unprecedented speed), led out-of-control spread. optimistic couple weeks follow trend regions, need monitor situation **very** carefully course, daily basis. phrase works. ‚ÄúAmong soldiers...‚Äù Army unit soldiers Roosevelt attached to? want suppress immune system you‚Äôre immune system severe response it‚Äôs suffocating creating much inflammation it‚Äôs killing - transplant patients also given steroids suppress immune systems prevent immune systems attacking new organs killing recipient. True, knowing incubation period C19, we'd least seen sign outbreak point. Signs certainly pointed right direction. Ok, get that. That's way handled country. contracted private security airport, certified. act like power tripping thugs like TSA. Woop dose U.S goes 0,25$ 50$ cool haha argument make sense supply chain retail differs supply chain medical suppliers. Well could hospitals ICU beds filled up. hospitals shut down. what? college aged people 700 car crashes 100 million miles driven, 200 result injuries 2 3 rich fatal. 10 hour car ride 500 miles, works 0.35% chance crash, 0.1% chance injury, .001% chance death math right. course, crashes things control like texting driving drunk, long distance solo drives also fatigue-related risk, make adjustments CDC counted 116 deaths people age 15-24 Covid19. assume people age group get covid rough proportion numbers general population, 10% covid cases age group, 200,000 known cases U.S. works 0.058% risk death contract covid.

But many undiagnosed cases left bring value down, may perfectly healthy also brings risk down. hand non-death outcomes covid19 including possible extended illness passing virus somebody else also want consider. can't estimate risk infection first place degree accuracy without knowing way detail either us flying.

So effectively, risks pretty low requires number really unsupported assumptions guess low could reasonably make either decision depending risks comfortable headline ridiculous! They're saying anyone flight caught it, nursing home went to:

""approximately 50 residents staff facility tested positive virus."" agree points make dick. realist. easy general public read articles think found cure covid. medical providers common sense us, general public hard filter new evidence based practice compared popular articles see promoted media. 

I remember frustrating articles surrounding tech companies cashing brownie points came ""we stepping develop ventilators help covid"" realizing machines go long grueling process evidence based practice, patient outcome efficacy, approved - training, education budgeting purchasing. takes year hospital even agree specific upgrade iv pumps. worked icu's different types ventilators - many articles coming comments ""oh yay there's 1000 extra ventilators fix old ventilators causing people die"". No. million different ways modes options change support patient 1 ventilator either changing fi02, peep, resp rate, tidal volume, inspiration time, peak pressure limits, etc public understand they're medically trained. also understand time due high mortality covid, left options withdrawing care - public reads ""something wrong ventilators people dying tesla gonna fix it"". summary, take articles grain salt. Unless local hospitals implementing best practices already, leave professionals. means positive news, false hope public thinking fight human kind.

I recall reading people surprised see people asthma negatively impacted.   Thank info! That's true. According data, ventilators normally, 3/8 people died. given drug, 2/8 people died. That's 33% (1/3) reduction deaths high level statistical significance. majority people dying, treatment makes possible even larger majority people Except I‚Äôm revelling bad news, way create false narrative head think reason mad me.

I'd bet 20% people limit spending necessities, namely vulnerable, rest 80-100% previous spending levels restrictions lifted.

I also think another NYC possible, even restrictions lifted. actively convince older populations stop washing hands often, go public much, etc...

Good lord believed myth life heard hundreds times many people. 

Newer casinos may pretty great air filtration tech unlikely thought. Ahh well, thanks forcing check beliefs. Masks aren‚Äôt 100 percent effective. Even doctors nurses access medical grade PPE trained use still getting infected thousands. highly likely vaxes development.. Look Oxford/AstraZenica.

""both sides fence"" funny way say ""because president made masks political position.""

It live television. pretend everyone guilty. Trump. cult wear masks doesn't, masks political.

Our testing huge look worse others dont test.

Why need misrepresented sub? 25th Amendment clearly dumbest comment I‚Äôve seen. realize there‚Äôs literal pandemic you‚Äôre worried people making ~15k year ‚Äútaking advantage system‚Äù?

Reach state representative. returned work PA, returned halfway biweekly claim period, somehow everyone claims set inactive could make final claim. us road traveling house house time spend phone, luck getting via phone call. emailed state representative, received response office next day, extremely fast correspondence, emailed UC behalf. following week, received call UC (which missed, considering workday phone me), left voicemail direct line extension speak someone. final claim done immediately.

TLDR: spent month trying file final week claim luck due current phone line email situation. state representative situation settled week. Contact state rep: Trump bright enought say anything anyone's head. Maybe toddler. metro areas required doctors referral since like first week April? 
In Texas major cities getting test based showing screening survey. knew I'd find controversial. right. read headline first article. mean way headline portrays be. I'm U.S. know truth he's saying. country testing bit lesser nukber people especially state stopped testing 2 days last week reduce daily count. [No lockdown state, country way]

The statement quality testing seems exaggeration, okay. accept that. 

But find actually WTFing statement ""double edged sword"". Concerned look vs testing comparison anyone do. simple choice : ""Fuck I'm looking let's erode problem away."" lot governments forget that. Yes, that's matter semantics. Look total tests people really think context?

I even read post, would assume said response number cases US vs countries testing lot smaller percentage population. ""if stop arresting people crime rate drop substantially!"" Wow. wowww. speechless guy come withüòíü§Æ cannot possible! Must scam. Nobody kind stuff without USA involved. Trumps point confuse nature situation hide ridiculously poor response. (obviously I'd prefer work job fulfilling, would happily even slightly money CERB supplies, that's whole conversation) stop testing now, we‚Äôd cases WOULD KNOWN.. lol. world live in? god stupid Fast forward Trump eliminates poverty lowering poverty line low one qualifies one said argument sound ignorance people reading headline parroting truth bs could vote someone logic? üßê I‚Äôm sorry 6 year old President seems relevant:

Uh, we're going tests done 90 days, people in, uh, 2 years ago taking 2 years do. they're making great progress. takes period time. they're making great progress. Uh, countries dealing people talking now. And...others, government universe. government people. honestly giving tremendous credit.

I swear either:

1. world become much political impossible escape kinds discussions



2. world always way I've naive WISH could test every single person! could respond appropriately. Asymptomatic cases meaningless. ones transferring it, unknowingly, vulnerable. r/nottheonion mean... he‚Äôs wrong.

The UK literally one densely populated countries western world counting tiny island nations sovereign states like Monaco, etc. large countries Europe even compares terms density Netherlands Belgium, higher density much lower overall population UK.

Another thing take account much international travel country gets, UK massive international business hub top high population density also brings lot business travel countries. That‚Äôs big if. likely, someone involved team leaked it. pretty much started the, ""WHO needs investigated,"" thing sign paperwork investigation done?  Even Trump total 180 started acting right, could anyone trust anything said ever? Redditors' dump joke Potus' real idea lmao Seems pretty straight forward me. took precautions keep hospital beds clear, mostly elderly nursing homes. models wrong, proactive steps proved fatally wrong. really think wanted secretly kill old people nursing homes? Except that‚Äôs article pulling quote. tweet came later day avoid God, dumbest fucking piece shit cock sucker planet. could anybody two working brain cells support kind idiotic thinking. can‚Äôt reopen business go bar cool. said tested less would cases infected yet? Duh? Even comment example understanding average is! true average. you‚Äôre referring median Came say that, picture explain wanted say that. Thanks! [Doesn‚Äôt say anything wave 40% majority. actually lost majority election. ironic Add list dementia warning signs Trump displays. Apply Trump logic big corporations getting $$$ bailouts...

‚ÄúIf stop reporting losses today, we‚Äôd losing little money, any‚Äù lol, jackass touting number one testing month ago. belongs /r/TrumpCriticizesTrump Conveniently, interview came today seems regret it. bad, thought was. 

Supporting statement endorsing 'spit facts' bc mask per airline policy far enough away harassing Karen. King Gorge-himself No. definition half people median. 

And tell us slope curve. might big plateau middle, 20% either side middle basically same. 

And giving concept *intelligence* accurately defined measured objective, numerical manner begin with. 

Which probably case. 

The proxy people use set decade old puzzles somebody came restricted language culture sense. Read parent comment wrong originally 1.5% positive cases dead NZ

Supports definitely better. personally going self-isolate much possible definitive end thing - maybe even beyond that, works coronavirus, also work flu colds.

I wonder practical entire country so? possible conduct least level trade maintaining distance. also quarantine new arrivals couple weeks. add tons testing.

Anybody know plan is? right, coronavirus endemic open quarantine, it'll eventually hit whole country. like others. That's mad government helping us. exactly time government providing assistance would rather spend money mega corporations themselves. done lightly also without precedent done much swiftly.

I totally agree. federal government hesitant invoke power actively avoiding it, opted lying public. lie attempting control behavior, without exerting authority would made extent crisis clear. ‚ÄúWhen **global pandemic**, privacy ***destroy*** attempts resolve problem,‚Äù says Mr. Knitowski. source what? US stopped testing amount positive tests would fall? really need citation that? Excellent complete misrepresentation full quote. Reddit propagandists hard work. Well, know reason protests people passionate making changes policing. However, infection numbers high protests. medical establishment waiting see spike infections. many people wore masks, outdoors sun wind helps disperse virus. shall soon see, Atlanta, Georgia new round protests, another incident, crowd massive. avoid old people like plague Trump stopped breathing, we‚Äôd Trumps, average response get ""oh please even done anything bad we'll fine."" look context situation? willfully ignorant means 118,283. Thought would look asked. That‚Äôs good way put it. Really?! Stop testing cases would low?!?! idiot Really good study uh, they're unemployed. So, receive infinitely unemployment earned? Stop giving Rockstar Games ideas GTA 6. game going real satire. Wow, guy delusional.  even know means propaganda dont activiely follow politics hear word president united states. Assuming live us, dont thats understandable people would stop dying, could live forever.  claim ignorance?  killed Socrates point NZ's community spread month already happening elsewhere world, giving time understand methods would effective it. Could US done thing month half earlier? Yeah probably would seemed ridiculous destroy much economy virus knew almost nothing about. NZ knew time started spreading therefore huge advantage.  said actually true. cannot argue that. Weren‚Äôt also saying don‚Äôt stop travel China this? find quite humurous everyone thread blaming single biggest reason US got screwed Coronavirus. 

Australia NZ told exactly thing masks (not effective, social distance, isolate, stay home etc). difference is, listened didnt scream BLAH BLAH RIGHTS go eat resturaunts bars. 

Stop blaming government take god damn responsibility. mental gymnastics you‚Äôre crazy. wow stable genius thing say literally feel headache coming reading title. mean. flights like 12+ hours long. survive, 12 hours without drink meal tough people full transcript video saying somewhere?

I doubt full quote. holy shit lol is.... think may something. Let‚Äôs use advantage Right, go ignorance defence. served well far. Lol think it‚Äôs 1mm edge nostril. see many people like that.  legit thought r/NotTheOnion saw hard forget quoted literally every Trump thread. Five bucks says tries fake heart attack live television day leave White House. Can't fault elderly buffoon. ignore problem - data. can't believe this, video? Yea, big brain time feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills  Somebody please tell quote taken context    doctor, nurse, respiratory therapist working COVID floors working door screening since virus blew up. never felt like front line worker. contact numerous people positive. COVID floors countless times take things. seen patients ventilators fighting survive passed. rarely recognized thanked do, mainly yelled cussed out, EVERY time see janitors staff work behind scenes make sure acknowledge them. quite new work friends play critical roles keep everyone safe hospital running.  
  
Side note: friends janitorial staff maintenance get pretty much anything want. hold true power!!! job..... get paid 20% store, don‚Äôt understand lots this. know hospitals would overflowing. beginning, thought covid patient would need weeks bed. 60000 patients showed hospitals mid april? also know excess beds gonna come from. I‚Äôve long since stopped questioning reality due jackass. accepted suffered kind cardiovascular accident mid 2016 living simulation ever since. Ignorance bliss. I'm 12 according would 9 years old Obama presidency, expect 9 yr olds follow political articles? Stable genius Become infected, become symptomatic? person calling dumb shares conspiracies Bill Gates Kennedy r/conspiracy. call Well people baseball idiots right probably aren‚Äôt gonna season regardless virus. However, NBA NHL already practicing back next month. NCAA athletes already back practicing NFL teams getting together soon. It‚Äôs gonna perfect adherence CDC guidelines it‚Äôs also gonna years past. We‚Äôre gonna live Yes.

One main political parties voted, consistently, put business ahead people. 

Shit corporations get rights lot poor people country. mean near perfect containment eliminated virus's spread? I'm epidemiologist think would pretty much impossible cases country, lockdown. lockdown could never perfect, people keep food supply vital services going. coming side. simply many want see happen focusing negative statistics make believe things worse are. Tona churches issues mentioned US allowing exports, forgot mention India threatened same, one largest populations world also creating ton pharmaceuticals. even blame 30-40 year olds. way talk disease, especially early on, misrepresents risk everyone. 

As result, young people think significant risk death, act accordingly. risk stratification stressed beginning, probably could protected elderly better targeting resources they're actually needed. CDC originally said wear masks. weeks held masks needed. Long trump said anything. Also liberal NYC, people street...not wearing masks, large groups drinking outside restaurants bars, social distancing wearing masks. 

Both sides...very accurate. Apart medical professionals? however lot political public pressure keep testing it, cult leader said so. convince people claiming second spike? public toilets lids so... soon!!! 2364?? hope Stupidity hurts you. evidence that? I'm sure quite expect case, space toilet small water swirling around it, unlike something size closed unventilated room. 

For example, study done seeded toilet C difficile pickup around room much reduced lid down. I‚Äôm worried dying hear get symptoms it‚Äôs worse flu .

I‚Äôve young healthy men who‚Äôve tell it‚Äôs like beaten bunch guys .

I‚Äôd rather pass . getting killed skin color throwing tantrums want manicure/pedicure (yeah, including soft muthafuckers rifles-compensating small dicks) Well let respond wrote ""ccp"" it. conform change write... someone know keeps writing two paragraphs.


Edit: yes posting paragraphs over. Funny can't spell certain countries name political group, continue posting comment over.... Hope find freedom looking Sounds like may spit-sharing group order catch it.... Maybe I've snot rockets come nose face lol Add list things first world countries America backward on. National health care, paid family leave, official government holidays, I'm sure more. American, thank red party's crazy right leaning people good things missing on. mean, I'm saying *bad*. I'm saying savior drug hype weeks now. Insulin 98 year old drug.  Sad true. Although denial ignoring make go away. use words actually state leaves everyone chronic problems. talking less 10%, symptomatic concerning numbers likely leas 5% overall. need stop allowing people create panic claiming disease leaves people chronic problems doesnt kill. possible. might 10-12 week delay policy changes dead people nursing homes. trends difficult predict. live Singapore damn AC worker dorms 98% cases from. ""Surgisphere, whose handful employees appear include science fiction writer adult-content model, provided data multiple studies Covid-19 co-authored chief executive, far failed adequately explain data Horrible government? absolutely

Horrible products? mostly, agree

Horrible culture? disagree, they've around thousands years, culture emphasizing family education thrive time time. never lupus though. Same, attended big basketball U couple years. gross. likely go outside get hit car dying covid. Dont forget average age covid deaths 80. sake mental health, dont browse sub  Maybe so... Swedish government supporters keep telling us ""curve flattened"" took two months get 7% take another two months get 14% still long way ""herd immunity"".

Of course, ""herd immunity"" calculation, suddenly virus spreading like wildfire!

It goes like this: asked high number cases, answer ""the spread slow"", asked ""herd immunity"" answer ""the spread fast"". It‚Äôs cool think baseball - team full people dugout practicing together, locker rooms, etc.. Unless quarantined season, contact outside world, constantly testing... players aren‚Äôt gonna go that. ones smart. It‚Äôs one thing get paid millions dollars play sport life line, it‚Äôs another risk future sequester away family another man‚Äôs game.

I think wanted sports would smaller teams, individual sports. Like NBA 1-on-1 competition. would workable, players would control safety. lot plans like restarting NCAA sports fall going happen. Good changed it.

What frustrates people committing mistakes around world.

As example:

March 8, 2020, South Korea, Call centre type environment: 

""Of 1,143 persons tested COVID-19, total 97 confirmed cases. these, *94 working 11th-floor call center* 216 employees, translating attack rate months later

June 15, 2020, India, Call centre type environment:

The count related helpline touched 57 - accounting *10% total 578 cases reported city since pandemic outbreak March So, even difference *policy*, difference *compliance* ?

As in, much people actually wear masks keep distance ?  around 432,000 confirmed deaths around world. cheap, widely available drug could saved 144,000 them. sound like effect you? vaccine question? Kinda like flu shot. get every year constantly mutates every year. Coronavirus already mutated. west coast USA got hit COVID straight China, mutation. East coast got hit COVID Europe mutated Europe. Thus deaths. NY received millions Europeans airport shut down. European‚Äôs fault means. borders should‚Äôve shut virus found spreading outside China. USA preparing Pandemic forever yet government majorly dropped ball. continue so. It‚Äôs people saving lives, it‚Äôs politics corporate America. Also people testing positive Covid. Even though they‚Äôve already recovered. Could they‚Äôre catching short term immunity, medical field leaning towards immune system flare causing virus become active again. Yeah, look governor Wisconsin genuinely nice guy. bit overwhelmed dealing pandemic opposition legislature/Supreme Court live different universe. didn‚Äôt sign shit. better hope don‚Äôt end 6 figure hospital bill Arizona think closer 1-2%. flawless study shut little spread, instead trying contain make enforcement mask wearing opened up.  There's abundancy theories subject far know. reports mention healthy safe (perceived sense) population tends spend more. 

I clue far links go, I'm afraid. many links folder, sigh. ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fucked‚Äù dialogue. Well get sick probably fine like colds flu‚Äôs. I‚Äôm accused non-mask wearing door knob licker, I‚Äôm not. It‚Äôs lots things life eventually kill you. never count everyone else right thing, boils taking care yourself. Common sense precautions do. need relaxation exercises daily cardio workouts! gf's sister who's respiratory therapist covid patients spends hour day combination yoga, meditation cardio center &amp; keep sanity. Surprised Pikachu think another issues people became fatigued Stay Home Orders, lifted like rubber band bouncing back, people went getting back life.

My neighborhood interesting folks really staying home better wife were, free go again, really went out. 

It lead think maybe ""lighter"" version stay home might better prevent sudden bounce back like witnessed area.

I know, sort expert, sometimes stricter something is, people become fatigued faster, experience anything else.  joke lol. interesting seeing Dex news. I've Dex last 3.5 years help chemo treatment. 

From experience pretty darn strong steroid. Makes hungry, full energy, warm, sleepless, crash HARD get it. 

I've taken 5 day spans, can't imagine come using longer u/TheWholeButt do? doomed start. everything useless posturing. Increase testing supplies, methods testing. work, people likely positive get best test also increased turnaround time (used take week get results). risk get new quick screen test takes 15 minutes. get sicker patients treated faster saving supplies aren‚Äôt COVID positive need surgery procedures held results back That's think aware fall, honest. pinpointed military games. came later French Italian athletes sick symptoms seemed like Covid games. Fuck, sorry hear lost parents. made employees take bleach showers, good. Agree 110%. could worded better. hope temporary state, lasting around 2 weeks so, authorities able find origins new cluster permanent countermeasures taken. state uncertainty tied new cases COVID-19 present Beijing, also nobody sure recent cases came from, got city. think staged. Could admit idea talking about?

This requires level introspection poster already demonstrated possess. seen bad mobile implementation website long time Sigh, consolation, shitty selfish. I've steady disappointed fellow Americans quite time. love take bath! Really? suggest keep extremely contagious virus forever current immunity without constantly locked closed borders? That's happening. already endemic nearly every country earth. lockdown basically pause button. Unemployment dropped May, consumer spending up. Unemployment numbers drop even June great leadership president Trump lol, think user questing claim vaccine would good brief time. Obviously lot working, mean everything is. also outdoor sanitizing clearly show. That‚Äôs raw growth numbers I...don't think that's takeaway message here... Quite contrary, continued original path intervention, would 100% killed kidneys death dialysis multiple times week. body withstand much abuse. drug trial great results posts seem go Go Casey mores Sunday-Thursday, it‚Äôs super packed . 

If want go weekend it‚Äôs worse main bar area outside end world . Thanks! plastic 3M ones need replaced wash it? protecting them, endangering you. would walked right out. even bring up? understanding. Solutions come understanding problem.

You understand problem take seriously. ultimately talked here. actual solution, would proper hygiene, use masks, staying away high risk areas help flatten curve. 

As solutions completely solve problem, that's entirely us figure out. unless means knowledge. 

Right need better testing system repeatedly, rapidly test individuals large quantities get results reasonable time frame. 

We need medical companies prepared mass-produce cures found effective immediately.

Finally need United States government take proper responsibility work full capacity see things done smoothly.  get test possible. doesnt matter ""generally speaking"" takes care everyone else office asshole. point take care take precautions group. (I want clear, take precautions even nobody does) people somehow spin mean immune coronavirus outdoors, lead facebook Karens screaming illegal lockdowns, perpetuate false information confusion everywhere.

People dont understand *being outside mask following social distancing* *being outside without either things*.

Yes, transmission negligible outside proper things, staying away people distancing yourself. less protections (not wearing mask, distancing, close physical contact people, going inside place people gathered, etc) chance contract it. NYT reported Pence telling governors keep saying case spikes increased testing.

State national leaders want ignore it. Totally. wonder long agencies start publishing longitudinal studies‚Äîsort expected 3-month markers coming around now. Hopefully someone's them, haha! I'm Tucson friend works department health contact tracing. said uncommon story someone just, straight up, goes BBQ got there's lots people KNOWING positive status find another person died got sick previous positive person contact others contacting. I'm guessing spreaders get super sick think stop quarantining minute feel slightly okay even though still contagious.  warmly welcomed 2024. Yeah seeing many positive casesthere w24 kind guesstimate many tests taken % positive tests. 70's. think generational thing educated younger generations; ""OTC medications harmful, else OTC, worried take them."" Maybe even generational thing, educational thing. never brought annual physicals way presented concern. mean, even read bottle exceed specific dose within day, taking X number days straight, see doctor. Pure failing person point, unfortunately. probably embarrassed admit Darwinism action. Anytime anyone says ""stop believing media"" implicitly saying ""and start believing me"".

The problem going find assertion like sub like us listening media begin anyway. listening statistics experts. opinions formed based evidence, belief evidence based well founded scientific principles (like sample size).

And morals align interests society rather pure selfishness.

You claim ""I'm sick therefore one sick"" exact amount thought reason statement ""I've never died yet therefore live forever.""

Normally I'd try get convincing something, I'm tired waste time let end saying stupid person, lives everyone around would significantly improved would simply recognize stupid act accordingly. know age people tested, hospitalization need age, predict many need hospitalization.  Eventually, people actually arrive ER, get actual count. resource management must done prediction, fact.

But would better prevent infections first place. know prevent infections -- least them.  mask-order, public communication, would prevent infections. 

I cannot imagine ethical moral reason governor would want prevent large numbers infections. friend wedding party FL weeks 100+ guests. I‚Äôm definitely going. Here. three best recent resources. I've compiled quite bit topic, three need. CDC page surprisingly includes great details indoor air environments offices (they quietly acknowledging aerosol transmission Sunsplash open it‚Äôs outdoors lines people PACKED together , mention bathrooms enclosed etc Since US tested less people per capita Belarus, would know? lockdowns US enough curb spread SARS-CoV-2, enough economic damage send us hurtling deep recession. joke. massively harmful, came steep cost. smell someone's fart means poop ur nose  Never understood people use toilet lids, toilet plumes shown thing decades.  earth tested , especially coming Uk.

The million dollar question. Also, news website extremely anti - current government.

This anti-bjp behavior writing headlines like this. Come South wish rich people wearing masks. literally maybe 10% people see mask on. Every day things get little looser far restrictions go. feel like I'm taking crazy pills everytime leave house. woke six month coma difference notice weirdly large number businesses advertising open reason. didn‚Äôt downvote must say alerted hear use steroid side effects.
Edit: also cannot find peer reviewed paper. Please point right direction have. really, outbreak happens older generation, young idiots.  Lol alright, don‚Äôt need prove living assure it‚Äôs meaningful think. could really care less think. standard care months UK I‚Äôve heard pharmacist friends working NHS.

Dexamethasone always first choice sepsis/ards ascorbic acid high IV doses.

This good confirmation nothing new. 

The news ignorant overexcited journalist wrote based zero ‚Äòground‚Äô feedback. originated mama, joking I'm here. not.

The minimal subsidies removed SIP lifted. eastern states opened - states can't afford want get people furlough rolls (and become either employer's responsibility go destitution), fed federal government propping market instead.

* said eastern admin delete bot let say red. Yes that's another problem all. go situation ""excess deaths"" ie deaths normally get month comparing 5 yr average. UK quote around 42,000 covid deaths around 60,000 excess deaths suggesting true total covid nearer 60k. didn‚Äôt say anything you‚Äôd crying silent.

Shut fuck understand make mistakes ‚Äúfix‚Äù it. He‚Äôs official relays information, conducts studies himself, 4th fucking time. never said even going about. get 70 million? Lol

And it‚Äôs imaginary number explain many times. truly feel bad sat thought man let's get Covid go away!!! children currently understand would result countless unnecessary deaths. Anyone sub knows worst possible option, I'm amazed upset told poor plan. Anyways good day, read wont ask ""strategic questions"" answered numerous times before. Oh yay, that's actually much fun. 

So think article actually really important clinicians even though novel virus, people treating patients cant really ""try anything see sticks,"" like many non medical people think can. House TV show. medical protocols. 

So first, article ""proves"" people treating COVID patients look effects outside respiratory system. clinicians research based evidence so, greatly affect quality treatment. 

Second, article sets research teams empirical work. One clear research question arises form reading would understanding similarities inherent infection modes. common? know how, directly target it. 

I strongly believe published research something valuable offer us. key us ""lay people"" understand exactly without oversimplify jumping conclusions. scientific process extraordinarily slow one builds piece piece. rarely answers. Instead confirm deny hypothesizes, move next step. organ damage... symptom? Well that‚Äôs case would hope, actually expect investigation study. I‚Äôm Canadian American politician climate makes shake head, doesn‚Äôt affect every day life. I‚Äôm annoyed escapes reality taken away, sports. Can‚Äôt watch, can‚Äôt play. u apologizing demanding apology? What's dosage? paid lot money get sigma news. It‚Äôs people Americans. Yes, point. likely motivated avoid going hospital hopes would blow charged massive hospital bill. upvote troll part. point valid insult quite unnecessary childish. getting shot police threat social contract indicates people impunity lives. Americans like that. Unfortunately, FL‚Äôs #s growing exponentially back shut down. 


The smart move would stay locked little longer could collected PPE, hired contact traders started actual tracing program.  


Instead said, ‚ÄúHey, didn‚Äôt get huge numbers said coming April, stupid lockdown April. Let‚Äôs open everything May! mask would help, also desk comparison air return, supply, vents? Dexamethasone generic drug, company make it. one thing worrying losing breathe talks.

Yikes, sounds like needs get hooked O2. would take hospital sure... read post history hope you‚Äôre angsty teen wearing Che Guevara shirt. You‚Äôll grow it. Yeah Arizona needed shut yesterday. SMH.  sounds great. side effects drugs. professional heard less careful use steroid led permanent lung damage SARS. similar type proposition? Please educate me. Yep, northeast getting better doesn‚Äôt mean states getting better. together. Including Mexico  Pretty much symptoms daughter‚Äôs having.

Got good news today! UK seems found cheap steroid reducing risk death 1/3rd among ventilation patients 1/5th patients oxygen. continue improve treatments make huge difference death toll (not saving people also freeing hospital beds ventilators). someone suffers gout admit colchincine (no idea spell steroids it) miracle cure. Go ""the slightest movement agony"" completely fine hours. 

""But long term side effects!"" one able walk? No? I'll take risk. feeling like ankles broken glass sucks Awesome thanks! would describe mucas formed lungs super glue. extremely sticky hard cough up.

I've always read get dry, non-productive cough this. still feel like dry cough difficult cough up? Thank sharing this, hope recover! taking Vitamin daily - 5000iuds? listened Joe Rogan Dr Rhonda Patrick podcast think look seems helpful Covid prevention recovery. still understand true parameters testing clearly shocked test negative! think disease spreading wider younger. relative capacity, hardier patients. depressing realization. wear mask maybe 40-50 people saw. I'm staying inside. Totally misleading headline.

Par course lately. \#KLM

/s Makes wonder they‚Äôre trying scare us taking disease seriously rightly add. less 100 cases. Yet schools set open USA... close together 10 minutes normal breathing. Also, see asterisk beside time post(edit &lt;2 min post ninja-edit show asterisk), people know post modified. Again, still addressing I'm saying. Everyone Taiwan still get permanent vaccine found. Maybe time actually go countries. swear Americans Reddit peak masochists think wearing mask public spaces like wearing seatbelt driving. going guarantee anything, easy precaution take improve chances. That‚Äôs good know talking low doses here. clicked x site popup able read article without paywall. MSNBC much polemical CNN. CNN usually reports current science. MSNBC bascially reports strident anti-adminstration stance. 

the current science basically understand Covid better, range therapeutics mimize hospital length stay impact death rates.

That seems pretty contradictory. prolonging inevitable *increasing* chances get sick? Could admit idea talking about? Dr. Bright says even vaccine 2 years mass producing enough needles people receive it. started last month fully focused mass production. 

We President concerned. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll go away summer!‚Äù regular doctor? recommend calling doctor. Also, would get pulse oximeter watch oxygen levels.

Thing is, exposing blatant selfishness, shows they're also underpaid. think fast food worker or, case, grocery store employee (who working pay bills try find degree related career - guess tough get dream job, right?!) making much someone level responsibility saving lives or, say, engineer something similarly skilled? already making level money could getting chosen field?

Attachment: Memorandum Explaining Basis Revocation Emergency Use Authorization Emergency Use Chloroquine Phosphate Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate

#Memorandum Explaining Basis Revocation Emergency Use Authorization Emergency Use Chloroquine Phosphate Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate

On March 28, 2020, Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) requested U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA Agency) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) emergency use oral formulations chloroquine phosphate (CQ) hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) treatment 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Based information available FDA time, Agency determined CQ HCQ may effective treating COVID-19 known potential benefits CQ HCQ outweigh known potential risks use. Agency limited use authorized products adults adolescents weigh 50 kg hospitalized COVID-19 participation clinical trial available, participation feasible. ^1

Since time, emerging data published literature raised new questions whether CQ HCQ may effective treating COVID-19 whether CQ HCQ‚Äôs known potential benefits outweigh known potential risks associated authorized use. part Agency‚Äôs ongoing review appropriateness EUA, FDA scientific staff conducted reviews new data also conducted new analyses information known time initial authorization.

A summary information includes following:

* suggested dosing regimens CQ HCQ detailed Fact Sheets unlikely produce antiviral effect. 
* Earlier reports decreased viral shedding CQ HCQ treatment consistently replicated recent data randomized controlled trial assessing probability negative conversion showed difference HCQ standard care alone. 
* Current U.S. treatment guidelines recommend use CQ HCQ hospitalized patients COVID-19 outside clinical trial, NIH guidelines recommend use outside clinical trial. 
* Recent data large randomized controlled trial showed evidence benefit mortality outcomes hospital length stay need mechanical ventilation HCQ treatment hospitalized patients COVID-19.

Based above, Agency concluded unlikely CQ HCQ may effective treating COVID-19. Further, light ongoing reports serious cardiac adverse events several newly reported cases methemoglobinemia COVID-19 patients, Agency concluded known potential benefits CQ HCQ outweigh known potential risks authorized uses. Therefore, Agency believes criteria2 issuance authorization longer met revoking3 EUA 039.4 

*Authorization EUA 039*

The information available time EUA issued regarding potential benefit included several components. 5 First, CQ HCQ antimalarial drugs reported vitro activity SARS-CoV-2 drug concentrations achievable doses considered safe humans.6,7,8 brief clinical report 100 COVID-19 patients China reported clinical improvement superior viral clearance CQ treatment versus unspecified control.9 Additionally, clinical survey French researchers involving 20 COVID-19 patients reported HCQ alone combination azithromycin associated viral load reduction 6 days. French report, viral load changes statistically significant compared nonrandomized control group pronounced patients received combination.10 Based experience viral illnesses, reasonable believe reduction viral load may predictive clinical benefit.

At time, number national treatment guidelines reported incorporating recommendations regarding use CQ HCQ setting COVID-19, including guidelines used China Korea. Expert assessments associated number U.S. medical institutions also included discussion use drugs clinical care. Regarding known potential risks, safety profiles CQ HCQ well established approved commonly used anti-malarial drugs and, case HCQ, approved rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus well. suggested dosing CQ HCQ EUA within range recommended approved labeling products. general, drugs well-tolerated approved uses, though known

Dear Dr. Disbrow:

This letter response request, dated today, Food Drug Administration (FDA) revoke Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) emergency use oral formulations chloroquine phosphate (CQ) hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) distributed Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) issued March 28, 2020. Like BARDA‚Äôs earlier request FDA issue EUA, BARDA‚Äôs request revoke EUA part collaborative, USGinteragency effort rapidly respond continuously evolving public health emergency. Today‚Äôs request revoke based new information, including clinical trial data results, led BARDA conclude drug may effective treat COVID-19 [Coronavirus Disease 2019] drug‚Äôs potential benefits use outweigh known potential risks.

The authorization product emergency use section 564 Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3) may, pursuant section 564(g)(2) Act, revised revoked criteria section 564(b)(1) Act longer exist, criteria section 564(c) Act issuance authorization longer met, circumstances make revision revocation appropriate protect public health safety.

FDA determined criteria section 564(c) Act issuance EUA referenced longer met. section 564(c)(2) Act, EUA may issued FDA concludes ‚Äúthat, based totality scientific evidence available Secretary, including data adequate well-controlled clinical trials, available, reasonable believe that: (A) product may effective diagnosing, treating, preventing‚Äî(i) disease condition [‚Ä¶.]; (B) known potential benefits product, used diagnose, prevent, treat disease condition, outweigh known potential risks product [‚Ä¶].‚Äù

As explained attached memorandum, based review new information reevaluation information available time EUA issued, FDA concludes criteria longer met. bases decision include following:

* believe suggested dosing regimens CQ HCQ detailed Fact Sheets unlikely produce antiviral effect.

* Earlier observations decreased viral shedding HCQ CQ treatment consistently replicated recent data randomized controlled trial assessing probability negative conversion showed difference HCQ standard care alone.

* Current U.S. treatment guidelines recommend use CQ HCQ hospitalized patients COVID-19 outside clinical trial, NIH guidelines recommend use outside clinical trial.

* Recent data large randomized controlled trial showed evidence benefit mortality outcomes hospital length stay need mechanical ventilation HCQ treatment hospitalized patients COVID19.

FDA concluded that, based new information information discussed attached memorandum, longer reasonable believe oral formulations HCQ CQ may effective treating COVID-19, reasonable believe known potential benefits products outweigh known potential risks. Accordingly, FDA revokes EUA emergency use HCQ CQ treat COVID-19, pursuant section 564(g)(2) Act. date letter, oral formulations HCQ CQ longer authorized FDA treat COVID-19.

While HCQ distributed SNS longer authorized EUA authorized use treat hospitalized patients COVID-19, FDA-approved HCQ distributed interstate commerce. CQ products covered EUA approved FDA indication therefore cannot legally introduced interstate commerce. addition, section 564(f)(2) Act, HCQ CQ distributed SNS EUA remain authorized emergency use continue treat hospitalized patient authorized product already administered COVID-19 public health emergency, extent found necessary patient‚Äôs attending physician.

Notice revocation published Federal Register, pursuant section 564(h)(1) Act.

Sincerely,

Attachment: Memorandum Explaining Basis Revocation Emergency Use Authorization Emergency Use Chloroquine Phosphate Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate

#Memorandum Explaining Basis Revocation Emergency Use Authorization Emergency Use Chloroquine Phosphate Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate

On March 28, 2020, Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) requested U.S. Food Drug Administration (FDA Agency) issued Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) emergency use oral formulations chloroquine phosphate (CQ) hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) treatment 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Based information available FDA time, Agency determined CQ HCQ may effective treating COVID-19 known potential benefits CQ HCQ outweigh known potential risks use. Agency limited use authorized products adults adolescents weigh 50 kg hospitalized COVID-19 participation clinical trial available, participation feasible. ^1

Since time, emerging data published literature raised new questions whether CQ HCQ may effective treating COVID-19 whether CQ HCQ‚Äôs known potential benefits outweigh known potential risks associated authorized use. part Agency‚Äôs ongoing review appropriateness EUA, FDA scientific staff conducted reviews new data also conducted new analyses information known time initial authorization.

A summary information includes following:

* suggested dosing regimens CQ HCQ detailed Fact Sheets unlikely produce antiviral effect. 
* Earlier reports decreased viral shedding CQ HCQ treatment consistently replicated recent data randomized controlled trial assessing probability negative conversion showed difference HCQ standard care alone. 
* Current U.S. treatment guidelines recommend use CQ HCQ hospitalized patients COVID-19 outside clinical trial, NIH guidelines recommend use outside clinical trial. 
* Recent data large randomized controlled trial showed evidence benefit mortality outcomes hospital length stay need mechanical ventilation HCQ treatment hospitalized patients COVID-19.

pg. 2

Based above, Agency concluded unlikely CQ HCQ may effective treating COVID-19. Further, light ongoing reports serious cardiac adverse events several newly reported cases methemoglobinemia COVID-19 patients, Agency concluded known potential benefits CQ HCQ outweigh known potential risks authorized uses. Therefore, Agency believes criteria2 issuance authorization longer met revoking3 EUA 039.4 

*Authorization EUA 039*

The information available time EUA issued regarding potential benefit included several components. 5 First, CQ HCQ antimalarial drugs reported vitro activity SARS-CoV-2 drug concentrations achievable doses considered safe humans.6,7,8 brief clinical report 100 COVID-19 patients China reported clinical improvement superior viral clearance CQ treatment versus unspecified control.9 Additionally, clinical survey French researchers involving 20 COVID-19 patients reported HCQ alone combination azithromycin associated viral load reduction 6 days. French report, viral load changes statistically significant compared nonrandomized control group pronounced patients received combination.10 Based experience viral illnesses, reasonable believe reduction viral load may predictive clinical benefit.

At time, number national treatment guidelines reported incorporating recommendations regarding use CQ HCQ setting COVID-19, including guidelines used China Korea. Expert assessments associated number U.S. medical institutions also included discussion use drugs clinical care. Regarding known potential risks, safety profiles CQ HCQ well established approved commonly used anti-malarial drugs and, case HCQ, approved rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus well. suggested dosing CQ HCQ EUA within range recommended approved labeling products. general, drugs well-tolerated approved uses, though known

&amp;#x200B;

First all, directly related, covered. wearing masks social distancing, immune compromised pretty much forced continue staying home much possible. I've got news anti-maskers, us old. Many us young, heads households shopping much used to, driving much. go movies, get haircuts go clothing shopping. plans go gym. short, still lot dollars entering economy, people part contain thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Second. Related another point view. I'm someone never really took abuse seriously. thought emotional verbal abuse person jerk. Even jerky behavior like heat sensing missile target abuse can't shake. target can't shake it, abuser's fault. So, take seriously. Until, is, father killed mother. rocked world changed entire view things.

&amp;#x200B;

However, four siblings view differently. exception one, views abuse domestic violence essentially unchanged. So, light comments, using family example took something hitting close home (no pun intended) someone finally wake up. Yes, people see change, also lot won't. They'll find story tell allows keep world view comfortable them. Well that‚Äôs insurance works, you‚Äôre paying people‚Äôs expenses either way. saying that's viable strategy, making point country's low numbers? Good news appears exceedingly rare. Perhaps need find better definition cleared exit quarantine  [They're people majority cases seem asymptomatic. stopped testing, subsequent infections even know it. statement confusing, might want reevaluate cognition talk shit idiot. NYC, Jewish communities parks pretty much never interact rest city. schools, parks, restaurants, neighborhoods, doctors, etc. They're unlikely hold jobs working public avoid public transportation. would probably okay let neighborhoods stay open wish.. rest city open access them. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs surprising thing. Good they‚Äôre getting tested guess. return sports gonna see athletes need tested regularly. It‚Äôs almost like there‚Äôs solution that! Hint: Taking break drinking water here‚Äôs don‚Äôt understand. people furloughed laid eligible unemployment right, according article means they‚Äôre making before. shouldn‚Äôt trouble making rent payments? link PDF FDA site. ease reading, entirety letter 3 11 pages addendum posted here.

330 Independence Ave, S.W., Room 640G 
Washington, D.C. 20201

Dear Dr. Disbrow:

This letter response request, dated today, Food Drug Administration (FDA) revoke Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) emergency use oral formulations chloroquine phosphate (CQ) hydroxychloroquine sulfate (HCQ) distributed Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) issued March 28, 2020. Like BARDA‚Äôs earlier request FDA issue EUA, BARDA‚Äôs request revoke EUA part collaborative, USGinteragency effort rapidly respond continuously evolving public health emergency. Today‚Äôs request revoke based new information, including clinical trial data results, led BARDA conclude drug may effective treat COVID-19 [Coronavirus Disease 2019] drug‚Äôs potential benefits use outweigh known potential risks.

The authorization product emergency use section 564 Federal Food, Drug, Cosmetic Act (the Act) (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-3) may, pursuant section 564(g)(2) Act, revised revoked criteria section 564(b)(1) Act longer exist, criteria section 564(c) Act issuance authorization longer met, circumstances make revision revocation appropriate protect public health safety.

FDA determined criteria section 564(c) Act issuance EUA referenced longer met. section 564(c)(2) Act, EUA may issued FDA concludes ‚Äúthat, based totality scientific evidence available Secretary, including data adequate well-controlled clinical trials, available, reasonable believe that: (A) product may effective diagnosing, treating, preventing‚Äî(i) disease condition [‚Ä¶.]; (B) known potential benefits product, used diagnose, prevent, treat disease condition, outweigh known potential risks product [‚Ä¶].‚Äù

As explained attached memorandum, based review new information reevaluation information available time EUA issued, FDA concludes criteria longer met. bases decision include following:

* believe suggested dosing regimens CQ HCQ detailed Fact Sheets unlikely produce antiviral effect.

* Earlier observations decreased viral shedding HCQ CQ treatment consistently replicated recent data randomized controlled trial assessing probability negative conversion showed difference HCQ standard care alone.

* Current U.S. treatment guidelines recommend use CQ HCQ hospitalized patients COVID-19 outside clinical trial, NIH guidelines recommend use outside clinical trial.

* Recent data large randomized controlled trial showed evidence benefit mortality outcomes hospital length stay need mechanical ventilation HCQ treatment hospitalized patients COVID19.

FDA concluded that, based new information information discussed attached memorandum, longer reasonable believe oral formulations HCQ CQ may effective treating COVID-19, reasonable believe known potential benefits products outweigh known potential risks. Accordingly, FDA revokes EUA emergency use HCQ CQ treat COVID-19, pursuant section 564(g)(2) Act. date letter, oral formulations HCQ CQ longer authorized FDA treat COVID-19.

While HCQ distributed SNS longer authorized EUA authorized use treat hospitalized patients COVID-19, FDA-approved HCQ distributed interstate commerce. CQ products covered EUA approved FDA indication therefore cannot legally introduced interstate commerce. addition, section 564(f)(2) Act, HCQ CQ distributed SNS EUA remain authorized emergency use continue treat hospitalized patient authorized product already administered COVID-19 public health emergency, extent found necessary patient‚Äôs attending physician.

Notice revocation published Federal Register, pursuant section 564(h)(1) Act.

Sincerely,

Food Drug Administration Ladies Gentlemen, president United States. meal time? Everyone‚Äôs going take masks spread whatever have. vaccine gain immunity? get some? i'm willing risk autism. list sources site. Probably virus die. honestly think someone faking tests results that's reason even thing? CDC guidelines.

sorry do, government telling Texans infringes constitutional rights. Hey, knock it. actually looked it'll cost $162 am. tempting. Well change that, though know won‚Äôt. live start US infections. Everywhere start treated Boston (which totally understand even less understanding isn‚Äôt much). Boston mayor making rules timelines bit longer rest state. (Example, offices could open outside Boston 3 weeks ago, Boston‚Äôs still closed, playgrounds could open parts state 2 weeks ago Boston opened today). It‚Äôs like treating Syracuse NY like NYC... doesn‚Äôt make sense point. need better quarantine short shut measures emerging hot spots, otherwise people never going submit them. someone 500 miles away hotspot state need shut business again, it‚Äôs going work. worse that. least there, there's real life correlation. stop testing, would much cases. Pick topic...figure divide people it. depends live, suppose.

Unions deeper part Midwest culture lot US.

Worker protections better Illinois Virginia (where grew up) Georgia (where family). Despite say cable news (and unions pain deal with), worker protections improves quality life -- even considering winter. I'm hurry move back South! initial advocates saying zinc known disrupt viral activity cell hydroxichloriquine helps zinc get cell.

If that's true, ""/s""? later studies test early zinc show ideas wrong? smh comments Fox depressing I‚Äôm conservative. We‚Äôve heard dozens medicines treatments, yet numbers still climbing. I‚Äôll believe see  *The* Ohio State?

There's many schools hard know one referencing. 50 hours 300 dollars? That's crazy. Get em Daddy Newsome!!!! ""If stop paying taxes, money."" 40% likely single issue voters, aka abortion 2A. Idiots, basically. actually think he's intelligent leader

The purpose leaders democracy represent stupidity constituents, correct it. filled car gas earlier.

Now know look fuel guage get 5000 miles tank.

At least. First never quit Fuck you. think right ways avoid this, would taken way simple request non-essential workers refrain buying n95s. Many would respond specifically seeking attempting acquire families. said, they'd *legally* prevent sale purchase non-essential workers means much significant exertion federal authority, well beyond CDC could do. newsworthy leader nation flagrantly imply numbers, therefore situation, would better simply ignored them.

We leader best interests people mind.

If anything, belongs r/NotTheOnion not, definition, fake news. beg differ. scariest part slim group left believe absolute psychopaths see sort hero...hence see absolute BS coming election can‚Äôt see winning. 

His remaining core honestly mix scary, sad hateful people lot like Trump himself. hope I‚Äôm wrong damn good feeling takes election outcome LOL Willfull obtuseness worst form political bias. know exactly meant pretend to. Pathetic. already say month ago? Mask use lines politics. blue Seattle, mask use pretty widespread. weeks ago, drove red part Snohomish County 40 miles north Seattle saw one wearing masks outside 25 percent people wearing grocery store. additional aid runs July economy tank.

We life support. back normal. People back normal ignoring happening nationwide. 
People hotspots come community borders. Many people still unemployed, affects entire country. 
 Americans welcome many countries right good reason. countries creating travel pacts welcomed anytime soon. üò± complicated issue lot facets, country deeply divided decades social engineering upper class Completely fucked continuous positive cases. Leave disease send Mexico. POTUS stopped talking would many fewer lies world. Nice. Ahh, ‚Äòif ignore enough, it‚Äôll go away‚Äô defense. fair read full article see spin.  trump said 

""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!""

im defending trump mishandling everything touches see spin quote.  Trump claiming test anyone else highest numbers stopped testing would look good like everyone else.  think bullshit thats saying country already that. must really hard live real world. 

The purpose typical business make money, pay 100% revenue wages would business. 

Keep voting Bernie filling head delusions. Hopefully wake one day. many new customers think takes get raise? Everybody always question reality remember watching debates YouTube, amount people comments talking ""destroyed"" amazing Schrodinger's covid 19? joke old Soviet Union, crime, prostitution drug addicts. recall correctly, massive gaslighting work well them. depends country/region:

I think Europe/North America higher case numbers going let medical capacity drive decisions. hand, lock down. gets hand, might.

China lock regions outbreak area weeks. expect countries lower infection rate same. mean, ofc he's referring confirmed cases. he's speaking context rising # confirmed cases, probably number bothers look (or hear aid daily meeting). hate trump's dumb ass bad. 1 10? Wow. 

As percentages begin rise, think happen. guys like 85% ICU capacity right now? lol shot downvote instantly thinking last 4 hours come *that* response. please stop harassing me, I'm trying go day Eh little evidence issues found non vapers. I'm cannabis consumer doubt black market carts responsible lung issues. Duuuude, much great music created generation! probably going hear radio, opinion. majority friends quite promiscuous. lot people rioting angry right now?

I trying dick, maybe becoming little disconnected modern society? Respectfully, understand feel need berate me, since platform dismantled course last years, like said conversations coronavirus, debate political views. understand self-turmoil current situation -- conservative president loosing ground incumbent, media system systematically labels opposition hate filled racist, urban rural divide grows day. Though solve inner-turmoil, one piece information could relay would ""win"" come mean. said sure would enjoy r/adivce could use right now. ""Hey, stopped lawmaking governing 'Murica RIGHT NOW, could complaints reason upset me, any."" Another reason ""67% jobless get unemployment earned"" unemployed selected high precision bottom end income scale. happen? because, recession, industries lowest-paying jobs highest unemployment, vice versa.  Finally. 

Stopping stop signs stop lights (for greater societal good) optional. 

Wearing mask pandemic societal good optional enforces ""no shirt/no shoes/no service"" rules get enforced without much issues.

Rules employees enforced employers turn government issuing business licenses. rules customers enforced company well customers well. KEY government (from highest level) MUST encourage mask wearing PROMOTE wearing TIME themselves.

Right NOW, people TOP (Pres/VP/etc.) making mask wearing show weakness propagating supporters causing mess confusion mask wearing. many people thread even bother read article. Trump obviously wrong, people clearly misrepresenting said lol. first one, there's really long set-up there's 5 people airplane that's going four parachutes one child, another one Trump. Every person reason deserve parachute (""I cured cancer"", etc) except child. Trump exclaims ""I live I'm smartest man world!"" jumps plane. child says ""It's okay, 'smartest man world' took backpack.

As far imaginary games, sat kid would play game called ""raccoon school"" college raccoons. teacher ""Miss Trash"" smartest student. mostly involved asking questions making answers. asked question like ""okay class, worst raccoon world?"" she'd say something like ""Raccoon Trump worst raccoon. He's orange stupid gets 100 spankings every day."" f‚Äôed Americans gonna elect guy threaten, it. Anytime inside without masks talking, crying, etc even masks, actually agree even though fully support movement feel protests important. 

Indoor crowds recirculated air super spreader events matter cause event is. Protests one thing - outdoor funeral too. minute crammed inside, bets off. Maintain 6 feet (or more) distance go business. recently flight masks required. soon air two people took mask entire flight. kept mask didn‚Äôt say word. risk fight breaking flight mask.

Too many people edge carrying. worth risk tick someone violent situation lecturing someone mask. mask necessary can‚Äôt and/or it‚Äôs difficult maintain distance. lives consequence-free existence right now, whatever want POTUS face zero blowback.  Ooh piece ü¶†. Ooh piece ofüçî. Ooh piece üçü. /r/technicallythetruth wish consistent across US. Half reason one wears masks one enforces Oscars 2021 scheduled April 11, 2021; nominations movies released late 2019 late 2020 announced March 9, 2021 5:38 PST. close eyes sun goes away
- trump probably pregnancy tests Trump rape victims? really wish IQ test requirement vote. Otherwise, wouldn‚Äôt morons like Trump office. do! basement 250 lbs dumbbells stretch cord attached eye bolt screwed stud.

No gym membership fees waiting around people get done, either. Shameful! Lack social safety net problem bipartisan issue. It‚Äôs not. Arkansas never shutdown governor made statement we‚Äôd never shut matter many cases deaths wtf implying? saying wasn‚Äôt implying anything all? simply making statement? statement purpose, value America people? exactly implying, since seem know means.   Poor things. Hope made July money top June money. black man pointing temple.jpg ‚Äúright liberty‚Äù violated meaningful way

Oh I'm educated it, wanted OP acknowledge limits rights.

Being angry mob right.

Not surprised mention reality op though.

But hey folks push narratives like  Fox News piece one viewers bet. *duh* It‚Äôs American way! /s Agreed, it‚Äôs way better packed bars restaurants without masks I‚Äôve seen.   almost feel intelligence radiating body... anything though, people may incentivised wear masks there's smoke around. 

They see smoke, can't see rona. Math checks out. blame Gem Z already lol  judgement offend me, neither opinions own. narrow-minded. missing Kind like open mail, pay utilities? thought awhile too. Especially used friends Clintons. cause inflammatory disease without symptoms.

YUP.

That's suggested ready fucking reopen. A-S-S-H-O-L-E . . . aren‚Äôt really testing. every sign sun, 2 hospitalizations, refusing test me. Stuck hospital room someone exact symptoms, whose dr also told rush ER, refused give test well. r/technicallythetruth Yes. cult followers guy's...rare man. see doctor nagging headache, never cancerous tumor.

Pretty obviously point. know manufacture new headlines Trump provides enough ammo otherwise.   can‚Äôt wait televised debates.

Ah yes. Agile Coach Murders.

As dumb is, surrounded smart people many we've never seen. 

China gun sights. war China distracts entire world election. CFR largely influenced testing, US testing nearly much countries. scientific evidence yet HCQ (+AZ) effective. Everything stated anecdotal. May HCQ effective? Maybe, guaranteed


Also, please provide sources whenever state ‚Äú**the data** overwhelming‚Äù. statement pure rhetoric unless data collection subsequent analysis verified I've never agreed Trump anything moment, understand simple logic chains. He‚Äôs wrong Common-sense-in-chief He's wrong lol man think lot alike. don‚Äôt get receipts ATM don‚Äôt wanna know broke am. /s Tom Hanks revealed coronavirus back March, knew going see surge. Japan went long time severely testing save Olympics. time, back March, Shimura Ken (essentially Tom Hanks-level famous Japanese comedian) died disease. Tokyo Olympics cancelled, Japan went severely testing slightly-less severely testing followed vein since. Last week, country tested employees customers hostess clubs produced symptomatic Covid cases, discovered 14 asymptomatic cases. bet 10s thousands asymptomatic light cases going around atm. hear in-laws friends still there, nearly impossible get PCR test. still phase need meet multiple number requirements qualify testing. hope bad, suspect picture still rosey.

I'm league long enough suffer kind damage made enough provide family families build.

I would make trade heartbeat Thanks, appreciate that! wealthy well educated. People misconstruing every little context sentance trump says makes question reality.

This little excerpt much attention basically says ""if testing thorough accurate higher # cases test, poor accuracy tests."" 

it accurate statement, could disagree? parents threw shit you!‚Äù boot leather taste, ~~pedo~~ pede? It‚Äôs chicken egg thing. authorities moderately responsive people‚Äôs needs, people trust more. [Here‚Äôs really interesting article dynamic Probably 2-3% IFR guess. Around 5% critical maybe would die. FIL huge Fox News fan. much bought us subscription Bill O'Reilly's site suggested listen he's ""straight shooter"". 

We provided evidence like posted Fox's unreliability, instances outright lied, showed bad news Trump report all, etc.

He said ""we'll agree disagree"".

I honestly hate Fox News done parents. feel helpless bring brainwashing. otherwise intelligent people, too. Somehow Fox strips away critical thinking ability point beyond hope. FDA revoked emergency use authorization (EUA) allowed chloroquine phosphate hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated Strategic National Stockpile used treat certain hospitalized patients COVID-19 clinical trial unavailable, participation clinical trial feasible. Based ongoing analysis EUA emerging scientific data, FDA determined chloroquine hydroxychloroquine unlikely effective treating COVID-19 authorized uses EUA. Additionally, light ongoing serious cardiac adverse events potential serious side effects, known potential benefits chloroquine hydroxychloroquine longer outweigh known potential risks authorized use. agency issued Press Release posted FAQs action.

Your headline match article matter people going read actual article anyway. watching theme park opening videos last week honestly theme parks feel like pretty safe recreational activity. theme parks Florida opened aggressive sanitizing physical distancing. parks even refuse allow ride vehicle move face masks on. Plus capacity significantly reduced. parks look empty. Chump garbage. Stupid ass coward okay didnt say 99.9*9* %

Indeed, since correspond 1 100,000 either.

But least screaming God government Fox News whatever. pretty much precisely AIDS epidemic started I‚Äôm trump fan, commenters brain dead. quote taken context - it‚Äôs comparing us total cases nations aren‚Äôt testing. Please feel free spend time elsewhere nurse let say gowning cleaning nasty infections don‚Äôt want long time, ever. Truly heroes let‚Äôs take care ‚ù§Ô∏è    can‚Äôt tell satire anymore nursing career started little year ago feel like I've spent entire time fighting damn pandemic.


Working Florida LPN already bad earning $15/hour (since Florida right work state unions healthcare profession) Florida Man patient time. He's gotta get treated somewhere makes headlines. 


It's even worse pandemic get hazard pay deal patients trying convince hoax taking rights away requiring wear mask facility.


Since healthcare for-profit, paycheck depends see enough patients. majority patients tourists, shit happens attractions reduced capacity worse, closed altogether. Even though there's pandemic going on, I'm scavenging hours patient levels tanked. People going doctor lost health insurance lost jobs. 


I want Orwellian rollercoaster. I'm aging dog years. Ask Vice-POTUS Mike Pence worked state tried AIDs. I'm sure he's got plenty data there.

It reminds playing hide seek nieces. One intelligent girl time, even less common sense (and that's saying something). would start counting, she'd go run somewhere, sit down, cover face hands. thinking since see anything, see her. took times catch fact work way. Bless her.

Maybe POTUS never caught on? people virus none dying.

Somethings matter look it. dumb! burns! Try again. - parents voted change cases Trump able much shit stupid, imagine smart, competent evil person would able place. stop arresting people anymore criminals too. pivot from? Jesus christ people easily distracted actually happening. let Trump easily distract content saying instead NOT- SECOND WAVE DUE REOPENING. AVOIDING acknowledging truth SAYING COURSE CASES TESTING MORE

God, people easily fall Trump moving goalposts?

1) think USA highest per capita testing?

2) think USA effective containment world? think top 20? defend POTUS statement don't?

3) POTUS seems less informed topic I, simple software eng Ky. review graph, POTUS access FAR more, easily see trend June mimics March far May June. clearly due reopening Trump dodging acknowledging truth, cause people die.

Graph: Look new daily cases - kind 100% feel like emerging narrative, particularly things get bad US. protests going blamed spike, even spike started memorial day openings. want believe that, evidence thus far seems indicate Trump face consequences. US needs heavily invest reformed education system. Poor education ended here. part world, letting know wrong.

btw Sweden's economy tanked countries bordering added bonus (/s) many dead, much infected populace well Scandinavian countries telling stay instead spreading less infected populations. He's truly dumbass. Edit: comes ANYTHING SCIENCE. part dont understand. check last month less half usial pay halfway employed im eligible unemployement extra $600 It‚Äôs really damn good well! Press probably waiting 10 million / 500 thousand deaths. u buddy. Bad Religion already released one best albums ever Trump - Age Unreason Yeah that's good point. Good thing I'm charge whether POTUS lives dies. I‚Äôm referring people trying find way return old job called back work(full-time). work recruiter, employees returned back work. work environment safety measures employees, couple employees trying find way return work, told making unemployment. Better make 1 Except really testing countries... unless referring raw data opposed tests per capita? Coronavirus Ba Sing Se Wuhan China completely different haven‚Äôt stopped community spread, unlike Vietnam going two months now. likely incubation false negative, tested twice. arrival release. difficult understand. student loans perhaps? people saying this? think misunderstanding Dear God...best luck loved ones there. mean who's ganna sit puppet seat? #yourvotedoesntmatter varies based state think. Connecticut, live, pretty good getting people money quickly. also message DoL site waives requirements look work and, importantly, encourages workers keep claiming loved one risk feel comfortable returning work. regarding ""suitable"" work workers there's higher bar employers/industries meet. Tweet trump: ""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!"" 

So yes, statement. I‚Äôve working whole time hospitality group. begged boss let us get unemployment don‚Äôt get unemployment resign. That‚Äôs whole crux reopening argument (that option comfortable putting health lone work)  would identify many cases possible tell stay home set time would help reduce infections

not simple suggest. would Americans tolerate aggressive policing black people latinos -- big fines -- infected stepped outside home quarantine? Americans live overcrowded multi-generational housing? would forcing infected person stay home time help hurt situation family members risk infection? 

this stuff never simple. think gates bezos happy clams Trump's tax cuts wealthy?

You're naive.   like idiocracy... intelligent. That's Arizona lol I‚Äôm pretty sure estimate optimistic. Oh man! skip next MRI make brain mets go away?! want upvote it‚Äôs 666. Sorry! legitimately liveable live well. even cover rent small 1 room apartments would likely require govt assitance legitimately survive (EBT, county insurance, housing assistance etc). Unless miracle happens lose first home nothing within 60 miles hiring paying previously making. take story times 10 that's many us let go last round. last 60 days seen 1 job posting close original pay job paid $4 less making. 100 applicants 1 position. SHIT lmao man speaks sides mouth given opportunity

What seemingly every goober defending seem comprehend DODGING FACT SECOND WAVE DUE REOPENING. ""take responsibility"" always, dodge truth- people die know take seriously. Modern times call modern solutions. cannot believe mods deniers let important facts stay posted long. usual CIAbots's bad math: 1 million new cases! 1 trillion death! also ChYNA lies! SeCOND WaVE! hurts bad gay people*, sure, go ahead appropriate read full quote comes plenty dumb himself. testing shows what's actually going on, make us look worse. death toll that, going make us look bad whether test anyone not. death toll US, way, already quarter deaths worldwide. anti-lockdown people literally brandished assault rifles front government buildings, made death threats elected officials required masks resigned, and‚Äîwhere live‚Äîspit purposefully coughed people wearing masks grocery store. 

I‚Äôm anti-lockdown. I‚Äôm pro 100% mask usage. lockdown complete waste money people flooded essential businesses without masks held massive parties street. 

We wasted trillions dollars half measures enforcement disenfranchised people like process. 

It‚Äôs long enough could put bailout money toward box n95 masks every doorstep America. Make em red MAGA masks too. Even though issue politics empathy safety... I‚Äôll gladly wear MAGA mask fellow citizens would follow suit. Fucking president good brain..... Really want Kiwi right now... Imagine admitting people voted him. Holy fuck, embarrassment lifetime. dislike dumb ass context, untrue unworthy.  Technically, he's wrong. mean, take shot, can't miss. Unless come back hungry ghosts. don‚Äôt think would see low SpO2 someone mild case. also pretty realistic guess. I‚Äôm either hoping it‚Äôs likely today he‚Äôd held accountable like many haven‚Äôt past (once isn‚Äôt president) least *thinks* that‚Äôs case cause think twice Fake news needs higher. hate trump much next guy usershere purposefully misinterpreting news. There's enough dumb shit said dat laugh with. pointing stupidity statement like this, exactly trump said .....

you literally proving point, didnt even call anybody inbred pigfucker, learn manners. I'd happy  Lol big brain strategy! Nobody gets Corona don‚Äôt test know it!

I mean... guy get stupid? Type 1 juvenile insulin dependent need live. diet prevent shots. Type 2 mix may need diet, exercise, pill, insulin. Depends factors. Two different diseases thing end look involving insulin levels body. Though havent used term, glycemic index, forever people could still it. insulin pump therapy long term insulin changes diabetics count carbs preferred method measuring much insulin take. take certain amount insulin per X amount carbs plus certain amount blood sugar target range. say take 1 unit per 7 g carbs 1 unit per 35 target 120. tested 190 eating meal 96 total carbs. Youd take around 15 units meal. pump enter numbers you. use syringe vial insulin pen. Thats bolus rate. Pump users also certain amount insulin pump gives every hour continuously that's called basal rate. pump usually take long term insulin like lantus night morning(or both) works basal. diabetics pump use 1 kind insulin shots use mostly 2, short term long term.

So type 2 , also called adult set, control gi diet. type one. understand. people sort education back man without feeling sort shame asshole. pretentious fucks. saying, 74 year old worth 2 billion dollars, enough best lawyers money buy finger, ability drag lawsuits years, fucked sort way? Mind telling us managed churn positive rate 0.03% consider valid result? That's pregnancy test level specificity. gonna while, like first time. wish people would wear masks properly, wash hands, stop wearing gloves, social distance. ‚ÄúIf get rid courts right now, we‚Äôd lawsuits, any‚Äù really difficult lie money went. directly correlated payroll tax expenses. money used forgivable reasons, fine, really used unforgivable expenses, caught.  keep responding looking info. Still same, narcissist. face consequence free life. actually scared ran bunker people protesting park next white house. 

Every single rally has, need next door, socially distanced, legally protesting rediculous term things Americans deserve basic right. Bully's stand others stand them.  think people believe knucklehead sent God.  Even worse insurance company authorize pharmacy sell full amount prescription. Can‚Äôt argue logic... True that. reads? live arizona ever seen meme ""man lost hope lost additional hope even realize still had"" thats feel seeing army braindead idiots walking around without maks want feel powerful cool. People here's brains shut comes avoiding pandemic. sorry vent little obvious now. antibody sample testing NYC found 20% city corona virus antibodies. people NYC alone corona virus testing entire US indicates. said done, clear probably already 20 million Americans corona virus. testing capturing 1/10th that.  say? unprecedented lockdowns occurring

The U.S. never ""lockdowns"" -- ""stay-at-home"" orders, really enforced million loopholes. people could even travel country much wanted planes trains. That's different happened France, Spain, Italy -- even Japan people travel responsibility. think going happen de-prioritize testing open things back up?

I think continue prioritize effective testing. 100k dead 

Tragic, deaths likely misclassified. ""Covid rage"" may well someone's defence person like woman beaten death one days. words, we‚Äôre f*cked idiot. Channeling spirit Harry Caray? There's strangers penis heterosexual male anus. ignore it, rape. Thanks trump. people still understand 2-4 week delay new daily case averages start going see reciprocal increase daily deaths? clearly due incubation time addition typical disease progression. cognitive dissonance astounding. He's smartass. hilarious, dont even like im Nice. Here, let actually destroy whatever argument exists juvenile brain said another civil user:

God, people easily fall Trump moving goalposts?

1) think USA highest per capita testing?

2) think USA effective containment world? think top 20? defend POTUS statement don't?

3) POTUS seems less informed topic I, simple software eng Ky. review graph, POTUS access FAR more, easily see trend June mimics March far May June. clearly due reopening Trump dodging acknowledging truth, cause people die.

Graph: Look new daily cases - paper yeah actual won‚Äôt change mean it‚Äôs months late good enforcing policy much needed. Yeah I‚Äôm telling you, america essentially exact thing actually sooner restrictions. difference luck really. ‚ÄúIt morally bad care whether thing true not, long makes feel good, care got money long got it.‚Äù

Glad priorities check. Based history, we've never vaccine year two. fastest record (mumps) took four. testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!""

This tweet president confirming believes brilliant point. reality obvious need said. using whole lot words say nothing, Trump does. 

We tested significant amount countries, much true. However, percentage positive tests per total people tested also rising much higher previously numerous states. Even statement total tests performed, would still reason concern since amount people testing positive everyday still extremely high.

The numbers sink stop testing. positive cases would still there, people sick would still infections would continue. case would spread without us knowing. 

Another thing makes something bragging way late game terms testing. fact, 60% total tests administered within last month. still crack top ten terms percentage population tested. 

Any defense statement kinda dumb, quite retarded statement itself. job still decide come back point. ever seen flu epidemic fill local hospital ICU beds exponential speed?

Nope.

But see Covid, genius. medias fear mongering cost jobs businesses 4,000 month

where 50 4k month? make 52 take home 2800 month [minnesota] 
also comfy, especially one person? elect idiot Governor President bound follow. Science real Alabama. COVID real Alabama. Trump con artist Alabama. That's works, that's works? fucking dumb he? knew months ago already. Smh  Edit, fat fingers 713 Vegas well. walked Bellagio yesterday see it. Half cars California Arizona plates. 25% people wore masks. social distancing.

The resort can. handwashing stations casino. give away masks gloves guests. Table games plexiglass barriers protect dealers/pit boss.

Still expecting big covid spike soon imported cases. Funny looking, Im Fargo. 69 likesüòã makes sense looks like mental illness violenting coughing people protecting coughing people! need fucking diagnosis tell might sort psycho! Geezus! people would use term adults. Source? Huh? voted Hilary.  try pit black people gay people. They're enemies, common enemy. 

Trying compete oppressed groups oppressed fucking pathetic. Save energy fight bastards oppressing. Reagan absolutely racist cunt. Appropriate that. stop looking bank account, stopped poor? Can‚Äôt coronavirus don‚Äôt test it. Big brain. can't believe ""controversial"" idea is? Like dare people normally treated like shit get paid livable wage *not* want give wage shitty job / risk virus, right?

It mind boggling touch guy replying reality. sit accuse others villain willing risk lives terrible job. Jesus H Fucking Christ. exactly. difference saying stupid shit president vs head Trump business much bigger platform directly affects many people directly definitely 'work' AIDS unfortunately. anti trump stuff see reddit grossly taken context. that, know, much better viewed context. still. really giving fake news claims real fodder supporters. thread objectively misrepresenting said. says enough stupid shit context misrepresentation completely meritless, even anti-trump agenda. ""Doctors hate one simple trick get rid diabetes"" mentally challenged? I'm legit curious. sensationalist headline. seem intelligent, must understand regardless actual intended statement, headline designed make people think believes test, sick. I'm defending meant. I'm attacking even misleading headline. think getting angry fallback attack pointed irrelevant intent headline make Trump appear literally mentally retarded.

""Hur hur retarded regardless headline"". Got way us. Hahaha wtf Stop admitting patients hospital, hospitalizations. Genius move Sometimes gotta pretending Troy! trying go elimination? people bars packed like sardines, even operate 50 percent capacity people huddle together masks, even hear people telling others wear masks "" let's get this"". virus going come back vengeance unfortunately.  bad healthy people. He‚Äôs wrong. We‚Äôd cases tracked country would spin downhill. can‚Äôt believe something POTUS would say one many. Oh god GeNiuS know, may good English, damn well Calculus Physics. Object permeance hard grasp block headed conservatives. worries, good luck! people getting wrong here

No, everyone getting wrong, headline. Everything else saying missing point. repeated understand first time. fault needed repeated. Philadelphia mayor trying soooo hard justify all.  stable genius remotely true. done total testing. close per capita. There's big difference Imagine desperate buy shoes.  Head sand, dick hand, overjoyed blissful ignorance. that's BRILLIANT! Media made sure report dangerous crowds Trump's rally Even living roommates way better parents.

Must American thing. can‚Äôt wear red hat expect people respect you. Sorry, we‚Äôre 3 years past kid. remember. answer every question ""9/11"". People shout gaslighting immediately first response almost always ones dishonest. suspect population density plays role, also seeing bigger increases cases single states entire European countries (e.g. Arizona vs. UK). Lets look numbers 2 months. stoped High IQ test easy questions, yet still scored normal 0.o context stupid thing say. Sure have...and people coming China happen one handful people billion virus lol [We're tests per day technically lie, definitely misleading. Also absolutely moronic like title suggests. can't feel feet legs? thought diabetic anymore.  Contact tracing beginning socialistic USA used harm. 7/10 Americans give hope üí™ [Yeah sure, misunderstanding ventilator? shit, Jersey max benefit 730 plus 600. good, work Thanks! there‚Äôs hipaa protection pandemic. period  Willful ignorance.

It's Hell drug. called ""porters"" am. may carry swabs one part hospital another (the swabs dangerous sent pneumatic tubes). well deliver clear meals, push patients equipment around. really important job poorly paid (considered unskilled labor). even want think working kitchen then. Anyone see episode Family Guy Lois ran mayor? debate said dumbed obvious shit like ""9/11 bad"" people got rile up. shit like that. Praying lots people pandemic dumbest thing religion right now.

Which kind funny. Zero logic like, ‚ÄùIf don‚Äôt take temperature won‚Äôt find fever‚Äù? (laws House God.) Rex Tillerson said best:

Fucking moron think protests mattered, allow big outdoor concerts resume? Okay first, every news channel followed time mentioned masks within first week. None specified holding masks week later Great Toilet Paper Friday 2020 happened.

*Then* conservationist talk started.

Second, half main news sources *outside* US.

The second South Korea problem, shut every developed nation started implementing SK tactics fighting virus.

This information widely available, sub elsewhere, Day fucking One.

That Americans get news international sources wide-spread distrust said sources, sources objectively, well, objective, own, source great shame growing number countrymen exact reasons. Saturday Night Fever course going backfire greedy idiots charge think money corporate benefactors. Absolutely, die things. Like, lung cancer sufferer die asphyxia. AIDS patients vanished nobody dies AIDS, they‚Äôd die flu. COVID-45 two Zig Zags, baby that's need. lol still talking bullshit every China post. Please tell say this. Never stop enemy making mistake.

Or case, he's actively killing loyal supporters needlessly. died sorry, mass gatherings worst possible place coronavirus transmission occur. basic science virus.  Trump incompetence death toll 117K Americans. Trump also pandemic competition COVID-19. Hard say lethal America. ever think words leak head go brain ? Hey listen guys, hear here, I'm starting think Trump fellow really smart. facts uncivil now? Oh well. mean bagged salad probably worst form salad...so insult makes sense! Symptoms part normal. symptoms experienced sore throat, cough, fever, body aches. nasal pain can‚Äôt pin point is. initially thought swab testing I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs case. It‚Äôs painful breath nose. I‚Äôm also experiencing seem sinus related pain around eyes.

Edit - can‚Äôt smell anything right now. Tried smelling rubbing alcohol, hand sanitizer, Vick‚Äôs vaporub, aftershave nothing all. technically yes disagree opening gives pandemic extra chance kill people?

smh you... Looting full view everyone. never thought I'd say active shooters need them?

/jk /s obviously

EDIT: fucking shoot people would make sense. think health, lack pollution also huge factor mean. 

Fuck Fox News. 

But he‚Äôs wrong

Show state legitimate second wave Insult them

start bunker boy Yeah, New York New Jersey two worst ""death tolls"" entire world, ahead San Marino, small Italian microstate. look Italy's ongoing epidemic, 50% 70% new cases Lombardy -- meanwhile, large parts Southern Italy excess mortality year. Even dense poor parts country, like Naples Palermo, mild epidemics. 

This really suggests quarantined NYC metro area back March order prevent seeding rest country. Cuomo called proposal ""civil war,"" sensible idea White House, would likely reduced scale epidemics Arizona, California, Georgia, Florida. 

France, Italy, Spain, Japan (voluntary, compliance high) United Kingdom banned regional travel ""lockdowns,"" yet New Yorkers allowed travel wherever want -- hop plane head Los Angeles ""quarantine"" -- joke! NYTimes even wrote article explaining NY seeded rest nation virus. Yes. functioning brain. 

And no, can‚Äôt change people. Don‚Äôt bother put sad excuse human polygraph test, ask ever said that, would say no, would pass it. self centered believes best everything nothing wrong.

As kid watching lot movies small European country always dreamed moving USA. think it...

This guy making whole intire nation look like joke Wearing masks definitely helped. Hand washing soap definitely...a work progress. Government response probably key factor, imo they‚Äôre continuing make wise decisions restricting international flights. aunt balls she‚Äôd uncle. Student loans next.

They're deferral September technically 2032 pay off, $0 debt goal, snow-balling it.  Yes. We've seen worst economic damage get virus control. large proportion people scared. Scared people spend. hard understand. Checkmate atheists we're going ostrich strategy. No, don‚Äôt get satisfaction looking number nonstop like u do. No, he‚Äôs actually right. even technically. Even don‚Äôt test, that‚Äôs still case exists. doesn‚Äôt erase existence virus.  Yes fact obvious that's meant makes everyone look silly imo REALLY sad thing he‚Äôs still much better job hillary-the-ripper would done Message public: ""Don't hoard toilet paper!""

Public reaction: hoards toilet paper Zero percent. truly feel way.  Maybe difficult enforce plane, lifetime least multi-year ban flying flight. **Breaking News:** Onion declares bankruptcy, real life become insane satire. Never history universe, someone merited benefit doubt less Donald Jermaine Trump. Good considerate. could replace mind-control drugs chemtrails empathy... still shred hope myself. But, like you, certainly dismal Trump wins 2nd term. What‚Äôs point threatening?

Just it. in! stop celebrating birthdays, won‚Äôt get old. knew?! Stock gym equipment one said obligated anything. 

The fact though telling. narrative driven, fact driven.

Keep pushing propaganda. last month said concept testing isn‚Äôt great.
 
His word meaningless. close eyes, wont see nancy. 
if shut ears, wont hear joe. 
if shut hard enough never open ever fucking again, nancy/joe never get bother ever again. 
what great way get rid those. inject utero? entryway job teenagers

but fast food open like 24/7 it? think mwth 4-8* excluding game days?  Interesting. believe model shouldn‚Äôt updated new information available? really naive? think misspoke he‚Äôs old starting go senile. ~1000 people day, dying reason turmp administration really wanted economy tank election.

What terrible wager make people's lives. 

And meanwhile cases keep rising, plan, leadership, empathy.

At least know looks like failed steak salesman runs country. Yeah I‚Äôm Oakland County soon restrictions eased up, probably 80% people know threw caution living nothing ever happened. give benefit doubt, reread video transcript. actually one point say title says, regardless whether that's meant.  Suuuuure look Brazil, yesterday \~800,000 cases, \~1.6m tests. \~50% strike rate (been way while). think referring to. Poorly worded, think ""makes us look bad"" means ""makes look bad"", true, better testing listed worse hit nation. getting wrong?

you certainly are. say this: ""The point comment testing country counts look worse country. numbers would obviously sink stopped testing much."" 

-- without correcting inaccuracies statement, bad everyone else. correct ""everyone"" wrong, correct way. way ""corrected"" people wrong makes look like trump justified said. truth.

if trump warrior, understand angle entirely. want warrior truth, failing miserably. don‚Äôt touch it, dick feels huge McDonalds workers clean bathrooms, too. might start wonder lot life much valued allowed give free food. :\\

&amp;#x200B;

(Thank cleaning bathrooms, btw. I'm pretty germaphobic think could ever living. Plus I'm always scared walking public restroom feel immense sense relief see found clean one. hero.) mean.. tree available? That's damn funny &amp; ironic! distinctly remember African political joking coronavirus numbers low could afford tests. Trump unironically saying thing. Oh, Japan method. Ya sure, go ahead try WCGW? odds go another lockdown coming months? Trying decide stock gym equipment time around Go lockdown can. Even close gas stations travelers stop. simply means fight pandemic without outside help. WTF wrong people??? Logic actually think he's intelligent leader

Intelligent??? Try thinking isn‚Äôt bonafide imbecile. availability  1600 icu beds still

For reference, 2000 Texans died total coronavirus People like bane healthy people ending pandemic faster.

Staying home 54267235 times safer everyone dipshit going fcking theme park Infect thousands. 

I pitty parents.. might work reelection. Florida 6 deaths yesterday LOL Exactly.


Hes saying didnt test would cases...

The context testing. cases. saying wanted make country (and himself) look better could simply test less (which insane). Let‚Äôs hope so. Russia doesn‚Äôt great reputation helping foreign assets retire there. British double agent (can‚Äôt remember name right now) retired Moscow basically lived prisoner home died. Burger King isnt supposed career

who working job paid well enough survive? True, true - guess I'm naive, taking clip Trump applauded without grain salt. KN95 means nothing, IIRC. N95 established standard masks US. KN95 Chinese vendors Al√Øbaba list masks convince people buy protect Coronavirus assumption means N95. Soubds like coming reddit really stressful you. Perhaps comfortable Voat elsewhere. Imaging one trumps brownnoses, last 4 years parroting everything man says like gospel. day gets boot crucified too, idea everybody know hates now. mean crazy virus, guy fucking imbecile Yeah, China run million test day, test *every* single person market? pervious claims testing everyone Wuhan correct, ability test everyone went market? individual clearly demented. Someone make stop FUCK MAN PRESIDENT?!?!?! I'm absolutely getting unemployment make normally. tricky. work supposed reopen end July (conveniently, right pandemic-related unemployment funds end). can't reopen, quite frankly state good shape right now, qualify unemployment all, employer church-based. $135/week would help much, need go back work. Little ironic someone left suggests attempt start civil war. seen what‚Äôs happening America atm? coma since president trump last election?

Downvote away can‚Äôt world views challenged. live cheap assed Alabams. McDonalds starting people $12. would think new York least double work there. used everyone started working form home.

The clients absolutely nauseating.  first thought calling Trump bagged salad. I'm using it. Yup.

I live Everett blue-purple masks 50-50.

I'm vacation right eastern WA ""lol mask.""  Deaths falling fewer infections 3 weeks ago 4,5,6 weeks ago. various measures place reduced spread virus. North East states seen huge drops death tolls, south+south/west states seeing flat lines slight rises. Deaths might begin rise end month. people dropping dead reason. üëèPresident fucking United States, everybody.. put tape check engine oil light, never change oil either!  10k week? No. Since beginning June we‚Äôve often thousand deaths daily. basic math alone. We‚Äôve reached less 7k week. THANK SERVICE. workers keep patients health care professionals safe. front line workers preventing spread well caring loved ones hit dire straights. masks lockdown? offer alternative anecdote, co workers boyfriend tested positive, lost senses since regained fully. agree point still, statistically 2/314 deaths superstars (at least top 200 famous industry) would suggest 1/157 people Japan belong group. statistically could extrapolate 200,000 extremely well-known celebrities Greater Tokyo Metropolitan Area. (~30 million pop). order explanation make sense, would conclude celebrities 1000 times likely die Covid-19. two celebrities Shimura Ken Kumiko Okae. 

So either 

a) celebrities category (200 super celebs) 1000 times likely die Covid-19 gen pop, 

b) prevalence Covid 19 factor 1000.

c) happy truth exists somewhere b

or d) Shimura Ken Kumiko Okae incredibly unfortunate outliers. 

or something. I‚Äôm finding things pass time staying home. actually testing low many places USA, many deaths reported pneumonia deaths, people dying homes cant afford healthcare, hellworld true. joke! Obviously they're going make profit. That's they're for. making profit != Exploitation workers. brain big....

Minimum wage increases (in BC) often consume raise. person comes along thats worked store 2 minutes turns making u... nihilism sounds exhausting. think he's actually starting believe figured fast loose scuence opposite way. go within 20ish feet people. mean ""finish containment""?

If they‚Äôre shit parents, take it. I‚Äôm no-contact family good reason almost zero support system different state. 

I lost job, lease possibility extension even could afford rent myself, ex wrecked credit score abruptly moved working overnight shift. Everyone know already living roommates likely interested letting extra person couch surf. 

I‚Äôve applied easily almost hundred jobs haven‚Äôt heard back anything temporary low paying jobs.

I starting career pandemic hit ): It‚Äôs basically constant gaslighting seems. hope people die? \*Cheers Massachusetts\* 

...while quietly sobbing indoors. Thank god someone actually sympathizing essential workers. People talking extra money ending July running bad situations soon that‚Äôs reality many people retained jobs. hours pay getting cut, it‚Äôs ridiculous people jobs worse situations aren‚Äôt anything. 

And yes, know government blame essential workers justified feeling ripped off. People receiving IU take complaints personally; extra CARES money much needed measure feel workers compensated prioritized relief funding should‚Äôve been. Who's foolish, fool fool follows him? mention odd increase pneumonia deaths cannot afford healthcare That's shit. boss says wants pay commercial thanking people eating restaurant. heard thank anyone keeping business running handling worst shifts place seen he's 3 hours day 5 days week. loves talking entitled people days. üôÑ ""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!"" Trump tweeted.

I‚Äôll attempt translate trump-speak. believe saying US testing capabilities far better everyone else makes us look bad. tested little others, we‚Äôd find cases we‚Äôd testing little.

Obviously still b.s. comment still better headline cherry-picked tweet. point, they've already left, already 100 gonna 110+ next week.

Been grocery pickup past months go store. Watching people go store car. best 20% people wearing masks. I've friends get harassed wearing mask.

I'm hoping nothing bad happens things looking good. Belgium outlier including ""likely"" coronavirus deaths tally. 

Italy got blindsided hit early China hiding data.

(Most of) rest Europe higher population density much US frankly I'm surprised/impressed numbers worse. Comparing data CA NY death rates might better comparison here. comes ineptitude national leadership, I'd say come 1st place solid lead.

Brazil probably handling worse. that's country come with. Maybe Russia, want accidentally fall window. Pathetic. rescinded 3,2,1...  I'd like get here, too, hard find somewhere offers quality life price...and people keep going way are, land gonna get lot cheaper.  What's ya trade?  Lmao. joke. recall specifically, sorry. day california added almost 2500 cases. numbers gonna see middle week? Actually whole concept trickle economics basically Bezos comment. 

It‚Äôs unfortunate you‚Äôre peasant economic system shit trickles you.  Victim complex? denying owners take surplus value value work pay wage?

Like, aside know, entire pandemic thing, every week there's something would've reported least couple weeks, every days. Oil/diesel spill here, people getting lynched there, massive DDOS's, companies breaking law without care, fucking nuts, stuff literally happening every days so.

It's literally inflation news way. Old stuff would wet dream CNN something report thrown day so, there's already breaking, relatively massive story happening day later.

I know happened got 2020, someone threw ""crazy shit"" breaker, I'd appreciate reset sometime soon. I'm literally speechless insanity we're seeing, accepted honestly, there's much else inundated much psycho drama major problems. think see closet full Jordans. Holy shit brainwashed think indirectly try tell hospital stop testing people coronavirus look like everything OK USA. Governor Abbot already said ‚ÄúReopen Texas‚Äù mandated order supersedes local orders Mayors. Texas leads country conflicting information. appreciate work do! Check Orange County 2 weeks. public health hearing last week crazies full force. went ocean once. took one 8 hour private fishing charters boss bought ""team building."" puked ENTIRE trip, back shore, threw another 18 hours. called doctor thinking food poisoning...turns REALLY hate ocean, least ears do.

People shouting hours, close quarters hours, getting tear gassed, etc, mean protests spread COVID, nobody idea much yet. US essentially adopting strategy ""we'd like hospital bed need it"", spreading COVID bound happen anyway, question many people sick one time. I'm Skilled Trades even make unemployment right now.

Brazil jockeying *hard* lead Fucking it. Pussies Wow bots coming out. Mods really need clean place.. according Trump, get tested, test positive. Who‚Äôs 1? Problem is, want cake eat it, too. frustrating!! many people realize this. joke, unless convince different person 9 month ago, realize belief means knew covid circulating last fall, would 100% ordered covered up.

And realize that, host things start make sense, low east asian case load vs US/EU, ABC genetic linerages, classifying early US covid data, leaving refusing sign international call investgation removed part assuming China orgin.

How many people kill maneuver?

Remember one Andy? 1% true death rate, meaning we‚Äôve caught 1/5th cases via testing. Around 1/3 completely asymptomatic they‚Äôre highly unlikely tested. Another huge swath mild symptoms likely opted get tested all.

Also, several died Covid without ever testing positive. testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases.



this still false every account.  people trying stop this? found follow-up study confirmed one's findings, proved gotten worse.

Does make far sense cases increased reopening pandemic? CA, max per week unemployment $450, plus $600 Fed ‚Äúbump up‚Äù. Let‚Äôs math.

$450/40 hours = $11.25

$450+600=$1050
$1050/40 hours = $26.25


Minimum wage CA $13/hr, less half bumped unemployment. Granted, making minimum wage full time, state says would max $260/week, plus $600, would still bringing home $860/wk, $21.50/hr.

And CA low side unemployment weekly payments. Kentucky $552 (plus Fed), $1,234 dependents, $823 don‚Äôt, plus $600 Fed. Sadly, CA lowest. 

The system messed private companies pay less one might get pandemic... make 15/hr company car use however want. car. work national pharmacy chain remodels/projects. car really gift, cheaper option paying mileage. clear meant context dont want accept Second Young people highly educated, make less money less job security Boomer high school dropouts.

I think degrees 50 years ago reserved wealthy classes---they would go school take family businesses. education designed teach world, especially history humanities. That's also STEM rather rare---what would point that? 

When became job credential, schools forced open (remember still legacy admissions reduced, way lower ranked schools now), longer signaled class. 

Social class born determines far anything else. Lest ask terminal psi tents goes like white people think racism experience any. still using Insulin? moved onto HydroCloroLysolin. 100% prevents diseases. FD's? least one near Greenbriar golf club respond wrong comment?

And lowering risk diyabeetus too.

Quaker Oats cuz right thing Muh misrepresentation. Good riddance trump. stop arresting people crime rate would zero! would damage financially???

Why would miss game false report? friend works hospital Tampa. said cases way he's seeing young people too.  think anything withe protests? business reopening isn‚Äôt based hours, get set amount goes healthcare account 401k per day worked. normally works well covers majority insurance premium, damn it‚Äôs fucking us lol. fit narrative. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø  ignoring context again? trash ‚Äújournalism‚Äù. Yes. Hospitalizations ticking up, good nowhere near capacity. Let's hope stays way! FDA determined drugs ""unlikely effective treating COVID-19 authorized uses EUA.""


""Additionally, light ongoing serious cardiac adverse events serious side effects, known potential benefits CQ HCQ longer outweigh known potential risks authorized use,"" FDA wrote notice Monday. I'm angry all. I've calm, expected paint emotional actually address failed argument.

Maybe overestimated you, context limited article. context basic common sense, either purposely pretending apply you... have. ""quit replying me"", haha first good chuckle day close eye see me. know lot people need travel would fly thought safe, driving don‚Äôt. know highest, they're highest country population. can't look straight per capita, Monaco absolutely killing metric, 16,000 tests. stop paying taxes mean wont owe any???  Yes, thanks too. 5 different risk factors. Info like actually save lives :) i'm commenting summary statement add important context shows still completely unjustified. 

if better job ""bringing real truth"" conversation say anything. SafePangolin3 wanted karma I‚Äôm Los Angeles. They‚Äôre labeling anyone everyone COVID. Deaths inflated too.

Drive local hospital look yourself. I've actually asked recently. There's good content reddit comments usually AIDs at. guess maybe stay comments. It‚Äôs damn Covid-19 Salmon imported Europe contaminating clean wet markets! Destroy Salmon imports! airlines know sits seat. There's reason create unnecessary conflict air. Wow really guys. news. always take words context Ok, California one generous states UI. best, pretty good. 

The absolute max anybody normally get (not counting months $600 feds pandemic) $450/week ($410 take Federal taxes) 6 months. 6 months (or possible less, see below) done. 

Now, max. made around $60k last year pretty high quarterly amount get there. max without Fed bonus $12k-13k 6 months. lot money. made $60k, even less, there's thing deep within website figure out. 

Basically, get lesser 6 months weekly rate (based highest quarter), total amount (based year), whichever lower. me, lucky enough get max. get $450/month ($410 federal taxes) get total year, $12k+. reach that, done. 

again, ALWAYS ready able work. Every time ask, ready able work. happen make money year, even part year unemployment, apply another claim one year started current claim. 

I hope said confusing. questions, please feel free ask. shouldn‚Äôt threaten it, it. different lighting cigarette. I'll give credit credit due, objectively right. Unrelated, anyone happened inform President can't lose election drops out? Might worth mentioning, saying. hydroxychloroquine? stop taking hydroxychloroquine prevent coronavirus already played out? Alright everyone, pack up, pandemic's over. metric severity Coronavirus Hospitalizations That's heard went labs. get doc give 1 though. Again, don‚Äôt disagree. it‚Äôs possible albeit improbable. simple think. Cases function testing. Hospitalized deaths matters. That's it. want President answer agenda driven questions. could giving better answers he's not. He's mailing in. He's disrespecting country, minorities protecting communities.  many folks ICU 40s? skipped false statement liked supported

Tells need know love propaganda war ba sing se it‚Äôs not. would idea who‚Äôs sick. Doesn‚Äôt mean aren‚Äôt sick. answer question yes, check post history. Quite bizarre. gonna say... might 200k August. stop aging less people dying... xD percentage hospitalization capacity now? Ok, cool. Let‚Äôs ignore bump hospitalizations record pneumonia deaths. *thumbs up* Elliott missed game, could damage financially.

Also, lie it.  people going Trump rally going sue him? seems Trumpian them... CDC said CFR .4% IFR .26%. baseless Better S20 paying staff higher salary actually securing labour force able poach best everywhere else industry, thereby crippling competition stop fact checking, Trump lie vey little mind reading though, make leader look like idiot purposefully take words context.

Trump's gonna blame antifa rioters somehow insider reliable source, also information study makes sense alot flaws without getting test would gotten sick needed hospitalizations?

He‚Äôs saying 0 tests we‚Äôd 0 cases we‚Äôre much testing lot cases. He‚Äôs trying talk crap countries low cases aren‚Äôt testing. stupid way, he‚Äôs right aren‚Äôt testing much. Man, know immune dosent mean can't still spread virus right? Also really evidence can't contract virus second time. 

Just try careful around others respect space social distancing/ wearing mask. yikes thought protests perfect storm.... school thought , gets rid school testing, US schools highest rate success world , since one fails!
 
 
 Holy Mackeral - Earth person become US president???? disputing? thought understood meant? That's smug first place. making sense. Another day, another misleading headline unbelievably hypocritical exact people lecturing us non-stop believe everything see/read watch much TV.

It seems wrong stereotype boomers negatively, I'll damned keep trying damnedest earn it. Yeah, giving $100 gaslight customers. üôÉ deaths scroll katiekaboom's reply thread August. dead alive? Look, worked restaraunt management. sense sarcasm, get it. hard job. isnt. opinion. stressful part job customer service rep, assistant manager, general manager, hiring 18+ work oven.

Only teenagers wanted job, adults think gas food. need money, dont work restaurant. Go work real job. cant get real job, why?

Are handicapped? Okay, understandable. cant anything super difficult physically/mentally tolling. getting disability supplement income.

Are young experience? Perfect. Great start.

Are convicted felon, nobody hire record? yourself.

Nobody ""good"" hire me! Youre looking hard enough. Look opportunity, wont look you.

Simple that. opinions, facts. Argue shower win, cause wont win here. people gotten money / getting it. Like people quit job shortly processed infrastructure super behind times. high fever. 101. keeps saying lost taste. flu season would say could something else kind illness summer doesn‚Äôt really fit complicated plans, like coyote vs roadrunner Doesnt make sense either. point testing much widely large nation

This false anyway, testing shit results government done shit job containing people. 

Why concentrate instead ""if stop testing we'd fewer cases""? News media makes fuckin sense test would graduated Harvard honors Trump thinks grope anyone counted. Oh stupid counting. Maybe I'm wrong Medicaid then.  hours cut half qualified UI. part pandemic deal. scroll /u/katiekabooms reply thread  Dude saw memes

""Can't pandemic there's testing"" voted guy regardless wearing mask I'll wear mine, stay home much can, wash hands hand sanitize much possible way regardless outcome best realistically could absolutely correct, said country size. Comparing USA Spain kind useless, they're monstrously different population sizes.  lawyer left Rudy? think sane lawyer take cases. show cannot sue someone lies Sorry mate come 2nd retarded president.
Brazilian president told citizens invade hospitals film prove covid fake...
Trump dumb whole new level.  *""If stop counting corporate bailouts now, we'll corporate bailouts, any. ""* People fault biden black people vote trump quote meant ‚Äúi better black community vote Trump‚Äù

With this... even supposed mean? serious Again, one's job day day hero, showing work. Let's make supermarket cashiers heroes. Let's make garbage collectors heroes. Let's make pizza delivery people heroes. Let's make... wait second... people heroes, everyone hero, everybody hero, nobody hero.

So, pay people heroes' wages, nobody else is. And, no, every fire fighter hero. every lifeguard, doctor. doctor Chicago treated least 80 people cancer even though cancer. hero?

I'll save word hero people earned it. COULD anyone, rare situation calls extraordinary effort willingness many others won't. Last checked, millions people clocked Walmart jobs. Oh, I'm sure millions heroes eyes, means know means poor. 

For poor, another day job.  lots Trump rallies, problem would take care that. even know he's trying say? hospitalizations? number ICU patients increased? deaths?  combination movement testing? Joe Buck speech writer now?  Right, time already running TP good reason. Masks would insane.  Futurama fans here?

‚ÄúThanks denial, I‚Äôm immortal!‚Äù also comports view reality: believe true. external reality Can‚Äôt 2nd wave first wave ends  Look aus nz want accurate testing. Everyone shitting him? wrong? No! 

Straight facts Donald What‚Äôs even sad treating employees well actually better company. many management short-sighted stupid realize it. sadistic. Lol. CVS workers dont houses. Theyre lucky arnt sharing rent 3-4 ways.  Maybe says something minimum wage covid benefits... Honestly though? That's COULD happen get flu. unlikely, enough people get flu it'll happen. Maybe start wearing masks symptomatic flu season even pandemic ends prevent this. That's exact point going type out.
Thanks! assumption state maximum unemployment $350 week accurate. state, example, weekly max $568. Either way, it‚Äôs significantly $1,200 assertion replied to. Also, 4,800 + 2,400 + 2,800 = 10,000, not, 7,500. Trump singlehandedly convinced living simulation. What? I've turning radio block refused call pandemic much later... even spoke flight blocks Miller manages get whole lot. Jacksonville resident worst part many damn people going meet street? many going accidentally infect many people? I'm going able trust anybody even house. knows f*** interacted with.

That's worst part whole damn thing. can't really trust people around you. safety assume everyone get you.

Oh RNC coming too. Jesus Christ pray us put assholes. feel bad comedians... #bunkerboy killing material Well you‚Äôve working specialized profession 20 years ‚Äúrisen‚Äù salary $275/week something wrong bc made high school. It‚Äôs amusing suggesting learn skill make employable allow demand better pay mocked. God forbid need valuable skill want earn more. that‚Äôs view job market working 20 years idk help lol. I'm also concerned time year sport takes place during. May, March, frightening Medians type average. Keep pedantic BS though- people love it! article definitely says that. dude's brain oatmeal.  Two terms voted veep, worked him. Oh, forgot mention 2% annual raise ""timer"" gets delayed reset promoted. Gotta love it.  fucking shortsighted, vulnerable people like going back work high risk environments.

Not that. Unemployment offices going people got laid fucked economically COVID report earnings make errors shitty 1996 level unemployment websites.

I seen guy Reddit yesterday saying California EDD office auditing didnt report $150 lyft earnings. mother fuckers want bank statements, Venmo details contacting Lyft, mean time owes like thousands ""overpayment"" like 10 20% interest added fraud.

Meanwhile, Millionaires corporations get MILLIONS completely unaccounted without hitch. interesting theory vaping world thc lung problems COVID hidden. I'm one conspiracies, making sense gotta bounce. nursed large tertiary hospital couple decades, still believe hospital consists *everyone* works there. Cooks, cleaners, clerks, security. Everyone. Imagine much chaos would happen group decided show up. 

Tell people work appreciate help. Sometimes need hear that. anything something like vote last 5 elections. 5/5 4/5 dem rep. 3/5 2/5 moderate/undecided.  Toddlers learn concept object permanence age two.

Trump still hasn‚Äôt. highly doubt anything actually gets deleted, go motions. No. I'm applying logic outdoors, there's little chance transmission, even top especially masks. volume air matters enormous amount, temperature air currents. Currents outside tend flow around people; viral droplets tend become non infectious minutes drawn ground rather hanging inside stale indoor environments stale recirculated air.

It DOUBLY important right focus infection likely occur - indoors people talking, yelling, singing close quarters extended periods time there's lack fresh air flow environment.

Of contact traced outbreaks worldwide, less half percent traced outdoor gatherings.

In America, everyone, even ""smart people"" sound like bobble heads using fucking ""but know anything yet/there's evidence/it's flawed study/that's Fauci said"" argument around world, teams closing places actually produce outbreaks,.the ones mentioned, creating study study signs point INDOORS. LENGTH EXPOSURE INFECTED STALE RECIRCULATED ENVIRONMENT AIR.

In America, gonna continue ""but science!"" Pissing contest ""I fuckin love science"" types ignore science produced funded group vested interest particular result? Only, COVID, I'm sure interest making everyone worry environments except likely contract - work main one.

Oh, places closing outbreaks actually occur? They're ridding virus numbers go in, oh, know, states everyone spending lot time recirculated air everyone keeps saying ""we can't figure out... Must protests BEACHES.""

And long office environments mentjoned politicians news media U.S., corona never go away. Eight hours AC someone infected, even far away floor, practically guarantees outbreak. Even living roommates way better parents.

Living alone fantastic, though. like see people --- go work, hang friends, date people --- spend time home alone, lot people really enjoy. cases different. patients tested positive 17~18 days exposed virus. become infectious already infected family members. incubation periods longer 14 days. Or, know, die it. Whatever. fine... He‚Äôs stupidest fucking person country.  kind implies healthy people get organ transplants. people require transplants healthy. meets criteria addict, age threshold, disqualifying illness match. could very, easily diabetic, heart disease, obese still eligible. charge got bodies Telegraph needs new headline writers. take that's problem lot U.K. publications. 120k deaths already cases spiking states reopened early (TX, FL, NC, SC, AZ, GA, etc). fear mongering. fact. Governments people need take seriously. weather nice mean covid disappeared. Well, couple weeks, suppose he'll say hospitals overwhelmed people wanting visit little while, see magnificent hospitals Texas Arizona are. headline gave good chuckle. mean, he‚Äôs wrong. tests mean diagnoses üòÇüòÇüòÇ disagree people morons. stupid believe influenced president. Trump said anything it, they'd alive. That's simple fact.   fuck matter leaked you‚Äôre willing admit agent confirmed it? Serious question here. Rumors NFL players come *all time* clear agent‚Äôs statement spoke Zeke it, saying ‚Äúhe feels good‚Äù not. Cowboys came refused say players infected privacy reasons, else left? 

This especially hilarious considering Zeke came hours later agent confirmed said ‚ÄúMY HIPAA RIGHTS?!?!?‚Äù mention, acted like absolute defiant dumbass whole entire season comes COVID-19. rights violated matter mental gymnastics have, he‚Äôs one puts way much shouldn‚Äôt really expect feel sympathy now? sure lot talk, really put practice.

Exactly, going enforce it? Employees U.S shops requring masks spit on, beaten, killed (shot) insisting someone wear mask. airlines strapped cash desperate revenue right now. aren‚Äôt going hire plane bouncers + deal legal fallout altercations.

These kind rules make public feel safer planning travel buying tickets \^

things happen fair, test blood sugar went along merry way, diabetes much longer. I've waiting since March 17th first filed. got email today application received... That's lying shitty. claim another persons reality. Pfew someone's butthurt. Glad negative asshats like get fuck country. Somehow ""wow willing risk elderly people's health let family 4 starve?"" ring people parrot ""killing grandma"" fallacy argument. Yes. shocking part seems like wouldn‚Äôt. Schrodinger's dick... Spicy retort. Though would enjoy intelligent well informed conversation topic, belief better places inflammatory obviously politically motivated post replies. checked r/conservative r/conservativepolitics ? Dude John Madden levels stating see Pat, secret winning score points team   actually 60k August according projections early April. We're 120k now. truly idiot. evil one. understand saying stupid thing say. would stop putting casts people, would broken bones, any. Trump would blind everyone else king. open windows doubt said anyone provide video? article's video someone reading article's text. would misleading suggested contracted facility. 

But didn't. I'm sure talking about.   flew last week kids behind weren‚Äôt wearing masks adult sitting next even though dad behind empty seat grandparents across aisle us (I‚Äôm assuming that‚Äôs since kept telling kids sit still.) thought 4-7yo sitting next good idea beyond me. don‚Äôt support banning kids definitely think dad grandparents banned. kids kept hopping down, yelling playing tray table. again, kids fault flight attendants normally would handle clearly rightly kept distance little potential COVID spreaders. hes wrong, look people actually going vote aint black biden  don‚Äôt need say again. enough people saying rightful doubt it, given reputation is. understandable.

 refer wrote mentality Chinese people VS USA people. also mentality people Asien countries people don‚Äôt take granted won‚Äôt get virus. It‚Äôs like paranoid people vs. relaxed freedom loving people. people overly cautious even number cases low, still respect virus. Asia people experienced virus outbreaks lot often, people also don‚Äôt think bad media says unlike USA, multitude reasons exists, people don‚Äôt take seriously. Self compliance works wonders (compare EU USA). Even numbers accurate, based self compliance alone, china lot better USA. Also look HK. People protests fight right, everyone still masks on. Chinese people Austria take seriously till date, even though lot restrictions lifted (today borders opened fro Germany, mask required anymore Supermarkets, restaurant, etc. workers Chinese restaurant still on, want extra safe) 

All all, understand point view regarding numbers China. numbers apart, asian countries better USA. Maybe even whole world, knows.  said now? don‚Äôt recall saying that.   

1. virus ISN‚ÄôT deadly. IFR .26%   

2. Mask wearing currently done really isn‚Äôt effective preventing spread. worried getting sick means stay home, rest us suffer .26% population vulnerable disease. Agreed. lost cause try explaining logical inconsistencies fucking dolts.

BuT Da LaMe StReaM MeeDIa! 

Newsflash chief big brain, Fox News mainstream mainstream. Watching Tucker ""Heir Swanson Fortune"" Carlson tell every night think, parrot garbage anyone within earshot next day work. I‚Äôm making more, idk job looks like fall. suspect people making unemployment finally start building savings account got insider? Thats even reliable science based website! Thank you!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è actually pretty fucking accurate. maccies workers UK suffering either

My job 90% programming, relatively skilled thing, move family home cheapest places around here, rent, bills running car, would struggle ever able afford leave house enjoy life test daily. think massively underestimate power daily tests. [President Monday downplayed concerns rising number coronavirus cases states across country, indicating increase due testing.

&amp;#x200B;

He's wrong, statistics 101. great argument! tried watch video pops fucking pan. link sucks absolutely terrible. work restrictions comes social distancing. Masks even mandatory employees customers. 

I immunocompromised roommate. right I'm try find balance mitigating risk running food days. 

Especially sucks customers grown another level terrible comments precautions. (Mask, sanitizing use, contact things, etc). paying debt. Paying debt would semi-responsible reason. People America want able go fucking drink, party, get tatoos nails done. bitching about.

Fuck fuck mefirst attitudes. Now?

So weren‚Äôt testing months ago now?

I‚Äôm doctor seems ass backwards ngl. Testing means effectively Track Trace.

Every worker person public wearing mask ‚Äî properly.

Enact community programs enable proper social distancing at-risk populations.

Be proactive around region recent outbreak.

A lack federal leadership acts like friction people business.

Naturally, let's double humble efforts. 

We need make sure neighborhoods well attended to. 

It's okay rest. walking steep slope. understand plight. following news closely. thought ‚Äúbleach injection‚Äù already hard beat. say anything stupid? 

I mean sure, test case thing really stupid, still ‚Äútechnically true‚Äù. bleach thing place. via phone guess.

No need talk me. Explain kind. reports seen shows outdoor spread virus? Lmao, reality actually sitcom doofus. seems like nightmare us audience getting funny parts. real life? fantasy? *Wilford Brimley takes one last glance direction, shoulders shaking breathes heavy sigh, rolling away sunset*   People die killed. lmao wat Agree virtually this, clarify Nurses?  


I know single RN making money due virus - granted, massive risk transmission, worst case scenario... well paid dead lead happy life. 

But work hazards aside, RN's gotten lot opportunities transfer state licenses specifically work COVID units, nurses know - they're faced similar pay travel nurses receive; 2-3k+ week, housing, travel/relocation stipends. Granted, lot positions contracted weeks, make lot money lot good want follow hotspots nurse.  


Many layers nurses positions may leave great mental health, physical health course, stability hospital gig, etc.  


But, ones list went school long enough know getting messy, depressing, potentially dangerous careers. nurses know also tough nails want there. cashier would definitely want ""helping"" ""being hero"" - really hero, really helping - are, deserve compensated fairly it. Hazard pay typically 10% wage, work lot overtime add up. course they're getting raw deal, essential &amp; expendable eyes employers.  


I think would unreasonable bolster wages front-line workers underlying health conditions tie portion income employees' age (potential age discrimination law ask, iirc matters interviews).  


Either that, companies treat essential workers like expendable sending at-risk ""expendables"" paid leave, giving atta' boy younger/healthier workers still risk health along anyone come contact with. 


Largely, one really cares - workers expendable, know it, employers know it. sad state affairs technology knowledge today... yet Americans handed invitation go bankrupt health, risk health - which... also leading cause bankruptcy.. 

People profits fit corporations people too, care get sick die, happiness, benefits, much thought part humanity.

Corporations *are* people, make people?

&amp;#x200B;

PS. Pardon rant, aiming anything - upset state things aspects stuff. Hope good day. Huh? CMC, course actually isnt true talking indoors air circulates. distance better, outdoors far far better. confirm forgot president feel *so* much better! doesn‚Äôt fit narrative.... sure, fuck not? seriously say that, he?! stuck head ground, hoping go away. smart ones keep necessary keep safe, BUT... lot people acting like pandemic over. need put cap ends like Spanish flu took 40,000,000 lives. teach stuff statistics, he's wrong. sneezing 

Uh. sneeze mouth? think George Carlin said ""Just think stupid average person is, remember half dumber that!"" again, statistical sampling methods require large study effective. It‚Äôs done 30 subjects. well wrong he? obviously confirmed cases since testing one reporting cases, exist.

You came conclusion yourself. need realize lot Americans idea statistics, statement matter perspective. I‚Äôd assume one people prob one lockdown crying haircut crying able go shopping go nice dinner restaurant....... it‚Äôs pandemic follow recommendations never get shit hole again, US really 50 different countries legal/legislative perspective. Double number EU member states see well fair whole. actual numbers show India

India youthful distribution, 0.8% population 80. also likely lot deaths elderly happening home recorded. Plus deaths lagging statistic, India undergoing exponential growth cases. fly pandemic...? Reddit allow OnlyFans site ""small business"". approval rating sit 40% greater virtually whole presidency. NAZIS chanting ""Jews replace us!"" approval rating took like 2% hit.

24% eligible voters doesnt matter gets enough delegates win, half people vote. tell right lot people virus whos tested. took antibody test actually it. whole family yet nobody showed symptoms all. imagine millions people bothered tested nothing wrong them. gonna drastically reduce number probably less 1%. yeah, virus worth considered ""pandemic"" let alone something serious enough destroy world's economy put millions job. save elderly overly obese people? Yeah blown way proportion. Well bad season going canceled even attempt stupid wanna league thing Florida. know end. permanent lung organ damage. dumb person's mistaken idea smart must like

A weak person's mistaken idea strong

A poor person's mistaken idea success

A spineless follower's mistaken idea leader said relative population. Tens thousands **nothing** nation 330 million. I'm waiting [this level public expect movement even *chance* achieving goals. Anyway deny uptick infections, see *specifically* blamed either protests reopenings, happening time. number big gatherings vs. many many times frequent, smaller ones (remember, people going parks, pools beaches again).  mean, wasn‚Äôt terribly smart thing say, media spin negatively. prefaced saying increase cases due increase testing. true? Certainly not. lend crucial context statement? Yes. sent passport renewal March 3 think many find quite cynical people labled ""heroes"" clapping them, symbolism....

but fundamentally nothing actually shows appreciation like pressing better working wage conditions lower rank workers like cashiers, janitors nurses care workers critial sectors. still payed quite bad, working conditions still good, many still short necessary PPE top lot people decided covid over.

I think I've read somewhere care worker basically said ""screw guys, shove 'heartfelt claps hero-labels' a**""... Robert Kiyosaki said best. coronavirus make rich, richer poor, richer. people screwed middle class. poor getting unemployment ever made normal job. Americans products resources corporation rules us, US Government. Laughs Washington D.C. rent prices. Bruh. Australia gets freaked 5 cases entire country. guys dumb anyone CMC, goofed. complete misunderstanding economics politics. No, politicians know set prices labor, especially better supply demand free market. rushed sign bill extreme circumstances, want undershoot. proving mistake, enormous morale hazard Wait guys think might something he, though? know strict definition ""case"" we're using here. regularly problem stories tweets. first thought way hell would say something stupid maybe article slanted him.

Maximum standard unemployment $350 x 4 weeks = 1,400 x 2 adults = 2,800. 

 without children we're looking $7,500 one time only, two adults survive even expensive area one size fits plan. high tide raises shops whatnot.

Anyway roughly $7,500 plus $500 per child *one time only* $5,000 per month two adults, stress, that's everything, every expense two people even expensive locations. One size fits all, etc.

Come together everybody. common than... Actually l live Vietnam now, since quarantine ended I'd say there's drop mask usage. feeling safety, low pollution levels late, fact required anymore.

We've known long time severe case rate 20%. literally everyone earth gets virus theoretically 1.7 billion would get severe case.

Of course, ZERO chance every single person world would get virus; sense extreme fear mongering article You

You responded CDC death data death data, without bearing many infections were. 

you find infection data easily online flu covid, TLDR roughly 0.25% death rate approximately 40 million infections far. think that's absurdly high. would bet closer 1% death rate 10 million current infections i'm scientist.

bear mind though look flu data see lots footnotes, one points estimating number flu cases based mathematical modeling actual positive results. that's why/how CDC also take stab dark many undiagnosed covid cases According Indiana's study, death rate accounting asymptomatic less severe cases 0.6%. 9x number cases currently confirmed. Hand face. 

He‚Äôs actually making point adjacent relevant least partially correct, moronic way. concerned ‚Äúus‚Äù looking bad. actually said it‚Äôs good tests, bad embarrasses personally. know, shitty job controlling it.

Feels like litterally beginning. threshold becomes problem average american. doubt 200,000 threshold. 1 million, 10 million? Unless affects majority american directly - someone know dies covid19, doubt numbers television mean much individualistic society.

My guess 2 million range. also human trafficking without threat deportations economic inequalities, maybe onto something post screenshot? Idunno, bodyguard steal medical records they're probably destroyed now. I'm sure everything White House going headed shredder hours election results come in. Public health say? man quotes painful text.

also ""we'd cases, any"" stark contrast something like ""over representation"". guy need translator? said said. Gee can't imagine young people faith system.

You quoted wrong said even realize it. Trump Monday downplayed concerns rising number coronavirus cases states across country, indicating increase due testing.

First line article read. entire problem said. focused trying paint every media headline fucking spin can't even see issue right front eyes. testing far advanced. It‚Äôs much bigger better country we‚Äôre going cases. We‚Äôre always going cases. said, morning, that‚Äôs probably downside good testing find lot cases countries, don‚Äôt even test, don‚Äôt have. don‚Äôt test, don‚Äôt cases.

You definition propaganda  tried avoid saying right wing dumb ass, thanks saying loud someone worked fast food 3 awful years I've witnessed many workers following normal bare minimum hygiene. changing gloves often should, touching phones store phones screens food. I'm gonna trust eating long time. Logic works serious diseases. dementia ole 'things pull ass usually smelly' defence. 

I.E. Allegations gaslighting immediately. Shall talk 'problematic' aswell? Maybe 'disingenuous' everyone *other side* right? completely transparent people use words simply effect I'm sorry remove wool eyes pathetic. Probably Americans idiots. get 74 without learning object permanence?! shit Sherlock! naming three rich people every reason dislike Trump ""showing hand"" exactly? addition Japan antibody tests showing 0.1% infected, concerning. clearly mislead media months ago said 14% NYC infected. means virus superwide spread, mild, fucking kill you, Backwards? never even stopped first wave Muppet.. ‡≤†_‡≤† stop checking balance bank account I'll never run money!

Oh fucking irony statement rofl. Shut dude, argument garbage. entire comment insinuated that, unless making point completely void context OP. Good thing Americans notoriously free preexisting conditions Spoiler: he's fine. peaceful protesters Rochester beating elderly peaceful protests around country

 

1. touch sanitize. take drink put back speak anyone. hard shows respect employees serving patrons. actually think people believe lie antifa thing?

Really?

I thought got past week ago antifa literally set fucking sovereign nation annexing part Seattle. right. majority can't comprehend it, live country made less testing Latin America (1500 approx), people respect virus anymore, government control testing conveniently many people get tested. man genius. Can‚Äôt argue facts mean think that‚Äôs sarcasm right? pay INCOME taxes* Haha shit It‚Äôs long ago since bragged cases almost testing. gives bit context, dont think? She‚Äôs completely right. People keep dying pandemic. It‚Äôs normal unavoidable cancer.

As long society isn‚Äôt crumbling mass burial hospitals constant triage, keep gears turning. can‚Äôt people staying home year vaccine found. severely detrimental economy, also mental health population. sad thing followers right like ""you know what, he's right!"" liked woman needs put highly contaminated COVID-19 ward massless full week clean body fluids patients. would best punishment imo. That‚Äôs way meant it, know it. He's fucking idiot. parents awesome. No, hear girlfriend deserves much better McDonald's workers NY deserve $15/hr cashiers? bridges gap college educated salaries literally unskilled high school students. part fair.  ain't sun screen wearin' type, pretty much back normal living. lmfao, ego superiority complex got bit bigger remove fire detectors house, cases fire? stop weighing keep eating like shit, I'll lose weight. sight, mind. :) Mm know good cuz toes fingers tingle im done! Lol pretending protesters wearing masks social distancing.

Your propaganda game obvious Janitors garbage men two important jobs society without pandemic. Shame Interesting. thought point phases incrementally increase testing group size order limit damage vaccine turns dangerous phases simultaneously seems contradict guess I‚Äôm wrong. 2 people UK New Zealand: ""Let in....LET IIIIIINNNNN!"" Feel free borrow this: [Covid-19 Alert Nobody cares britbong eurotrash say America. Absolutely agreed! damn well wish coronavirus situation could bring end general social acceptability stranger getting space. 

Social distancing thing ALWAYS, wants smell body odor sprayed bodily-fluid-excretion aerosols emitting disgusting stranger's body ever?? Read article - I'm providing context, Trump¬†on Monday downplayed concerns rising number coronavirus cases states across country, indicating increase due testing

That's first sentence article gives context headline.  fish infected, surface frozen meat fish could serve resting bed virus. already knew various plants meat seafood fallen disease. impossible virus could spread one workers stay surface salmon 2 days air travel. happen people pneumonia well? least short term? I'm saying same, can't know permanent permanent. Oh, okay. average intelligence usually referred intelligence within one standard deviation mean? actually makes sense. mistaken. According AskReddit thread read once, u/Gc8211 owns Jeep vehicle. court saying police cannot break angry mobs limits protesting.

So point op? He's pointing fact spikes cases due rising testing availability fucking nitwits lmao fucking wrong. Amount initial exposure much clear indicator risk dying. Countless healthy medical staff died get exposed large dose vira immune system get overwhelmed adapt.
Stop spreading uninformed bullshit. *""It'd funny pathetic...""* huge island! half population Spain 15,201 TIMES surface.

Just bit crowded New Zealand. Red rocks baby hope get worms asshole. Honestly people, depends demographics affected. Old poor people nursing homes? sleep. Young children rich families? real shit Last time checked numbers, US 27th world tests per million population.
This baced stats worldometer
site. Fair, it‚Äôs unfair without context. However still categorically false level testing - many ‚Äúshithole‚Äù countries fairing better testing competently run first world countries heads above. Protests actually legit cause behind it, sporting events beaches don‚Äôt, thats dumb! 

 

 

 Good news virus. Well they're going anyway, maximum extent they're allowed. need strong oversight comparable nuclear material control stuff like this. Random unannounced inspections data, processes, use it, sell much, internal documents, meetings, plans.

Or could not. contact investigators told three events took place late May, two 50 individuals attendance,‚Äù according Claudia Murphy, public information officer Whatcom Unified Command...   
  then, county health department learned private social events connected additional cases...   
 ‚ÄúYou want haircut? Wear mask. going enjoy freedoms phases demonstrate control this. hope go backwards, concern,‚Äù Lindquist said. Wow Brazils president Bolsonaro faster trump Idea. Lol, doesn't. like build lives away parents. mean like they're bad people. Culturally prefer independent become adults.

For example, America dating would much difficult live parents. I'm fully aware context

Oh man, reddit's new slogan. can't sue children. Smart, terms pandemics, warning shot.  means cases asymptomatic. Idaho pay people go back work fear bankruptcy. Hospital bills coronavirus treatment make people go bankrupt heartbeat. Idaho regrets initial decision open back up. not. I'm pretty sure something types folk actually do. ... me! half voters vote guy. still rankles lot world perceives Americans stupid voted Trump, reality us screwed really stupid Americans electoral college system.  Well already I'll ramble again

Ramble ramble ramble, guy LOVE 

this whole thread people literally AGREEING Trump, still thinking he's saying something completely different.

This entire post studied. fantastic example media's ability manipulate people half-truths lack context. new forecast projects 201,129 deaths due COVID-19 United States beginning October mainly due reopening measures way, Institute Health Metrics Evaluation (IHME) University Washington said Monday. IHME raised estimate 18% 169,890 said Florida would among hardest hit states, estimated 18,675 deaths.

*Summary generated It‚Äôs beautiful.  opposite comment exists sorting quoted words mentioned above. 

But yes, absolutely, searching confirmation bias hand inevitably correct. 

9 10 scientists say... (As ask exactly 10 scientists). could go wrong? According new modelling study, roughly 1.7 billion people around world, 22% global population, fall 'high-risk' category coronavirus cases. study, published Lancet Global Health, excluded healthy older individuals without underlying health conditions, group also known risk age. also take account risk factors like poverty obesity.

*Summary generated First time seeing it, wonderful possible impeach someone twice?

These last two months blatant incompetent response toward COVID19 protests. Go ramble somewhere else, guy absofuckinglutely. Oh that's good method, I'll look that. Unfortunately restaurant brother works opened back they're making employees wear face masks. supposed stat policy. health department hotline set report violations full voicemail. Seems like many places even trying lol. can't imagine damage done bank accounts time over... hope recovers soon. People underlying health conditions 12 times likely die coronavirus otherwise healthy patients, according new analysis US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC). analysis 1.3 million cases, agency found 15% patients hospitalised 5% died, though true fatality rate likely lower people mild symptoms least likely tested.

*Summary generated Too? Heck no! first heroes. difference cries nurses - ‚Äúheroes too‚Äù people?

I support guns without well regulate militia...

I studied shit Constitution protesting fine, angry mobs, impeding others etc, however, LEGALLY, broken up. ‚ÄúEveryone‚Äù 


Bwhahahhahahahahhahahahhahahahha


I hope enjoyed gas.

We bring back water cannons know trusted anything government last 3.5 years, Trump gutted CDC killed pandemic response team.

Not surprising empty agency gonna useless needed

I know I've never cared much Fauci says, he's obvious mouthpiece since beginning that's symptom much deeper problems could go wrong? /s. cheap state thinks buy you. Remember, costs thousand bucks donations buy state rep vote way want them.  last long McDonalds employee get summers off? math person teachers salary divided working 40 hours week, 52 weeks year. work 52 weeks year. math properly say made like 20 hour better? Listen, i'm saying vast majority ""middle class"" jobs arent underpaid. I'm raising bottom paying workers money. However, idea school teacher like working fucking coal mine needs stop. hardest job, dont need ""REALLY love profession"" like poster said. decent job benefits, retirement/pension summers off. reading out-of-context quote headline Hill taking fact. Christ. Uh technically Phase 2/3 whereas everyone else Phase 2 trial. Cansino probably technically furthest along adopt phase 3 summer. Fair enough literally Trumps point lol.

I love reddit actually agrees him, ORANGEMANBAD one bullshit headline, think he's fool. He's worst president history sometimes he's right. case, he's right. Wait... satirical newspaper?  Yep. Restaurants afraid going lose business going non-smoking never thought business would gain it. Teachers work summers though. summer school idiots. also syllabus it. Yeah, 40hrs/wk summer still something. That‚Äôs America. money world piss away anything, except things meant help general welfare people. F McDsssss I've seen askreddit  That's idiotic thing say, kind moron - Trump quote, it? close eyes it‚Äôll go away! know already.. one expect genius urgent care facilities? Around need doctor order it, urgent care facilities anyway. 

The cost testing covered insured course - sure urgent care visit extra - imagine is. Buy gift cards, like visa kind used pretty much anywhere then? Oh that's right forgot, virus sentient able distinguish RNA people according virtue. know remember this. virus career ender many even recover.  talking potentially taking livelihood away people can't fucking deal precious football. virus doesn‚Äôt care woke 

Second kills blacks 

Congrats. 

You really big Haha checked north Austin, cedar park area limited none. Killeen tomorrow. driving Killeen. 

I wonder WeAreBlood market cornered? offering testing don‚Äôt turn back tiger avoid killed it. That‚Äôs get eaten.  comment prove point. He's actually suggesting stop testing. He's saying America many corona virus victims test far people countries. US tested much countries (reduced testing per capita lot) would look comparable outbreak severity. number cases found related number people tested. test half much it'll look like infection rate plummeted. test zero it'll look like we're cured. hyperbolic statement. used now. argue might case, read sensationalized headline get outraged. know causes teen pregnancy: teen pregnancy tests What's point? AHHHHHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH

God thread pure gold. Watching make fools sweetest sweets. Japan prevented superspreading early people wear masks. diluting stupid shit stuff like clearly point media lying said got elected going path again. want know mentally retarded. use lightly. Agreed, see need ban anything. Personally see lot issues theme parks virus. ""they"" say ""they"" testing ~~less~~ FEWER people? 


P.S. Maybe take xanax calm fuck bit? audio saying this? 0 cases, cases exist regardless diagnosis.

Because NYC special case really part analysis nation whole. basically lied us straight face country exit strategy, including Sweden. They're nowhere close herd immunity like thought would be. waiting months re-open economy would meant drastically better outcomes get COVID-19, however.

Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!

The testing causes high number cases. People getting sick Coronavirus gives us high number cases. 

The issue dumbass thinks double-edged sword really isn‚Äôt. Testing lets know actions counter virus effective. bad comes testing, good.  test numbers skyrocketing, information make informed decisions ramp you‚Äôre caught jam packed hospitals tools.

Lol! thought calling trump 'that bagged salad' sure made laugh hard thank need Seems reasonable. Pretty sure cases started rising masks would back Lol amen police around, may killed. simply stated positive tests high increased testing. test would positives stated clearly explain can't grasp told another way. point virus may spreading spike positives could increased testing available month ago. think would agree hospitalizations Covid19 symptoms better measures spikes. course. Since ""MADE CHINA"" became successful trustworthy story?

China's brand associated slavery, cheap rip offs, dumping, scamming. like first result google search. busy trying best make look fool, best miss point entirely. He‚Äôs wrong Well true, big. Ground glass opacities mentioned article also characteristic miliary TB. basically laugh people going cases asymptomatic. surprised long term complications even asymptomatic Trump grade fucking moron...but honestly, dude. Seriously? Lol.  hate trump quote taken context. 

He basically saying reason many cases higher rate testing (not sure accurate is). don‚Äôt test (like countries referring to) us also ‚Äúwould cases‚Äù.

Thanks saying this. people make assumptions quickly. can't think better petri dish NASCAR event. many beers rednecks can't even pronounce ""distancing""? Ironic, need moron notice every single quote every single headline context. Seems like saying (per article) test much countries, all, higher numbers. stop testing. best way lose weight move space station. [There's actually somewhat-relevant video similar topic Lindsay actually interesting listen to.

And world government's response handling pandemic politics-related? anybody supposed real conversation subreddit without censored protect people R affiliation? misleading even bit.  straight forward article straightforward title course pushing certain propaganda make sure current narrative damaged. Disneyland California, first all. Also doesn‚Äôt say opening like normal. opening restrictions. signs roadblocks herd people circle out.

Even reading article, know get tested again.  Sorry, suggesting testing LESS something right? dumb argument. 27% eligible voters voted Clinton, leave us? pretend average person smarter half vote. Brazil CCP supervision. 

We need independent test without involvement China all. production deployment. Otherwise bullshit, 99% China's claims. couple pals Facebook mad this. Unemployment still crappy pay, least pay. Crazy know crappy pay better people's regular pay. Well CDC says 99.6% people get survive 99.8% people get flu survive.

So according CDC twice bad flu. Sorry say, think science doesn‚Äôt support lockdown anymore lol. That's fair, would president feel need argue that? I'm fully aware context involving situation either I'm unsure asked question relating it. either unemployment food shortages teen, babysat four year old didn‚Äôt believe things existed closed eyes; ran smack wall day ended swollen nose. learned something day POTUS apparently not. That‚Äôs gas lighting defined. someone thinks go tappy tap tap unemployment website money comes like ATM, sorely mistaken.

I applied month ago released, decision yet made claim. amount paid still big fat whopping zero. too, let's complacent. misleading...I hate Trump much next guy watch actual video it‚Äôs different story. He‚Äôs saying countries numbers low don‚Äôt aren‚Äôt testing. testing reporting numbers, like countries would show low numbers. claim kind genius, baffles stupid need see dipshit speak think ""yeah, he's really smart guy definitely charge country"".

Especially people HIV/AIDS time. work prevention/harm reduction I‚Äôm little young remember really dark days HIV/AIDS; definitely learn new stuff time like back then. Things humble you, things flatten you. So, thanks. must really hard. disagree you, could many years ever get near zero cases. Fans packing stadiums long almost every country gets zero. Said like real bagged salad, fucking bagged salad. get going to. full quote basically stating universal truth test anyone **no one tests positive.** headline implies evident top posts thread meant test anyone **no one gets sick**. interpret anything sensationalism beyond me. ok like Trump also higher journalistic standards time.  close America mvp. gods hard read works. logic is: trump doesn‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair (to him) covid test results show rising rate coronavirus positives. suggests test less he‚Äôs victimized ‚Äúunfair‚Äù statistics. shifts narrative otherwise obvious conclusion loosening restrictions/reopening states close contact people recent holidays protests (on side political spectrum) facilitating transmission resulted higher incidence disease; instead implies higher rate testing resulting higher total number cases identified. 

This simply isn‚Äôt likely. US done poorly testing compared highly developed countries, done poorly containing transmission, trump repeatedly suggested answer test fewer people identify fewer cases.  utter fucking stupidity tiny handed man just... limit exist Covid Potus sounds like black metal band. point is, cases reported properly unlike countries. I'm India definitely testing properly number cases remain low (not matters went No. 4). guess point least they're trying pretend handled situation manipulating numbers.   would think right? there's disconnect, promise you. 

A year ago would answered yes asked healthy person. health conditions diseases never go hospital, kids. also smoked pack day 100 lbs overweight. swear I'm stupid person. me, disconnect there. I'm sure many others. many, ""underlying conditions"" conjures picture old person someone sick confined bed home. 

The illusion shattered I've since quit smoking dropped 80 lbs. point would told healthy truly wasn't. can't imagine alone. Given we've aware existence virus mere 6 months, data extent lung damage caused COVID permanent simply exist yet. likely many ""mild"" cases fall short recovering 100% pre-infection lung capacity, extent recoveries fall short remains seen. Literally what, every single nation planet doing. US #1 testing massive margin. one testing.  Yeah, tricky. got sub thinking, person touched face breathed on. China salmon makes wonder. say?

I hear folks adre using one two main stores consider interactions rural farmer 1 week vs someone city. spread slower rural setting. Wait....*both* ways? *that's* mistake I've making Two. real rough 12 years so. hyperbole. example used explain reported cases US higher countries. China example barely testing all, numbers seem lower actually are. He's saying correlation amount tests, amount people find infected. actually think Trump believes ignoring virus makes go away, might actually ignorant him. guy bright, he's arrogant, really look better right now. garbage tho, thing, Trump's denying problem pointing testing instead. That‚Äôs amazing. saving that? feel bad her. Losing parent one hardest things go through. Reposting reddit likes downvote arguments instead saying they‚Äôre bad. Either get smart response (great) ideally cause psychic harm people can‚Äôt tolerate perspective/analysis disagree (even better dunno).

To fair President small hands, people shrieking ‚Äúspike‚Äù daily new cases similarly stupid. Breathlessly waving around line charts historical new cases (with amusingly tight y-axis ranges magnify increases btw) presupposes March, April, May June least remotely apples-to-apples comparisons. 

But they‚Äôre not, plenty sick people aren‚Äôt reflected early portions charts.

At least overlay charts another line showing daily testing volume % tests positive. want tiny bit thoughtfulness you‚Äôre going steal attention smh

Otherwise I‚Äôll ignore hop state data dashboards CDC misleads public again.  use phrase ""underlying conditions"" makes people feel safe. 

In fine print, see Americans suffer underlying conditions.  (High blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, obesity, asthma..... etc, basically everyone). Fair enough. Maybe include full context/quote people judge since comment top controversial. read origins here: http://11foot8.com/about/  risk families health Fear shirt bumper sticker slogans. That's point. like this, current climate US never going way. would require people power trust citizens. help all?

It helped bring humor day! pretty funny watching idiots try push ""antifa real"" thing. Fucking hilarious.  What's point then? 

Try say Trump's point ""the problem big tests say could testing less."" Well someone COVID-19 prepared food without mask, touch food face, possible. get disease eating virus though, however think one sure moment.

Less likely hot food virus can't survive long higher temperature. Seems like way stop destroy tourism industry via stopping travel countries. Look New Zealand model thinking wants attempt make covid ‚Äúgo away‚Äù outside realm probability? 
 
You give far credit due. dullard. far less intelligent even average person. actively ignores experts, fits diet things. Don‚Äôt trick thinking there‚Äôs big conspiracy hate reason. hate business position power, let alone position requires makes decisions. history proves incapable making right ones. bills paying strategy. don‚Äôt look mailbox ain‚Äôt nothing pay! Yes, diseases, still run delta deaths hospital utilization. think key stop health care entirely, abolish government health-related agencies departments good go! surprising unfortunately. He's person would tell poor people stop poor. says talk him. want claim he's smart (because isn't), he's clever saying things get attention. Unfortunately, really care whether good bad attention, oftentimes say something stupid inflammatory get response.

Essentially, current President United States developmental mindset spoiled 13-year-old. Good luck, everyone. context, ""mild"" means ""do require hospitalization avoid death."" Mild cases absolutely experience lung damage, indicated fact experience shortness breath that, cases, persists well recovery. Jury's still whether mild cases eventually recover 100% pre-infection, whether plateau 80-90%. Donny never learnt object permanence get voted? üíØ agree you. ""Gum food."" Every sixty seconds Africa, minute passes. symptoms doesn‚Äôt mean adverse side effects. Almost half Americans deny reality. It‚Äôs fake news, hoax take away freedom open path micro chipped bill gates. 

How cure stupid. hope vaccine point cats bag social distancing lockdowns. Bingo!  found solution guys, pack Idiocracy coming true Keep mind first big wave positive test results almost always significant delay virus actually spreading.

Italy hit well March. took realise bad was. Ignoring likely incivility clear view T-rump's mind works likely get.

It's thinks it'll go away without testing (as dumb is, he's stupid), rather, hopes people think is. show. ‚ÄúWhen stop please. ""remember found reality denying echo chamber, good make believe death cult friends"" Please say sike right now. risk asymptomatic presymptomatic well mild cases affect others mild. yes. Ideally, need isolate every infected person. would probably better economy well. always figured rest 2020 would write around April started really blow up....just gotta safe vaccine comes out. Except problem states, increase coronavirus positive cases outpaced increase testing.

See spikes vs increased testing apologize guy want must agree wishes covid would go away. course, best course action would shut fuck up... can't help himself. are, told shit happening here! üòÇ

Also bene What‚Äôs point asking people test positive they‚Äôve protest? 

It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre going able track strangers standing near them. everyone already assuming protests likely super-spreading event.  Indecent exposure Context matters, child. Context matters. That‚Äôs bullshit. zero evidence support that. You‚Äôre using hindsight like fucking 8-ball. 

For know, locked down, virus could spread unreal rate(because took zero precautions) shut businesses anyway many people got sick.

If damn government balls step take care people once, could get pandemic. Instead politicians don‚Äôt want fully lockdown also don‚Äôt want spend money support American people. person responding clearly joking.

That‚Äôs even considering firmly believe certain states fudging death numbers make look positive. Dude dudette.

Are dumb?

What think life based on? ignore shit anyone needs anything. Thank you! stop debugging code now, get errors.

Amazing work finished! Context matters, child. Context matters. Y‚Äôall know meant. making point testing gonna result reported cases. Don‚Äôt dense reddit fun one, mods. really wish lived Canada right People bother read articles that's put headlines like this. Context matters, child. Context matters. problem! Aaaaand getting expected. Yes. N95 mask mask, that's alluding to. They're still advising using N95, instead saving healthcare workers, though argument put forth.

You choose see horrendous lie manipulation by... fuck knows conspiracy theory, tinfoil hat wearing brain decides... see number people buying toilet paper? Ya, imagine masks. take vonnegut name, he'd consider fucking idiot. someone thrown right outside tent NASCAR race confirm. sanitary environment. Couple sweaty red necks port potties we‚Äôll wondering Alabama got huge spike cases. Context matters, child. Context matters. thought calling Trump bagged salad glad hear new insult.

Don‚Äôt fight Trump, fight equality prevent another Trump ever taking root.

Zinc never part method drug would work by. precedent charge presidents office. He‚Äôs gonna shit done   Quarantine, Contact tracing Oklahoma worked really well. Aided low population density doubt though.  People probably wear mask take theyre plane :/ Look dimwits... Sue me. Shojldn't problem according you. Yeah unlike us, guys already wearing masks part culture courtesy others, long Covid came along. 

So guys mask thing quite quickly did, screamed rights 3 months. Never completely worthless utter cunt held public office, Jesus Christ. earned electoral vote. Implying players simply walk away made choose life career. John Madden would proud. You‚Äôre fucking stupid 200k dead like 500k surviving lung damage? still denial blame someone else.  Exactly. People take opportunity push political view. working full-time '08 lived car. minimum wage $5.85/hr raised $6.55/hr middle year. time, enough money put gas car food belly trying save enough pay apartment. wanted first month, last month, security deposit. entered homelessness nearly 200lbs weighed 112lbs escaped it. many near-death experiences haunt day.
 
That 12 years ago. Minimum wage gone less dollar housing prices soared. can't imagine difficult someone trying merely survive nowadays. Got it. That's point too. need ascribe apathy clearly malicious. Thanks! noticed it. I...I'm trying come response every one falls flat. someone go dunking something that's already stupid malicious? Best could repeat near equal still stupid coming that's actual stupid thought.

I'm loss words. dumb, vicious asshole. ""If close eyes pretend they're there, burglar go away!"", literally, actually lacking object permanence is. priority always stock market. long keep numbers down, even means cheating public, advocate it. Hear full quote dude: hate btw not. bowing mob anarchy. imagine wrong libel would reply 4 times it, go thru somebodys history call libelous names. assume meant, people test cases find. number dead won‚Äôt change test death. tested everybody USA tomorrow would massive increase cases, nothing really changed. situation same. Hey, that's China Also water wet Hey least won‚Äôt subjected confederate flags! Headline truthful. asked cases, full tweet: ""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!"" Trump tweeted. supporters listen him. listen right wing radio/TV host interpretation said. US Government: re-opened business.

COVID-19: Hold beer. I'm done yet. many straws possibly left imbeciles general mass people realistically two different things. 

Other information available Korea excuse CDC lies. Disney World supposed open July well believe. watched video guy going around Universal Orlando. pretty empty good, gets crowded mess. commented people passing place. People pass out/overheat normally Orlando used humidity, adding mask going cause issues. is. rains constantly masks soaked destroyed days. mean, open it, legal people want go, go it. take family there. wait vaccine herd immunity. America's locked homes scared thought virus going kill 50-60k. IHME updated forecast 200k+ October people want live like used be. basically giant bet transmissions droplet aerosols. making bet, others clearly are. yes, Disney best, much better bet six flags(althought less indoors six flags). Higher use masks quarantine. think guys talking thing.  

IMO Sir talking headline taken context. Sir saying Trump suggesting less testing like headline implies.

IMO Wild talking specifically rise June due reopening due testing.

To honest think both. definitely getting higher numbers we're testing (that's brainier) reopening also increases numbers (also brainier).

What's frustrating countries gotten cases control (like New Zealand congrats them) better leadership pandemic we'd boat... yet :( I'm sure 8% country that's unemployed families 5,000 people died rest assured knowing GDP shrank half point less Scandanavian neighbors. lots deaths from...pneumonia! airports Revolutionary War, broh Sure, actual goal. isn't. 

Who actually freely choosing buy airplane seats right now? That's market. Plus last thing want conflict flights. likely start fight get way? people wear masks ones don't? mentioned bad faith posting. get try nitpick names articles post garbage like now.  think could hypocritical tried. people read article tho even first paragraph?

Hes pointing inverse testing bias. tests = cases. Less tests = less cases ""science"", yeah, right. No, another embicilic quote know-it-all who's dumber box rocks. lumping together, trying imply they're equal. Fox News sure worst them. saying depressing see 3 behind literally news sources study. Especially since 3 main news channels.

Also, nothing, study shows MSNBC also behind ""No news"" comes international news questions. agree Fox News bigger negative impact. They're dead last categories study and, like said, massive audience. real shame media become. You‚Äôre obvious stupid. Either way stfu Really wish US Government would stop screwing Tribes especially since lot suffering pandemic. Enough bad stuff done ancestors already. time government least pretend act neutral, otherwise might well booking seat elevator hell. Context matters, child. Context matters. couldn‚Äôt gotten somewhere else China, stated article. I‚Äôd like see one instance case coming imported fish I‚Äôve yet see anything that. track seat 162k. actually worse blaming everything 'evil' foreign power. Context matters, child. Context matters. mean 60% commenting lack testing countries resulting 'lower' number cases actually have. saying would true United States stopped testing. Trump like frat dude college 53appu bad intramural injury. ofcourse hurts even walk bend even think knee sit specific position.... gone. would need doctor doesnt hurt specific position. He'll tell tore ACL dont need negativity life bro think Polio mild disease? haven‚Äôt Wisconsin haven‚Äôt seen spikes. I‚Äôm loss why? Also go ""night places"" likely disproportionately regular population. *ahem*ahem ""night places"" source major cluster here. mean sure, not? Blame damn fish. someone eats much chocolate cake?  Testing death rate close 100%

Because it‚Äôs dumb shit care this.

It‚Äôs worse version flu. Nonsense like getting kicked courts absolutely zero merit people claiming happening. Lol get scared, close eyes. Got it. feel sorry Onion! Can‚Äôt make guy sound whacked actual thoughts. engage either comment. comment really projection. He‚Äôs publicly stating way deal developing second wave virus test fewer people numbers positive test results (which affect public opinion quality job done) lower. article sensationalist? Yeah. Sure. get sick someone everything them: buying goods, cleaning, cooking, taking care kids, etc etc etc etc etc etc‚Äî they‚Äôre gonna huge epiphany!!! January, Chinese gov experts told public wear medical masks minimum preferably medical surgical masks. also said paper masks, activated carbon masks, cloth masks, sponge masks ineffective recommended.

So Chinese, I'm still sure much difference homemade cloth mask makes, surely better nothing enough medical masks supply. lungs, remember reliable antibody test two months ago. everyone wear face masks

It's NASCAR race. best thing NASCAR races stuff cooler full beer bring you. Mid July gonna hot balls sitting blistering sun, gonna drinking beers that's awful hard wearing mask.

*Plus* get beers you, questionable whether mask stays on, whether maintain social distancing, etc... Stuff like makes think fucking us point. fooled. Sadly, I'm painfully aware - four months breathing still inhibited. never showed symptoms aside slight shortness breath. Using inhaler now. See that's thing, pointing reasonable issue cases function testing, telling without proof tests increased much June compared May account spike- point null.

I hate current USA. agree someone overall point still disagree nuanced details. Yup were. think ( like 20 years ago) evenly spaced like 50 cm desk 50 cm space north, South west, east, hit wall. 2 metre gap spaces. room square. point b points centre North South one metre wall. amount substance released, time, figure hits first. Although phrased much better. messed things guessed desks off. That's remember it. good night mate. mean OP said joking way, Trump fact technically correct here, assume he's talking cases reported, actual infected numbers. people still like say early estimates fallacious.

Do math yourself, 350 million x .055 = .....

Millions dead, President want accept virus US, think going get hand US, specifically acted ways discourage taking virus seriously taken root spread throughout US. Every single problem we've virus since then, partially Trump's fault. severity outbreak partly Trump's fault, directly. Anyone says otherwise hardcore denial.  good news. 99% bacterial filter efficiency pretty high, especially reuseable mask 20 washes. reuseable masks lose efficiency 20 washes, improvement. data source(s) trust why?

Are accurate models aware of?

This particular model often cited CDC. 100%

What‚Äôs point testing someone dies?

Why would take economy shit? I‚Äôm far left liberal progressive. Right, government lie effectiveness masks, completely ignore screening airports, took COVID seriously spot.

Additionally, go second lockdown people followed simple rules, economy could thrive. People/media learned deal Trump still. doesn‚Äôt goals methods would expect. He‚Äôs stupid come across ignorant. Everything purposeful he‚Äôs used making shit fly. doesn‚Äôt true, doesn‚Äôt make sense - achieve current goal atm. mean compared $15/hr McDonald's employee get, $2.30/hr seem fair. gap minimum wage middle class closing that's crappy part. I've seen minimum wage go staggering amount percent year recently company muster awful 2.1% yearly raise ""5-star employees"" one ever is. I'm HCOL city recently 2 bedroom homes rising 6-10% even high 13% one year. thinking since beginning : OBVIOUSLY testing leads results. Flattened?

They crushed curve. r/wellthatsucks I‚Äôd say different wearing mask frowned upon like west. People regularly wear masks pollution, government actually enforce wearing masks certainly helped community cases exist. can‚Äôt handle truth sub!! signing kids baseball Wisconsin since illinois joke still. False. [**Moderate severe asthma high-risk asthma* isn‚Äôt believed substantial risk factor. people seriously need actually read Constitution.  lot 2nd amendment. I'm glad took time comment multiple flaws could discuss merits paper. study said we'd 0 now. Whatever gets clicks, guess. Edit: word likes ignore little things like facts. also get rid crime abolishing police departments!  Yes city offering testing asymptomatic people. Think it‚Äôs worth getting tested?

And since every country even using testing procedures, testing per capita skewed data point. replacement caps lock like $5

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* going kill us unless gets rally Sir talking headline taken context. Sir saying Trump suggesting less testing like headline implies.

Do people really take headline way? first line article literally states purpose article..that downplaying spike COVID19 cases increased testing. Increase testing equaling cases inverse less cases less testing...which stated quite clearly.

He acknowledge anything regarding reopeniong.

The headline misleading direct quote context given line 1 article. people consider misleading headline everything misleading. Might well title article #1023459052352 No. even real? Context matters, child. Context matters. Yea mean doesn‚Äôt need help supporters see headline wasn‚Äôt 100% genuine say ‚Äúsee? Fake news smearing again.‚Äù media literally stop editing use said meant. It‚Äôs appalling enough divisive. 

But want views bad highly culpable entire situation. think using word ""symptom"" refer typical presentations. must nice go life never acknowledge reality  Context matters, child. Context matters. angry American tests 'good ' US ""more"" cases compared countries less cases tests accurate.

In words, concern America comes stats.

This probably  kind rationale used life cheating taxes - under-report truth will.

What psychopath uh think two side judging, saying it‚Äôs every person govt shit. people think wearing mask ends this. virus still gets outside mask, touching face, constant hand washing/sanitizer use, importantly, SOCIAL DISTANCING, nobody anymore.  second wave going brutal. Right. states mass protests northeast bump cases

So protests cause spike Unless vpn server vpn provider know who's paying bill using for? Thanks! Tbh none bothers besides real estate prices, could see people would struggle things.

In opinion easy form social circle there? people make friends social? assume lot people move knowing anyone. Absolutely us affected financially. count blessings every single day above. worry much suffering financially. truly do. work police department domestic assault cases we‚Äôve ever had. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs due severe stress. loved comment. try complain anything. basically correct answer. needed lock extremely hard, extremely fast, 2-4 weeks, we'd able contract tracing things could re-open normally.

It's really sad see US functionally inefficient unable large scale operations reasonable time-frames. US stupid healthcare system. 1 100000 identified, success. Agree 100%! Yes, we've already seen even China report people repeat infections.

Have got source that? Please tell called assumed lies? think brilliant idea. take tube crowded hell. everyone wore mask time would much better. people coughing ij face. would definitely reduce sick days etc Thanks mate!

Sounds like know lot struggles terrible person. really even that. People ASPD can't form emotional bonds people. get hurting people. Granite sociopaths impulsive psychopaths it'd spur moment. even make sense? mandatory quarantine prevented new infections. screening masks prevented community transmission. know - Sunday, extremely uneven.

June 1st:

Total: 470

Total population approx 324 million similar U.S. 

Current US 7 day average deaths : 747. 

Also every country peaks 2 weeks U.S. German right time. UK days U.S. peak, mean highest 7 day average deaths. 

I fail see U.S. much better Europe. Please try convince me. worst part temperature checks fever never good indicator covid. minority experience fever, even symptomatic. best catching folks common cold, late flight (rushing, blood flow).

Not fevers generally get worse night, folks could chill morning, deadly plane.

NOT EVERYONE MAKING $666 MONTH UE GETTING JOB BACK mean? Yes are. saying person simply existing public without mask impinging person B's liberty.

Save face what? Calling pit bigotry? 


And love assume I'm white. adorable. forget us supply chain! Iceland? almost 2 weeks without new case, even 2 meter rule anymore.

I assume would. you‚Äôd adjusted sometime 6/14 seeing prediction low.

H gave could quickly find, behind paywall.

I gave found top Google result ""South Korea coronavirus reinfection"" 2 months newer newest article, debunked them. seen new articles claiming reinfections, would thought sources show proven reinfections.

The rest comment opinion, still seen proven reinfections in, someone tested positive, fully recovered, tested positive again. Maybe chance cities Calculating percent increase percentage meaningless. That's like saying 100% increase temperature went 20 degrees Celsius 40 degrees Celsius. Understandable. let's ease restrictions cause that's common sense kinda thing /s  Hermosa beach  review article trash journal new data. Hardly worth posting. German government part experts unfortunately sang FLU song far long, like European govts too. people saw testimonials coming hospitals medical staff patients would different appreciation disease. hospitalized Covid tending Covid patients absolutely traumatic, life-scarring experience hospitals overwhelmed. Compared source trying justify party's failures leading election. political document clear political goal. independent evaluation evidence purposes finding truth. epidemic. corrected earlier using word.

I'm worked up, friend. I'm pointing base level, want testing know tell real story, prevent want. Neither I, missed point seems. really matter purpose since specific measures completely useless. Cleaning streets migrate anything since viruses spread. purely show. 1/7 many Trump rallies February/March ancient news COVID19 terms.

I gave could quickly find, behind paywall.

We even accurate initial infection numbers time frame. UK alone 65k ""excess deaths"" reporting 40k corona deaths. Belgium, Spain Italy similar numbers excess deaths. know previously asymptomatic, got hit again, we're testing enough. 

Contrary guy feels need capslock (denial much?), seen re-infections, particularly Asia. People got sick, got sick again. happen, oh-so-wonderful news best chance vaccine likely time limited reassuring all. Last fall, got sick tube woman sneezed damn face. FACE. looked husband said ""well, guess I'm sick now."" Four days later...

I agree. know I'm gonna stop behavior mask hand sanitizer/washing especially public transport. (Hell, touched door handle years read gross are.) I'm tired Typhoid Marys understanding disease spreads. Yeah game thrones ref. like virus lol Director-General Tedros responded CCP‚Äôs cover-up praising CCP ‚Äútransparency.‚Äù repeatedly parroted CCP talking points ignoring conflicting information. Director-General Tedros‚Äô full-throated defense CCP‚Äôs response embrace revisionist history, well impact actions global response, incredibly concerning. 

You literally replace every use ""Director-General Tedros"" ""US President Donald Trump"" sentence would still true. create binding neutralizing antibodies? lose father father-in-law time must brutal. Thoughts prayers. source this? I‚Äôve multiple people explain possible. incubation period 2-14 days highly doubt anything current surge. teach patients seek medical help. privacy issue limit people seeking help time unnecessarily. One common drugs used treat lung failure helps disease causes lung failure. Haha good news. Cuts death rate third apparently.  I'm sure heard that, that's something could possibly predicted point. number waves pandemic depends things like human behavior, biomedical treatments vaccines developed, long-lasting widespread immunity population is, whether virus seasonal nature. things vary currently understood completely impossible predict. you? That's New Jersey, seems falling things reopen. Sucks cause seem control otherwise. Yeah non-Americans saints never break rules. Oh, yeah. You‚Äôre right. Never mind! stop testing, fewer cases China! much winning! Spotlight effect?  regret putting penny door. wan keep living. going potential granny killer want fun BBQ warhammer. act like asshole call one. Really? Lol me. I‚Äôd risk dying, guess. Thanks!

That's suspect. curiosity, get data? must tested Abbott ID test considered accurate conventional RT-PCR tests take hours.

AHHHHHHHHHHH Wow - like, it‚Äôs pretty obvious he‚Äôs saying ‚Äúsome work forces burn crosses‚Äù verse. oblivious?

Iceland third unemployment rate Sweden does. Denmark half unemployment rate Sweden does.

A: trying enjoy theme parks sounds much worse trying enjoy theme park normal operating conditions.

B: even entertain notion relatively speaking COIVD-19 bad. God forbid mutates adapts strain even deadly starts burning population stand without stupid theme parks. americans fucking up, others working right thing. America seem like one giant country, even folks live here. state different population, culture, politics. states (like home state Illinois) right things (and still encouraging proper virus containment practices) seeing numbers decrease. states scoffed notion masks proper practices seeing numbers get control. unfortunate part mindset america skeptical authority elected officials foster thinking problematic levels. That's get selfish citizens refuse wear masks, vocalize doubt professional doctors scientists, know talking about.  Like seeing now. Yes. Ah yes bad messed math! father, also esteemed engineer multiple patents high-level rewards company. love trump. 

I think it‚Äôs matter relating old guy TV ego/personality like yours. Tbh, old men, think politics matter little Fauci Big Pharma doctor who's trying get fired Trump whole time. He's corporate political mouthpiece, leader representative entire epidemiological field. 

He says boss tells say. boss fired CDC pandemic response team. 

*next* That‚Äôs true. lot uptick positive cases due increased testing. 0.001%....if high.

The thing deadly enough lock regular people.

Only risk folks lock moving forward Send Venmo link lol varies age range. data available, influenza remains deadlier pediatric patients. posts like misleading.  entire fucking point players virus means fuck got issue could infect others.  amount handwaving make go away matter hard try.

* can‚Äôt get em never get tested* Dumb.  cops unironically blasting beating peaceful protestors Portland couple weeks ago. Cool bro.  Holy hell, privilege thick could cut knife. 30000 people standing elbow elbow ok. Right vox. read part fine. Doesn‚Äôt change fact shitty clickbait headline intentionally context quote ‚ÄúTrump blames increased COVID-19 cases increased testing.‚Äù We've never dumbest shittiest amongst us band together elect one talk Stormy Daniels, guilty. literally laugh loud hear mfer say things sometimes wonder anyone got coronavirus wearing mask advice sue malpractice. guy maths FYI done testing per capita country. We're Oof, family living Alabama they've mentioned they're fine conservative live... safe say unfortunately wearing masks. Explain us, genius. believe he's using term ""case"" cases reported testing.

So point he's likely trying make reason cases we're testing (and thus uncovering cases).

You could say he's kind shifting goalposts think lot people concerned increasing number INFECTED, increasing number CASES. He's implying increasing number CASES good thing shows testing increasing we're path better handle virus, he's addressing underlying issue, number INFECTED.

For example, Japan there's prefecture actually zero cases virus, that's almost certainly they're also testing scale be. That's sort comparison Trump drawing; US testing more, cases. ever learn round fucking number

Yes, last digit 9 round up. drop digit.

In case rounding would produce 100%, want here. American here. love travel hope close borders American travelers forseeable future. mean, we're great job keeping track general population (everyone mostly taking preventative measures, much active testing), getting good numbers hospitals getting while.  automatically removed referred coronavirus-related subreddit quarantined reddit admins, stated may contain misinformation hoax content.

I know many people tested positive two died, 90. One friends went hospital twice breathing treatment, everyone else recovered completely home. includes couple 60s diabetes.

Per CDC twice deadly normal flu 99.6% survival vs 99.8% survival normal flu, contagious Everyday gets dumber Alabama: getting us herd immunity much faster. That's... straight forward, honest, truthful thing he's said.

Is implying test anymore, test more? testing, virus gone!! yay! Alright, well mid June, 10:30pm EST shows 118,283, though think would fair check tomorrow morning weekend cases get logged.

In case, estimate bit aggressive, we're 13% 135k, definitely think agree point we'll hit 135k closer mid June Aug 4th. No, really isn't. stupid piece shit lamented looking despite still inadequate testing going open responsibly. fits long standing problem general dipshit hoping go away instead chucklefuck administration actually half way competent leader awesome site!

For this, younger generation seems care largely 40-60.

You've decided whoever dies tired house okay. prioritized entertainment lives others. couple months bored less important entire rest lives people.

And guess what? probably never get anyone sick, attitude actions compatriots agree absolutely will, negligence self absorption enables death.

So article results research doesn‚Äôt seem settle either. shows it‚Äôs theoretically possible, based model, material hang air. I've seen various values stated even test (the ones provided statsnews article). Here's another study tested Abbott tests independently:

""Looking 256 samples ‚Äì comprising samples 103 patients COVID-19 detected PCR testing 153 samples patients without disease ‚Äì found Abbott's test, runs company's Architect platform, specificity 99.4 percent sensitivity 93.8 percent 14 days symptoms seems like Abbott test one better ones though,

""Euroimmun's assay, running Inova Diagnostics' Quanta-Lyser 240 instrument, specificity 94.8 percent sensitivity 85.4 percent 14 days onset symptoms. Euroimmun's test, borderline results primarily reported positive results.""

From newstats article stated tests typically providing 6%-20% false negatives. 99.6% specificity good. medical diagnostic tests 70s 80s. One rich people. knows, wanted score pedant points Yeah I'm buying reinfection thing yet, make us much aware

Plus masks. Everyone knows wearing masks increases chances getting infected. guys think Covid situation look like December? 1980 millennial.  Says guy made illegal require masks I've definitely seen theory floated know ""Uncle Joe"" said debate prepping really strong economy.

But think foregone conclusion.

If cannot keep COVID-19 control, would expect see hospitals dire situations August September.

Once hospital collapses... Yeah. Could really simple blood type latest research correct. Though I'd bet there's that. Hopefully researchers study years come figure out. ? vaccine ? Please share Yes, scienticians got together evil scientist cabal said ""haha yes kill filthy Americans telling wear masks, praise dark lord.""

You're absolutely right, sorry doubting you. Socal outside LA, everyones got masks inside grocery stores, 1 10 wearing incorrectly thing said you, hope able get people wearing don‚Äôt want wear mask‚Äô lmao isn‚Äôt struggle you‚Äôre victim

And know trump looks like something would see carnival...vomit...mostly spaghetti ragu sauce genuinely happy that!

NZ acted relatively early (end March) compared number cases. keyword ‚Äúrelative number cases‚Äù.

NZ gets take full credit dragging feet, even minuscule number infections, acting decisively, dismissing virus ‚Äújust flu‚Äù.

NZ thankful 20 cases day NY already stress hospital system.

While NZ case happy, feel like sets wrong expectation (or rather hope) people totally different countries.

Also, despite politicians say, vaccine slam dunk. let‚Äôs keep mind likely long game. borrow gas gauge Orange nail polish? /r/unexpectedexalted marks seventh time past nine days Oregon reported least 100 new COVID-19 cases. Prior stretch, state reported 100 cases day once, April 4. Exactly. waiting take trip this. take feel safer so. means requiring people wear masks.  logic, stop looking bills, owe them, right? once, lie. quite true. That's different insulin. newer ones supposed way safer better something. older ones apparently cheap bottles walmart (at least think heard then) older ones generally recommended can't get new ones. Welcome US, everything's made points matter. That's right, points like coronavirus testing pandemic.

*shuffles papers* sounds like me: ‚ÄúOur state‚Äôs budget can‚Äôt handle another quarter zero revenue, need guys go buy stuff again. Wear mask want, one cares. See there!‚Äù like he's covering mouth. Good detail there. virus-protection angle, I'm wondering many people actually died directly things he's said (like various non-cures tried promoted). infected people touching surface fish somewhere else? found virus chopboard. Also said, droplets fish splashes onto face, probably chopping it.  never said life throws *exploding* lemons way! Youre luck!

Edit: gives numbers table form; One fast-tracked November... sub stops fear mongering, sure.

It‚Äôs actually similar story throughout country. haven‚Äôt seen spike deaths similar ‚Äúwaves‚Äù saw NYC? Honest question, way. Covid becoming less fatal? people infected generally less vulnerable?

I'm confident lawyers found balance avoiding liability scaring away customers. Probably quarantine fatigue mixed desensitization. like it, America things mind never :/ First never ended. ok? Chinese people thanks American meat workers sacrifice, livelihood, hard work Chinese people eat pork. get ""You're welcome!""?

This like time Americans supported death squads central America cheap bananas. Compared countries population class, i.e. top-10 populated, US #1 far.

Why go way? essentially less-granular per-capita metric. ""news"" website literally consists compiling social media posts politicians, celebrities, ""people interest."" basically Twitter+Insta+everything else, page friendly old people. dumb people. somebody... I'm actually sure target audience is. (EDIT: think target audience ""people want link social media posts news, make social media posts look like news."")

Appears speciifc political affiliation, since ""articles"" (using descriptor loosely) posted various independent contractors, individual article slanted toward whatever point particular poster wanted make, (as far tell) editorial oversight. basically means social media, people want reblog social media try make point something. sounds almost exactly like describe many subreddits. Reddit cooler.

That's wtf twitchy. Another typical article NYtimes.com: ""Hate China, stealing meat Americans going hungry""

&amp;#x200b;


From said meat **exported** April ‚Äúwas actually **ordered processed months prior company added ‚Äú**much exported items attract little interest domestic consumers**,‚Äù **pigs‚Äô feet**, **snouts** **tails**, exports declined production slowed amid said pork exports China amounted **3 percent** total production since October. 

&amp;#x200b;

And

&amp;#x200b;

It basically article Reuters month ago titled [U.S. faces meat shortage pork exports China soar: 


From article: important remember recent sales exports China accumulated U.S. meat shortage truly escalate


And one reason ""soar"" export pork China because:

[CNN January 19, 2020: Pork markets become big winner US-China trade day United States China signed phase one trade deal, US Department Agriculture released report delivers another optimistic message US farmers: Chinese demand pork likely boost US pork markets 2020.

.

.

So, China increase purchase pork USA news articles come saying China following trade agreement Trump throw another tantrum.  now, China followed agreement, signed contracts made purchases coronavirus outbreak meat plants, articles like comes out, title insinuating Chinese sinisterly stealing/taken pork hungry Americans.  bars last weekend ‚Äî definitely different good time regardless. view, going won‚Äôt safer year I‚Äôve already decided I‚Äôll take sensible precautions I‚Äôm gonna spend next year isolated social life virus that‚Äôs likely kill all. think get reddit, run reasonable person. Thank you! breather style nose exposed ever popular ‚Äúmask necklace‚Äù?

You left ""chin bra."" thought sure would click would say POTUS. Riiight. coronavirus all, that's told quarantine 14 days discharge. policy quarantine 14 days people go hospital.

And even right change fact order discharge people ONE negative test lead death. mean discard everything said, arrived 7 years ago. entire lineage affected America's systemic racism. Black people born poverty get opportunities pull dirt. cyclical. came higher economic level average black person, experience shit even share skin color. Try get job place haha data-driven study. collection guesses picture format.  slimy hoe. Wellll... maybe there's vaccine.... health care worker can't even socially distance right, hope country. Eventually somebody gonna flush. risk prevalence low go anywhere extremely small risk infection. get infected contact traced proper measures taken contacts infection basically over.

Masking, distancing hand washing enough keep new cases within capacity tracing teams trace. must sustained IFR drops well 0.1% ( cure found) suceptibles depleted (through vaccination time). read reasonable excuse stay overnight someone ""avoid injury illness"". Due girlfriend diagnosed depression, sure seeing would aid mentally. classed reasonable excuse? Omg, it‚Äôs week declining symptoms mild cough. clearly say case it‚Äôs covid19. mean people mild coughs time whatever reasons. researcher Plandemic video said masks bad must true :( breakdowns age? 

What's interesting places like Texas Arizona also summers like winter Midwest northeast. hot go outside huddle indoors air conditioning shade 

Still believe death rate going high experienced New York New Jersey due better known treatment methods, better (younger) demographics, much less population density.

Would interested see per capita hospitalization statistics.  Apparently instances people got gastrointestinal symptoms little respiratory tract involvement, suggests probably contracted oral route.

That's logically sound proposition. different versions virus going around, know GI symptoms due virus bacterial infections. like virus wreak havock lungs, bacterial infections come cause pneumonia, GI tract get bacterial infections virus clears. transmission seriously proposed many researchers. 

Flat earth theory also seriously proposed many researchers. evidence earth flat. know viral load stability probably/possibly lot higher feces contaminated food, food could still contaminated, right? 

Food ""normal"" home virus. home inside host respiratory droplets. example, multiple scenarios could potentially lead outcome (infection ingestion/oral mucosa order uncooked food carrying surface contamination, immediately store fridge upon receiving later eat without heating up, insufficiently so. Viral decay wouldn‚Äôt chance happen fridge temperatures (quite contrary) seems risk getting infected significantly higher zero.

Then observing people getting sick eating contaminated food eating/breathing shit... confirmed cases either. 

I understand hypothetical examples they're observe reality. competition. would love country well. also spent lot time pointing people science showed country bad track turn around. called idiot told incorrect. Now, curious people disappeared. people want gloom doom (although may small subset do) - problem see local, state, federal decisions look like they'll good outcomes. point solutions (""what everyone wear mask? way could safely open parts economy lowering spread."") shot some. predicted beginning come true, naysayers seem jumped ship. Probably so. remember reading significant portion (like people housed care homes Massachusetts killed, I'm able dig source moment. know state reporting 367 nursing homes least one suspected confirmed case. that's case Sweden well, could likely represent significant portion nursing home population.

Regardless, given much nursing homes are, affecting death rates, crazy suggest what's going something death rate lowering, virus running highly susceptible hosts improved safety measures. It‚Äôs dumbass statement say test less people, wouldn‚Äôt know many cases. That‚Äôs true.

Is meant? It‚Äôs fkn exhausting, trying understand ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs‚Äù defiance safe guarding others. facing another wave infections. point, I‚Äôm beginning think ‚Äúpeople‚Äù want see world burn contracting virus passing someone everything you.


 Wrong Ever again? Yup, live Utah outside SLC, one wears mask. went grocery store suburbs didn‚Äôt see single person wearing mask. didn‚Äôt even bother going in. Whats alternative then? Sacrifice lives well others restaurants serve overpriced tyson foods underpay employees stay open? FUCK THAT! mouth breathe helps push air mask. Umm. Yes is. Obesity absolutely pre existing condition. Americans accept normal, doesn‚Äôt mean strike us medical terms. High blood pressure, diabetes, obesity three common predictors mortality COVID wouldn‚Äôt outrageous require face masks flights isn‚Äôt plague. Travel makes people sick time, plague wouldn‚Äôt protection place earlier.

But ‚Äúno way! light comfortable mask face steep price jetting atmosphere. Muh freedums!‚Äù virus spilling across border? 19 20 people general recover, nothing drug read story correctly. accomplished goal. Line pockets friends expense misery American people. country region reported this, something people Stockholm told? 

Translation:

* Stockholmers tested positive covid-19 go work mild symptoms doctor judged okay.
* ill seven days, fever free two days clearly feels better, risk infecting others small, according infection control physician Per Follin Stockholm region.
* ""With knowledge virus, rules effective."" Firstpost, good news. Well person knowingly romped city maybe he/she victimized people knowingly exposed.  They‚Äôre British, they‚Äôre New Zealanders. expected. Worst case scenario became normal scenario. Definitely, think context needs given scenarios.

Imo TX cycling phases re-opening quickly. irresponsible expand capacity places without letting first phases reopening cycle least whole month moving next phase. 

Also fan going hike seeing 50+ people huddled swimming hole within arm's length away without masks. rebuttal there. Waiting pea brain respond. Going keep distracting, huh? says evidence back all... ‚ÄúBraiiiiiiiiiins....Braiiiiiiiiiiins‚Äù üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it. literal saying: "" stopped testing right now, would cases, any.""

Why would say that? think mend that? purpose?? people something. think might‚Äôve intake...anyone following thing knows bars shutting place southern states, state wide outbreaks happening. took headline exactly commenters point, look common headlines becoming Better get Genetic Shuffle II...

Wrong Yeah huge, still could effectively turn entire UK another New Zealand complete game changer. There's degree risk exposure germs expected tolerate though. pandemic, yes makes sense extra careful, can't go become completely germaphobic entire species.

That would genuinely dangerous everyone long run. frees hospital capacity reducing effects worst cases.

I call lukewarm touted cure convince people safe go without vaccine. 

It's good news, might backfire cause many infections. ""This Murica! liberties!"" 

I guess anti mask wearing crowd learning hard way. Well, seems like Trump got revenge. incompetence mismanagement two qualities wreak havoc friends enemies alike. terrible human manager, he's also clinically insane. hope high-O2 works out.

And fundamentally you‚Äôre right - could go back forth endlessly minutiae bundled payments ventilator days - overall long health care business, care patterns always influenced reimbursement. haha work whole foods too? got job 2 months ago part-time seasonal saturday sunday. 

i lose primary source income pandemic started figured could get weekend job since 1) going social stuff 2) i'm single, young, healthy 3) save extra cash cash things get worse

it opened eyes low-wage work situations. ""full-time"" workers told every sunday time need clock get overtime. $15 x 40h = $600/week. 70% staff store middle age hard working immigrants. really complain, miss work, etc. kids home that.

i rely job quit whenever feel horrible ones stuck. could really used extra $400 week hazard pay, essential work pay, whatever. 

it's completely unfair make less. No. disgusting.  Governments give clear instructions do. sorts vague recommendations people hesitate do.

An announcement like could work government asking people cooperate helping eradicate SARS-CoV-2 forced upon anyone, government suggests everyone capable perform two 1. Wear respiratory 2. Install smartphone tracing Thank you.

Swedes coughing border? right on. ""waves"" propagating individual case small cluster drops system take quite bit longer become apparent simply ballparking incubation periods top other. really take good two months make statistical noise - point number big transmission chain control. Multiply X happening throughout country. This, least, works America - Laissez-faire approach Pandemic Control. Add California list. Thanks. interesting responses defending reality. Fauci stated lied hoard masks. Instead pretend science changed. living world make believe consequences accepting openly stated brutal accept. CDC says .26% mortality rate.

That's patients deaths, unfortunately, ability need fewer days ventilators ECMO machines good thing. Nazis, both.

LMAO piece pure propaganda, sounds like someone China Flu wrote  stay cheap UK thats one thing Ive got look forward too. elaborate please ? God bless advanced country. appreciate do. work, nobody could theirs.

Your work got harder, lot people's work got little less comfortable. Sorry getting merit deserve. wonder prednisone would also similar effects, since corticosteroids mainly used anti-inflammatory purposes. Nope. brother keeps saying he'll start training relay race going running tomorrow, sits couch month instead even going walk let alone joining running laps, start doubt whether whta says weight it. need wait see he's actually going get couch believe says weeks empty promises.  imagine Trump gets Asymptomatic.... would happen then..... deliberately daft ignoring comment care old/immunocompromised people almost guaranteed die get it? investigative reporting fro ProPublica, Pulitzer Prize winning non-profit newsroom.

I like defending him, also like disliking person based something accurate. study isn‚Äôt peer reviewed yet. Encouraging, let‚Äôs go sucking other‚Äôs dicks yet. Yeah
I talking docs wonder drug could combined remdesivir. Obviously limited supply remdesivir still issue. sincerely hope muzzle first (gloved) fist teeth, reduce spread virus particles. virus load extraordinarily high screaming. Totally agree you. Can't believe downvoted.

From article: 

""Lead researcher Prof Martin Landray says findings suggest every eight patients treated ventilators, could save one life.

Yes, that's great definitely helps. However, coronavirus remains extremely dangerous disease fatal many. wouldnt enough change distancing procedures yet, example. simultaneously shove/gently slip UV light ass. buy 100 ""Petco"" $15 cheap big pharma rolls in.

CDC's ""estimates"" take actual count, roughly quadruple it. still fucking stupid per capita, 29th testing, also matter many people tested. amount tests change number people infected. care saying ""confirmed cases"" stopped testing. 1) that's wanted communicate, that's communicated, 2) need accurate count people infected, 3) FUCKING STUPID. Fair enough, spent time around elderly 50-90 crowd cohort. exhausting early years damage long run someone ""paced themselves"". damage lifestyle psychological rather physical. going work hard retire-early, lesser known traps (besides usual relationship pitfalls, etc.):

As tragic outliers are, still completely true fair say virus typically affect people preexisting conditions, older approval rating would soar stopped fucking talking Stopping spread 7% reaching herd immunity compatible. two opposite approaches. worse people US coming small, rural areas possibly bringing virus.

One thing learned sometimes people autoimmune conditions even aware get older. people would luck wear mask. might survive virus developed it. Centers Disease Control says wear mask. two cousins virus said awful. sick long time. CDC says wear mask, social distancing, wash hands least 20 seconds.

What actually says video: reported cases US countries thorough testing. Now, maybe that's true, maybe not--there probably nuanced answer that. promoting ignorance remedy (in instance) OP's title suggests, comments imply.

This man says plenty expose incompetent, need dress more. That‚Äôs true, interpretation curve meaningful within context. And, we‚Äôre talking intelligence tests, consider someone IQ 95 meaningfully differentiated someone IQ 105 (for example). whole America devastating year. New York opening credits. Thank clarification Never thought before, it‚Äôs interesting way put things.. definitely gonna start using line someone says HIPPA it‚Äôs good sign idea they‚Äôre talking about. use tactic bills! make decent money.

Nothing pisses tax exempt status. need go Church pray God...any God...and God requires money need rethink situation. keep indefinitely there's vaccine pray nobody slips cracks. 

Sounds totally sustainable. Yeah, tricky situation sure. simple answers. Holy shit, never thought like that. huge percentage. HIPAA violation. It‚Äôs still illegal medical professionals disclose medical information without permission. pandemic doesn‚Äôt change that. So, idiocy POTUS statement aside, address confusion brought conflicting testing numbers?

I get argument constantly people say ""more tests gonna mean cases"" that's given. weird argument assume somehow nullifies fact cases regardless testing. somehow improving infection rate werent previously detecting more.

And say testing resulting positive tests way nullify increasing actual number cases equally preturbed, explain case *ratio* increasing (percentage people tested positive).

And top that, number hospitalizations increasing. So, even tested ONE, seeing worsening situation simply fact people hospital symptoms curiously similar COVID19. number hospitalizations going up, extrapolated 20% (previously determined rolling percentage) cases severe enough admission hospital, two scenarios, bad: Either 80% mild cases (likely tested) increasing number, thus total cases increasing, total cases staying same/decreasing, meaning *percentage severe cases increasing* virus somehow mutated become virulent.

And aside, states rates increasing, testing data actually shows plateau, maybe really increasing testing rate thought, making moot point. Fewer tests, cases definitely wrong direction head.

Am wrong assumptions here? feel like I'm taking crazy pills, maybe that's goal narrative, make question seems blazingly obvious scientific metric.  **QuickGetInMyVan** ü¶†, kminder **1 year** [**2021-06-16 [**r/Coronavirus: kminder 1 year

This flattening curve important. Besides hospital capacity, PPE, etc., incredibly important researchers find ways shave every possible percentage point death rate. may magic bullet, find different drugs affect response doctors decide one need, help lot. Stocks gambling stupidity American public people claimed democratic hoax... Yeah Karen got yelled random passerby grocery store stormed away pissed called out.

The suggestion *anyone* coming Sweden, Danish Swedish whatnot, *have* get test. Further, test expensive, maybe Icelandic one. 

that could also applied Finland Norway's border areas. would prevent ""If get corona, get corona""people going back forth willy nilly pay 100+E per trip subjected rather unpleasant test. 

And even though tests nowhere near 100% accurate still, would still catch went Sweden brought bug back them.

..Coronavirus decisive explanatory-statement, joke

http://vps224.keurigonline.nl/~greatnews/showthread.php?40156-Coronavirus-and-the-decisive-explanatory-statement-and-it-is-not-a-joke False sense security parents. School feels huge pressure reopen want look negligent either. So, example, schools claim every child checked morning. Explain temp check 800+ kids every day without extra staff, without wasting entire day, without spreading germs process. would need parents stay help, defeating purpose getting work first place. yeah, far perfect detection system anyway.

I suppose might work students taking temp (like hs/uni). schools taking every temp unrealistic. School boards suggesting leaving planning implementation individual principals. would surprised see school couple hundred kids actually able accomplish this. case would get ill get positive tested corona, everybody thousands people range last couple weeks would get contact warning?

If **in contact** thousands people, get sick, yes, *could* infected thousands people.

The app broadcasts randomly changing numbers using Bluetooth. Anyone else app installed remember list numbers encountered weeks. get infected, upload list numbers central server everybody else check whether they've seen one numbers recently, hence whether may contact you.

And yes, considers long contact, notify everyone walked past. state would trying suppress news? understand point. also think article title could understood mean even bother fever screening.  example? someone hit tennis ball, act, shoot basketball, etc mean taken seriously arena, pun intended. evidence support assertion ""mAsKs dOnT wOrK""

Therefore, telling people buy use masks without **any scientific backing criminally negligent.** Read article!!! explains this!!! Hi, yes right say sorry I'm pain. give idea total cases USA use CDC's death rate 0.6% work back number deaths. Yes! remember that, made think well. doctor/medical profession confirm this? Really good information underlying data give context numbers State's largest hospital. 

UAB instrumental developing Remdesivir, btw enough people thought? much. Aye, point might catch someone 1% time, miss people 5% time. place, measure likely slacken 4% misses could spread wider.

Anyway, confusing evolving situation. understand people can't show respect everyone else wear damned mask. like overly burdensome Pete's sake. There's huge segment population seems comprehension social responsibility rights rights that.

Dialysis needles like I'm dope *At least!*

In Chicago took us 4 weeks pretty hard lock get cases move downward. stuck 2500 cases day 4 weeks, *sucked.* gave us 100 dead per day. total somewhere around 6000 deaths week.

Say come reddit moderate liber#l views shaped experience society. see people posting things really make sense ultimate goal transitioning s#cialist society. say something like, ""while agree healthcare fundamental right, I'm sure great idea give people enough money live nothing like UBI. Maybe targeting social safety nets towards can't find work better."" wind -14 several people writing diatribes wrong.

So next time post, knowing subject unpleasant feelings, change things up. avoid talking UBI, wind +5 several people affirming opinions socialized healthcare.

Now posting say opinion anymore. posting get dopamine hit. brain lights see +112 upvotes. get excited see orange ""1"" messages box, excited see ""3"" ""9"".

You realize long loud spouting ""correct"" opinion, get dopamine hit, regardless whether assertions right. Sometimes even say things sources. feeling have, fits narrative. matter. Upvotes. ""This."" ""You right."" ""Absolutely.""

You even read articles anymore. exist comments section. read headline post first thing comes mind get +2K continuous stream orange message notifications. moderate before, think Biden basically Rockefeller. posting redditisms long getting positive reinforcement ideas managed convince entirely correct. read left media only, educate soci#alist talking points fully dismantle casuals debate moderate talking points.

Either this, turned initial reaction views wind going complete opposite direction falling welcoming arms far right.

No one comes reddit educated. come bury bubble (sub) similar viewpoints continuous dopamine hit. makes manipulating opinions incredibly easy. social media like this, exactly we're existing p#rtisan era American history.

A lot folks surprised corona number COVID-19 patients Tennessee hospitals hit grim new record 400, twice number could need beds weeks ahead state grapples new spike coronavirus caseload, Vanderbilt University researchers reported rolling weekly caseload hospitalizations jumped nearly 30% June 7 June 13, researchers said, people 20s 30s lack pre-existing medical conditions needing treatment. 31,000 infected Officials said Memphis Shelby County could move Monday phase three reopening, allowing restaurants businesses expand 75% capacity, plans delayed due ‚Äúdisconcerting‚Äù upward trend, county health director Alisa Haushalter said.

I think, now, realized many state reopening plans always insufficient garbage.

Most states threatening cut social services, free lunches programs, educational programs impact COVID-19. They're money. 

These states reopened Congress give money stay closed longer.

And states use lockdown period really stockpile wave two we're finding situations never prepared additional waves adequately. Food thot. million Americans died 1917.

Among South East Asian nations, Vietnam highest incidents BCG vaccinations (against tuberculosis) incidentally also provide cross immunity Covid-19. countries BCG vaccinations least 6 times lower mortality rate don't. Feel free look up! people affect others.

I got sick correct protective gear knows where. gatherings, runs store. Probably douchecannoe running around coughing without mask . So. quote Blazing Saddles:

When ill come back Disneyland Paris end February. initially sore throat - annoying anything. Initially thought dehydration airport (couldn't get drink plane taxi Disneyland slightly late). Felt plane normal otherwise. Got flight back home, taxi back, kids bed, stayed hour went bed. next day fever, headache, muscles killing etc. 

Due information time Coronavirus hacking cough presumed picked flu. day slept, easy write - rough. get energy. night went downstairs drank ate bit, straight back bed. big temperature freezing cold, put house coat bed. Following day starting feeling like going sick, none coronavirus stuff time pressed fever bit paracetamol hate taking pills, always refuse ill.

Third day much sick, green bile throat fire. point wife called ambulance. Went room ward tired remember going on. blood tests. sick couple times bile. point feeling okay. one thought coronavirus blood tests things (I'm medic idea testing for). 

I started feeling better later evening Discharged protested medics (I still bit weather is, rather home) Doctors said probably stomach bug. Following day brand new last days bug, carried normal went work day two later.

I got coronavirus test results back home like crikey. one first cases UK. Wife eldest son chesty cough really them, 4 yo daughter get anything middle son great too.

So since started feeling groggy, pins needles hands feet, got psoriasis patches. psoriasis faded mostly groggy feeling became dizzy feeling get quickly. got worse.

A weeks ago bit good period, feeling unwell definitely underlying issue - presumed thyroid. came back avengence. started struggle remembering words fatigue pins needles got worse.

After first B12 needle head spin went pins needles hands feet lessened. I've second jab earlier today feel great now. Go me. Lol going say ‚Äúdamn...if something could put face cover mouths noses help this‚Äù race herd immunity never good idea. Flattening curve helps prevention disease better treatment.

It worth mentioning though enough say delay = better delay =/= prevention prevention treatment. demanding smarter solutions governors harder restrictions. Even treatment cuts mortality 50%, wait 6 months treatment lockdown, we'll taken American life longterm saved COVID.

When governors see low cases empty hospitals think they're good job, kicking road unless actually get infrastructure place PREVENT infections. outrage targeted at

1) Lack effective masks everyone (surgical homemade, *still* huge push America)

2) testing! (More cases means need even testing keep things control)

3) Better PPE HCWs. Yes, still rationing N95s, America got tired complaining it.

I'm sick people thinking shutting economy good thing none necessary infrastructure put place. lockdowns restrictive many countries control. took ""lockdown nothing"" approach this. mindless suffering. Oh see, addition that. kind confused wording articles. info really enough strangers find are, live contact you. like post picture &amp; phone number social media. literally travel history past days, names &amp; vague detail street place live nearby. Hotel managers &amp; taxi drivers interested list normal folks. 

That's idea contact tracing app used developed countries tells recently close contact infected individuals, even less intrusive app literally tracking &amp; could alert server immediately exposed. problem biggest naysayers always going whose liveliehood impacted shutdowns. flight attendants encountered flying weekly (its lose job) anti shutdown. kidneys return back normal?  going refuse onboard? federal backing. literally nothing power force someone wear mask plane one aboard airborne laws fall back on. soon say. could vaccine needs taken every year. Much better immune system compared whom? right. saw ""blinding"" contents page made jump. you‚Äôd see around world. Like lot more. fact even news story one individual tells isn‚Äôt overly common. 

Now like, ‚ÄúThousands people beat Covid one tested positive again‚Äù would cause concern. Contact tracing myth, It‚Äôs depriving privacy.

Edit: takes one person affair???? Coronavirus Good, Primark closed Bad!, summed you. Yeah, someone well-versed Sweden's COVID-19 responses, hearing many superficial (at best) plainly incorrect misleading takes situation making highly critical people saying countries whether believe anything say. big wake-up call.

I know people often say judge media source based say topic well-versed in, that's good way determining accurate reporting generally, I've never chance test theory now. boy, bunch news/media outlets nose-dived estimations them.

I miss naive days thought news outlets ok like Fox News (or tabloids) garbage, crisis made re-evaluate many news sources considered trustworthy. spreading much misinformation Sweden Swedish response else spreading misinformation about? :/

It's always maliciousness (or agenda) behind misinformation either, simply superficial take situation. shows need investigative journalism journalists really research one topic in-depth, shallow takes people parroting misinformation they've heard elsewhere. May god mercy souls China generous. /s 

Americas health care system frothing mouth make 50000 dollar dose. Dexamethasone well patent lots generics available = it'll cheap! Grow pair. Lol Greece testing, speak, extremely low number tests. 
If test zero results show up.

They sweetening actual situation tourism. peak season like 50% GDP tourism. think proper campsite bit might key difference. stopping getting hot sleep 6 am? Steroids suppress immune system? thought strengthened muscles? janitors battle anyone else. Absolute troopers. also make 1/4 nurses do. People forget that. studies showing risks turned fake. Trump right that. Nobody wants it, yet sadly many get think 97% survival rate important statistic.
I can't necessarily blame either, difficult convey general public complexity disease and, mentioned, immune response.

Personally, think worst part disease acute infection either get mild get bad ‚Äî lot in-between, find get it. studies suggest virus would rapidly inactivated outdoors, risk transmission indoors would remain.

Yet lead picture someone breathing outdoors. Henley bit thorough. said kick they‚Äôre kick kick around. Ah experts Masks Steroids given case asthma Whooping cough, instance Corona also attacks lungs? Seems like obvious treatment worth exploring. way Israel defines it. look accusations anti-semitic, see center around criticisms Israeli state treatment Palestinian people.

Of course, context often left glossed right wing media much base probably unaware context, still spread idea antisemitic. Keeping weapons planes pretty useless, say, I'm pretty sure bomb screening still useful. got sick beginning March. time, admitted testing ICU cases. prescribed albuterol/ ipratropium doctor. nebulized 3-4 times day month half recovered home. still start wheezing I‚Äôm active I‚Äôm better. month ago could handle bed 3 hours day go 6-8. 

I would describe mucas formed lungs super glue. extremely sticky hard cough up. would take decongestion, wait 15 minutes. nebulizer albuterol.

Also, always toilets worked! Oooh...can screenshot???? Nah, knew Swedish healthcare system f'ed. remember seeing htis article Feb. thinking oh that's good: 

That makes COVID policy look even worse though. know health infrastructure creaky, really try suppress disease. that's common sense. happen.

(Haven't read study design while, helping run trial locally) drinking home 10 times cheaper dont drive. skype/zoom bar hangouts ur buds dude. something Thanks thought going mental. good news! Hope Covid19 ends soon economy recovers. family lost job COVID 19 forced spend extra $ buy masks sanitizers. looked Amazon soon realized people selling goods expensive. used one-time use mask found good. people like us, sells mask significantly cheaper regular vendors hope help low income families like me. beijing shutting again? know flu?

DUH - FUCKING FLU ANYWHERE NEAR FUCKING FLU!!!!!! Sounds like Newark Sinovac Biotech‚Äôs CEO Bribed Chinese Food Drug Administration Hol up, Russia, Brazil, China, US lying? Whaat?! yea limiting spread opening things like theme parks helps people. 

Like, things order make actually essential places fend mass waves infection potential. blamed Trump yet? Let guess, virologist epidemiologist? even read white meant interact bacteria viruses daily. immune system simply weakens much vulnerable pathogens wearing mask... facts. live bubble wearing masks doomed. exception.. massive crowds hospitals... much non daily things expose to.

No. According data, beliefs regarding masks pure bullshit. Why? may near impossible completely avoid viral load, goal keep low. Masks proven reduce viral load infection science prediction. Nearly everyone end getting Coronavirus. 

Yes, true, keeping low viral load low infection rate important? reason slow number serious cases prevent hospitals overwhelmed like ones Wuhan. hospitals overwhelmed, medical staff effective, fatality rate patients medical staff rise.

It's hard understand... unless fucking moron reads infowars naturalnews. Thanks! don‚Äôt lurk sub much appreciate resource. ""Mask mask.""

No, clearly masks. mean say want ""your"" money want people's money.

Because government money, take people. 14? permanent Wait, let‚Äôs another highly upvoted post 102-year old oldest left-handed woman Northern Minnesota survived COVID-19! strong evidence? peer reviewed paper? media reported ""strong evidence"" chloroquine efficacy well. FYI find Florida covid page testing know I‚Äôm getting lunch Blame organization 3 letters. 4 letters ones great. big convention coming town? Infections exactly good. Surviving ventilator exactly great result either.

This drug saves lives, eliminate risks damage virus. reason blown up? I'm getting antibody test week. presumed positive 3 months ago lungs still feel awful. Figure might well get test since denied one back March. I'm curious say. Australia say people two months immunity software developer well. big difference. built, fully documentation hardware software. 

We entirely mapped human body's reaction new viruses fully understand.

Most time, must build understanding trial error. learning new programming language, need understand inside out.

My initial statement caustic been, understand feelings time uncertainty fear. ""Thoughts prayers"" Apparently there's correlation, I'm sure real implications are. call pulling Lacour. evidence points towards fabrication. main reason posted think people much idea normal chance dying given year given day. interesting article read back compared chance dying covid-19 New York city skydiving, basically converted percentage many skydiving jumps would take equal that.

At least give people kind barometer. Maybe think skydiving dangerous maybe knowing three jumps 10 jumps 50 jumps whatever least makes number understandable  think careless went public place have. wearing masks. think whole 'Out sight, mind' mentality. state opens back said everybody fine, took advantage that,‚Äù Crisp said.     

A healthcare worker?? masks?? fired.  
   
This fucking sucks - healthcare worker goes partying comes work patients, hell break loose. respect opinion. China published internal guidelines diagnose clinically wo swab antibody testing, detailed information infects organ, blood vessels, brain cause death. Someone posted link Reddit requesting translation, there's much medical jargon proper translation read edification. yes, things like permanent lung damage, sudden cardiac arrest, less often seen symptoms like kidney failure documented there. I'm sending comment HR rep thinks bad cold go away it. Please call people Alabama americans. Thanks! Google ""one third dexmethasone coronavirus"" lot headlines making claim Also see body bags refrigerated trucks NYC peak? People willfully ignorant point. I'm sure would still better second movie. definitely good news. also guarantee politicians \*ahem\* Trump \*ahem\* going say ""Nothing worry now, got treatment. Come rally.""

Yet treatment really sucks. get die \*might\* stop dying hospital. far silver bullet.

In world politicians heads asses, would better news. Oh still maintain right totally ignore argue bad faith. Depends mood though. Africa (implying treat continent monolith) lot unique features actually make diseases less deadly.

- Poor infrastructure makes spreading diseases difficult

- Little economic interests generally less important. e.g. London financial capital Europe, many African cities share similar wealth thus attract much travel

- disease bad enough, probably kill poorer people quickly, result, may able spread far.

- Old people basically exist

- Urban centers rare, population mostly rural spread story proof need know highly infectious covid is. Mask mask. thing gets everywhere without proper precautions.

Seems paid off. 

Where leave argument? Oh, good thing positivity rate also decreased 3x since then. Oh, mean actually increased? therefore saying ""more testing = cases"" batshit stupid thing say? Hmmmm, say. refused give data Lancet. Every time try workout reminds I'm weak old lady, frail face gains. miss working out, miss lungs hurting. read somewhere would several months. actually America‚Äôs systemic racism causing sad statistic.

Coronavirus soon deadly saber-tooth tigers. Ugg afraid, fire work coronavirus without hurting Ugg too. suspect posters saying: ""OMG huge big deal"" bots trying pump stock prices.

Anyone knows history drug, knows definitely big deal, already fairly routine treatment. find many tests done daily USA love look trends whole hide facts.

One biggest hit places New york, since done good job curbing infection, since large numbers, decrease really effect results. 

As see graph, new york done good job recently, really bringing numbers let's look nice sunny beach loving FUCK OH FUCK, maybe florida increases deaths right?

Let's look another nice warm deal here. spikes around time protests people getting bored lock too? Time deny everything look back total US numbers instead, safer there, bet could go find states sticking lockdown, use examples go beach everywhere too!

The US big place, states bad no. Go take look states love going beaches on.








You know what, mate, think going outside, wearing masks really designed job enough keep getting it, go it, fuck anyone disagrees, fuck fact country virus spreading longer want live normal lives day one, fuck larger economic hit take since virus around longer you, tourism hits half hearted lock measures extended making everything slightly less efficient while. Fuck elderly, vulnerable can't live lives spread still real, fuck expert advice, fuck percentages figures put USA top country world infection rate right now, number infections. 

Your country dunzo, reason Americans refuse see it, there's point even trying talk logic you. seem upset change aspect life stop spread global pandemic, upset police revealed condemned world stage systematically racist, fact angry protesters even caring all.

You you. Go beach. Hmmmm remember hearing vaguely, link handy? doubting one (for once), I'd like read bit more. 

But yeah, JIT cut all. FWIW think Finland really *proper* PPE stockpile: everyone learn bit better this. hopefully illustration flaws end catalyst positive change Swedish system. death numbers (deaths/million) go since one returning dead. rate people dying clearly going though. Comparing rate change death numbers difficult, since every country different stages pandemic - Italy instance clearly much along Sweden UK. Question.

When person recovers virus, still spread catch again? example, let's say recovered person comes contact another person virus caught it. antibodies kill virus body, virus multiply time spread someone else never contacted virus before? Assuming talking [this states specifically reduces deaths seriously ill patients ICU?

Was pretty clear me. Jesus. entire friend group tested positive, people bar?

I feel bad bar owners, see way safely open unless COVID numbers drop next nothing vaccine developed. breaks heart seeing people think right things, like church in...Georgia, want say? Six feet apart, masks, hand sanitizer, avoiding touch--and yet people still get sick. things sadly panacea. People want togetherness right comes consequences. That's tragic. NEJM Lancet retract paper coding error. would publish correction.  
Retraction rare science unless intentional misrepresentation fabrication data. happens sometimes. Google Michael Lacour example.  


  shit plenty transparency work.

The project open source. literally look code comment implemented.

You literally comment find wrong, github, huge platform programmers who, far understand, know detect something unclearly implemented.

What talking lck transparency? app direct link documentation works yeah, sure, governments lie. give that. pretending UNLESS absolutely go stringent measures anonymize internet (and probably neither since talking reddit) good chance much traceable. actually free UK, however American hospitals able charge huge amount ""generic"". means patented anyone synthesise that's get highest number Covid-19 deaths Scandinavia. hope get reliable % showing ppl severe complications recovering Covid. bet # would lot higher ‚ú®Will Miss Rona win season RuPaul's Drag Race? Tweet #MissRona show support! ‚ú® sound like people got sick. That's brightside. Look data every country Europe. 

Every country followed pattern, peaking April steadily declining since peaks.

The difference countries mortality rates.

Does prove lockdowns worked? prove don't? prove anything. Anything take simply assumption. cheap steroids expensive hell US. Ohhh changed numbers! Damn, runs deep bro. lizard people live flat hollow earth? 

Lemme guess, lives matter right? 
Foh bullshit..ü§£ü§£ People call Presidents death every day here. Last week wishing death anyone going rallies. Yes racists though looking percentage positive tests number tests given? think would paint better picture going on. That's local doctor told 7-8 years ago. Nothing live it. seeing comments think go look find another doctor. üòÅ GoT ending shit. Easier track people cell phones, license plates, mobile pay. China, every where. stuff cough syrup right? Yes. case pretty much everywhere right? dont flush then. Duh. WWI even biggest killer era. flu was.


The combination two caused average lifespan expectancy drop 12 years. means cases found people contagious even 9 days know could that.

I've seen articles people still virus 4 weeks discharged 42 days diagnosed It‚Äôs ridiculous. Everyone able get tested. + almost 3 months ago body back normal. Dr worthless. hospital helped low oxygen. really don‚Äôt understand doctors taking seriously. crazy certain publications peddle bull propaganda.

they really wanted highlight largest month month increase ever 40 percent year year really. Sure lot things can't thanks COVID, need go bar maintain mental health. activities could done would much safer going crowded bar without masks. backyard get together friends would comparably much safer. would need spread chairs try maintain sort social distancing. still risk compared staying home, much much lower one going bar eating restaurant. Thanks saying this! Vaccine probably available 2021, so, looking good. Check Smile Tupac worthy effort effort limited could better used elsewhere.
There nothing wrong skeptic. Americans could worse becoming skeptical. Oh see gonna look like two weeks!

/s .... news? Well, professional athletes even safer now. Remember Disney's copyrights expired?

There's always way enough money purchase convenient regulation. hospitalizations also increased almost 70% since Memorial day, fear spike deaths follow.
We definitely need follow escalating situation AZ well free, free point use. we're also really reporting deaths correctly right now. statistic there's 4x many pneumonia deaths Florida normal year. real number? fuck knows. Dexamethasone

In Us probably, rest world gonna happen two weeks since protests started, surge cases simply materialized. don‚Äôt get folks risked life new virus scientists don‚Äôt fully know it, there‚Äôs treatment vaccine yet. Also, could transmit thousands people lockdown could extended forever. they, it‚Äôs choice Yeah, lay drugs mate.

Edit: spelling  feel sorry her. basically asking it. forever? sure, it‚Äôs half half now, certain groups way lower Sorry propose genocide? situation describe unlikely low viral load situation. virus certain level replication body contagious. active antibodies unlikely reach level.

That said, long covid antibodies last, seems people recover make antibodies all. So, scenarios person could become reinfected spread virus again. Well, fair thought already beat virus, warm humid air would stop tracks. Bars restaurants fine. calculation may slightly off, fine.

Edit : much /s  really allowed comment sub unless read article. TITLE, guess.

""COVID-19 antibodies appear last **at least** two months, preliminary study shows""

""*at least* two months""

""aT lEaSt""

That's important point make *the study tested patients two months* Holy shit, nearly every bullet false (except fact population young, probably important one). Africa biggest urban centers planet. Check Lagos Dakar. There's loads travel fronm Africa (tourism huge industry), infrastructure plenty good enough travel, thanks large part massive Chinese investment past decade. AZ big community spread problem going on. wear mask buy tickets Disneyland!

You'll spend time sat phone arguing Reddit too, waste cash, could beach! home work something.  make sure close toilet seat lid also applies America also spreads poo particles. I‚Äôm curious surely Chinese tried Dexamethasone said steroid usage EARLY illness makes Covid WORSE however proven beneficial CRITICAL patients. worried people might understand distinction. might bad take drug symptom onset, self medicating bad doctor.  Also Ohio (the Sea Corn Sector) confirm. make excursions pick groceries, we've seen substantially fewer masks month ago. like everyone decided stop caring. think jumping conclusions much person douche.

It's hard tell might cause it. come potential theories, though without data it'll impossible verify anything.

a) Directly poverty: likely take public transit, likely work service jobs    

b) Historical lack trust authorities   

c) Cultural reasons wanting wear mask

I seen little suggest particularly ""C"" (most everyone I've seen without mask elderly white). ""A"" seems likely, seen data actually back it.

Even ""A"" really racial except via long way - tied income anything. Yep, Florida spiking hard again.. That's *serious* lockdown do! **America, I'm looking you** good thing everyone 100% board social distancing, hand hygeine, masks avoiding mass gatherings. mhhmm yup! 2 months study period!!!!!! tested two months period, hence title says ""AT LEAST."" Jesus people, EDM available 177 patients March 29th May 22nd 2020 (inclusive). I'm happy see us start zeroing real solutions this, even fight still long term. Sadly first thought says 'cheap' cheap entered mass production American company American public solution yet. incredibly expensive normal functioning adult. 


Normal functioning adults feel need belittle others, so.... wrong? Look TB deaths 2018 It‚Äôs official it‚Äôs zombie virus know IFR is? It‚Äôs infected fatality rate. IFR around 0.28%. need show CDC source? estimates, high end, IFR 0.6%. 

The IFR important number includes infections. CFR quoted really meaningful number, given confirmed cases represent small fraction actually getting COVID

I never said ignore anything. corrected persons inaccurate statistics someone responded calling dick lol.

I know hypochondriac know many sub.  British visitors already reintroduced virus New Zealand. nation otherwise stomped out. still seems kinda dumb

Well, disease infection control doctor. I'd guess understands severity making statements like that.  voted present resolution recognize Armenian genocide.

She also opposed sanctions Turkey Iran thinks lead deaths shortages basic supplies. However, supports sanctions Israel. I‚Äôm this. hate people percentage percentage maths. It‚Äôs right way communicating decrease 12% points death rates. 

I‚Äôll admit, lost battle. Miley Cyrus? sure got ¬£35 save life figure though. treatment costs ¬£50, takes 8 save average 1 life people ventilators, 25 save average 1 life people oxygen, average cost save life ¬£400 people ventilators ¬£1250 people oxygen.

Still steal, course, ¬£35.  one hope going change political climate political work done. Last twelve years it‚Äôs finger pointing, opposition stalling policies they‚Äôre opposition SD blaming immigration every thing that‚Äôs wrong.

You search yourself. reform made 2009. Privatization pharmacies. mention hand blowers. It‚Äôs disturbing!  employees interacted wearing masks? you? see link actual study. Imagine government base pandemic response science, politics No, lowest point. They're back 5/10 right huge (and slightly suspicious) drop 2.27% positive. elections state due November...... lot candidates already running promises pass laws strip governors powers shut states again..... yes I'm voting really frustrating NJ, seen delayed response turn out, south ample time see happened here, really excuse. _further reduction had_.

Contagious worst looking for, communicable. problem though - mask become politicized. Especially Trump zones. already see results. Thanks saying this. Y‚Äôall amazing job too, know janitorial staff getting paid lot less police, doctors nurses would appreciate free meal financial standpoint. 

I‚Äôm essential don‚Äôt public (back office financial institution) anymore, worked starbucks would taken front line essential workers ANYONE working hospital doctors office, someone title.

People paying police, EMTs firefighters dime dozen experience, people got hit last line pay forward drinks REALLY hard times needed tugged heartstrings. huge. 

And everywhere else stating similar things. _huge_. miracle cure. need specifically honest things mean.

You even estimate many deaths would avoided used, simply true _because used along_.

And everywhere.

My _wife_ end march know shit would would work _because know effective types lung inflammation seeing_.

Now know _how_ effective, yes make sure used routinely. going end _much_ smaller reduction others leading people believe simply used standard drug treatment COVID since day one. 1 year design? need pay again? mean made surely cure üòÇ would verrrrrry skeptical this. trial page don‚Äôt see statistical analysis attached percentage reductions mortality wonder statistically significant effect bullshit we‚Äôve heard therapies ended effective. 

Too many people grabbing headlines without understanding underlying data. Maybe ends real advancement let‚Äôs see data first. Meanwhile, 1k new cases ground reopening places... Yeah, I'm going able visit family (or clear storage unit lol) California anytime soon (I live Western Australia). Flying Perth analogous normal flight Australia followed flight New York LA. People social animals - people *literally* can't deal going bar buddies. Drinking home seems sad, going seems sad.


Does make sense me? No, I'm also social extrovert accept others definitely are.

I know people super, *super* hyped able go restaurant sit patio 4 months. totally understand feeling even want myself. legend rap game .. hasn‚Äôt done much recently .. retired intents purposes ..those athletes current stars 

Plus lot pre-existing issues according Willie D.. interviewed YouTube.. think djvlad use modeling antibody tests make educated reliable estimate IFR. Regardless exact number, evident antibody tests IFR much lower CFR

In communities countries extensive testing IFR always within range 0.2-1%

And yeah cases(not all) test dead COVID, anything?

I‚Äôm difficult time understanding you‚Äôre argument even lol. don‚Äôt know many infected estimates useless? think better number merely dividing amount confirmed cases deaths? makes sense considering said testing far behind actual infections. That's catch

Google diamond princess Curious - diet look like? Lots carbs, lots carbs fat, lots fat? Finally guy knows stuff. amount monkeys hyping drug shitting another generica hate Trump, shows ridiculously loaded stuff become. Dexama frigging immune supressor used since beginning swelling inflammation. help multi organ failure. help vasculities. needs given early signs cytokinestorms appear. Yea sensitivity like 99.9%+, determines true positive rate. 999 1000 people test positive actually positive, remaining person false positive.

The specificity however good. understanding common tests 80%-94% specificity. means 60 200 people 1000 positive cases tested false negative result. Idk live Oregon (not city church in) lot people wearing masks whenever go days. 

But seen lot older risk ppl always ones don‚Äôt wear masks really think given steroids likely kill patient matter introduced. Solumedrol given people right intubation still dying it, dexamethasone given whenever appears makes significant improvements. 

I doubt steroids timing played dexamethasone One ""employees"" porn actress, right?

You'd think kinds things would generate red flags right away, but... ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø interesting working. Initially thought steroids made disease worse. wonder depends type steroid used, initial consensus Italy? ""intubate early"" early mistakes seems. blame anyone, really knew nothing treatment time.  Nobody's dick. pointing that, great advancement, enough advancement change precautions world taking right now. That's important message time people take good news permission reduce precautions. 

Don't ""dick"" accusing people ""dicks"" trying help get accurate information there. would stop anyone: Healthcare worker here. go inside bar , club theater vaccine. Actually no. hospitalizations going already problem. goal hospitalizations go - that's see cases rise supposed immediately enact measures slow spread. saying state safe highways lead it. Nobody smug progress one family reunion undue months quarantine. found true, COV vaccine released next 100 years, time humanity die, Im telling sources are, otherwise make fuss Well article discusses anti-trust issues PBMs. understand pharmacological differences, can't two reasons viable factors drug go price despite generic?

Deaths/infections fatality rate. IFR completely unreliable outright fabricated without actually knowing many infected are. 

Are aware testing dead COVID? Lol. 

In countries without extensive testing, IFR uneducated unreliable guess lol Muh freedums can't tell serious comment not, chance is, hygiene include sneezing coughing someone else's personal space.

It also includes cleaning oneself regularly one get infested lice ticks spread others, lice ticks often vectors diseases. Likewise fungi, want sharing towels people got them.

Cleaning streets homes cockroaches, rats mosquitoes can't breed, vectors diseases well. forth. Get real! It‚Äôs HOAX!!

It fault media misrepresenting this. Cheap steroids... Sounds like became expensive steroids 9/11 official advice comply hijacker demands hijackers either wanted money passage country. 

9/11 changed dynamic illustrating compliance= certain death 

After 9/11 tactic hijacking planes died. would Passengers ever compliant, always resist lives depends it, do. 

We could dismantle TSA today nothing would change, TSA stops planes hijacked, locked cockpit doors 120 passengers beat death secure lives. 

Thats planes dont get hijacked anymore. SARS-CoV-2 mutate like influenza does. could still beat years mass vaccination programs. USA? Fuck numbers already super high, need spike go dangerous levels spread, already tons people infected spread it.

The spread virus like 10 people it, much slower spread virus 25k+ people it.

But... even matters, since see logically huge spike cases protests? Like, magic. virus spreads like flu/cold, lot people gathered around together weeks? simply spread. ppl face criminal charges like jail time breaching? serious Iceland's approach? Florida does. positive case counted once. Peer review always big deal. basis whole science field literally taught children. sciences, especially anything human being, checked. gives fuck nobody celebrity?

He's arguably biggest tennis player world. Definitely ""nobody celebrity"" nobody would listen take advice dont think way 100% safe anymore. People thing, living lives exactly protecting either. 

Theres much do, cant keep forever, know? Mistakes made put risk.....

I personally think point us, and....thats scary considering whats going meds yet! always questioned whether fever scan effective detecting asymptotic carriers neighborhood locked morning. Since 1 positive case confirmed wholesale market nearby. waiting tested tomorrow. 

Everyone worried. could easily go 100 10000. back full scale lock Go home drunk. bar right around corner shut (central florida). day shut down, drove past another bar live music guests basically shoulder shoulder.  hOsPiTaL bEdS fUlL cApAcItY Ay Yup. PBS generally reasonable although watched recently. means 60% deaths care homes pretty terrible, yes. 242 deaths *overall* pretty fantastic, **20x** fewer deaths Sweden overall present (4,939). 

It also totally disproves idea Sweden's deaths due % died care homes: norway *higher* rate deaths care homes, 20x fewer deaths overall. Clearly indicates problem care homes, widespread community transmission. Norway nipped bud, successfully traced isolated new clusters now. would neighbouring countries significance compared countries?

This goodfaith question point. obvious widely discussed well established apples apples comparison compare Nordic countries similar terms demographics, education, density (DK outlier higher density), etc, etc, etc, etc

Belgium painfully obviously apples oranges re: Sweden. Might well compare Sweden US it. Cohort means groups persons, meta analysis different studies. 
What cite say samples representative total may also representative. Eh, I‚Äôd say slowdown earlier half-assed attempt lockdown.

It‚Äôs two weeks infection showing symptoms, average somebody dies two weeks presenting symptoms. deaths representative cases infected around month previously.

So, various states loosening restrictions last couple weeks, I‚Äôm expecting us see surge deaths towards end month. We‚Äôre already coming 120k dead next couple days. expect we‚Äôll 140k-150k range dead July 4, probably nearing around 180k end July. Damn, they‚Äôre seeing major post Memorial Day spike. guess super spreaders enjoyed Memorial Day weekend much.

Still really interesting ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù pummeling places avoided first, really much places hit first Damn, rooting them! Sad news. Nope, keep information think Nordic countries hiding deaths, what's deal? spent money doesn‚Äôt make less money. 

True, money. True gave didn‚Äôt need it. it‚Äôs ours. given people need it. 

It always money, even it‚Äôs pockets. states bone joint thinning extended use. That's likely occur cancer treatments. extravaganza. Going up. Florida lot beds tho. completely valid question.

You pushing agenda dismissing valid question. real question? know virus care borders, right? 90% success rate still useful running thousands people per day. catch LOT pre-symptomatic cases way. data?

There ""data"" leaves device.
There anonymous pseudo-random gibberish sequences.

There's registration required report fill out, obligation quarantine.

Data protection laws even apply, since definition, random sequences data associated person...

My point is, since lockdown people start not-care anymore, tracing apps place now.

Public transport crowded people start demonstrations whatever cause, send us straight back second wave... there‚Äôs huge spike cases protests next week, you‚Äôd agree go ahead open beaches? Hmm still seems kinda dumb they're making doctors approve writing something guess see rationale? 2 days still seems sketch think Somalis over-represented Finnish statistics too, could live Helsinki situation worst there.

ases novel coronavirus Oregon climbed least 5,820, record 184 new infections reported Monday, Oregon Health Authority (OHA) confirmed. latest daily case count reported highest since outbreak began.

More half new cases reported Union County, several cases linked Lighthouse Pentecostal Church Island City, medical director Acute Communicable Disease Prevention Section OHA, Dr. Paul Cieslak, confirmed.

Union County reported 99 new infections Monday, dramatic increase 22 recorded Sunday. Authorities specify many cases county associated church.

The church deleted video posted May 24 Facebook page, showed hundreds worshippers standing together close proximity service allegedly held phase one county's reopening gatherings permitted,¬†The Oregonian¬†reports.




During phase one reopening, faith-based gatherings limited 25 people, provided social distancing practices place. Larger faith gatherings permitted phase two, began June 5 Union County.

Oregon's Center Human Development, arranged test results contact tracing Union County, also confirmed several new cases associated church,¬†The Oregonian¬†reports.

Cieslak noted county worked church host testing clinic. confirmed 365 people Union County tested weekend officials expecting remaining test results Tuesday.

""We testing, especially targeted testing, around places starting see clusters,"" Cieslak said.

""The clusters cue us disease transmission going find cluster testing event like [hosted church], find lot people infected,"" added.

Cieslak warned ""large gatherings, especially close quarters distancing can't maintained, really efficient way spreading COVID-19. Whether workplace, especially closed assembly area, really concern.""

A person answered phone church Monday hung contacted cluster new cases Union County,¬†The Oregonian¬†reports.

Newsweek¬†has contacted Lighthouse Pentecostal Church comment.

.

The OHA said cannot confirm whether church holding services leading recent spike cases. public health administrator Union County said: ""I can't speak specifically congregation. say, general, we've received complaints we've received concerns receive information, get referred appropriate entities.""

Last Thursday, Oregon's reopening paused week following spike average daily cases. state saw seven-day rolling average new daily cases increase 54 June 1 89 June 7, marking 65 percent increase average daily cases, according OHA website.

""The noticeable increase COVID-19 infections Oregon past week cause concern. order ensure virus spreading quickly, putting county applications reopening hold seven days,"" Oregon Gov. Kate Brown said statement Thursday.

""This one week pause give public health experts time assess factors driving spread virus determine need adjust approach reopening. work doctors public health experts determine whether lift pause extend make adjustments,"" added.

But even case, cant virus eventually become resistant overtime treatment drug? Seasonal flu kills Americans every year corona virus killed country.

Nope ‚ÄúNear draconian measures‚Äù? noticed massive discrepancies statistics reporting? date, Corona virus country 0.003% actual fatality rate. 3-5% projected CDC govt lapdog media deliberately caused public panic. isn‚Äôt public safety. It‚Äôs political power grab thru fear mongering. don‚Äôt see now, you‚Äôre either simply paying attention, you‚Äôre supporting political power grab. Pick one. coming every angle, Americans. Many people default talking US bringing topic around US whether directly involves Americans not. I've seen occur subs across site, even country specific subs internal topics. Plus there's Whataboutism tactic that's used whenever post Russia China. *Looks pictures beaches*


Yep, endless room, filled people spread really far. /s


PS, high winds (or windy areas) spreads virus transfer via droplets usual (like beaches)


I really get problem, opening beaches nesesarcy spread virus more.

A riot good cause, reason behind boredom, can't compared opening beaches.

Opening Disneyland stupid opening recreational area's people bored actually stick lockdown.

Shutdowns similar scale saving lives banning driving.  USA Best comment reddit. thought someone sub mentioned NZ going completely limits countries while... incorrect? said, rather antisemitic

I see far right would dislike based that, though. anything would improve ratings books.

And clarify: actually ""anti-Semitic"" way Israel tries define (speaking Israel policies), fact anti-Isreal pro/neutral Jewish people general. Agreed. cannot tell many articles like get sent day I'm fat. 

I realize I'm target audience this, absolutely like try ""green tea pill make shit entire watermelon once"" medicine!


Most shit stuff either work harm good. yeah, hard look medicine think ""is scam really help me?"" 

It's also think many people pass mental health care (and health care general) many people promoted psuedo science next ""cure"" everything. NO. Absolutely not. Truth truth. Period. End story. people want discuss news stories go find something else want discuss.  ""Using truth tell lies""  Fucking seriously? reality it‚Äôs combination everything kept us safe.

I think really key. everyone develop fever caught? No. thermometer work perfectly? No. remember screen everyone time? No. temp screening reduces spread certain %, mask wearing reduces spread certain %, hand washing reduces spread certain %....

At point feel like it‚Äôs assured I‚Äôm going get it. overreacting seriously mess up? conjunction word, try Maybe little hope? week since Brazil hit peak daily new case load. refuse conclude anything data suspect, top official peak next 3-4 days I'd guess may plateaued. that's many people got sick died. kind answer expecting? Nobody yet able offer alternative, say im wrong? THANKS DOUG. indicates either a) Immunity short b) never recover. scary prospects. moment believe b likely. virus HIV-like properties all. Hides immune system. yep am. guess what! didnt listen went ahead put ass risk. doesnt make like much anymore im starting question relationship them

keep feeling like villain fuck virus deadly medicine well-equipped handle it? Imagine even half everyone required medical intervention COVID died... would catastrophic. like good things 50's drained away, left bad things. month ago downplaying virus...something adding up. You‚Äôre allowed say red even bother - one's home! That's thoughtful. I've hating person seems treated statistic person pandemic. know that's largely death rate high everyone's overwhelmed, could remember people, kind way touches heart (and I'm even religious). find way blame someone else actions individual. Sorry. always halls fame. I‚Äôm, like, *ridiculously* funny. Unfortunately, we‚Äôve done poor job producing enough PPE. opened early start contact tracing.  

I don‚Äôt think state governments idea shutting - saw numbers rising lots people dying. 

We squandered time gained lockdowns. LOT elderly Arizona, reason people like retire heat high crime rate. recently saw tweet saying one ICU bed left Tucson Medical Center. went partying Memorial Day weekend got Rona didn‚Äôt they? see repeated lot, explain increase % positivity?

There possible explanations.

It possible that:

- states getting better tracking tracing, people tested people know exposed.

- states testing places know cases percent population - meat packers, prisons, etc.

- people listening government susceptible quarantining susceptible getting disease, increases disease counts increasing without increases hospitalizations.

- disease evolving less lethal strain.

Regardless, new hospital admittances continues fall (including Arizona Texas). find way rationalize trend moving direction, matter much cases rise long wait.  Wait see fast get 4 million, exponential growth motherfucker. That's funny. Kemp reduced restrictions bars, restaurants, salons, theaters, pretty much anything involves crowds people distancing practiced. Nah, they're opening. username checks difference 0.05% population Lol sub went downhill frickin fast it‚Äôs even funny. still check time time it‚Äôs awful compared was. even sure happened Seeing tomorrow. I'll make sure get opinion case specifically! intention discuss literature. That's bad joke. Nobody knows yet much protection get antibodies. enough data yet sure, corona virusses, sick means temporarily immune anywhere months years. aware many dumb fucks rioting lady grocery store least fucking problems agree this. something perfect mean it. better nothing. there's additional measures take, course seek taking them. could still say comfortably reopen protests people ignoring masks vs. BLM protests WOOSH. I'm certain /u/pistoncivic sarcastic.  clear, using article starts #1 something took place 3000 BC....and comparing something taking place 2020, knowing understanding complex sophisticated medical knowledge, treatments, hospitals, sanitary conditions, communication systems, information systems, basically fucking everything...you're comparing situation today saying 'they're identical.' issue times, dumb fucks running around armed knowledge information today choosing ignorant arrogant face calamity shrugging big deal. huge fucking deal barely it. case noticed, we're still it...states nations still surging, people still dying still vaccine. think that's cause alarm, actually pure piece shit. Oh yeahh. Let get 18-wheeler real quick bruther. amazing many people think ""at least"" ""only"" synonyms. think Oregon governor restaurants ready open Friday counties spent last money purchasing food issue order 11pm could open following day.  That‚Äôs beyond awful.   food lost.  remaining positive spirits many small restaurant Workers owners.   area open pretty well precautions people gingerly stepping out. California testing increased lot positivity rate dropping, around 4.5%, look like spread necessarily greater, we're catching cases. Hospitalization rates stable. SoCal - Norcal pretty well still higher testing small increases case counts. saying change soon since moved stage 3 opening bars, hotels, etc, OK. pretty low level attempt trying distract pressing issues. much want join rest admonishing woman... least shes trying raise awareness. need stories like people realize simply everything simply fine. people putting faces makes far digestible reporter saying loud. school long time. account indicators Russian troll account post history alone.

So stolen account lifted site leaked passwords simply create one? they're saying ""well, least psychological trauma"". That's literally argument (not all) Swedish people making. Like, yeah, many deaths per million, least spent two months trapped home they're scared living life.

They say ""scared living life"", say ""being cautious"". Always give law 10 20 years catch technology, unfortunately.

I think we'll eventually getting legislation making data owned one creating first foremost European countries decade. Even worse instead 98% survivability rate 99%? think spooked lot people April reports surfaces could contaminated 3 weeks. 

All PCR rapidly reproduce strands particular RNA surface, necessarily active virus.  

Yes wash hands put damn mask inside people. sad. seems like big deal beginning wear mask take precautions end not. get used annoying. Going covid19 pandemic, I've made mind states never move to. Florida 1st list. high false-negative rate (20-30%). 

I've heard like this, even tests covid decently high false negative rate US. think exposed back Feb one could get tests back even really knew covid widespread, I'm hoping get positive keep searching different test. see grocery store EVERYONE masked, enter unless N95 mask better. there, stand directly markings social distance checkout. Let person ahead go two place ahead step half way first were. step directly spot another person standing, even masked. Tuesday‚Äôs record case count partially attributed outbreak Eastern Oregon‚Äôs Union County. 278 newly reported cases, 119 Union County. comes 99 people county tested positive virus Monday. cases associated Lighthouse United Pentecostal Church. Prior Monday, total 22 known cases county pandemic

Getting Corona God friends claim mask ineffective reducing infection 100% effective/have openings.

But also swear mask causing C02 poisoning.  big wildfires blazing AZ right now. Sounds like good verb usage me. would thought coming fear.

That said, historically pandemics multiple waves, likely 2nd wave happen 

But given know virus (0.1-0.4 fatality rate, depending source) history viruses, *not* likely bad second wave

In modern times, terrible 2nd waves happened Spanish flu *exception* rule masks mandatory statewide, south illinois like der state (take first would reverse letters) disregarding order Considering reports symptomatic reinfections like despite 8 million confirmed cases world, doubt common event. Maybe individual body failed produce proper antibodies keep couple months. maybe tests picking dead virus another health issue caused COVID-like symptoms either first tested positive. 

I would want see cases like worry much. Outdoors safER SAFE. case Italy ever reported one day 6500 fun, seem dense understand happens wear mask, even though wrote pretty clearly you. 

Have great day please try civil. I‚Äôm still sure I‚Äôd want take vaccine although won‚Äôt really choice medical field. want know exactly it. You‚Äôd surprised know what‚Äôs vaccines. Watch ‚Äú Shot Dark‚Äù it‚Äôs 2020 documentary really gives prospective vaccines. still believe people receive vaccines, spaced apart more. parents made aware exactly put children‚Äôs bodies.  parents gilbert won‚Äôt stop going out. dad went got haircut day ‚Äúhe couldn‚Äôt take anymore‚Äù. go frys Costco every day insist going restaurants pick food opposed delivery (which scam). I‚Äôm immensely worried there. say go 60-70% people wearing masks. see comment, asking articles studies show things say. I'd like read myself. Agree you, always focus bad news NY, NJ, PA, CT, DE even Maryland absolutely crushed curve. encouraging shows done base reopening around science political ideologies. deaths unlikely yes, illness permanent damage also yes, inadvertently spreading others higher risk categories testing positive also yes. round glass opacites generally go away own? anything else cause know about? Depends virus around long-term not. so, eventually individuals predisposed extreme reactions would die rate would impact procreation rate. Assuming vulnerability/sensitivity virus genetic component, genes would reduced chance passed on, resulting slow, multi-generational genetic change humanity.


Not large number assumptions conditions, yet know genetic predisposition towards worse effects, whether people routinely reinfected, virus mutates quickly enough pose long-term danger, build broad immune resistance. guess longer-term studies fill gaps. Deaths lag cases week two. Also, it‚Äôs possible demographics spike skews younger anecdotes Memorial Day weekend crowds trusted. gotta honest, see tennis one safest sports play right now. I've sworn bathing grandparents don;t think government political anothe shutdown. said, see shutdowns completely consumer driven point.

You'd foolish go bar, restaurant, sporting event, mall, etc. states point. retroactive March. Wow... that's dumbest thing I've heard today.  Thanks, needed that.ü§£ü§£ü§£ Oh. wear fucking mask. comparable, you‚Äôre choosing pedantic they‚Äôre 100% identical. nobody said deaths equal holocaust bad. sure you‚Äôre getting there. 

The fact Covid killed many Americans world war obviously significant, sure you‚Äôre trying complicate that. That's reopening never going go well.

People low compliance voluntary things. Especially things cost money.

I'm one recycles neighborhood requirement recycling costs effort money.

Even gyms required clean equipment... enforced happens time.  Yeah concerns real valid dictatorship leadership must control people. much democracy. someone takes steroid stay alive pre-Covid19, wish worked. Yes, Afghanistan complex modern borders don‚Äôt represent historical nation realities global politics. 

Still, call graveyard Persia along many others thought region would easy conquer. lessons never learned. Nope. know long term folks see coming antibodies. Could took test soon, fight virus T-cells. entire threads it. soon start supporting family glad so. though, kind need work. Sooo reason? believe sports gonna proceed, sports departments need develop methods even one person tests positive, people still move forward. see everyone work stop testing. that, ‚ÄúBOOM!!!‚Äù
No ‚Äúnew cases.‚Äù Problem solved. /s Huh? No, didn't. curve hidden, flattened.

[The ""flattened"" number daily cases ""flattens"" end March? know happened then? That's Swedish government stopped testing suspected cases COVID-19.

Notice number daily cases starts rising beginning June pretty much rate change testing criteria? know changed? started testing suspected cases again.

We see rate growth change testing fewer people. proves ""flattening"" merely artifact testing people likely virus. China also censored winnie pooh government spoiled brats misleading title.

Thanks though teri maa ch*dne busy hain still clue Trump promoted strongly I‚Äôm guessing wearing masks etc? local police department can‚Äôt use health ministry‚Äôs data either. Oh. wear fucking mask. latest CDC shows infection fatality rate actually even lower 0.3% 45 pre-existing conditions. Decreases NYC New Jersey, increases places like Florida Texas.

Wearing mask outside new normal, can't even get people much. Lol side still countries would consider extreme-right well, way long people lost sense what's reasonable. *your immune system figured something like saw big number pop worldometer. Still, trend worrying India. country four times population U.S., taken longer pandemic build speed, looks like getting control.

That's great question. Alabamaian here. Went restauraunt grab food see packed gills, masks, social distancing :-(. Oh sorry, guess missed sarcasm tasted Beyond Burger? I'd rather eat Chum Bucket. flying loving it. Things opened couple weeks county (last reopen) cases nosediving past week.

Yea look price mask, singe KF94 mask sold $5 Amazon $3.5 spend extra $20 every week get mask, even including sanitizer, may wear mask. Think family 4 becomes least $80 extra expenditure. pretty common practice variety conditions including viral &amp; bacterial pneumonia.

This study proving already practice. China works hard freedom coronavirus. 

Meanwhile country works hard give freedom coronavirus. HAHAHA.

Censorship moderation good thing, opinions equal. üòã Oh. Well case stay fuck home. seeing increase hospitalizations Arizona. Im sorry what? new info? We‚Äôve using drug forever. Inflammation = anti-inflammatory drugs. Almost deliberately destroying economy money though. pure ideology.

Long term stuff wish dead. end, die it, way disintegrated body brutal Interesting, major cities protests much impact coronavirus cases. 2-3 weeks cities like Boston New York great. think numbers general re-opening following mask/distancing rules. Protesters general good wearing masks. one organizers city's protest inform everyone positive days protest (obvs aware time.)

She wore mask. protesters wore mask.

So far, nobody town protest appears gotten her. police departments, grocery stores, utility workers.....

As I've understood it, large problem immigrant families/societies infection, tendency often live take care elderly, meeting relatives often. Basically tightly knitted ""natives"" certainly noticeable live country well. Sadly, less distancing lead hardships times mean *silent postal*?  ""you actually die Covid, it‚Äôs crazy. actually kill you""

what fuck wrong people literally get sick believe covid real *kyrie entered chat* That‚Äôs great. suspect thousands lives ‚Äúsaved‚Äù less driving. Time tell stats roll out. may already available. Lets protest racist virus. First people get infected. get hospitalized. die. things separated weeks each. rocket surgery. Idk is, I‚Äôm dead serious take flintstone gummies Mind you, millionaire access best available medical care. regular people? accurate. 

Please understand, antibodies type memory immunity. parts immune system less effective, they're different. 

On top that, many people antibodies serum (blood) *do* seem antibodies mucus. even think antibodies be-all-end-all immune system (which really aren't), many people antibodies, measuring them. 

And finally, first paper linked commonly used antibody tests finding fraction people whose blood *actually neutralizes C-19*.

If think somehow news story going cause bunch people contract COVID, I'm going need source one. Even *were* correct rest said, watching news make sick. think puzzle. Humans little immunity (essentially meant calling ""novel"" coronavirus) huge reservoir people infect. therefore faces little evolutionary pressure mutate order remain infectious may fulfill biological imperative passing genetic material on. people returning overseas True, worked hard manual labor many cases caused preexisting conditions them. especially vulnerable group. really heartbreaking see years service put making Swedish society better repaid cruel manner. sister it, asthma, recovered fully.

Around 20% car accidents caused distracted driving, assume goes deaths get around 600 people per month.

Gun deaths total (including suicides accidents) around 3K per month.

Stats medical malpractice vary lot researchers hard quantify counts not, 2K 20K per month. 

If add everything up, get figures comparable corona, sure, illness singlehandedly kills people major causes deaths (except heart disease) combined cause extreme concern? would guessed see propaganda department got involved step IV unaware nose threatening avenue delivery mouth.

Just think different purposes nose mouth have. cells make tissues different other. Nose cells lot ACE2 receptor proteins cell membranes, make easy virus enter begin replication. Mouth cells don‚Äôt required ACE2 proteins it‚Äôs harder infect way. Also, provide source this, share credentials are?

Weak also strong. Common fascist propaganda trope. COVID-19 deadly manmade Chinese bio-weapon. need scared it, silly Republican. act macho remember, flu (ignoring flu actually pretty terrible bug). Alec, you? Ok well mild cases don‚Äôt really need much treatment clear since quite time coronavirus leaves long-lasting damage even ""mild"" cases. question percentage cases, 10%? 30%?

Shutting opposite change though.
I really understand point view that's OK. curious. know coronavirus epidemics long term, chronic health issues caused coronavirus infection. SARS patients often bone density issues. fallout pandemic going brutal last generation. ones contribute statistic disputing. ones predominately lead death? forms dangerous Covid19?

Bad math bad feel bad. Except government utterly incompetent best times citizen‚Äôs data, hence past breaches. Also, transparency broader issues current UK government, relevant app outlined think everyone realized point, governments want admit wrong would rather stick ""ok lots people might die economy suffer"" argument. Awesome! Slowly surely, we'll find way beat eradicate virus! would able thing? WHO? say! yeah thats choose put little data possible. without government intervention / legislation social media see stopping. People upvoting comment think nice, actually shitty promoting false disrespectful defamatory conspiracy theories. can‚Äôt compare wars viruses. flu killed people 2018 many big wars, it‚Äôs 2 different things. TB kills 1.5 million year, one compares war I'd like make garage. instructions pinterest somewhere?

/s dropped like neighbours. 

By metrics, actually worse! Unemployment growth forecasts worse Sweden DK FI (Norway gotten screwed global collapse oil, heavily reliant on). heard immunity waitig vaccine like rest world. vaccine comes reasonably soon death could avoided.

And vaccine either, get improvements clinical treatments every week. Listen Week Virology's Dr. Daniel Griffen: almost every time he's show he's reporting something new docs learned help improve odds survival. today news steroid treatment significantly increase survival rates: aside, Sweden ignoring international European guidelines pursue Test, Trace, Isolate strategy that, almost always cases / clusters pop up, keep spread well control.

Fuck outta here, man. *Essentially*, yes! think back ""we know yet"" category. 

It's effectively ""probably work"" category. studied bunch different countries--if worked, we'd know now.

All initial evidence worked studies sort methodological flaw (no control arm, non-randomized treatment arms, dropping people started get worse, etc.). brazilian government website get data ministry health also liked wine sayingggg I'm sure due fact parents locking children tightly good parents. county county started lockdown Mid March initially allowed construction continue social distancing rules. cops spending lots time warning construction sites breaking rule county shut down. construction reopened noticeable uptick Covid cases roughly half construction sites. Whatever rationalization works push narrative, son. prickly all. sarcasm quite apparent thought. worries. well...looks like entire country going explode cases longer stay outside, seems. Maybe Pence, head Pandemic Task Force, would somehow set example........ Understood, hope longer protection could conferred vaccine!

For woman's case however, **clinical perspective**, really sound like 'reinfection'. Something odd. symptoms different second illness; ""high blood pressure headache"" different ""clear obvious symptoms.. ..coughing like believe"" first presentation (*aside; I'm entirely convinced PCR swab first presentation - journalist seems skim part - maybe ""test"" retrospective clinical)*.

""High blood pressure headache"" sole symptoms, difficult reconcile active Sars-CoV-2 infection. definitely reporting respiratory symptoms first illness. would think truly encounter virus second time fact mounting immune response. guess one could argue mucosal protection endothelial/ systemic protection, perhaps chronic infection kidney involvement causing hypertension/ headache I'm getting speculative! - hope wrong.

On brighter speculative note, maybe flu first time, false positive serology donated plasma, recent ""asymptomatic"" Sars-CoV-2 infection uncovered new diagnosis high blood pressure, essential unrelated. Pretty sure There‚Äôs joke I‚Äôm gonna make R0 info states Prevention preferable Treatment. 

We practicing social distance wearing masks states shut again. saw post deleted.

There ample evidence Trump's inaction increased COVID deaths 60 percent.

In real world, hold people accountable failings costs lives others. whose kids young, like toddler age, grow likely knowing dead parent knowing one who‚Äôs alive... Where, might ask? said took responsibility though. enough? Doubt States reported all-time highest single-day new case totals last week: Alaska, Arkansas, Mississippi, Nevada, North Carolina, Arizona (twice), Texas (twice), Oklahoma (three times), Oregon (three times), Alabama (four times), Florida (four times), South Carolina (five times). 

This simply function increased testing. Oklahoma South Carolina, average number daily tests actually declining. states, like Alabama, average daily new-case count growing faster average number daily tests.  might dumb question, ask it. 

Is badly advised practice chew gum wearing mask? take medication gives dry mouth don‚Äôt drink water constantly. wear mask entire time work shifts job. take water breaks occasionally, enough prevent whole mouth throat going dry, super uncomfortable happens. Im chewing gum shifts keeps mouth going 100% dry.

Since Im wearing surgical cloth masks, it‚Äôs possible coronavirus come mask. Would chewing gum make likely get infected? Im wondering theres info that. Thanks everyone! Clearly close minded since info seek clearly stated article. actually bottom half states median age despite stereotypes.

There lot retirees Arizona. also lot young people. north east older median age Arizona, Texas, Georgia. Combined less density, better treatment practices I'd bet negative outcomes severe states.

Florida looks trouble following theory though. shall see. Worldometer new cases 31,633 1,123 deaths? anyone confirm? I've prednisolone couple times asthma flare ups amazing quickly works much better feel taking mean, even without masks/distancing haven‚Äôt seen outdoor spread. We‚Äôve crowded parks street-drinking NYC since April, beaches open South, party Arkansas too. things caused people predict huge spike never happened. know topic article. don‚Äôt see humor satire. See. took science based article reframed political one. See satire? upvoted. Plus poorer sanitation general, compounding diseases, poorer nutrition (especially following WWI), host factors mean COVID19 probably would bad - worse - 1918.

Consider we've Spanish Flu recent times significantly different flus (could immunity accrued 1918 though). say using [Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS¬Æ Anti-SARS- CoV2 Total extremely low false-positive rate (&lt;0.3%) high false-negative rate (20-30%). Basically says positive, definitely COVID. negative... keep isolating consider another test suspicion actually exposed.

I example trying find another get negative. live Boston took public transit day lockdowns started, week-long illness late March, assumption point caught recovered COVID already. Great points. problem re: schools lot people refuse see can't kids school stop spread disease. And, see given choice education safety, people willing let safety go. (Just as, larger scale, world seems generally willing sacrifice lives economic comfort.) can't admit they'll sacrifice lives that's painful, theater pretend forced choose. Stockholmers tested positive covid-19 go work mild symptoms doctor judged okay.

Read article  People named Lynch need stop naming shit themselves. know side effects extremely rare, right? Nothing all? Nothing say? accusations? good, players get infected recover means sports. I'm real worried Oklahoma situation, trumps rally indoors combined already increasing cases something watch commonly used, often would think used already? approved widely accepted drug COVID? Sometimes treat symptoms already used for? good news understand more, already widespread use COVID patients net benefit lives saved smaller stated benefit already realized. Well, one thing US govt pay treatment for, dialysis. Dialysis subsidized basically Medicare 4 currently have. I'm sure age well Thank contributions science. sure name vaccine done resolve mysteries virus. Given you‚Äôve said, think Dexamethasone already part current covid standard care hospital? Also seems like drug fighting virus, making person strong enough long enough immune system win fight virus die. understanding correctly? Read article linked 8 10 Americans worried second wave, 

but 1 10 Americans willing wear mask go shopping.

Makes wonder 7.

If 8 10 American would wear damn masks, second wave. drug used high altitude climbers? watched video months back doctor New York saying symptoms Covid-19 resembled altitude sickness pneumonia. yeah dude reddit really giving brain damage al left-leaning censorship one either suddenly guy running president platform Making America Think Harder. he's one main reasons even got stimulus all.

There's lots help people feel safe. everyone feels safe economy reopen real minimal risk. everybody takes seriously 10% going ruin rest us. ruin without realizing it. Big events like certainly part economy, hardly whole thing. think may overestimating % US economy comes conventions. Also, businesses likely stop shuttling employees around things open up. There's reason willing pay much flights hotels, really convention travel decline. I'm sure many consultants still Mon-Thurs grind state laws allow it, I'd bet people find new ways spend money well long everything completely closed.

I disagree point, arguing lot stuff mitigated. [Patients increased early (&lt;2 weeks) antibody response SARS three times mortality normal people getting strongest immune responses (possibly due long life HCoV infection?) probably people put ventilation. go (hospitalizations) - death stats readily available well. Yesterday's 3 day average death rate 476, lowest since late March. story today's reported death toll around 2,000 people?

Is one catch-up data dumps rising around 300-400 week  Damn right are. pandemic made one thing clear, many essential people country treated like shit. need medicare health care, need living wage minimum wage, need guaranteed sick leave. isn't, people getting time limited. sir bill 2.8M cash credit? addition US attempting heal economy all. claim able businesses open aim, things allow happen (universal masking, six feet, etc). Good point, guess balance infection rate versus procreation rate. interesting see numbers Covid Boomers next year. Ladakh disputed territory close Himalayans, exactly like marching straight Mumbai Also curious this... said ""FREAK"" reason. Maybe stars aligned someone, etc. 

Doesn't mean people lucky sporting events.

No, supporters may wearing masks probably stop wearing event causing even spread. message. someone start voting low infection rally. I've surprised good San Diego restaurants been, seen violations pick take 2x/week, still chance dine months least. Definitely. sincerely hope southern/western states seeing increases right act it‚Äôs late bring feeling they‚Äôll learn hard way like did. could choose rent there. Meanwhile we're masks temp screening case last week.

Almost anecdotal evidence irrelevant. Why? It‚Äôs flu.*

Sorry inform you, can't cancel Joe Rogan.  include stress stupidity entails(inferiority complex)..

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread rapidly throughout world since first cases coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) observed December 2019 Wuhan, China. suspected infected persons remain asymptomatic play significant role ongoing pandemic, relative number effect uncertain. authors sought review synthesize available evidence asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Asymptomatic persons seem account approximately 40% 45% SARS-CoV-2 infections, transmit virus others extended period, perhaps longer 14 days. Asymptomatic infection may associated subclinical lung abnormalities, detected computed tomography. high risk silent spread asymptomatic persons, imperative testing programs include without symptoms. supplement conventional diagnostic testing, constrained capacity, cost, one-off nature, innovative tactics public health surveillance, crowdsourcing digital wearable data monitoring sewage sludge, might helpful. landlord told shove papers. papers good airlines. properly trained service animals required law allowed. supposed focus hurricanes covid Donald increases 50% offering medical knowledge Fantastic news requiring treatment.

Dexamethasone cheap commonly used mass produced.

I've read summary, data supports conclusions, looks solid. They're claiming reduction one-third deaths patients requiring ventilator support reduction one-fifth deaths patients require oxygen support.

(No benefit patients requiring oxygen ventilator support.)  exceptions flying well driving, unnecessary travel allowed two countries. hell make free everyone fucks sake. Making free ""for can't afford it"" means sticking stupid bureaucracy way, allowing special interest groups profit kickbacks stupid shit like that. Go swim pee ocean. mask supplies long gone general public announced masks don‚Äôt work. No, wasn‚Äôt Americans wiped out. didn‚Äôt ask officers ID ...... Bars, though, even worse, need lean close people hear you, pulling mask every time take drink, likely drniking alcohol relaxes inhibitions dulls judgement. Well also weird vote making healthcare affordable. it. 5% huge especially one people hospital. Every little improvement counts towards better chances part bigger picture! look AIDS - longer death sentence was, even cured/in remission (not sure correct term, since read changes AIDS care treatment know come leaps bounds last years, plus development PrEP) Assuming test numbers correct (I double-check):

Positives tests:

A) June 9-15: 12422

B) June 2-8: 8074

C) May 26- June 1: 5296

D) May 19-25: 5304

I'll 4, think month enough. let's normalize them. take first number 27947 divide remaining test numbers. 27947 100.76% 27735. means normalize week B, would multiply 8074 get 8135. I'll rest real quick get.... C: 7839 D: 4476. 

A: 12422, B: 8135 C: 7839 D: 4476. clear upward trend control test rates. Including jump \~65% week B A. like that, many potential new clusters. So, nothing said accurate. maintain social distance extreme, wash hands often, don‚Äôt touch surfaces don‚Äôt need touch. actually extremely careful surroundings. Likely you, that‚Äôs fine. medical doctors agree wearing mask causes harm good, going stick advice yours. want give advice lowering reload times, it. However time produce medical degree still go advice doctors. 

Sorry hurts feelings. Nope. [It US, Covid-19 politicized early on. half-million us die prematurely partisanship willful ignorance.  KD symptoms ? England, James? Sad true. true. completely possible without violating hippa.  Look nyc. weather Wisconsin warm feels nice. weather Arizona hot oppressive. That's probably main difference. People outside Wisconsin packed inside Arizona. Best Buy also took care employees financially early stages pandemic furloughed people became absolutely necessary. friends work Best Buy nothing praise employees.

They seem genuinely care employees customers time. Yup. fastest vaccine ever deployed four years. time clinical trials. vaccine end year, safety trials cut short. way I'm going one first people take that. certainly multiple dynamics play. consider nursing homes account nearly half Sweden's deaths (as third week May, can't find newer source). inexhaustible well victims virus. We've seen US well - many places nursing homes disproportionally hit earlier harder, one reason CFR drops time. contact tracing ?

AZ said plan able trace 500 cases per day June 1st.

Now averaging 1000 per day even best case scenario planned still missing half cases. sure implications HIPPA tracing AZ supposed do. doctors nurses adequate PPE now? bad news what's going happen capacity... promising! finally good news!!! Wait people think this? sure whole northeast area amazing job continues trend positively even reopening! still feel like long term immunity exists within disease might lying virus‚Äô origin potential HCQ effectiveness COVID: thought trolling first. claim really easy prove wrong. would compare overall deathrate 2020 previous years see drastically Might help go low dose anti-depressant bit. could take edge anxiety. Talk doctor. 

I've mild anxiety years. twice month might panic attack. I've good managing mental exercises, every often, simply need low dose Xanax calm down. However, started becoming real February, anxiety took off. needing Xanax 4-5 times week function. good *sure* want benzo tolerance/dependency. doctor put low dose Lexapro. Within couple weeks, feeling pretty good anxiety better since it. depressed, still helped general anxiety. Still taking I've increase quality life. YMMV Lol, avoiding sub last time spent time outdoors nice see stupidity posts. go sub sort Europe/New guy posting 10 articles row? pathetic donnishness ... Buy Lynch's saved! price people pay saving economy! helping get there?  protestors left side politics wearing PPE protests, there's would explain doesn‚Äôt help oxygen mask patients much helps ventilator patients? Wondering update? bf 2 jobs, lost PT ones bc covid kept full-time ones. Wondering eligible unemployment $600 Look, bud u/Mighty_L_LORT official press release WH. lies, ignore problem pretend over. Claim victory double confronted facts. Back fashionable (because might get mean tweet), saying 100k June 1. beat 3 days. know... right? shocking think government hiding true start rising heavily again, know right.

Nope. again... number cases hidden. That's Sweden case fatality ratio 10%, nations around 1%.

I'm saying people infected, I'm saying infections hidden official numbers. We're starting see real numbers. Woah that‚Äôs actually kind big. basically means immunity last long time we‚Äôd protected longer strands couldn‚Äôt get us. NEED SCIENCE THISSSSS tickle brain! I've 4 tests past week...not fun. 

My job involves many people working EXTREMELY confined enclosed work spaces travel public transportation. 1 case could *easily* hit us fast. first trip back, company's plan involves pre-traveling isolation + lots tests. excess mortality directly covid-related. probably [10s thousands second-order due *response.* happened steroids exacerbating covvid symptoms? thing anymore? different steroid early reports? many back forth things hear drugs.  seals it. I‚Äôm definitely flying anytime soon. Look, bud u/Mighty_L_LORT System Dreams Total Darkness. wonder inaccuracies testing. Seems like fool proof way confirming. Nope.. reminding young sheep left alone wolves flat rate that‚Äôs 70 days 100% capacity. exponential growth much sooner. seem like data graph correct, according we're seeing 20,000 new case day remained pretty consistent level since peak April. graph tweet showing less 5,000 new daily cases, I'm reading correctly. right looks like deaths US downward trend, exciting hope keeps up. üôè SQUAWK SQUAWK I'm dumb ass parrot. 

They discussed senate hearing long time ago. Well, let nature take care thing Hard believe, it? /s is! really like it.

But Germans long ass names even everyday objects surprised! Europe crush covid. still highest deaths per capita many countries still struggling outbreaks. still want wear masks give virus.

Florida three times population Arizona. don‚Äôt mean masks though, don‚Äôt mean political figure heads. I‚Äôve seen posts platforms, even people live near me, everyday people sit left side political fence shaming people even going get mail. one ever leave house next 18 months horrible human being. 

Not everyone guilty, are/were extremes either side aren‚Äôt helping. caption discusses fact breathing/talking/etc produce airborne particles. still case outside, aren‚Äôt likely infect others stagnant indoor air. thought people joking no, actually blamed imported salmon. \*Insert ""you can't second wave first one never ends"" meme here'\* Every year [647,000 Americans die heart 5.552x WWI American casualties, [609,640 Americans die 5.232x WWI American casualties. 
Stop comparing coronavirus deaths war deaths stupid hypocritical suddenly care people dying saying anything millions people dying much serious diseases. Exactly. qualifies able afford it? Nobody pay shit. joined Slack ""Body politic"" group should. 5000+ people symptoms, discussion research etc. Considering adeptly handled situation, tune populace mitigation factors like mask compliance, immediacy, think it‚Äôs ‚Äòcheap talk‚Äô coming there. perhaps doing: societal education awareness willing compliance, future looks like. praising progress China's making towards containing virus seen ""disinformation"" western politician, wonder many fucked pandemic. all, kind dismissive attitude big cause delay western countries beginning?

Well, besides special cases, I‚Äôm sure puppet PM delighted organise plenty reciprocal travel ensure infect properly comment section victim blaming much. Many risk factors controllable, like male, old, diabetes (in cases), type B blood. also know many girls workout gym, workaholics, dont overeat, eat well, still obese.

 Many underlying conditions go hand hand old age. Hypertension, instance, look sources tell underlying causes arent well understood. people get older, numbers go fast. issue use word (or persons comment implication all). posts refer some, none implied anything close lifelong chronic illness. honestly believe 50% people disease lifelong chronic issues dont know say. will, I'm disagreeing that. minority it. create panic. Piss off, saying disagree someone still feel sorrow loss ""impure"" legit ""pure"" shows humans love despite differing opinions. Keep one sided bullshit yourself. shut enough get economic impact without much health benefit, absolutely worst worlds. really tragic time squandered people supposed do. wondered first video Willie D. really covered much Houston. would good story warn people dangers issues virus. Slim Thug well said barely left house except get groceries said never got truck. first wave tsunami also hot. summer, don‚Äôt lot people opt stay inside? Sort like people North winter?

Americans large live air conditioned perpetual summer 70-80¬∫ year round 7 day trend new daily hospitalizations Arizona hit new time high. [See chart spreadsheet [with data This, coupled record ICU patients showcases due increase testing. People getting sick. middle school 9/11 definitely remember shift. others pointed out, society largely return normal point following COVID, especially there's vaccine viable treatment. But, think many us changed individual level. (Especially us already suffering generalized anxiety disorder.) look death rates (which still subject manipulation/noise due count deaths many miss) instead case rates (which dependent much test test), graphs look strikingly Ugh, can‚Äôt wait Friday :-( That's taking official testing. random test antibodies, results totally different.

This research example showed 1/5 new yorkers already antibodies. that's back completely expected July next year close 60% immunity. vaccine happen that. We've tried nothing ideas.  


Didn't wear masks. social distance. Went out. like saying commit one crime time heightens risk get caught. Maybe try one methods least. Yes given not, banning sell N95 mask personal use using emergency power encourage local producers produce mask would prudent plan. got rid ours! Bet way Arizona. they‚Äôre absolutely correct... Wonder he's reconsidering church connected explosion cases neighboring Union County. ""Some nobody outside tennis""'s wife better?  I've heard second wave, know say second waves...well, thing we've done great job make America Great Again. personally made sure invisible enemy shot sight, think we've done great job - shooting enemies, mean - that's part reason great American people safe Administration. Remember kid opposite day?

I worried second wave white house denied confirm second wave. degree redefine things. Turn whole floors things resemble ICU, people would normally admitted sent home, army field hospitals some. feel bad states giving problem obstinate goofy. There's plenty evidence deal this. Absolutely agree. Hence army preparing second wave. Dont think US stupid doesnt see what's happen.

I mean disrespect toward opinion, SEEN people charge? put stupid callous action past them. Taps forehead... worry, already Business closures also violated constitution wife. even know name? honest

I really need know Jah Rule thinks Today good start. Deaths seem pretty low Tuesday, found drug might work, dominos roasted someone Twitter. Improves population immunity. Sweden ultimately prove importance natural herd immunity. mean think like six months long enough time point cuz virus mutated like crazy

Antibodies also detectable six weeks only, addressed study too

I feel like case hospital workers would sick that‚Äôs awful, fortunately haven‚Äôt seen right? Simple answer no. best bet visit COVID dashboard former employee fired wanting fudge 15 cases 0 bada bing bada boom don‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs due testing! Oh wait... true, headline hospitalizations. That's important lot less likely artifact testing availability. I‚Äôll believe see it. swear Mark Calaway gets sick us disagree. Since one immunity still transmit summer seeing viral explosion southern hemisphere (South America) enter peak influenza season (June/July) starting see serious growth southern states use lot air conditioning.

Research SARS Classic shows virus stable cooler, dry temperatures like Arizona office 5% humidity 68 degrees F.

Northern states seeing large decreases cases across US Europe. Sure mitigation decrease spread, think heat humidity behavioral aspects summer help decrease viral spread.

During Spanish flu, many know Philadelphia war bonds parade kicked horrible outbreak. parade late September, presumably back September 4th month summer, actually quite moderate temperature. think heat last weeks protected protesters, parade Philly started outbreak filled every hospital bed within 4 days. 

Here's great paper stability SARS Classic exposed different temperatures humidities. Read conclusion, also explain Thailand Malaysia mostly unscathed SARS outbreak. Weirdly, Covid, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos almost cases, behaving similarly. 

I think going see seasonality going correct number really well 150k. world war 2 civil war states end like new york, anticipate US quarter millions deaths. real deaths counts 100,000 deaths go! good, since states massively defunded institutions favor tuition funding international students prop financially. need raise tuitions domestic students raise taxes find schools. Imagine trusting Fox News credible news source Yeah no. works. There‚Äôs way could possibly buy every generic market ‚Äî one, federal antitrust regulators wouldn‚Äôt allow it. eardrums lot foolish people. Oof. Thank goodness play devils advocate.

You claim believe that, yet don‚Äôt live that. what‚Äôs truth? leave questions following exclusive interview, many foreigners know custom. Apparently doctors learn lesson HCQ

""safe. cheap. everyone else it""

Also, steroids shown increase viral load secondary infections - CDC far recommended use COVID patients. Even forehead temperature sensors notoriously inaccurate compared oral. 

You note tenth degree accuracy core body temperature, rather tenth degree accuracy skin temperature. I'm pretty sure going get plenty false negatives positives using skin temperature wrist.  WTF. news screaming everyone? People clue wtf going on. think people don‚Äôt actually realize economic consequences catastrophic people‚Äôs health virus shut everything. Even family‚Äôs business struggling we‚Äôre staying afloat now. sure much longer tho. Ears? eyes. Yep, many states increasing every day past week get new articles like depressingly often I‚Äôll shop Menard‚Äôs. strictly enforce mask policy local store. don‚Äôt mask they‚Äôll give one. 100% compliance.  Pretty sure 17 y/os lying age get gunned Omaha Beach end-of-life-care-home dementia residents coronary-heart-disease-waiting-to-happen.

Trying guess Trump anything fool's errand. said, doubt scientific community listening much drugs study. Instead, looks like made educated guesses works ran studies. far remdesivir (for early hospitalization) one people decline need oxygen support ventilators. 

This big reason social distance. longer delay infection, greater chances survival. know answer according post spent integrating app german health authorities stuff. 

It's somewhere AMA Go vegan. Leaving animals fuck alone = pandemic. That's thing. Large groups supposed gather without distancing. look news, many gathering sorts places actually wearing masks. 
And that's people freaking out. people gathering, brain dead losers follow protocols. 
Oh, go 2 years. lot quicker fucking idiots actually listen go beaches bars. Depends mean long term. terms antibody titers, one study found.

 

**Neutralizing antibody responses SARS-CoV-2 COVID-19 recovered patient cohort recent study found 70 percent developed high antibody titers, meaning blood contained high concentrations antibodies virus, whereas 25 percent lower titers, 5 percent detectable antibodies.

Immuni kind suggests immune virus app. news BTK inhibitors &amp; Covid? live Florida well often see people without masks on. Everyone seems forgotten stopped quarantine boost economy, virus went away. virus much still active government care. wrong many levels, I‚Äôm happy would never happen Germany. wrote thesis ways drug companies keep generic drugs market! specific loophole Turing Pharmaceuticals used Daraprim ‚Äî something called closed distribution ‚Äî closed December 2019 passage CREATES Act. 

Currently, biggest way pharmaceutical companies keep generics market *patent evergreening*: way using patents patent litigation continually refresh monopolies. creating vast portfolios patents single drug (Humira, example, covered 120 patents), filing new patents old ones expire, introducing new version drug functionally identical original, new patent, right generics original enter market, process called *product hopping*. 

If you‚Äôd like read generic delay strategies, recommend paper: [Drug Wars: New Generation Pharmaceutical always happy answer questions too. Hi, UK here. 
We want acknowledged idiocy too! Planning early study said steroids increased mortality. Like miracle I've found observation Karl Marx history first repeats tragedy farce pretty insightful times. gave superintendents locked outhouses, every individual worker? No.

This disappointing event

Blame origin virus definitely cave near Wuhan. journalism joke days widely available, normally used steroid treatment could saved thousands lives discovered effective treatment method astonishing... Yeah I'll discussions day many projections wrong, saying we're coming side like countries live Mississippi one thing we've noticing majority black people around wearing masks ones nose sticking it. Nearly white people wearing masks though.

Anecdotal, perhaps. I'm seeing. Much Mississippi Alabama public transportation either. Something take consideration.

I think one biggest factors blacks tend large families live extended families. got 10 people house one gets sick, lot worse white family single child. Blacks also higher rates obesity health problems contribute getting ill enough covid visit doctor. Oh sorry talked German one. Somehow missed Italian thread. ideas like this. way we‚Äôll need 1-2 crew members. thousands thousands BLM protesters beg differ hard chant mask.  Florida Texas 4,000 deaths pneumonia 2020 far. past years, states 900 pneumonia deaths per year. go it, someone pops 3 aspirin 30 min screened good luck picking thermal indicator. PD really wild body state constant panic vigilance. Hoping PD solved medication &amp; psychiatry pretty easily.

PD seems worst real reason exist, like case. Inactivated vaccines seem safer. Aw geez. wonder could happened? /s Highest number new deaths increased. India completely terrible fucked up. It‚Äôs kind hard enforce violates constitution. open meager wages, open combat brutality perfect logic game 5 year old hide n go seek tag... it! happening often hard figure articles recent Cutting chances death third ventilators massive particularly drug cheap.

That's terrible! someone massively inflating drug's price profits shunted executive pockets boner pill research? moved Texas NY end April many TX friends thought crazy.

How turntables... first course action disrespect me? Come man Soft play centres too! remember reports came 10-20 years ago disgusting are, nothing came Greater 2,392 new cases...out 9,676 new tests highs also hospitalizations, ventilators use, ICU beds use Yeah like reclassification covid deaths pneumonia deaths keep death couny low excellent Reddit right here. 

Makes wading BS find site well worth it. Defeatist! That's exactly right word. evidence organ damage even asymptomatic cases. lungs either also heart kidneys. think would show 35-50 crowd nursing home aged like many assume Oh, will.

Behind numbers lie names. What's best strategy prepare eventual infection? Aside general healthy living vitamin supplement, anything regarding lifestyle/diet proven reduce chance serious case? 

There plenty healthy people serious cases, I'm wondering conclusions drawn went wrong vs. people barely got sick. know blood type play role. 

I've heard there's indication smoking could help, plan pursuing route. realise aren‚Äôt spread evenly continent though right? Half us live 3 cities (even 4/5 Sydney &amp; Melbourne) It‚Äôs announced BBC‚Äôs news. basic language exam requirement get Swedish citizenship? apologies using strong words.

I trying alert people may start commenting actually reading article. intend insult you, sorry! Sounds effective putting sneeze guards fucking everything... That's still problem. Asymptomatics persons still contagious. much? [We know better conservative here.   
Persons symptoms however mild still contagious 9 days.    
Besides, bet whole recommandations mandatory, wrong? Sounds lot like arguments segregated housing. People want live around supposedly dirty/uneducated/dangerous people. know right. Many countries dealt pandemic without apps far less deaths infections.  Contract tracing apps become great tool point right far new rushing apps going huge, huge mistake.  might fine handing data god knows get make decision people. Thought shortly conversation. Maybe problem search due activities meaning life making meaning life actions. I've best conversations life Reddit...they tend subs less 1,000 subscribers. People walking bike riding etc early mornings evenings. like snow ground stopping us! lot time spent pools too! Nothing OP‚Äôs comment endorsed president bleach injections. it‚Äôs easier insult straw man.  Well forms insulin patent, price steadily risen like three manufacturers make it, much stretch think something similar could happen here? words, willing say ""good job"" brother starting train seriously he's immediately gold medalist. 

You lousy brother. constitute ""good news"", well we'll see.

Maybe meeting 100.000/week goal? raise bar ""couch brother bad""? US 6% fatality rate, case. That‚Äôs million people. edgy doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre responsible deaths caused spreading disease. 

It‚Äôs preventable risk good way mitigating, part dick move. Take personal social responsibility suck up. Dick. live Sweden, far Norwegian border (Karlstad) yesterday took trip car look around foreign cars outside shopping malls camping places. 
All could find two cars norwegian plates, two german campers one car latvian plates.

This area usually ton Norwegian cars time year. used hold guy pretty heigh regard, conclusions Swedish numbers reported new cases seems completely disregard change testing strategy preceding sharp rise cases he's referring to. also completely misses relate decreasing trends ICU cases daily deaths. I'm criticising Swedish response pandemic, fact lot criticise, kind shallow analysis *severely* undermines case. R. I.P. Illhan Omar's father. condolences family. That‚Äôs worst kind stupid. I'm legitimately surprised took long administer steroids that's like first fucking thing give go pneumonia. whole situation honestly really underscores absolutely fucking stupid many doctors around world they're hyper trained one area expertise, dumb rocks outside large. baffling. #Hey *other thing* distracts point post??! Horrible. Upvote. really think another shutdown? I'm sure. suppose possible honestly surprised stopped testing together insisted gone. go back USA. that? anything else life chinese besides thinking talking USA? thought even actively said don‚Äôt use corticosteroids.  19 20 patients coronavirus recover without admitted hospital.

Give 6 weeks. group idiots called hoax, opined flu worse...but totally take advice! forms insulin patent, they're still 3 manufacturers cost many insulin products gone like 300% past 20 years so? even state attorney General sued alleged price fixing, no?

I definitely understand sentiment, I'm sure drug's patent expiring always much relief seems. disappointing right are. It‚Äôs long announced BBC‚Äôs news. Skin temperature effective measurement body temperature, inner canthus much, much better.

In order achieve accurate readings inner canthus need things:

1. proper thermal camera someone like Flir (not repurposed chinese security camera)
2. One person's head, static field view, occupying frame (so crowd shots)
3. Better 1 pixel per mm resolution
4. eyeglasses worn person test.

When see fever screening - work. impure. *Here's good vibes, also shitty feelings toward you*. saying dumb shit *long* covid came town. can't even imagine must like live fear entire life. Refusing protect yourself, family, anyone around unhinged fantasy capturing formless vague concept criminal. There's help available you, man, live way. Yep - govt sources experts publicly strongly suspicious even basically writing possibility. State media also runs analysis. Plus, nobody really knows what's happened moment.

Report also came ""no covid virus found salmon entering market"" risks risks drug already , effective goldilocks period, virus present attached ace inhibitors. still showing statistically significant results administered right. results virus taken hold shows benefits infected. google ""bat cov 4991"" news i've heard take 80 years fully complete.

lmao what?

Sounds like someone assuming ""we cant sure long term side effects unless use toddler watch die 80 years old. Therefore vaccine released next 80 years"". true all, vaccines work. Wdw: Walt disney world
Dlr? 
CM? huge, vaccine lets say 85% effective yearly thing many people could immune time cases Thailand repatriated locals. go mandatory state quarantine arrival, there‚Äôs way around it. arrive fever sick, get sent hospital. There‚Äôs confirmation test end 14-day quarantine results negative, allowed go home.

I don‚Äôt know NZ‚Äôers didn‚Äôt undergo mandatory quarantine. doesn‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs advanced cases #In Iceland.

As usual, Icelandic news feel like say story pertains Iceland. 

Anywya, follow piece day: find ones looking test negative! Yeah, Im 40s, chronic health issues mostly control still dont even want get point go hospital sick home kind scary. Mind linking anyone stating that, people debunking bullshit posts? Exactly. rheumatologist warned patients steroids careful, increases chances getting infection worse symptoms. Yet biologics seem protected slightly getting infected worse symptoms. Big pharma waste time this. Easy add one passenger fake cough lot inflight. everyone wear it. prob appropriate choice video.
I personally hate It‚Äôs possible, especially since got sick earlier pandemic. read interview ER doctor large % COVID-19 patients developing acute renal injuries keeping ‚Äúdry‚Äù hopes preventing fluid filling lungs. dehydration pushed patient‚Äôs kidneys edge. ditched AKI rates fell level non-covid ICU patients (which still scarily high).

They‚Äôre also throwing kinds drugs covid patients hoping something sticks. Undoubtedly patients kidneys won‚Äôt respond well. great takeaway Flattening happened several months ago America big, massive, drinking eating fetish.

UCSF epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford believes we'll able gauge impact protests transmission soon.

""Pick day protest, look seven, eight, nine 10 days protest,"" said. ""I think easiest thing look case counts, perfect metric since factor increased testing. We're finding asymptomatic cases now, exactly comparable March April, detected cases symptomatic. May June, we're catching asymptomatic cases hard interpret since we're finding That's came see too. I'm almost afraid hopeful know they're testing medications now, let's hope even combing steroid another medication greatly reduced deaths further. I've always felt tackling COVID-19 would matter multiple medications, rather one. spike Florida going? people already massively wearing masks since February, shops increasing availability hand sanitizers entrances, without needing government say anything. 

I live Japan even see around 95% people wearing masks although temperatures 30 degrees C. It‚Äôs optic-all..illusion. know that? evidence there? go orthopedist half staff wearing masks noses rest wearing all. I've made SURE tell EVERYONE unsafe was, including physical therapist's office, everyone EXTREMELY careful conscientious. refer orthopedist said going stop this. Agree. Plus capture amount data many hospitals able blind easier. physician UK recruit someone trial eligible, long done online training. easy train easy get ethical approval.

Hence statistical significance much better could achieved triple blinded study, albeit risk bias.  entered scene three weeks ago. yet we're still waiting see impact all. even need enforce fine. New Mexico mandate, governor literally said police enforce it, yet there's still 99%+ compliance. stores generally enforcement own. Fucked knees suck. get bad knees better dying. walking? amputated legs better. saying it‚Äôs everyone minimum standards quality life. Sure learn use prosthetics maybe improve QOL QOL shit maybe dead better. 

Before get hate line reasoning neither endorse condone. individual must act appropriate way life. mean.....if could help 100% worst worst affordably drive death rate something genuinely LOW, like common cold low, could get lives. improvement theraputic outcomes WOULD functionally render coronavirus ""another cold virus"" terms mortality economic/societal impact. could actually genuinely squirrel away absolutely at-risk (active cancer patients, people literally immune system, nonegenarians, etc.) REALLY TRULY go herd immunity. ESPECIALLY HCP, could quickly reach point many front-line folks caught safely RECOVERED this, thus likely protected reinfection. 

ESPECIALLY effective input well-tolerated 

If could guarantee die, would gunning catch get life. Nobody sane said 3-5 days. person stupid. takes 3 weeks surge cases appear statistics, one month deaths. Current cases still Memorial Day Weekend Alright... stand corrected. Close half million deaths. think that's small? 
No, can't chill fuck thanks fucking lunatics like you, think nothing happens 2 weeks free virus. 
This virus asymptomatic. never know carrying it. 
If helping containing this.. fine. least stop shitting people actually trying, TRASH neither us wearing masks Daraprim 

 People need remember first mean best, year protection we'll probably get even stronger vaccine, even yearly vaccine boost hardly inconvenience considering world last 6 months definitely ""smaller"" death rate. closer people six feet respirator required safe. Cloth masks go together distancing, respirators don‚Äôt. store wearing masks since April 2020, said Region York spokesperson Khairoon Abbas.

The plane seats many A380, believe American flies. two flights? gonna say that. quite significant, actually. covid, decent chance someone died b/c decision. go, NZ, took 2 British mourner tourists get infected guess question is, 'next years' shot guess like flu vaccine (guess bad word use know mean)? multiple strains Covid 19 vaccinate against? years see vaccine 'wrong one'? point #1 - someone pre-existing condition need extra careful virus act opportunistic manner. look up. BRB know tried thing Wuhan let's say even stop they're exponential growth least another week issue state things current Lombardy case tally, 100 new cases many... I'm also worried could bring virus back lesser hit areas, region quite proactive. New York part United States? ""If exclude hardest hit areas, numbers bad"" really good argument. How's weather Russia? par course majority modern countries good healthcare system. shift already happening -- especially among gen z'ers.

To OP, kind study interests you, check Jonathan Haidt youtube. large portion research addresses issue, really fascinating insights topic. seen paper supporting this. I'd like read published paper research drawing conclusion.

Either way, moment, 130k dead.
Thats 20 thousand Americans died month last 6 months.

But hey, I'm sleeping easy.
Because I'm America. AZ way. pickup order restaurant, place packed single mask customer, many employees. I'm defending TSA. 4 times I've US security procedures far worse anything I've experienced Europe, Asia Africa. I've never treated demeaning disrespectfully TSA subjected to, even singled out!

Yet rest world isnt increase (or really examples whatsoever) plane hijackings, think could dismantle them, suggested.

You might young remember time 9/11 im not. individual airports handled security, pretty well without multi-billion dollar bureaucracy abusive thieves shaking travelers guise security theatre. 

You could easily go back model. infrastructure security literally already installed airports. could shut TSA tonight let airports staff gate checkpoints absolutely nothing would change. Well, one thing would change, less abuse, less theft, billions tax dollars saved annually. Trump holding big rally indoors (24k capacity church) Phoenix 23rd, I'm sure help situation too. Oooooo thought don‚Äôt want regulate people thinking freely????? maybe since people don‚Äôt magically become irrational conspiracy theorists overnight, there‚Äôs history behind decision didn‚Äôt bother inquire about, jumped straight negative judgement. 

Oh answer first reply, don‚Äôt care gets coronavirus. care many others get ever changing opinions verbatim ‚Äúnews‚Äù outlets complicit spread death thousands. needs huge public communications program this.  point seems bad WW1 death count, view somewhat equal terms WW1 given loss life. people making mistake, loss life similar. could change context would easier notice truly horrible virus is.

If I'm still missing point, please fill in. Karen

I wonder much longer people stop parroting word everywhere.  Fucking MORON respect supporters . None. bizarre logic. ONE MAKE WEAR PANTS RAWRRR!  mean, breaking anti-Trump circle jerk, said ""Our testing much bigger [...] shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases.

It takes long need large enough sample need ensure whole cycle disease gone through, particularly since covid patients remain hospital months end.  thots count. doesnt work virus present . goldilocks effect non intended consequence drug. 50% effective exposure fully infected decline. many label drugs like used doctors. 

to explain goldilocks further. dont virus all. taking wont anything except expose possible p side effects drug. virus introduced system immune system hasnt cascaded pneumonia, drugs presence block theoretically virus attaching cells cause cascade.

Sensationalism 

Have fun idiots Janitors deserve credit DR, RN RT gets. clean dirty covid rooms also asked transport bodies. Narrator: took virus loved ones. could anyone known? weeks? going three months. think stay inside vaccine. (Which isn‚Äôt even guarantee)

The people saying people like yourself. person selfish. symptoms still went. new cluster Boulder people protested partied. Incredibly frustrating considering well Colorado doing. know corona never got tested. Schrodinger's virus. could definitely possible especially work part time. $7.25 hour X 20hours week $145, times 4 $580. minimum $600 week unemployment 4 times made before. lot people get unemployment normally, like part time self employed basically getting $600. probably laws prevent price gouging well. heard there's protests there.. so, wonder actually virus protest China guy absolute dipshit I‚Äôm willing bet problem pointless looting violence, right?! Careful now, buddy. dont want pull anything reaching hard. massive spike COVID hospitalizations following weeks protests nobody able help injury. goes *any* blue collar job. 

But culture frowns upon anyone that's blue collar.

Hell *wanted* construction worker youth, summarily dismissed option highly successful white collar family. became closest ""acceptable"" option - architect. (Which family *barely* qualifies acceptable.)

My nephew hugely construction (as ""just phase,"") I'm hoping sister sees happened *encourages* make path what's ""acceptable""  created character story modeled Trump, told character unrealistic Oh boy. far today saw person know post anti-mask, anti-coronavirus post, went see person full body covering waving blue-lives-matter flag corner busy intersection today BLM protests. this, burn all, destroy rebuild, time. Every great empire downfall. Fuck Trump people sucking ass, that's side I'm taking. booing me, I‚Äôm right Source? want believe. that‚Äôs correct. Sure expanding testing going allow us find cases. But, positive case percentage starts go up, start see infections increasing again. Also, testing adequate comes testing/capita.

This stupid comment say people interpret movement virus actually understand statistics sensationalized? headline literally quote president...? That's exact opposite sensationalized.

The fact quote fucking moronic make headline sensationalized...it makes fucking idiot. Imagine president strategy avoiding criminal charges excited see hospital techs mentioned, almost never do. tend literally first person contact patients usually ones dirty work too. incredibly American. second point demonstrably false.

Emphasis mine. understands he‚Äôs saying, case: test more, you‚Äôll see positives, they‚Äôre good find. countries testing heavily, numbers smaller. Ffs. broadcasts live feed home every stupid person america.

Not quite. cable. government reflection people‚Äôs wishes, no? People want think.

I many otherwise smart/educated people parrot CDC say masks needed March long. really thought original. Ooops!

Cases exploding US. We're seeing marginal increase handful states (that mostly explained increase testing tracing infections). meantime, we've seen huge decreases hospitalizations deaths nationwide.

We're ones struggling helping out. anyone tips dealing symptom anxiety? anxiety levels higher usual lately, seems like nearly every day I'll start telling symptoms, occasionally leads anxiety causes tightness chest, convincing short breath, etc. go bed, wake up, fine. anxiety much keep convincing I'm getting sick. keep smelling things remembering still taste keep spiraling control. reference, 25 year old male, underlying health conditions, extreme anxiety getting bad case. misinformation. poor generalisation me.

I‚Äôm obviously referring influenzas, coronaviruses oft mutating viruses.

The point trying make tweak flu jab every 6-12 months tackle latest strain market, coronavirus jab same. science papers we‚Äôve seen already referring multiple strains, news shocking.  Cheap US healthcare system gets involved. It‚Äôs cheap Big Pharma US somehow takes advantage it.. agenda showing. ashamed. feel wrong side history? Sounds like homework curious study I'm [linking others see. I'm wondering challenges notion length immunity? seems like study talks prevalence overall infection immune response (suggesting long takes develop antibodies whether effective). part talked duration could see quoted 191 symptomatic participants reported symptom onset date positive real-time RT-PCR results, positive ELISA results, both, eight positive real-time RT-PCR negative ELISA results; participants, ‚â§15 days elapsed since symptom onset time specimen collection (Figure 3). Among symptomatic participants positive ELISA results positive microneutralization test results (n = 107), median 22 days (IQR = 15‚Äì26) elapsed since symptom onset time specimen collection (Figure 3). Among 12 participants positive ELISA results days symptom onset, eight maintained positive microneutralization test results, including two participants tested months symptom onset.

The study seems limited sample size (382 1,400 sailors) fact samples taken once. Maybe I'm misunderstanding, seems suggest (as said) maybe 40-50% healthy 30-year olds get neutralizing antibodies probably need least two weeks develop them. see make meaningful inference duration response. somehow think true... reported officials I‚Äôll believe actually release paper subject scrutiny. another false claim sea false claims. Odd hotels open , could go San Diego etc .

Maybe think heat keep safe ? They've waiting test right profile.

The test they're using 100% specificity, means every positive result true positive. get positive test, definitely immune anyone planet be.

Older tests 5% chance false positive person tested. current belief 5% Americans infected far (this varies region).

That means test everyone, going get 10% testing positive. 1/2 false positives. would think they're safe go out, carrying disease others. ""Did say Foosball? Foosball Devil"" -- Mamma Boucher (Waterboy) Another warning heeded.  It‚Äôs still fucking insanity institute policy like extra 5 days labor someone *could* spreading disease innocent people. makes sense. concrete evidence that‚Äôs virus works. Yes, I‚Äôve seen preliminary studies stating otherwise, it‚Äôs clear virus still transmissible 8 days. research cherry picked get people work soon possible flat stupid. Honestly, neither. Pharmacology complicated. new disease thing sure particular drug helps reduce mortality severe cases. also neither helps hinders mild cases. far I‚Äôm aware hasn‚Äôt actually study shows steroids general harmful, rumour early pandemic new. Suppose two groups 100 patients each, critically ill.

Nobody first group gets drug, die.

Everyone second group gets it, 33% reduction deaths. 33% 100 33. 67 still die regardless. 

The majority dies anyway. Well thought original comment sarcastic apologize. Unfortunately things gonna come back faster want live fact. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs odd upset bad news. it‚Äôs overly optimistic? People need hope Absolutely agree. Hence army preparing second wave. Dont think US stupid doesnt see what's happen. Well, yes. per information have, young people getting sick. guys pretty good spike too, especially smaller State - yea, near hot spot - Im North Jersey, probably similar terms effect. NHS pay oversea treatment? Beside, believe insurance exclude pandemic coverage. Here's 30 more...years, mirite? Canadians near border maintain US delivery addresses getting ""stuff?"" prove masks work? Health care too. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd even want take vaccine right away. fast they‚Äôre trying develop one. work? major side effects? many shots often new shot needed? first foremost hell it? also heard government talking giving first round vaccines black population. disagree that, I‚Äôm racist. family quite diverse. think vaccines go elderly voluntarily want take first. opinion giving first million shots blacks kind makes wonder government yet using black population Ginny pigs without population even realizing it. big concern mine many others health care field. new race clock go volunteers first rest us continue wear masks, wash hands social distance much possible know sure vaccine safe especially comes giving vaccine children. far didn‚Äôt offer single fact, asked rhetorical question implied sympathetic CCP. You‚Äôre entitled position. seen enough already convince CCP oppressive nothing I‚Äôm going say change mind. 

Cheers. killed .001% American population 1914.

When reach 328,000 logic compare US per capita deaths instead absolute deaths vs Europe!&lt; think would probably r/conspiracy r/the_donald hey, whatever floats boat exact reason I'm going office yet. Big building. offices ten employees, multiple rooms distance, building hundred people it, windows common ventilation. Also public toilets much scarier months ago. 19 states R(t) 1 plus another dozen sitting 1 inside 50% confidence interval.  data looked much better month ago seen outbreaks tied various large outdoor protests, bars mostly operate outdoors fine

Just look Minnesota (which ton bars ton outdoor Genius agree, feel like Americans need damned punch face realize something wrong though. Nobody claiming Corona exact WW1. comparing total deaths, every single factor behind deaths. Obviously pandemic different war. New York outlier data. LMAO (and government/country) less cash buy leisure/culture/better healthcare mean quality life lower?

What happens supply exceeds demand? Prices drop.

We already seeing happen New Zealand, food prices dropping largest monthly amount since 2017. Lower prices result higher demand, balance found. interesting see develop antibody response second ""reemergence/reinfection"".

Also take cases follow next months see RT-PCR viable virus possibility moves next months. Steroids recommended covid treatment unless severe absolute last ditch effort.

Having study come shows medication effectively used get go ICU patients pretty big difference initial recommendations.

Take look thread /r/medicine see discussion it. Imagine dumb I'm Arizona asthma. shit infuriating. guess, least, trying wear mask. number people wearing masks ridiculous. actually care things like whether friends family die. Sometimes targeted testing (ie prisons). makes even less representative sample. shut lid lot gets aerosolized flushing swirl around air inside toilet somebody comes along lifts lid, point flies directly face. (Very similar they've shown aerosolized particles swirl around closed unventilated room hours pandemic.) put terms life-years lost. made comment thought I‚Äôd post too

It‚Äôs fine like president, don‚Äôt either wanting huge outbreak Tulsa makes huge weirdo.

Let‚Äôs break down

*Potential Positives(?)*
- people don‚Äôt agree politically get sick die. Maybe say election political disagreement. Fine. Still don‚Äôt know getting sick dying 
- get social media acknowledgement people always agree anyways

*Potential Negatives*
- People die. thought cared lives now
-front line workers risk. 
- businesses slow reopen. People lose livelihoods, government money runs (hard understand people parental support)
- tax increase rebuild econ newsflash Jeffy Jeff bezos isn‚Äôt gonna paying all
- schools close. believe OK decent number schools already 4 day weeks. online school stunts generations educational growth
-sure others I‚Äôm forgetting Lots people, everyone, makes little $600 lot flew United last week made everyone wear mask, basically forcing one old white dude wear one. Shutting early possible best thing could possibly do. look New Zealand!

The problem lot US shut early, also didn‚Äôt actually take shutdown seriously enough put dent virus. taken seriously bat would much better position right now. Well that‚Äôs worst one. Genuine question: feel knowing mortality precarious? make look life choices differently? Look boomer perspective - dudes dont use computers, social media new tangled garbage they'll never use except facebook. entertainment literally home wife (their kids long moved out) going bar buddies.

They literally dont know anything else care.

Not saying hanging spitting cool, dont know way life.

Kind like people work home learn learn computer scratch... literally dont know adjust new way life. Ron DeSantis last week said upward trend confirmed cases mostly reflection testing conducted combined spikes agriculture communities, number tests conducted daily peaked three weeks ago percentage positive tests 6%, double rate 2.3% late May. Best move follow advise opening statement. literally worst sub find advise COVID. don‚Äôt know anything SARS treatment, steroids always this. mum bad knee gets cortisone shots sometimes help pain, can‚Äôt get often bc steroids eat away joints. Maybe next medical breakthrough one doesn‚Äôt!  people missing goes like (follow along end ...): 

The virus killed anybody. case patients, bodies killing (and causing damage). 

Their bodies killing excessive release normal defensive mechanism called ""cytokines."" 

This excessive release cytokines several different names. One commonly used name is: Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS). 

Unless nicotine prevented so, known rapidly effectively supresse CRS. 

Therefore, nicotine users even need go hospital treatment, UNLESS something gone awry nicotine supressing CRS. 

Obviously smokers go hospitals treatment, let's ask: gone awry nicotine supressing CRS individuals?

There's one definite, several maybe perhaps possible ways nicotine prevented supressing CRS: 

The maybe perhaps possible ways involve handful drugs might might compete nicotine's mechanism supressing CRS. I'm sure, think drugs commonly used, looked details see actually compete nicotine.

More importantly, let's look definite known way nicotine prevented supressing CRS:

Any COX-2 inhibitor prevent nicotine supressing CRS. NSAIDS COX-2 inhibitors. Examples NSAIDS include: Aleve, ibuprofen, aspirin, etc (but Tylenol). COX-2 inhibitors also found nature ginger turmeric. Although quercetin also COX-2 inhibitor, seems seperate ways inhibiting excessive cytokine release, maybe grouped others. Echinacea might also.


For scientific details above, read publications cited comment:  

Some people might take NSAIDS various reasons. reasons might include stated symptoms covid19 body aches. People might consume natural products like ginger turmeric COX-2 Inhibitors various reasons.

Logically reasonably assume smokers take COX-2 inhibitors.

So far, have: smokers need go hospital treatment unless nicotine prevented supressing CRS, COX-2 inhibitors (such NSAIDS) prevent nicotine supressing CRS, surely smokers take COX-2 inhibitors.
 
But post (and therefore comment) smokers report hospital treatment apparently likely non-smokers bad outcome... that?

If majority smokers report hospitals treatment probably needed go hospital lost CRS supressing effect nicotine due taking COX-2 inhibitor, SCIENCE tell us anything else COX-2 inhibitors immune system?

YES! Science tells us variety things effects COX-2 inhibitors immune system (completely independent nicotine). details that, please read paper post: ""Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pharmacology, COVID-19 infection"" (2020)  


As non-smokers hospitals, various potential causes excessive cytokine production. Low levels several essential nutrients independently linked worse outcomes (and therefore go hospital all), Selenium, Vitamin K, Vitamin D. several conditions known involve chronic cytokine production obesity diabetes. logical assume information COX-2 inhibitors suggest COX-2 use might factor non-smokers go hospital treatment, independent factors also identified. 
 
 
So; scientific evidence suggests smokers go hospital treatment necessarily tend worse outcomes non-smokers smokers, go hospital *at all*, due taking COX-2 inhibitor, thus losing CRS suppression effect nicotine incurring negative effects immune system.  Yep. China, Taiwan countries temperature screening know they're doing.

You tell results. Covid Rumble WWE Wrestle Mania  test yourself? Yeah man thats gonna work, done test theres way, amount instruction, anyone voluntarily stick swab deep hold long dealing self inflicted pain. Unless high viral load guarenteed give high false negative rate.

2) Get money

3) Send home, let state deal fallout Football season kicks 10 weeks! wife's hospital implemented policy two workers eating breakroom together (the one place take masks off). asymptomatic nurse thought source several others floor positive.

That may well true national law, suggestion states, ever happen US. Trump GOP would push law Trump whole administration would need wearing public.

Yeah. that's never going happen America. produce meds work. lots reasons people sick winter. pretending one sole reason compare two disingenuous. agree, exceptionally hard untangle. worry even harder tendency towards simple solutions narrow-minded *mono-causality* problem media politics, also major problem even scientific community. problems, health science public policy, *inherently complex* areas hard reason inside old *Cartesian paradigm* science. virus isn‚Äôt taking time states going wide-open... 1/3 huge. 2/3 huger 90% certain spreading diseases count field employment. recommend head Tulsa Friday. little dose might bring reality perverse world views.  need better worker protections provided government.

Three days bed me. go back multiple decades find anything even close. Yeah soon Americans hear meth sell out. Especially florida it‚Äôs clear weeks outdoor transmission negligible, one wants say reason. 100% agreed. You‚Äôre much likely complications fall 22% personally would want take risk. However, want point large percentage 22% still experience complications infected, even higher risk. government paying people here. I‚Äôm playing Last Us too! Yeah like 2700 right? That's remember NYC days worst actual CCP CCP American media created? Going salon right worth risk, even wearing mask ask me. anti inflammatory meds same. Even class drugs different ones different methods working. Wear mask going church sing etc..Also church service outside. sucks cuz I'm Prednisone life. one health officials saying ""We going able stop spread, can‚Äôt stop living"" Get many possible coworkers wear masks. Yeah, Karens Karens. effect. 21 days since first large scale protest Minnesota showing extremely low case numbers. begun seeing spike 2 weeks ago especially (14 days 7th straight day large protests). problem, true. best hospital world would crumble without janitors unsung heroes like receptionists. precisely advocating.

It time 2016 realized [Trump talks acts exactly like imagine drag queen version mob boss would thought would matter time got gay version Frank Caliendo demonstrating Trump's tough guy fa√ßade actually sounds like. 

But Sarah so, good does. Per capita testing rates really comparable countries like Australia, New Zealand South Korea community transmission effectively suppressed. Check confirmed cases percentage total tests countries compared US:

Korea: 1% tests positive.

NZ: 0.4% tests positive. 

Australia: 0.4% tests positive.

US: 8.6% positive.

No point testing countries literally enough people symptoms. That's different situation from, say, UK, Sweden Netherlands, effectively gave keeping accurate record numbers.   death rate least alarming part. dont know everyone focused particular metric. 

America country largely incapable thinking outside binary terms, discourse dominated people terrified mortality. We've got kind cultural infantilization. see, thanks, confusion someone counter source?

One group never stopped working low paying jobs, risking getting coronavirus every day keep paycheck coming in.

The 2nd group sitting house last 3 months, nervously venturing grocery store times per month, groceries delivered.

Obviously never stopped working, around various people day long, used risking getting virus scared it. hiding house keep hiding over.

What fucking investments think us make 12.50 hour? creeping radar wisconsin. People get relaxed boom. 2nd wave. Probably something United states tons testing compared countries, course we're gonna confirmed cases. really keep politics (or particularly like Trump), incredibly obvious. shit Donny!!! Water wet. doesn‚Äôt even make sense. guy still followers?  mean, he's wrong also massive outbreak gain. lower numbers, better looks base. want know deal effectively giving political black eye. claiming virus present sufficient loads cause disease humans cease quit testing? literally logic sounds. Cases determined symptoms extent (they this).

How come conclusion based stop testing right now, we‚Äôd cases, any,‚Äù

It seems like making valid correlation something not. Wuhan open two month sweeping test still found 300 asymptomatic cases likely got infected long ago. There's still lot unknown virus. I'm saying fact tested negative border tested positive 15 days working theory. fear virus. bs come says testing bigger better anywhere else, false.  Ya common defense mechanisms action. addicts, defense mechanisms associated rationalizations and/or denial pronounced amplified. Also, less cultural acceptance hide behind, behavior quite visible. type defense mechanisms happening sure, many experiencing kind lean make seem normal. reenforces delusion.

It important realize normal human behavior. question people delusional, ever delusional? smart man, is! brimful covid the, 45 That‚Äôs it, I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs legally retarded. [Simpsons think *really* listen him, snippets good parts. Like un-Christian is, here's photo holding bible!

Lots folks consume one source news, that's Fox News. shit CNN gets, I'd imagine average viewer consumes sources well. post proof? data per capita. really trying say US worse India? US ~76k tests/1 mil population. India testing measly ~4.2k tests/1 mil population. Even Germany also testing notably less ~56k tests/1 mil population. countries you‚Äôve listed, one higher testing capabilities UK. UK also nearly twice many deaths/1 million population well.

The positive test rate isn‚Äôt indicative much unless entire population tested due fact tests US selectively distributed higher quantities hot-spots.  Trump secretly 7 months old? Goodbye object permanence.  meant OFFICIAL cases. 

Trump frustrated people keep saying : ""The US cases world"". Yes, official number higher done testing, far. stopped testing, official numbers would go down, like China's. buddy someone office get coronavirus got symptoms. went got labcorp test came back negative. Theres way he's negative means people showing hospital symptoms, geezus ppl. one pure dumb agree. cannot select context field day. article explain quote generally stupid. like: stop testing right now, would show cases . like NFL commentator saying: defensive ends tackle guy ball would've scored touchdown! kill everyone else, noone else war with.

Yeah shit Sherlock, that's we're calling president idiot. cares reported numbers opposed real, actual cases virus. wants stop testing numbers go down, actually make reality virus go away. wants votes less (reported) covid cases get there. 

I'd say headline quite generous considering clearly confused thinking president made actual good point somewhere. fuck president world largest economy? Well, one first cases country beginning March full shutdown March 16. businesses considered essential grocery stores, restaurants(takeout only), pharmacies and... banks maybe?. Non-essential medical procedures first open back beginning May. county county approach implemented middle May. consisted 3 phases, phase 1: 25 people gatherings, phase 2: 50 people gatherings Phase 3: 250 people gatherings. county prove hospital capacity, downward trend cases ability contact trace. 35/36 counties state least phase 1, rural counties phase 2. counties advance Phase 3 til least September.

Portland county(Multnomah) one still completely closed, seems definition little fuzzier right nonessential retail opening like thrift stores art supply shops.

Oregon well rural state, like Montana Wyoming, take Portland, big city compared Seattle Los Angeles. still counties Oregon single digit cases, example.

Cases shot up, Monday June 15 rural county church service infected 99 people. Thankfully, easy contact trace, means procedures implemented working.

Edit: 

It telling three Portland counties(Multnomah, Washington, Clackamas) #7, #10, #14 list. lucky urban outbreak here. top two counties aforementioned church fish processing plant Lincoln county. Lol what? looked absolutely testing per capita country. food industry, chain restaurants even worst fast food, notoriously bad really giving damn sick, want shifts covered. Restaurants Canada beginning pandemic released guidelines ""when keep employees home"" basically jaundice perfectly able work long access tissues soap -_-

I've industry entire life worked 7 hellish years McDonalds somehow tell shit real. physically go prove shingles one day get measly week fucking manager.I ended bed ridden month.

Do.Not.Go.To.Fast.Foods.Period. I‚Äôm sure. Alabama Trumpland, Cali isn‚Äôt they‚Äôre also seeing resurgence. Arizona isn‚Äôt exactly Trumpistan, slope turning vertical. 

What states become unbearable outside? People staying A/C spreading shit. March April typically pretty nice outside states, June August. 

I don‚Äôt know. speculating. fucking stupid. amazingly shockingly stupid OH, THAT'S works.


(/s) edited transcript in, thanks. QUICK, CHANGE CHANNEL! ""It's like per capita relative what?""

He literally understand concept per capita, makes statements like this. live America 18, excuse vote, right complain vote. That‚Äôs reality works normal circumstances someone gets closer 1 meter better know well enough I'd want hug them, I'm hugger. That's 3 feet inches. damn close stranger. confused all. Never said (1). Still asking (2) problem, answer. makez less likely seek medical care ailments inflicting upon themselves, resources go people actually listen medical advice. Doctors arent hurting them, hurting themselves. less 20% normal capacity, enough keep social distancing groups household. also means keep distancing, like one-way alleys.
If everyone wear face masks, distance outdoor, may significant risk.

I know epidemiological trends Tennessee now, sure situation getting control event hope would step back cancel run without fans.

At point, can't keep everything closed years, risk analysis event reopening decision, depending social distancing maintained, transmission trend area. also depend attendees locals multiples states.

I hope decision based facts, political economic. What's point? honestly missed it. Well yeah shit Corona time People china lot trusting authority follow directions society less individualistic way fewer crazies. Anti Vax thing china example clearly want everyone thinking masks going keep safe wanted us stay home instead. time may known infectious was, want people get false sense security masks alone enough. miscalculation psychology anything. decision approach things way overestimated number people would agree stay home.

Seeing number people refuse wear masks people know wear right, kind understand wanting people assume masks would keep safe, hindsight spelled way. clear trying save medical grade masks medical purposes. Californian - seem like California anywhere near seceding union. mean, seems silly even type out. live San Francisco. husband flew American Airlines didn‚Äôt say word didn‚Äôt mask. Also entire flight full. lip service.

Edit: say it‚Äôs lip service AA. understand Southwest better job keeping people distanced selling flights. clear, California would need make worse unemployment right now. 

$1950 regular unemployment, $2400 supplemental. 

If opportunity get $52,212 year without working, would looking new job. I'm shocked. surprised. cant believe thing happened. Fox News presents carefully scripted, carefully edited versions him. rarely display unfiltered, do, got 30 minute rant nonsense.

This means followers hear truly batshit stuff straight horse's mouth, dismiss real. already knew covered insurance, insurance company going say need hip surgery, paying service.

Insurance companies regularly deny coverage necessary medical expenses, saying exactly much, need X treatment cover it.
 hand, universal health care board going evaluate case might decide life expectancy 5 years, would waste resources give new hip.

Can cite examples universal health care board actually this? sounds like nothing political new cancer research expensive, worth odds survival 1%.

""New cancer research"" insanely high fatality rates, again, insurance companies regularly deny coverage cancer treatments, established reason people generally public healthcare. Well anything run US typically mismanaged anyway.

If stop voting people whose goal mismanage loot US, dismantle public healthcare ignorance, things stop mismanaged quickly. stop supporting people afraid accountability. Dude truck drivers make good money. totally see Odell ""I stared solar eclipse told to"" Beckham wearing mask goes necessities social distancing otherwise. I'm mad people unemployment. bringing fair amount money. need stop corporate theft increase wages. education! students failing schools! potus think test coronavirus result fewer cases? 40% **bare minimum.** Aha... object permanence! think sooner! simple... could STUPID?! suffering dying, everyone imagining it, hoax.

Don't worry go away April like miracle. guess really comes think important. 

There valid arguments both...sad thing I‚Äôve seen lot silent white closet racists get ally claiming ‚ÄúI‚Äôm protesting Covid-19‚Äù. 

Don‚Äôt get wrong, that‚Äôs fair reason. I‚Äôve seen wrong people use wrong reason. least thread, seem trying. controversial sort. much anything. Closest gets couple people going ""If look, can't find anything,"" read people thinking they're funny. Oooh! get examples?? build contact tracing way know location:   fear initial low numbers combined fairly successful (while place) shutdown lulled AZ false sense security. news outlets screaming Armageddon yet weren‚Äôt really impacted here. still don‚Äôt know anyone personally AZ tested positive. 

People convinced overblown. Maybe degree, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre gonna like NY (not dense population, less reliance public transportation). concerned decently long list susceptible people know may die summer/fall get infected. comment makes zero sense.. nice Goddamn right shitty thing say. student mine lost uncle cousin disease. partner three relatives can't talk painful.

Just see little bubble mean affecting thousands people. Read post. state max $275.    shove heads asses indeed dark. stop tracking spending, we‚Äôd little debt, any. condescending fucking attitude? 

You‚Äôre fucking dick. wanna make point make it. You‚Äôre smarter everyone think understand something. 

Furthermore, shit attitude even know something nobody would ever listen you‚Äôre talking them. Dear Lord. never learned object permanence. threaten? Make policy! think jobs propped government they‚Äôre providing critical need otherwise can‚Äôt fulfill. 

The notion artificially increasing pay extremely misguided. Without welfare minimum wage could leverage unemployment benefits put pressure markets resources force changes exploitative business models. Business models like paying grocery workers $9/hr servers $2/hr get help government policies resultant culture.

The wealth transfer happens send bare minimum down. Honestly, like sort crazy scientific experiment going now. match power absolute stupidity observe actions results come two combinations.

I surprised shocked jammed crayon nose point thinking good idea. work grocery store Canada, there's really nothing pay. can't quit, im eligible CERB CESB. can't demand money, fire us hire someone lost job pandemic. cancelled hazard pay last week, there's nothing anybody it. Yeah definitely bot looking r/test history hope get 4 years Gaslighting.

It's thing POTUS dementia stroke. confronted $[insert astronomical number] bill... can't say specifically since work district, call check web site. may COVID page info, file complaint that's comes to.

Our district start mid-August, general consensus nobody going know anything sure late July earliest. lot frustration sides, sympathies! know help say month district may complete turnaround. Enrolling online school might good idea gives peace mind. Check guidelines make sure kids go back regular classroom need later year. I've realized company actually worth time 

They'll let go earliest convenience employees understand fucked getting hungry children die, they‚Äôre longer hungry upvoted Facts doomers Well tend better educated. alone leads things. should, eliminating food beverage service flights well? dont see stance passengers wear masks also providing things require almost every single passenger removing mask time flight. Yes... employees get ripped employers. Roll tide. swear people forgot covid reopened business here.  wut?  maybe. nobody prove alive physically ""exist"" thing that‚Äôs certain matter dumb utterance, fan base goes wild. love DNC sure Hillary going win Trump right night election, based ""polls"", yet 50% primary votes, abandon Bernie force Biden upon us, based ""polls"".  truly want represent people, they'd let us vote primary. But, post Citizens United world, need worry donors, mostly corporate, support Biden. poorly controlled outbreak feckless moron power.

That's hardly fair, we've got fuckton morons throughout country helping along. 

I meeting today plan around doctors appointments nursing home residents offices refusing mask glove visits. 

And governor recommended nursing homes go ahead open visitation even cases state steadily climb. 

We're nation morons, led one. thought two new cases given special exemption attend funeral New Zealand, 1News reports.""

So may placed isolation facilities. Ah, old head sand trick. Doctors hate this! Oh think it‚Äôs retarded We're testing per capita countries. Quit bullshit. Technically correct.. Suuuure One could argue current pay is:

(what need get by) + (please stay home, seriously, look work) + (could maybe also spend bit too, otherwise whole economy goes shit)

It's government saying, ""it's valuable us disease spread job"".

Take will. say that, reddit consistently used inflated case count *which inflated due rigorous testing* pretend we're behind curve compared rest world.  
 
It's like acknowledging substance claim without addressing dishonest comparisons leveled since start thing. 
 
It's like *I want X, want mad* meme except unironically expressing sentiment. really report guy responded you? find hard believe comment responding removed within five mins posted one it. Plus low enough comment chain unlikely someone skipped previous comments spontaneously reported one responding political. 


So much 'muh feelings' lol  base knows this. trolling libs remember

don't pay attention it, use energy elsewhere. Downvote because: A) post contributes nothing conversation, B) flat wrong. Best luck. Repeating stupid trump quote make look smart, makes look like fucking moron. stop testing right now, we'd cases, any,"" president said Monday event seniors White House.

Can dispute this? Please quote context think relevant. like floodgates weak spot. 1.4% protesters turn positive actually low amount spread state started 0.06% population active infection. Classic GOP! yet, are. Yes free die.

... Sorry, I'm tired hearing ""what actually meant was"" every time Donny opens mouth reminds us much idiot is. business mentality work here. CEOs/businessmen care affects bottom line anything achieve numbers. Also notice much would brag we're best economy world ever seen? Yeah, U.S. wealthy, people not. data based five scenarios, including best estimate mortality rate, 0.4% overall. That‚Äôs double flu mortality rate 0.2%, according 2017 data CDC‚Äôs mean he's wrong. count unemployed people, unemployment stop increasing. Good news guys, fixed jobs.

One definite thing learned pandemic IMHE terribly statistics, one job pretty stupid trust billionaire going looking best interests sooo really doesn‚Äôt get it, he? I'm normally ""WTF POTUS!?"" bandwagon, clearly taken context clicks/views.

I believe clear POTUS meant *""If US stopped testing, show many cases official count.""* rather *""If US stopped testing, cases exist.""*

As shown another quote article:
*""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!"" Trump tweeted.*

Not agree conclusion cases increasing testing is, US testing countries. believe US's increased case count combination tests overall cases population.

While believe US likely absolutely stuffed COVID, article/post misleading inflammatory garbage imo. post removed political one replied ok? fuck work? watch actual video article, headline misleading. US serious trying manage (doesn't seem like it), would identify many cases possible tell stay home set time would help reduce infections. would allow people return normal faster. Hmm start fact I'm trained EMT volunteers elderly specifically mentioned less perfect grades I'm self aware enough know I'm perfect?

Also, I'm tradesman, yeah grabbed last bag N95s could complete drywall job working time. Well state aid, choked cancer paycheck name good fight?

* mom calls spheres. Women ovaries. ya go! yeah tell ""It takes courage compassion wear mask. one lacking?"" Wow fucking subreddit supposed informative, instead you‚Äôre using quote context roast trump like even takes effort. Y‚Äôall fucking pathetic sheep I‚Äôm gonna die laughter trump gets second term. really hate people spread misinformation like this. It‚Äôs fucking pathetic real Schr√∂dingers taxes Hope I‚Äôve hoping recent studies this. study 2012 I‚Äôd really like current results. don‚Äôt expect results drastically different. Lol

We're stupid species general government, although understand cases like film crew avatar movie paid company bringing staff....there number exceptions NZ citizens residents allowed enter lot context this, similar every 'crazy wacky' thing trump said past months.

the statement accurate true, people outraged probably watched clip, would see noteworthy

pitiful pedantic people try scrape little thing mad about, defense said subject met 'lol trump dumb, dumb too' response truly darkest timeline. man human equivalent toddler trying stuff square block circle hole. OP interesting post history. 2 month old reddit account, 170K+ karma. Something around 50 posts r/Cornavirus last 24 hours. everyday before. 

If less trusting person, might think OP worked organization/country dedicated spamming Reddit platforms type content seen post. wonder - oh, let's say country - would strong interest Reddit sub call r/Coronavirus? Hmmm. Basically Self sacrifice Orange one. People need stop questioning reality realize he's saying. 

When Trump said covid would 'wash US', absolutely sounded like dog whistle ethnic cleansing. video saying anywhere? tellin theres chance! dude even real? fewer cases want people tested, account deaths sure follow? simply multiply COVID-19 related deaths multiple see many infections are, can. However, shit stop spread! WTH really wrong person? world 45% vote get duped voting him?

He definition stumble bum incompetent. deeply devious wicked one that. r/technicallythetruth God, people easily fall Trump moving goalposts?

1) think USA highest per capita testing?

2) think USA effective containment world? think top 20? defend POTUS statement don't?

3) POTUS seems less informed topic I, simple software eng Ky. review graph, POTUS access FAR more, easily see trend June mimics March far May June. clearly due reopening Trump dodging acknowledging truth, cause people die.

Graph:
Look new daily cases - Yes. fact cult talking say ""you'd complain even trump cured cancer."" screening = cancer. Modern problems require modern solutions! Well, none, course: virus hoax, remember? /s Cool we're never opening border Canada cool cool cool stay plague rats need one that? Come on, think it. Obviously tests positives. Although US's refusal lot places actually wear masks probably help. Pfft come America surely better that, noob numbers.  testing garbage anyway. Might well stop testing. It‚Äôs game point. 

Had employee came contact someone COVID-19 confirmed Thursday last. Employee notified Saturday last. got tested last Monday. Test results didn‚Äôt come back Sunday. 10 days date exposure test results. Test results negative really knows. 

This someone health insurance. Getting tested point procedure FFCRA paperwork. Yes. food service industry full abuse exploitation.

This another fucking reason reopening fucking stupid. testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!"" Trump tweeted.

He's talking numbers look worse due testing availability. enough tests, numbers would look better. 

It's true. job bring people justice yet time time can't even that. beat kill people feel threatened meanwhile threaten brutalize people impunity. Except want talk per-capita we're 7th testing. Can't really use excuse numbers. Deaths starting rise places like Texas, Florida, California. seeing increases number cases well. Cases starting spike states well. China hiding data.

They still are.  Lung transplants obese people? joking ask this, hospital/region? Yes, eliminated nearly food/bev service. flew 2wks ago delta hand zipped packet cookies/crackers, bottled water, purell wipe.


This 4hr flt. making like $21 hour. fuck Walmart going afford lol.

Be mad Billionaires? many trillions 3 month stimulus again?  Technically truth??? husband donates vitalant went Wednesday. Checked portal yesterday results already in- negative (which expected), cool they‚Äôre that. Bumpity bump, thank you. 

Why oh always many stupid people itching believe least generous interpretations cherry picked headlines without teaspoon critical thought.

If one time thing would care less, almost every r/news post trump days. reactionary mob mentality bad bad good thing. hate makes feel like barely reasonable people online anymore.

Trump idiot bad dude terrible policies enough. reality time efforts office discussed thoroughly honestly. enough reveal idiocy incompetency. Shitty leading headlines don‚Äôt reasonable people favors. reasonable person call see them. satire ... right? ? supporter, I'd consider comment like insult intelligence. Luckily none problem. sounds right Wow. I‚Äôm sad see vicious horrible pro-lockdown community become.  ICU doctor Colorado. drugs you‚Äôre talking mostly undergoing clinical trials given certain individuals meet criteria study. patients mainly hospitalized ICU level individuals, it‚Äôs given Joe positive test cough, without admission criteria. patients sent home quarantine orders reason admit. patients admitted regular hospital beds require level support - always supplemental oxygen. 

You get certain treatments even don‚Äôt qualify study FDA exemption, however, you‚Äôd relatively sick doctor recommend it, especially consider remdesivir still unproven costs thousands dollars. 

There likely nuance friend told you‚Äôre getting full story.   Oh.....I get it....just like gain weight step scale. scales....stay slim! Holy fuck love righteous indignation idiot. 

People like baited Trump hilarious. Dude fucking president USA reacting second wave COVID19 saying ""well hurr durr yeah we're testing more""

like god damn really hard POTUS informed software engineer KY (me)?

Here's graph btw, straight cdc. Look New Cases new cases day June. 
Then look trend graph March. notice March climb first wave, steadily trended lockdown got serious spikes down, trending down.

Well KNOW, open back trending right back fucking up.

And POTUS claiming simply due testing? 
And people like yourself, uneducated math least purposefully ignorant freely available stats, gall call others idiots? 

Go chew dirt. never begin with. could state specific file. could ask local sub, r/povertyfinance, could probably help what's amazing loyal fanbase - regular people - ones hurt many GOP policies, dont see it. ultimate con. stop using eyes, we'll never see another murder! /u/ninjacereal coronavirus

Doesn't matter true not. say Fuck he's stupid... Taken bleach, works even better. Puts IFR 0.73% people acting like understand concept? one sentence, context, used imply numbers testing up. people get fixated one line like this, makes supporters think WE'RE stupid getting overall concept. Meanwhile, plenty ridiculous stuff upset about, like claim tests somehow ""bigger better"" that's numbers vs countries. false. Pretending he's stupid object permance takes away reality malicious, willful, dangerous liar. Jokes comment political lol silly, says means (which course know core demographic)

it's position

it's really position stands for

it's says stands represents

don't look represents, look does! rich enough join club.

Yeah give tax breaks that's lot people fine forgetting mean technically isn‚Äôt wrong Since apparently know dose virus necessary become infected, say anything distance necessary?  Clearly two meters better one, Three might better yet. 

I would happy someone link something scientific says kind exposure necessary infected. Yeah Pence bad hed able evil shit competently !remind 365 days Saw headline double take make sure wasn‚Äôt reading nottheonion. got take-out Chinese food past weekend, something done couple months.

The Chinese restaurant really like near house closed weeks. got saw why. closed counter floor ceiling plexiglass, installed filtered air in/out kitchen roof, give receipts small double-door (to prevent air leakage), signed receipts go bin another small door.

There large double-door mechanism get food air leak kitchen, kitchen positive-pressure.

I've never seen anything like before, I'm impressed.  also remove post I'm replying to, explicitly singularly bringing politics (hence political replies bot Meanwhile, Repubs maintained 90% APPROVAL DONALD entire Repub approval spiked started locking innocent children cages.   ""there's place like home""

(click click) /r/technicallythetruth thousands mysterious deaths nothing Coronavirus wore mine empty elevator. Oh well lol rather current president? Almost $50k year added $600 state. Since shit hit fan I've able barely scrape by, means make much get anything unemployment. would paid anyways. still can't get ahold them. one claim due payment March. Last week canceled saying date filling falls within ""unpaid waiting period."" Fuck faces. problem enough sick people see people injected vaccine got infected exported test Brazil, since case going Well consider Schrodinger's cat thought experiment perhaps... 

/s Trump stops talking, actually look like sane country.  That's related everyone jeering about, aware of. Whether say defensible not, Trump say test people get sick. L FUCKING L, fucking idiot chief, worst timeline sure Similar thing 99 positive cases far, 300-something tested. tied church opened back 2 weeks ago. causes people react like you, i'd say benefit. I‚Äôll bite I‚Äôm confused point. I‚Äôll paraphrasing. 

Someone talking Trump ‚ÄúAmerica confirmed cases X country.‚Äù 

Trump says ‚ÄúYeah, testing‚Äù aka ‚Äúno shit, tested like China wouldn‚Äôt confirmed cases.‚Äù 

But obviously taken context. 

From understanding people comments understanding Trumps point, either choice ignorance. r/TechnicallyTheTruth  Well yea, incorrect but... 

well... prob! allowed go tell everyone Elliot lied him? think that's works.  Unfortunately non NZ citizen aware countries policies that's good move part Maybe people still can't afford health insurance, many lost coverage job. country set handle pandemic, compensate population time quarantine. such, country suffered massive blow first wave. guess second wave bad, worse stop testing entirely. We've already done bare minimum best. 

In conclusion, many Americans can't go hospital want to. simply can't afford it. dunno, really sounds like coin toss. municipal government said tested 8,000 vendors, purchasing managing staff market. also traced nearly 200,000 people visited market since May 30.

Because 10 million vendors, purchasing managing staff market? Yes amazing universal healthcare system. We‚Äôve 7,000 coronavirus cases 102 deaths (population 25 million). done extremely well here. fucking joking right? super ignorant?

SARS caught stopped FAAAAAAAR earlier along Covid.

Covid doesnt **chance** stopped point without vaccine. **way** late stopped. Vietnam 0 deaths/ 0 deaths per million one strictest lockdowns world sheer necessity.

Seems paid off, though it?

Given they're ... know, anymore? Still same. trying look real method? Yes, I'm Michigan hopeful worried things may rise quickly almost everything open again. Also feels like Detroit suburbs similar situation Manhattan/Hamptons crowds New York, may look like beat numbers, lot people get hit close enough proceeding without enough caution now. want COVID-19 political already is. fuck's sake, MASKS things considered political statement they're sort symbol oppression, even though masks proven reduce spread COVID-19. strategy idiot cheerleader Bolsonaro using Brazil: test, count, new cases! That's type unwavering dedication expect McDonald's worker. Great news! Lol Donny Two Scoops PA bullshit governor wil cry excuse. truth make shift hospitals set thta never touched, lie NY. reason send patients back nursing homes. enough available space. thoughts too. Everyone did. 

Well mouth breathers wanted haircut get sick early opened bar. assumes deaths stable. see increase cases happening south? result deaths weeks months.

Then fall comes probably another wave infections North. 

It totally possible. expand volcano lairs? Yeah, think that‚Äôs real issue though. mean, there‚Äôs hundreds hundreds thousands individuals might reason sue him, definitely leverage images Biden wins. shows getting decent wages reagan relgious right happy thought gay disease wanted god's wrath wipe sin gay. mean  I'll gladly give life others privacy government officials.

Idk man, remember got upset one staffers tested negative got positive test? thought proof tests don‚Äôt work? didn‚Äôt detect virus got it? seems pretty brand really. yeah, clearly dangerous covid-19 spread serving quiet people dinner restaurant coffee coffee shop. raging hypocrisy public health experts leaves breathless. say someone thinks take virus seriously.  Yeah, huge hassle us Canadians Americans want travel Canada (see family, summer visit) fight president wants reopen. essential travel US risk Canadians nearly clear going US keeps us confined longer. Everyone one sided can't ever admit ""other party"" something right they'll always make things sound 10x worse really n

Ever. told whole truth passed law making sale n95s public illegal. fucked one royally. Link 99.6% statistic? Real heroes wear capes! Kinda like want get cancer. never get tested cancer way.

Almost like Last Ship... don‚Äôt watch current situation tough ya lol  Alternative headline: ""President accidentally makes factual statement"" Reeeeeeeaaaaaaallllliiiiitttyyy That's point. addressing concerns people freaking rising cases. matter perspective. way suggest stop working it. Lol. expect transparency Dutch. always putting articles good news flair pump collective ego. think governments lackluster pathetic coronavirus response. see folks countries that. ought know mentality chose horrible country education. Can't wait leave! many rational people saying since began, outdoor spread minimal. Minnesota's cases dropping, streets almost 3 weeks. SF 30k person protest 12 days ago seen rise cases. NYC massive protest numbers still dropping.

By time lot transmission occurring events would started see it. don‚Äôt wear glasses totally feel heat breath coming top mask mask fairly molded nose wire. balaclava top sounds like good idea too. Proof trickle economics bullshit 12k one month maybe, three months since shut down. said, I‚Äôm favor UBI attached employment. We‚Äôve clearly seen tying employment income levels disincentivizes work. Lmao ignore it, itll go away guys US population, mind you. wildly unpopular nearly anywhere else. people actually believe trump campaign would advertise craigslist.. lol idiot actually thinks tests cause virus. Let sink in. disinfo limited Russians Societally crippled disinformation stop opening mail, I'll little bills, any. I‚Äôm LOA care dad. signed unemployment 7 weeks ago.

I hope deaths low, nobody wants see reality number. Good luck student teaching! hope goes well you! Yeah, ignore troll. u/1Drumcode another garbage user around causing trouble. tell private company trust private data, like Facebook.

And dosnt work, dont ask, they're already tracked dont seem mind long dont tell genius! Dare say, stable genius! new Dark Ages mankind. leader said nonsense got away it. Stupidity accepted. allowed give medical advice. holy crap CDC keeps digging hole themselves. Anyone working hospital considered hero current period utter madness mention odd decrease many illnesses last 4 months. percent two deviation expected, cases seeing 10-15% unexplained drops. data expected released first week July. see much coverage gets. mean... he's technically correct. big brain shit. Please welcome ""I Want Haircut"" Choir sing new single, ""I Wear Mask, Get Peanuts"" key Flat Moron. Spit outside. lot easier spit 3 feet face height vs 6 feet. science come Poland government draw pretty much ""conclusion"". test, drop cases, government saved day! missed point statement. heard MANY TIMES! Seriously... voted guy?

I'm sorry what? Japan going herd immunity afaik couple places close (NYC Lombardy, Italy). High number would unexpected ""good"" Japan's strategy suppression.

Edit: nevermind, see talking IFR. then.... Come hill, finish quote I'm yoga instructor. one loyal HEALTHY students (she may one healthiest people know) get COVID. said horrible wish anybody. Sure, recovered, took like month said felt like death weeks. douche, dude. There's guarantee severity people get. care getting sick, fine. But, wear mask give people who, regardless health, want (or can't afford be) sick. decent human (you even great one, decent one). I'd like see say protest/riots. Can't stand double standards. Arizona literally 8 deaths yesterday, total nonsense. Also, even compare Georgia Arizona? They‚Äôre completely different states, GA‚Äôs pop. density almost 3x AZ‚Äôs begin with. Yes, getting cheeseburger fighting right murdered. shit get upvoted? Fauci went 60 minutes said masks would encourage face touching would worsen spread. Never said study makes law. I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre bit ridiculous discredit entire study want nitpick professor *psychology* defines human emotion. definitely knows subject do. answered question. low skilled job. People shit expect people they're directing passive it.

I passive person nature I've said I'll say again, someone pulls ""coughing people wearing masks"" crap me, they're getting swung on. they're going assault deadly virus, make sure self defense hurts more. point comment testing country counts look worse country. numbers would obviously sink stopped testing much.

I never said this. different user quoting. deleted reply comment feel like informative. could permalink comment happened see mean

And discussing sensationalist headlines? What's point? ""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!"" Trump tweeted.

THAT presented ‚ÄúTrump said test less less people would disease.‚Äù context need literally next sentence, would involve reading headline. stopped paying bills would few, all.... oh wait thats works. thing virus. don‚Äôt look bills go away?  read Jeremy Clarkson's voice reason. *""Brruuilliant""*  Even money Biden pardoning everything ""to put behind us quickly possible."" Maybe state AGs keep him, stall he's dead. never face music. Based three studies, doesn‚Äôt site source me. don‚Äôt represent me. Might bad place right üòÇ... fucked Considering it‚Äôs written Professor Psychology Whitman College, think would position say agreeableness kindness related. You‚Äôre really challenging study written reviewed multiple PhDs personal opinion defines ‚Äúagreeable‚Äù? speak well I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs false say US best testing world 

The US done 25 million tests, testing world far. compare per capita, US top, better countries. idea tests better worse quality countries though. [adding top-level comment, apologies see twice]

It's like boiling frog. People become numb numbers. affects people personally think they'll understand severity. 90 days still going without mask gloves, I'm pickups stores.

Americans thinking like wish thing away. hate isolated too. I've go different medications cope it. God damn I'm dumb try pretend reality exist. First 2 weeks January pressing China right things Tedros visited Beijing totally co-opted. 

Like Sepp Blatter, knows corrupt back room dealing. He‚Äôs wrong know.. What? one said everyone understands it? I'm using words. literally know talking about, you? using words guide around broken logic. Welcome 2020 version reddits. already better. Loads places opened nothing note happened. Europe category. Remember state Supreme Court opened Wisconsin one day, everyone ran get drunk local bar sub collective hissy fit? month ago yesterday. famous election everyone thought would end state know month that. Today 174 new cases 2 deaths. That's it. still nothing much going Georgia. Missouri. much complex ""stay home = good; go = weak bad."" de fund police... Less cops= less crime ? California. Especially Bay Area. make $18 hour poor sin. clear evidence frozen fish human transmission one anything it. Sounds familiar? Wisconsin well. Headline says

and fuck working headline? almost sound proud it, lmfao

Read goddamn article hopefully feel shame embarrassment Yes. test. 
Then sit back watch people die ""strange pneumonia"" symptoms, Covid-19. people actually see him? beyond me. could anyone think worthy politician? Quite big brain donny Uhhh makes look bad incompetent bungled response. Given criteria laid out, would consider appropriate country compare to? ""They"" drop guard.... protests happened ""America"" forgot pandemic.  

We pay stupidity divided nation. Nope

This sub full propaganda now. Holy shit it. Trump found solution every problem world: ignore it! 

/s  free country that, mean, free promoted respective levels incompetence No! say that?! way! didn't? Right? Lol No, take care eat right avoid diabetes. wet market. Yeah crazy talk, *it 2020*. Hell even autonomous zone Seattle. father lawyer friend (one intellectually brilliant people I‚Äôve ever met) 1000% trump cannot life understand someone ignorant. 

I get voted guy, whatever, point stop go hey mistake?? Seriously it‚Äôs like admitting mistake fault making u-turn would shatter egos. 

Unbelievable blind people are. nice love retail might need figure policies, procedures security inevitable combo entitled/surly whiners think wearing mask political, probably per flight typical unruly passenger. Well kind scares me, yesterday felt like couldn‚Äôt inhale well normal, didn‚Äôt even think covid can't fucking stand dude, check history. 

I agree headline shit, could phrased better. stopped prosecuting, crime rate would drop dramatically. reports [pangolins sold wholesale market](http://www.chuannane.com/shiyao/20170215/7029.html). Seriously. people making sound like end world willing give anything prevent one death. Many people given lives protect civil liberties sub would throw away say saved lives COVID. one way try reduce cases. don‚Äôt understand sub Shut fuck up, bagged salad! can‚Äôt wish away war. There‚Äôs much money made that. ever learn round fucking number

i swear trolls getting shittier shittier  shit works test more, cases. *DID REED ARTIKLE*


/s would guess people would be/were hoarding masks regardless CDC/government advice. Either way CDC can't throwing away credibility--at start fucking pandemic less--based complete guess reaction advice. thought calling trump bagged salad, new favorite insult. Exactly! Everyone says Trump symptom disease getting rid fix underlying problem. 

So, evidence seems prove Fox News primary disease spreader.

The depressing thing appear way stop Fox News' malicious anti-American lies without infringing 1st amendment. Yes. story. paper published 1998, partially retracted 2004 fully retracted 2010. tip-off might problem investigative reporting exposed financial conflicts interest Wakefield, paper's author. led digging. sort 'scientific fraud money' common USA, lesser extent China, certainly occurs elsewhere - UK case. India proliferation 'predatory journals' another example. 

Here one frauds. note overwhelming prevalence ""(US)"" note names fraudsters Biomedical Sciences section. 2018 'Science Magazine' link database 18,000 instances. [Retraction website project involved. facts noted here. first retractions involve deliberate fraud, even disturbingly large number do. Plagiarism big item. Another rate 4 papers 10,000 (0.004%), rate remained steady since 2012. third thing researcher may live another country source funding often traceable USA. 

This article Science interesting informative. doubt single high quality journal whole world met demon least once. article support contention India large source fraudulent science. would argue country large number truly junk science journals examined projects therefore listed surveys this. That‚Äôs thing. people support don‚Äôt require intelligence. require audacity, trolling, zingers. discover pay attention responses Twitter etc. stoked he‚Äôs troll. that‚Äôs need. people organizing protests aren‚Äôt ones supposed leading country pandemic. mean, once, he‚Äôs neither lying factually incorrect. That‚Äôs something, right?  harvard‚Äôs finest in: rich give fuck you. certainly power make schedule look replacements sick workers. Unsure you‚Äôre trying say. r/technicallythetruth Wow, corrected spelling mistake, must think you‚Äôre high mighty now! bet lick balls! shocker! I'm sure social people go bonkers quarantine isolate pre communications era. Cannot imagine 1918. stop eating, there‚Äôll starvation anywhere... sure one. looting organized people didn‚Äôt see ‚Äúriots.‚Äù I‚Äôve seen thousands peaceful protesters. im talking werent tests, read correctly stop looking student loan balance, don‚Äôt owe government shit Except means all. article states last 7 Mondays. yeah, title could worded better.  relative volunteers help train dogs seizure detection. raise puppies first year. level training participates ""get well behaved enough stand chance entering training program"". raised 3 1 failed out, overall like 25% make program fraction succeed becoming professional dogs.

So ugh... yeah. Training dogs also hampered lack materials (capable dogs) technology (humans able train dogs). taken context. actually said following: ‚ÄúOur testing biggest best, shows cases. stop testing, would none. Testing double edged sword. Makes us look bad, good have.‚Äù something like that. Still, definitely taken context. Title completely context. said saying that‚Äôs increased testing good shows results. shit everywhere. I'd feel reasonably safe go shopping spending money community mask usage actually enforced adhered to. happening around anymore, fuck them. 

Good luck kickstarting broken economy large portion consumers still afraid participate. won't. ' cut risk death third patients ventilators. ' 


From article. GA next time go eat take good look count long people washing hands. often wash change gloves taking cash, handling it. I‚Äôve seen take persons money give change back. gloves hours end without changing them. Also majority workers still super close one another screened start shift. one negative confirmed test covid. saw yesterday employee splash water hands put pair gloves customer told wanted use fresh pair gloves food. Dang another person got mad upvotes saying skmething similar. 

Its fine feel bad someone disagree with. 

If trumps family died coronavirus id feel bad him. I'd hope he'd resign rake time himself, I'd still feel really bad. 

We sre human deaths cancel out. add up. worry used lieu comprehensive screening safety procedures. Colleges trying justify charging outrageous tuition, that's motivation. They'll likely revise protocol keep classes person second wave lockdowns. Saying they'll go online later semester set expectations prevent lawsuits. Yeah.. people forget drugs give ventilator destroy brain. coma inducing drugs, course, brain designed drug induced coma 2 months.

People develop mental illness type thing, normally unable function long time (if ever) again.

Makes wonder people right thing. Imagine he‚Äôs feeling right now, wouldn‚Äôt like torture ? Maybe noble death peacefully dying sleep battle would right thing do? 

It‚Äôs difficult topic. personally would know situations. I‚Äôm sure getting chicken nuggets, highly suggest try different restaurant. Lol. Take lesson kids. read headlines form dumbass opinions like guy.


Read articles everyone US catches would 16-33 milion deaths 0.5-1% .. looks like COULD happen Slamming ""the US"" areas made right choices, put work, seeing good results brainless. 

If want condemn everyone shares landmass bad policies big outbreaks want know planet without issue. Well, that‚Äôs Fox you. giant hoax evidence became clear actually wasn‚Äôt.

Can‚Äôt wait Trump call fake news Yes right, hospitalizations also up. That‚Äôs good. Texas also isn‚Äôt state hospitalization increases.  really seems like numbers made palatable
public consumption, like underestimates downright illogical. Reddit special tool state sponsored propaganda. 15 cases soon zero. Yes, include outbreak NYC, huge controlled. separate area, increasing. Rapidly. at? US would hard pressed find population 1/3 preexisting condition. people. Omar. think people whose lives Koch made worse deserve it. got point here, countries, like Norway Finland, look like they've handled situation well, really think have, there's currently clear data tell us *why.* data suggests infection rate *can fact decrease* without strict lockdown, Sweden one example, countries also seen decrease infections implementing lockdowns easing restrictions.

What suggests can't *just assume* lockdowns responsible success countries done well, neither assume played *no* part. 

I really hope we're able learn form scientific studies come aftermath pandemic, actual efficacy lockdowns, also public health status, organisation elderly care, health policy plays role. 

My guess, would put money pandemic cost far, including cost closing schools businesses, travel restrictions costs economic recession, preventative healthcare research current epidemic cluster health issues commonly referred *'The Metabolic Syndrome'*, single largest underlying risk factor among die COVID-19, could prevented deaths we're currently seeing, along many tragic deaths associated Metabolic Syndrome, case Sweden around 50k annually look statistics *Socialstyrelsen*.  cheap long, probably. Stonks always go link neither protests.

I care fact-driven decisions, fears person expert. already know protests major superspreading event, Ill give people another week let settle brain.

This largest dataset possible may showiny us outdoor rules bigtime overkill. head mild cases damage caused?

They said article doesn‚Äôt. makes sense, it‚Äôs immune suppressant. It‚Äôll helpful patients get point activated immune response. hot page r/all Fatality Rate Age Bracket:

0-17: 0.06%

18-44: 3.9%

45-64: 22.4%

65-74: 24.9%

75+: 48.7%

Even personally die, caring taking responsibility stop contracting spreading disease means responsible anybody dies you. it‚Äôs much bigger picture ‚Äò99% people won‚Äôt die‚Äô (which already false), don‚Äôt really need take personal responsibility. Unemployment benefits run July. YOY retail sales miserable. terrible person? annoying. feel like French goose stuffed American bullshit politics throat daily basis. mentally exhausted point. South Korea something similar, too! Idk, death immolation seems lot scarier think happened? capable providing evidence? comment nothing supposed trust future? guy admitted lied effectiveness masks? listen anything says? 15% would reall surprise me, would thought would least double that. Well, Chinese citizens allowed enter China Atm Wow wow. really hope you‚Äôre trolling cause point you‚Äôre making brain dead levels retardation

Now go ahead say ‚Äúif brain dead couldn‚Äôt make argument given I‚Äôd brain dead unable argue‚Äù making none point adding nothing stupidly conversation lmao

Jesus you‚Äôre dumb fuck donate every 8 weeks time! Thanks knowledge bro frustrating. work industry seems attract people ""I'll want"" mentality. wear mask gloves matter cant get customer save life. Worse love tell ridiculous ask maintain social distancing. Even something simple using drop box payment installed mmy desk met anger straight refusal. taken many steps keep work place safe people give damn best actively belittle worst. course would 0 cases. 0 verifiable cases. Cases reported doctors. Cases shown media. We're talking retorted data, actual infected people reality.  know like afraid life every time encounter police officer, shut up, don‚Äôt know talking about! Virus not, things need change, protests seem that! bad faith posting. Period. End story. Ok know corona kills people I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs dumb hell compare viruses wars. TB still deaths per year corona lots different steroids yes even ones designed growth inhibit immune systems.

For example, get eczema inside crease elbows. happens move arms around crease folds out, gets irritated hair skin skin contact, immune system responds inflammation. apply topical hydrocortisone works suppressing immune response area, eczema goes dramatically. significantly more, less testing month ago. 7 day average number tests reported daily

Now: 28,857
1 week ago: 29,793
2 weeks ago: 21,048
3 weeks ago: 23,174
1 month ago: 32,379

What happened positivity rate exploded tests. 7 day average positivity rate:

Now: 6.98%
1 Week ago: 4.10%
2 Weeks ago: 4.16%
3 Weeks ago: 3.18%
1 Month Ago: 2.66%   Therein lies problem said. ""The state opens back said everybody fine."".

Let's forget coronavirus pretty much pushed rug powers be.. task force, speeches, more, much news it. touted yesterday's news, spikes product  agree overall point children verse old people critical distinction regardless. one outlive child. know that‚Äôs meant otherwise you‚Äôd said ‚Äòfiercely advocating Americans civil rights.‚Äô exactly first thought. New use case makes new patent... bye bye affordable life saving drug. hope happen way 2020 all... Happiness matter face deadly virus. pretty old news, right? I‚Äôve read March. Okay well, lump doomers people understand basic science statistics. untouchables doing? costs $35 save life UK, American hospitals charge $250,000 per dose hound deepest pits hell payment. could said several things we're currently allow us ""safely"" reopen. safety theater allowing businesses avoid liability.

As side note: recently went doctor noticed home running fever top issues already having. symptoms typical Covid all, concerned Covid; concerned body fighting type infection needed get checked for. Nonetheless, fever, worried got doctor's office let building. However, infrared thermometer showed fever let right in. called back appointment, oral thermometer show fever. think infrared thermometers accurate regardless effective temperature screenings are, another issue. North Alabama checking in, essential job worker checking in.

They officially rolling us back March 2020 style lockdowns job, enforcing new quarantine measures. ""workarounds"" little issue.

See: also: know likely able pull-off bullshit drug. tbh - put anything past them. almost certainly try put anything past you) I'm sorry. area job? Reducing deaths third cases require ventilation absolutely ""slight"" reduction, especially considering percentage perish intubated. Like stockpile meds just-in-time solution, lot things Sweden. Just-in-time doesn‚Äôt cut pandemic. That's surprising, half community well known wearing face coverings. would expect spread much lower. many shops closed April, allowed shoppers access ""essential"" items?

Is 18% increase really exciting? Thanks, that's 15 hours research issue. surprised little concept screening fevers studied. considered mentioning IR camera systems occasionally see touted alternative solution, find actual academic studies them, lot marketing literature. Hahahhahaha funny, yes joe Biden lifelong stutter equivalent mentally incapacitated 26IQ sentient skin tag advocates white supremacist violence Unless you‚Äôre likely fucked, study finds‚Äù Inb4 American company buys jacks prices immensely. 

Martin Shkreli, anyone? also get similar number. much depends cases continue decrease, flatten predicted many models, increase. uncertainty level massive. 

With disinformation campaign groups banned mentioning subreddit, pessimistic. know exactly uncivil. push it. Boo yah! First day back office since last Tuesday masks longer required work. two us wearing them. feel safe right now...üòñ way headline written would thought eliminated deaths. Even got excited. read it. I'm back regularly scheduled programming.  Yup. 

My essential job rolled back March lockdown mode. 499 passengers, 50 infected, 9 deaths including 32 year old nurse. 


Did miss article never say flight was? Keeps saying passengers died april never mentions flight was. mean I've read things people definitely seemed tested negative. symptoms? Exactly. suspect different version app. every country uses one. seen tends couple day incubation, we‚Äôve cases makes question infection happen quicker. either lying misinformed

It specific group officers didn‚Äôt arrest specific public officials (who also received threats) issue climate bill.

No, didn‚Äôt name individual officers clear threats directed towards specific public officials particular officers area random cops another state. 

I‚Äôm blindly believing admin, fucking remember exactly happened.

Threats made specific group (the sub users) specific people far dangerous one comments individuals across multiple subreddits. Good thing Trump suggest may helpful. 

Or would banned use now. memory remembers everyone saying ""these studies suck way anyone recommending this"" number deaths seem spiking. holding steady dropping tiny bit. Yay! good news coming Denmark makes positively giddy. truly think largish European countries response one best (Norway's better results though, Iceland even better Norway Iceland tiny).

I think best news one thinks problem over, remains guard vigilant despite many positive things happened. definitely cause celebration! Hopefully new infection clusters (which happened always expected predicted) nipped bud contact tracing system constantly seeking improve. think mean ""mild coronavirus symptoms"", ""mild coronary symptoms.""

Then again, mild coronary work almost every day. . . Maybe cheap U.K. U.S. cost 100x more. moved Sweden election. know debated take test. never saw anything change. think hospitals overloaded yet another poster pointed out, seniors taking seriously infrastructure helping (I think publix still ""seniors only"" shopping hour, instance).

It kinda shows ""deaths"" bad metric anyways, care dies guess know Florida lot testing ? Question, actually. asked question, posit 'what if' statements reason possible scenarios. Try sometime. really believe numbers right? even kill leaves chronic problems might kill mean people think means. 

This standard drug used treat asthma lung inflammation issues. used along. effectiveness already existing stats.

All study examine specific efficacy detail.

Sure it'll help little bit knowing little bit better effective, used.

But already use since day one standard drug treat lung inflammation. ever happened rhemdesavir? I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm spelling wrong amazed people would take big risk **just go bar**. drink home? 

The elimination bars ""clubs"" (dance clubs/ ""night"" clubs) one changes U.S culture would like see.

Underground raves free ok me, monetized, advertised drinking buildings could used low-cost housing instead bars. got chingunguya symptoms lasted year. Methinks need /s end. Ah looks like he's reporting data me! HA HA HA HA follow long term recovery people treated sars steroids never really recovered.... Couple things note article. Notice nowhere article mention even tested first time via PCR, diagnosed telltale signs. later test positive antibodies, poopooed on, time, especially sub, super accurate.

So woman sick February, could covid? Yes. covid? know. tested positive later date via antibodies. false positive? Maybe. Could COVID ernest? Yes. comes covid tests positive via PCR June. active virus? Maybe. high blood pressure headache related? knows. mention that. positive test prolonged clearing viral RNA? Can't answer sure. 

 saying true, fear mongering title slanted convey position fear. Way many uncertainties draw real conclusions. take deep breath. True point people go listing litany reasons moral high ground they‚Äôre side wouldn‚Äôt risk. acknowledge within article possibility something happening also putting blame solely police strikes disingenuous. ‚ÄúSerious‚Äù side effects specific definition clinical trials reserved things could life threatening. Things like fevers muscle aches serious side effects going happen vaccine they‚Äôre caused immune system activated (which kinda you‚Äôre going vaccine). You‚Äôll massively downvoted cheerleaders deniers... pro-HK and/or pro-China threads Why'd post twice? get it. difficult wrap heads around things directly experience witness. Thanks sharing successes people close you. correct many people country opportunities available and/or face barriers. ""Sorry luck glad live country"" adequate answer rightful demands equality. soo there‚Äôs pretty much chance i‚Äôm going able go Florida fall semester? i‚Äôm nj cases aren‚Äôt bad used Coronavirus hates left right equally too.

It kill reopen protest BLM protest. kill Trump rally Biden rally. 

I'm left-leaning condemn recklessness sides. suspect protests reopen ones pushed bots trolls Russia places sow chaos spread virus further.

 

 Sorry that! Hopefully stomach problems go away eventually. trying hide vaccine available. sounds like may one end year. Thanks. Archived link: http://archive.is/1XOV0 ""In conclusion, shown COVID-19 pandemic potential severely affect annual life expectancy Madrid. Continuing monitor trends life expectancy Madrid worldwide provide valuable evidence total impact pandemic mortality."" worse. Trump sewed confusion statements totally contradict CDC recommendations. get good, get funny, get way. want trivialize issue, equivalent 39 9/11's. sure anything swinging favor. It‚Äôs small win. still fucked.

I think many covid patients empirically steroids anyways. It‚Äôs fairly standard treatment pulmonary problems specific treatment available.  

I‚Äôm doctor. I‚Äôll ask icu docs hospital using steroids Different tests different specificity/sensitivity. red cross using [Ortho Clinical Diagnostics VITROS¬Æ Anti-SARS- CoV2 Total FDA evaluated specificity 100%, unknown sensitivity. 


That basically means 0% chance false positive (the test positive never COVID), unknown chance false negative (the test reads negative even though COVID). test positive particular assay, COVID developed (presumed) immunity. 


There's almost always tradeoff sensitivity/specificty, they're useful different problems. case, test never false positive great large-scale population screening: someone tests positive, safely exposed virus can't carry it, meaning definitely return ordinary life without putting anyone risk. Yes thats true. talking say they're trying spread bullshit data. said florida increasing testing proven true pdf linked.

They asking infection rate increasing, decreasing, staying stable. question asked many times properly answered people much pleasant you. Thank breakdown, makes sense! hard get head around graphs going around, information represent. article says Philly significant rise cases. see thing many cities. obese rapper questionable lifestyle habits. Yes , translatable general population. 

If fighting anecdotes anecdotes know 3 people got fine. Went golfing one weekend. did, said Anti-inflammatory medication like ibuprofen/advil. forget mention 96% match coronavirus sample bat gathered 2013 SARS-CoV-2, pretty much puts ""it developed/escaped lab"" argument rest. probably ‚Äúsingle Karen‚Äôs‚Äù Facebook group weekly big night stfu Nope:

118,000 fatalities 216,000,000 cases ~5.9%. Worldwide, 5.5%. 

5 times people think dying. I‚Äôm trying protect myself, I‚Äôm 20‚Äôs highest risk. It‚Äôs stopping killing old immunocompromised people. 

It‚Äôs saving people like parents grandparents. it, might live, parents grandparents? 

You can‚Äôt shocked people call dick you‚Äôre willingly going around saying actually ignore preventable risk painful death vulnerable people, risks already exist. 

I don‚Äôt think know hypochondriacs are. Lmao companies make sell go press say ""Sue us saving peoples lives"" I've running spreadsheet analysis own, using eleven day interval. [I've run latest comparison June 15's data provided New York New cases interval average 21.9k per day. pandemic continues spike, wildly differing end results State. example, Connecticut overtaken Michigan highest mortality rate 9.29%. Arizona shows biggest growth cases whopping 62.2% change since June 4.

* [11-day spreadsheet latest 2020-06-15
* [state-by-state cases 2020-06-15  Yes, do. understanding Florida bit unique case. shitloads ""snowbirds"" declare residence northern state property fly Winter vacations. people may even spend majority time there. 

I could easily see thousands thousands people chose quarantine vacation home. 

Now Florida nice tidy demographic people Florida months months, traveled state recently, got infected Florida ""Florida"" driver's license. Read article. study found seem anything patients milder cases Covid. people ventilators, significantly reduces mortality. that's Daraprim.

What Insulin?

Or Epipen? It'll get extended 30 days, unless US ends correcting course, highly, highly doubt.

No reason open virus raging like petri dish. Damn, would mean Norwegian numbers absolutely utterly catastrophically bad? would neighbouring countries significance compared countries? Belgium also reportedly horribly. Although they're complete mess measures well. necessarily. Resources limited, human effort care, situations. want devote limited resources things actually work. saying Trump xenophobic opinion well. 

Most people agree Trump xenophobic antisemite. origin travel UK, unclear they're citizens UK, NZ other. addition that, obtained special permission break quarantine visit dying relative. Meanwhile, states, Florida, charge reporting numbers purposefully reporting numbers. 

Particularly early enough Covid tests go around, blame hospitals saying ""they symptoms, probably Covid related death."" Also seems kind like HIV/AIDS sense many die directly disease itself, rather die complications relating conditions may have. argument I've seen hoax-ers post facebook. ""They die Covid, died diabetes! call Covid death inflate numbers!!"" negative Slightly reduces. headlines today terrible. good news, people take as, GOT TREATMENT NOW, TIME REAL CORONA!! social distancing required

where people whether required not.

otherwise agree, although limiting social circles if/when socializing stay outdoors. 85 million people died WWII covid likely exceed number. See make useless comparisons too. Chinese government announces humans live earth would also called propaganda......... least casinos already filter living hell air, can't really claim thing Disney rides, like goes 20% chance catching covid 17% chance understand trade off. think people aware free lunch treatment either. It‚Äôs great news works people still cautious even risk dying lower Yeah took 3 weeks lockdown PA things start trending hopefully Florida act quickly holding breath response far. Ok, found reported test count today. 7 day average positivity rate 6.98%, exponential climb along case count.  good...  Yea one bar got popped town next day 2 3 others block shut reason. Entertainment districts gonna get wrecked very, soon. Sorry hear this. silver lining pain now. hope family heals. ""So essentially costs ¬£35 save life.""
Now available US hospitals starting $49,999.97 per dose. thing.

I mean, maybe, really basis believe people Wisconsin staying inside people Arizona Tennessee. Wisconsin packed bars like Arizona packed bars. Neither us knows percentage state packing bars.

Assuming people Arizona confirming bias want believe. Steroids primary treatment many SARS patients 2003, there's serious side effects. Asian countries trying avoid use steroids COVID-19 pandemic. also second wave. first wave completely different part China Wuhan, initial outbreak was. reason people describe ""second wave"" happens country. flu killed people 2018 many big wars

~34k third Corona killed what, 3 months?

States still setting records new infections per day; isnt anywhere close total yet. DARE MAKE DECENT ANOTHER HUMAN 100%. disgusting narrative response virus steeped ignorance. Fuck whole profile paints racist dickbag  probably right....here's upvote. It‚Äôs off-patent drug. thing limiting supply pandemic situation manufacturing capacity, countries order happen things like DPA. Price issue here. Yep, logically play whole time.


Waait, not.

Really bad idea. ever went i‚Äôd hotel sure Non-paywalled article everyone able read it. I'm sorry pandemic leaving nothing carnage wake.  People need know info even doom gloom. talking peoples lives great many survived virus going lifelong medical issues result.  want discuss turn around get fuck here. Delta. I've multiple flights work Yeah that's point covid stacks top probably worse entire Year's worth normal chances Asymptomatics persons still contagious. **How much? know yet** better conservative here.

and
 Persons symptoms however mild still contagious 9 days.

do coincide. really. Research shows pre-symptomatic newly-symptomatic periods transmissions occur. Fact check worldometers: last 3 days, Sweden gone 483 deaths per capita, 484 489.      
Meanwhile, deaths per capita remained Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal...     

You strange definition ""shrinking lot"". then, exactly I've heard last 3 months. ""deaths rate lowered down"" much wonder there's still 49 daily deaths. /s convinced family friends real. live 3 baseball stadiums 2 football stadiums 2 basketball arenas NFL MLB NBA. mention NHL AHL games easy access within 2 hour drive. shutdown used thoroughly arguments.

If stadiums shutdown one brand new arena bring tons big artists Summerfest delayed least. serious lot fucking money people missing on. tended work better arguments right leaning individuals know. better conservative here

This kind sentiment caused massive, worldwide economic crisis certainly cause much damage virus itself. countries whose GDP projected shrink tens percent. always linear, bet see quite similar shrinkage essential services like healthcare, welfare on. /r/rimjobsteve Masks reduce transmission? Oh man, (exposure X time) factor going figure pretty heavily Mango makes wait 90 minutes ""power move"" rambles another 60 virus ""totally contained"".

EDIT: feel like choir example common political rally. numbers associated pretty scary. ya go bud, since want knee-jerk response instead actually reading researching anything. read Army preparing second wave? sure hope LA gave green light re-open day camps summer camps. We'll see next couple months kids really vector covid spread. idea sort contact tracing done AZ know spread ? Bars Clubs Restaurants ? Protesters ?

That would imply plan contact tracing...26% positivity community spread everywhere. Border controls--strict ones--seem common thread countries kept CV-19 control. used porous borders implications showing reporting. example, border controls Eastern Caribbean saved lives destroyed businesses businesses, lives. thought Darwin awards stupid things end killing people. group 100 friends age 50 likely result 0 deaths. group much smaller. person AVN hip, I'd take death. surgery recovery time month light activity - side really limited mobility leg need replaced 15 years so. Still, I'd rather gamble AVN higher chance death. sound disappointed. know cheering them. There's still chance completely wrong. really weird, doctors expensive hell  figure killed virus vaccines pretty safe, since based tried tested method. As.a healthcare professional, what's take this? even trust Florida report deaths accurately though? got feeling they've under-reported whole time, given whole ""excess pnuemonia deaths"" we're seeing Chile Peru testing too. Results promising. question discussion is. supposed do? bigger picture. society? news headlines numbers going up, second wave, increase surge, etc... locked months, reopening told would. supposed think? 

The numbers gone down, steady possibly slowing increasing. hoped would measures ""stay-at-home orders"" closing economy. gathering, protesting, moving back towards type normal ""new normal (ie masks distancing) "".

What end game? Without vaccine, right way live? shut forever? work? anti-social creatures years vaccine? may make happy. see nature. 

I want see anyone sick die disease. want safe. want everyone safe take precautionary measures. wearing mask something people want live daily lives? Obviously not, terrible? prevent disease spreading, big deal wear one? really constricting life? Especially go living life ""normal"" try difference piece cloth face public? 

I guess know answers are. feel people want everything extreme time. Close everything, avoid everyone doomed Open everything, flu. pass.

Were responses appropriate? Ask 1000 people get 1000 different views. much enough? Depends live ask. Someone know anyone got virus lives small population little travel. someone lost loved ones lives large populated city deal extreme change lifestyle.

Are smart enough people see somewhere middle? can't prevent everyone getting sick/dying 100% point. also can't stop society tracks indefinitely society collapses. Hopefully medicine/vaccine eradicate disease like polio. 

Sorry much point post even coherent. thoughts. feel frustrated someone concerned stay safe also want live life again. know virus real gone away. every news article scares ""second wave"" ""surging increases"" makes feel feel guilty anything engages society. 

Where hope? positivity? light end tunnel? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* people gun point pulled beds still virus internment camps? social media hoax? people don‚Äôt think changed comment unknown way people already commented/voted it. huge, major headline news pages then? read ""cheap asteroid""...

Don‚Äôt feel guilty engaging society. virus attacks core means human being. 

Wear mask stay safe, go outside enjoy summer friends family even it‚Äôs awkward maintain distancing socializing. 

We can‚Äôt see end tunnel yet, other‚Äôs lights now. We‚Äôll get this. will. ‚ù§Ô∏è wish right. don‚Äôt get it. wear damn mask public. Shit ain‚Äôt hard. Probably people racist. said stuff McCain though. Whatever reason, good show kindness cross political boundaries. kidding? There‚Äôs AC everywhere. wouldn‚Äôt able live VN without AC. jurisdictions US, lethal force stop attacker claiming coronavirus would certainly legal justified depending circumstances. 

In example, would similar rapist attacking someone claiming HIV - again, likely justifiable legal use lethal force. Imagine much research stroke ego. dedicated, I'll give that. loves dumb people. think fact people (Americans) voted absolute fucking moron, absolute abomination human powerful human planet.

Reminder.

This man absolute real capacity start nuclear exchange, incinerate world end mankind good.

Good fucking job. totally work stop testing people get sick die.

What colossal idiot man is, prepared sacrifice public health massive scale look good.  said (paraphrasing) listen one Trump's moronologues, think sounds like blithering idiot, blithering idiot. fucking dolt get bent shape dude's comment. I'm 30 stoked guys. generation came information age, ""grown ups"" can't hide behind ignorance more. 

Centuries generational abuse ending y'all fuckin Wikipedia.. age wanted challenge power made sense, resources. guys allll information us older folks can't figure get social media find facts..

I speak music aside saying EDM come critical mass awesomeness young DJ's putting absolute bangers. It‚Äôs time admit idiots mind gone. He's rich though, acts like is. He's piece shit, nobody forget. agree he's going get nailed anything second he's FORCED office, he's private jet Russia live rest bankrupt days someone owes lot money gets him. Might actually work war... got lazy fight. Seems like really draft-dodge personal like one frequently quoted Futurama jokes reddit lol TIL, Reddit doesn‚Äôt strong understanding math... ü§Ø

/s. Reddit users average that, average! 

Btw disagreeing you, right u/FuRyluzt! ""If go White House bomb shelter, problems go away."" Congratulations win Internet today. Wish award give you. Yeah, /r/test comment history likely feeding Markov Chain generate ""conversation,"" trained using another bot spews Trump rhetoric. Speaks volumes considered living wage US.

Hint: it‚Äôs one Hahahahhahahahahahaha would say that? seem pretty self aware situation in. Why? 10/10 analogy. New York needs build wall. mean electro-shock therapy guy? Ok Denial river Egypt... right? mean, state cases decline(for now) imagine much owner lost six hotels closed two months. understand need reopen cover costs think cautious reopening understandable. 

That said, think way place, like many others, handling reopening utterly irresponsible. They're throwing us back minimal guidance. We've open three weeks management never sat us team go policy changes important guest questions, tossed us back tense situation zero preparations follow enforcing necessary protective measures. claimed told us reopening everyone would provided masks masks bought small size even cover mouth nose time, I've make due bandanas. matters, since management refusing wear masks since day one reopening even though state mandate. ran disinfectant wipes weekend something tells management going act like one tub lysol wipes needed go back business usual despite fact pandemic continues rage around us people raging areas come stay us. 

So, summarize, yes, think places need chance reopen get business flowing really wish someone enforcing safety making places taking appropriate precautions shut doors properly comply. Rude 29th Ooh, needs name book movie admin. fuck guys elect someone fucking stupid mean, he's trying convey increased testing we'll increased confirmed cases, true. capacity understand poor choice words, care fact places ratio positive results also increasing. Exactly. one funniest things I've ever seen ad for. 
Dumbest dumb. NPR shit think motherfucker broke brain. We‚Äôve seen demonstrations, wasn‚Äôt point post. say despite may think, masks aren‚Äôt large part australia‚Äôs success far. fact, chief medical officers- federal state advising us wear masks unless unwell vulnerable. There‚Äôs debate advised us that, result ew flattened curve without general population wearing masks dare you, sir! first, friendo. live we‚Äôre number 1 one day tested 175 people 95 positive happening everyday governor still pushing open phase 2 that‚Äôs exactly hospitals completely full urging governor push phase 2 openly lied general public saying doctors gave approval country quarantine, schools closed sports canceled, people social distancing, wearing masks using Uber amounts Lysol hand sanitizer, it‚Äôs surprising people diagnosed less communicable diseases? 

It‚Äôs almost like measures actually work. God damn, actually liked fucking idiot back 2016. Get dumb shit office. Fuck it, let's make voting longer we're at. exactly China üòÇ He's going use strategy ballot counting starts November: ""If stop counting right now, declare won."" Yeah id rather evangelical christian potus ""If stop arresting right now, we'd every crime, any."" nobody votes trump, would votes  See Las Vegas Fremont Street YouTube. 10% mask usage, people drunk, zero social distancing ... eventually hop plane bring back home states. Smh. man insane. insane person elected president country. know Pence? use insulin unsure long prescription lasts know prescription Australia cost $4.60 ... going assume that's week's worth.

To hear America cost $400 vial still blows mind ... Yeah get government subsidies honestly something probably costs $1 vial make (including staff costs ) marked highly criminal

I get onboard universal health care large number Americans still see bad thing even evidence like noses ... People Cray cray hated Jesus told truth. Right lots Californians saying, ‚ÄúSEE BAD,‚Äù completely returning normal. live Northern California went grab take moms favorite coffee shop Mother‚Äôs Day place 100% full one wearing masks besides couple workers me. 

It‚Äôs spike time lots thinking we‚Äôre done. amount masks I‚Äôve seen general fallen half easily. fucking hate asshole, think trying make point sarcastic, no? headline true, doesn‚Äôt paint whole picture. context. I‚Äôm saying he‚Äôs fucking idiot; I‚Äôm saying people stop getting fixated stupid things says way presented. They‚Äôre presented maximum outrage. likes way, I‚Äôm sure, let‚Äôs stop giving wants: attention.  site dumb even know spend time  Hey, noticed getting downvoted, think might expected. agree men overrepresented dangerous jobs, mental illness, substance abuse, suspect people downvoting also agree. people likely taking issue fact believe men's health taken seriously, agree SublimeEntity. SublimeEntity claiming men personally responsible poor health outcomes, merely pointing exclusion women clinical trials (which choice made men) proving detriment men women. Basically, sexist choices hurt men women. It‚Äôs amazing stupid fervent supporters are. Yea sober people don‚Äôt give shit give even less shit they‚Äôre sloppy drunk. ""Our testing much bigger advanced country (we done great job this!) shows cases. Without testing, weak testing, would showing almost cases. Testing double edged sword - Makes us look bad, good have!!!"" Trump tweeted. COYG good abstract problem solving mean well informed, politically savvy.

Nevermind IQ tests benefit white rich men most. Probably boomer FAs still working. They've cut flights much seniority people regularly working flights hired back mid 80s early 90s. God! brainless turd. He's ALREADY proven know fucking thing disease medicine. Straight alternative facts? could watch video president. make mind up. I'm also curious this. I've taken Abbott antibody test, I'm convinced result, I'd like take another company's test ""second opinion."" could easy way sure Abbott.  Thats exactly I'm saying bro lol PEEKABOO! ....

Edit: yes, supporters also terrible people stupid. say shit get way. Whatever is, say it. dumbest fucking thing I've ever heard. Congrats. fucking idea business works. whole widespread thing...

Clearly bullshit. Virus deadly measured rate shows. Nah dude. Countries halted flights regardless control growing pandemic soil mass testing. urgent all. 38 countries coronavirus cases spreading February, refused call pandemic. It‚Äôs irresponsible. No, prefer exactly said. want #'s appear lower things re-open, think going happen then? Yep, going bounce around country get herd immunity, successful infra contain it, vaccine. People think couple months lockdown killed it. started boys. position march except made inroads rural areas. mean, money?

The government money. Social security checks today's old people come money younger people paying today towards social security. $600 bonus unemployment checks coming loans government taking out, paid back higher taxes future. sight. mind. Source says testing country? Trick question, get thousands per store still get raise. might get mandatory OT that's raise. Sources? Fox?  could be, not. tested negative first entered Vietnam, means test Vietnam uses chance false negative. Therefore could false negative cases facility. Also, without sweeping test one sure there's asymptomatic cases population.  making argument seeing cases makes numbers look bad good numbers goal could testing like are. bad argument since look positive rate fact isnt going down. Typical reddit though reads headline sees Trump reason turns critical thinking throws context reading comprehension window takes everything face value Ironically diagnosed bad one lower leg. Turns tested it. would thought. yes news spinning look article. Yea OKIE 

I know four people alone virus within 2 mile radius lol first paragraph linked article actually sums basically that, think people outraged care. said still kinda stupid, actually *unreasonable*. I've actually say almost thing someone explain differences case fatality rates countries. WTG Michigan New York!! care much people talk trash Gov. Whitmer, made right decisions info had. I'm proud standing ground opening slowly. ""Have tried lying?"" - response every problem. *taps forehead* can't Coronavirus never get tested hate president handled this, least keep sub quality information?

That ain't never, ever gonna happen. reddit. Idk, I'm people distance less warm outside Oh, old poor people die, productive economy becomes. stock market excited. ""Ignore go away"" worked many scandals many people government willing break every rule him.

Stupid cunt thinks same. Europe. Fair point - well stated. One 5 people could impacted virus access cells multiple organs across body. 

This comment hopefully age badly - reports ... good point. It‚Äôs something visible. ends feeding false sense security many people already others desperately want. said, helps all, it‚Äôs worth doing. cannot get complacent believe taking temperatures going keep virus entering. O2 sat another option. That‚Äôs pretty quick easy one. 

But yea obviously that‚Äôs problem, point good option, can‚Äôt treat security theater confirmation safety. make people feel safer? sure shit don‚Äôt. don‚Äôt want fight higher ups work they‚Äôre ignorant think fucking thermometer going tell whether someone virus. get virus asymptomatic. get virus &amp; show symptoms fever. I‚Äôm sick shitty ideas universally accepted nobody feels like challenging them. *SARS-CoV-2 may infect central nervous system(CNS), viral nucleic acid detected patient's cerebrospinal fluid brain tissue autopsy.* think would seen now. GF lives halfway across country I'd much appreciate safe again. Well, party thinks preaching abstinence best way prevent teen pregnancy...taking human nature account part approach. Offices, bars, public transit seem likely virus vectors. know freaked people going beach, probably dangerous indoor stuff. personally still even beach, though. HCQ literally taken billions times last 60 years. Reports extended QT interval wildly exaggerated. drugs safer HCQ. ICU beds use covid patients looks exponential. 

If look free beds situation look dire, hospitals what's coming canceling elective surgeries freeing beds fast can. But, come point free many beds influx new covid patients overwhelm them. Here's current ranking states per capita deaths:

 map US counties per capita deaths:

  don‚Äôt think actually many leaders idea would like leader. made system, either executive, legislative, military branches. exposed duties requirements manage big organizations. Others hereditary rulers saw parents brother do. 

Which leader inexperienced? even give couple weeks looking mornings headlines huge spike today. 

Cant help think many protesters went home high risk family members back work exposed unsuspecting others. start seeing effects next week. Deaths trail... maybe 2 weeks see significant jump today deaths. Thanks Florida disappointing. then...it money. gone lock down, much country locked soon NY basically. NY NJ took serious serious. states SERIOUS yet, made seem dumb lock down, hence protests...now good luck putting smoke back candle. entire pandemic display people position making possibly wrong calls, would improper discount possibility case here. increase minimum wage, correct cost living would SLIGHTLY increase nearly margin. would still huge benefit poorest vulnerable think what's important understand minimum wage, matter amount, meant ""lived on""

Says who?

It disingenuous suggest millions people working minimum wage slightly realistic means improving situation. First off, many working multiple jobs can't get minimum wage. can't go college. can't ask every McDonalds Walmart employee become assistant managers. teenagers living home bored retirees."
