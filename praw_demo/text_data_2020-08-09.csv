well, bad thing expect trump re-elected november. US finished. 7day daily announced isn’t cumulative it? worse think...The Board Ed suggested rotating students seats every 14 minutes quarantine students near infected person.  actually opposite.

Its blowing now, good november election without bad news trump. post title edited source. headline changed apnews.com article submitted here.

Here archived version submitted article, showing previously titled ""US response virus met incredulity would assume lot single people fact people perfectly happy alone, tbh. I'm single choice, hate relationship like peace have.

People like alone likely relationships would think. anecdote, partner express discomfort idea isolated alone, would support suspicion. worry us introverts... We're fine, really! concerned disappointed hear people like flies lakefront. yet c'mon! someone needs liver transplant there's long waiting list, de-prioritize people drink alcohol. is, people make bad decisions choice, let go.

If people wear masks, go social gatherings, attend school, church, etc. part sorry them.

People die, people idiots either. putting everyone risk.

There one strategy now. brain cells, save yourself. Let idiots gather spread disease idiots dead gone. Older generations need stay away anyone young. Perhaps permanently, see disease existing decades. people already incorrectly believe common colds. think started sore throat got cough, anyone get sick would start sore throat cough, example. 

ThatsNotHowAnyOfThisWorks.gif got sick doesnt mean covid. almost flu season really think America gives fuck rest world thinks. Let's see Europe get trouble come cryn' USA. Come europe, free nearly anything want, including mooch takes government benefits never works. Americans free that... ""no, care."": also europeans. Apparently leaked version said safe UK recording many cases right appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* I'm Russian, remember parents telling conversation early marriage (around 1987). thought life would probably boring. Get married, kids, work, retire, nothing special. wanted excitement.

Then Soviet Union collapsed, shit hit fan uh, boring not. point is, even problems becoming obvious 80s, average person expect believe could happen. told '87 '92 would living capitalism, would thought crazy. 

I know what's around corner US wish kind catastrophe anyone. one Ga wants go NY anyway. serious note wonder new infection rate low many people NY got begin start.

Tomorrow able turn cell phone back buy groceries.

Thank everyone helped out!

I repay way another...you’ll see! Compared rest world whole, US sucks. Coming American. yes, traveled countries. America might great point, not. Croatia. country harshest restrictions compared number cases beginning pandemic started. Everything fantastic, life back normal summer started bam - borders wide open, tourism booming counting numbers higher beginning pandemic. nobody cares anymore, people wear masks stores/gas stations work people daily wear work it. Beaches, bars, restaurants packed. know happen one summer - everyone hoping avoid another lockdown nobody certain yet. That's right - complain us wearing masks verbally accost us call us sheep. live strange place here. Definitely sounds like moo point, ask me. Massive testing seems kinda pointless stage epidemic. 


You still missing many people without symptoms negative people could get again.


Tests super important early could actually stop spread, feel good thing anything real benefit. Quite often negative/positive test results would change anything. Somebody mild symptoms sepf isolates regardless test. UK much better position cannot compared Georgia. Ypu would probably compare New York schools also reopening I'll take 5 days pool. DeMoCrAtIc HoAx!?!

/s

That's issue, right there. Idiots believing conspiracy theories, facebook ""doctors"" selfish assholes ""muh Freedumb!"" Guys country kinda sucks ngl Dont tell Americans this... say ""See, WW2 worse flu. Start annexing."" Voters  fellow SW Kansan?! Europe well, bad USA, atm. Cases rising almost European countries now. learn New Zealand.

Even we're dependent interstate travel, nonessential travel states/countries stop pandemic over. people want move another country, like move home country origin they've working somewhere else while, trust quarantine properly. Isolate upon arrival, imprison attempt leave scheduled. telling would take advise mechanic physiology heart muscle? would ask 5th grade teacher fix HVAC system’s leaking condenser? America sucks bro. drank Kool-Aid. yes, world 100% laughing you. numbers really terrific. Nevertheless, comparison Vietnam war good one, 50k mostly young people. compare ""loss life years"". course, quite abstract number even difficult comprehend. parents called sheep wearing mask. gonna lie, stung little. border open. Thousands refugees cross border illegally every week. Yep..the mayor said recent years affluent older motorcyle owner type oppose bikers. 

Any way, read elsewhere sex workers california..I think san diego heading cause business slow qualify unempoyment . hope make money event 

Thats said. People also die preventable causes cause reluctant visit hospital Would love see numbers this... respectable predictions (WHO, German Health Authority, Imperial College Study etc) February saying estimated final CFR would come 0.7-2 %. Current CFR based confirmed cases vs confirmed deaths comes 3.3%. would great could let us know whereabouts ass pulled claim. America truly fragile country... Yup gonna drag shit across country wrong way. mistaking fourteen day daily averages cumulative averages. ECDC uses cumulative average, US using daily average. website puts numbers side side makes obvious, certain math strong suit. two America's. Union Confederate America division within every city state country. north south, city country. incredulous living Michigan, end damn underground railroad US, hear people talk Confederate flag symbol heritage. symbol enemy, destroyed chance. civil war ever happens cannot make mistake again. I'd say us care. That's snapshot. We're basically talking daily death/case rate. They've maintained suppression virus. Strictly looking perspective, keep they're currently doing. Misdirection stop Facebook YouTube, folks. good thing is, people common sense many people affected shorter degrees separation experienced covid deaths getting common fast. saw anti-masker speeding around local Target sign said ""Covid Balogne, masks pansies"". called Police her. Spoiler: be.

Mainstream media unhealthy obsession ""mutations"". know SARS-CoV-2 mutates rate ~24 substitutions per year meaning basically mutates per transmission. also quite normal, par e.g. flu.

Some mutations might change immunogenicity, quite rare far between. usually takes ~years happen. expect tomorrow's numbers roughly well due today public holiday. find data? Would like add covid data bookmarks Depends country europe, europe many different countries doesnt cover whole region worry Americans, really care wear masks government orders avoid fines. Also superiority complex calling fellow country men side political spectrum stupid disgusting. hate Trump wearing mask time go protests without masks. bunch hypocrites think every European supports you, internet said so. Pray tell exactly ""seems off"". numbers correspond actions Malaysia Malaysians taken? numbers reflect situation ground (e.g. graves filling faster, hospitals becoming full)? numbers detailedly published daily since Malaysia's first case January inconsistent? ""seem off"" numbers good? I’m sorry hear that. really hope situation improves. Health underrated quality life aspect. either beat herd immunity smart start. Bay area shut weeks early, unlike NYC. you, sure. lots aren't. I'm glad able get partner March, prospect another lockdown starting leave visa reasons pretty awful. everyone handles things same. A-choo Bill Gates businessman software engineer. 160,000+ dead Americans disagree. definently better though, keep listening morons pandemic advice, enjoy 2nd grade level info germs. I'm sure 6 feet space plenty distance people, fine

Now who's assuming things? Lol Wow. That's amazing amount wrong. steal source code (he famously bought Seattle Computer Club) build PC. first hardware Microsoft ever built Xbox, Bill Gates comfortably retired. Plus they're Michigan fans. Covid exposes systemic racism?

Am loop... pushing agenda?

Because first blame Covid white man. us introverts completely satisfied social interaction reddit. Seriously, I'm lonely, would lonely? cat internet. handle 1-2 years ultra-intraversion. fair also true Trump. difference Trumps ""experts"" believe demon sperm. seem like haha time New York one knew contagious thing biased towards elderly severe cases. PPE wasn’t plentiful either. NY hospitals ran beds sent people nursing homes reaped havoc elderly. It’s awful. States know benefit time stock protective supplies beds. We’re also learning effectively treat disease. Who’d thought elect people hate government bad running government?

What mean ""elect people hate government""? Unlike US, right wing countries necessarily hate big government. yes. need redo census covid declines. states going missing lot people.... Great. Sooo hit heard immunity 1000 deaths? took virus serious implemented rules prevent spread. According nyc hit heard immunity thats cases low. Soo whats going San Francisco bay area ? explain it? care. Sadly alot people don't. circumstance would appropriate agree you. That's happened here. woman Covid denier worked medical facility without mask willingly worn mask gave one. given one pilot either thought bullshit. protect turn endangered everyone encountered. she, unfortunately, paying hefty price ignorance irresponsibility. hope daughter Downs Syndrome okay this. joke sustained GDP growth unrivalled prosperity? much tax money fed get? much PPE confiscate states countries. Save rich assholes line pockets. Nothing much would happen. Saw quite lesbian bikers actually. bikers like kids want look cool, like punk kid wearing nail studs n shit. They're really hurt people, like making statement cool are. unemployment you.  Yeah pretty messed up, Google ""Guatemalan Genocide"", find kinds information it. indigenous mayan people targeted. sad history even person making jokes fuck care said them? Oh wait, another person likes shit Americans fun none peers going stop fact, validate opinions pat back.

Because never actually think say offensive based stereotypes.

Healthcare USA still #1 someone lives systems. German say America way transparent are. Actually going everyone else. Spain Italy Britain way worse situation Sure think bar setting. One man eliminating malaria solving energy crisis climate change, dedicating golf tournament hurricane victims despite fucking FEMA beck call.

One one wife since divorced first wife, one literally billionaire figurative billionaire. 

You find two contrasted people tried. care I'm staying fuck home. I'm single, way easier isolate way. worry co-workers infecting me. Get shit together spread plague countries. updoot thanks service times. hope Leo varadkar mícheal Martin. probably taking money American corporations stay 20% plus Election Day virus hit herd immunity. average life expectancy 78.7 years us, going hard time convincing 58,854 people 74 going die next couple years anyway. That's entire bad flu season extra deaths (not counting excess deaths)! Pull decade maybe 30k people 65 74 really going die next couple years--as doubtful may be--and saying 28,974 people 65 mostly going die. recommend buying PPE China. others cumulative, can't go down. Napoleon France exactly qualify tragic, man arguably saved democracy (with violence) overrun monarchs Europe. sports organizations run assholes. hate see don’t want believe it, deep down, knew along.  kind valved masks really protect others you, danger others exhale. valve letting exhaled air without catching water droplets layer cloth anything, work.  I've reached loudly, aggressively public shaming portion pandemic. yeah us care, literally screaming idiots don't.  

I give fuck anymore. I'll scream fucking grandma isnt masking/distancing. 

So fucking morons. I'd say good riddance know going responsible deaths good conscientious people trying live dumpster fire. Even great people, everyone deserves humane treatment governor.  Two party democratic systems ripe picking. Ask Cambridge Analytica. ever small enough group control majority wealth build multigenerational anti-government campaign weaken regulatory powers said wealth, situation mistrust revolt government creates exists today. doesn’t even account racism sexism divide even further. America never settled hate problems, divided much can’t even agree save citizens unnecessary suffering death. planet US saved Europe totalitarian rule twice century still gets scolded supposedly enlightened people. Pak getting huge resources china including masks, testing kits, contact tracing medical personnel. India countries trying hold China responsible mess trade. like 5 nanoseconds! I'm AZ daughter's school let us choose online in-person (which start Sept maybe) 70% parents chose online. parents want kids going back anytime soon. mean it'd end like flu - vaccinate it, due number strains unlikely eradicated Eh fuck dude, let's go bowling Serious point order. extracted usable DNA fragments 120,000 year old neanderthal bone. Okay DNA RNA come people. flu. America part developed world.

It undeveloped years ago. Exactly. seems manipulative me. judgmental cautionary tale sparse medical facts. Well, disagree healthcare industry, fan health insurance, personal responsibility play role. Much cultural, course.

Unless things get severely worse, deaths Covid US never hit even one million. law diminishing returns play time side medical science. AEW could put Jericho's second-in-command Jake Hager replacement Wednesday's match. could re-write storyline around still make sense. Yes. may apply. Doctors getting laid salary cuts lack business hospital. particular er docs mentioned seeing level heart patients say stroke before. People afraid catching covid hospital delayed died. 

However, cover excess deaths. get soapbox? Mind borrow done using it? NYC seeing lax attitude? I’ve said somewhere here, live Bushwick; pretty much everyone masked outdoors course indoors it’s requirement. Head Williamsburg waterfront it’s totally different deal outside. non-masked masked far South Carolina us wondering call spade spade? Georgia's policy reopening refusing encourage wearing masks failure. suck stop spread safe send kids back school.

This whole politicizing mask wearing ridiculous platform ever existed. say worst political calculus ever put forward punish proponents never authority ever again? live island north Carolina.  place covered tourists,  surprised island  sinking. Honestly,  simply can't understand people thinking.  fear doomed. This. Healthcare workers come first. also Faucis reason, explained capitol hill. first date, empirical estimates IFR published due challenges measuring infection rates. 

That's contradiction. Nothing estimate 1 : originating based observation experience 

You cannot observe experience estimate. That's contradiction. That's Science, that's scientism. That's Science fraud.

The west publishing lot garbage Inference drawn Bayesian framework incorporates uncertainty seroprevalence estimates (supplement).

Statistics pattern matching footprints sand. Statistics **not** Science.

Theology, metaphysics, religion, 90% philosophy, statistics, Contextual Empiricism. know ""I say true"".

You know say Contextual Empiricism? worth lump coal. also heart replication ruled Contextual Empiricism completely reality science forever late 1600s.

The writing Newton's tomb wall reads:

Nullius verba (Latin ""on word one"" ""take nobody's word it"", literally ""of words"") motto Royal yourself"" business done, Science.

Contextual Empiricism never produced single empirical reality. Ever.

**psst** every statistical model broke, completely, covid-19. serious? sound like they're happy it? FFS. person struggling pay living expenses expressed weight loss context, shred emotional intelligence. deranged comment.  know many dead people would say otherwise... lot us do. unfortunately don’t seem making worse everyone. Let's keep eye excess deaths numbers, although weeks data today. ones Costco surgical masks. least assuming based available locally similar stores. isn’t Costco within 100 miles me. (And admit I’m bit jealous way people talk online really makes wish them) style made paper make surgical. IOW Covid rule USA **forever**. Remember normal? ain't never ever coming back folks, thanks anti vax lunatics. friend mine lives practically forced work, majority workplace fucking illness. Fuck Florida stg. didn’t know dead people used pawns living ones? Today learned something! Imagine real case figures are. Desantis hide case numbers full hospitals. Nope can't take isolated places like cruise ship etc

Just numbers already . afraid, well that's whole problem. feel sad also piss people like you.
Here simple thing
The numbers pick whatever site wish
Now take positive cases California
Now take deaths say covid 19
Now divide get actual percentage deaths. rocket science way lower figure probably know lazy math. perfect example mass problem posting about
Turd back least little work involved give honest comment. forget it, gossip world central  Yep. that's case they'll go right back exponential growth.

Limiting large gatherings strategy number one. schools concerts crowded bars. state spread whole USA brainer schools remote learning. Death row.... people vacation? 1.6% us. school started yet? starting question stories AI driven keep everyone others throats. anyone verify stories. know virus real know got better quickly old people passed away. much driven media. much real stories.  people would shocked told india tough time pandemic. respect lot people always going get bad I'd interested peer-reviewed study showing absence significant long-term complications. Feel free post that. I'll mine, actually exist, you. sound like denier. Sounds like outlier good Samaritan. must lot fun parties. Maybe better state focused getting control virus instead focusing making wearing masks mandatory.

I think one main thing Europeans think strange US handling virus. Instead everyone knows works, busy focusing kinds different things place. die? fuck working? Go get fucking job? started fucking business shit. tired scared little bitches like sitting home complaining. fucking stop buying bull shit like everyone going business. even 200,000 died US fudging fuck numbers. Wake fuck people gonna starve death one prosperous times history. Funny shut parties open schools? shut down? gained 0 traction sub, shocked tell you! appreciate warning, I'd rather risk $20 human being, especially people abandoned them. scary af American right now. try protect family staying home government us dependent either way screwed. help, give misinformation, expect everyone go business usual send kiddos back school. absolutely care us. scary me. Seriously. isn't. I'm 63. course could wrong, even end ventilator would continue believe global response virus misguided. medical, social, economic, psychological spiritual costs lockdown forced isolation simply great. less destructive ways manage pandemic. appropriate Republicans lean science fits narrative (children almost immune covid), disregard sciences like promoting social distancing wearing masks? means lot better right? That’s trump told me. Rich people power writing rules exact ideology nation founded on. Eating really dangerous too, food contaminated less people going eat. caught c diff contaminated food. brothers workers got food poisoning big chain restaurant recently too. lockdown would increase risk pregnant women? T’Challa voice: “We don’t here” I'm self-righteous, I'm empathetic. Give go.

You're trying call people privilege, ignoring privilege understanding difficulty lot people face regarding health.

You problem do. Great. cool, understand lot complex 'eat better LOLzers.' Tulane University? right middle *New Orleans*?

Not likely. 10 million. 

China tested 100 million February found 10 million positive. China advanced health care system world, handled 10 million patients one month Wuhan overwhelmed. he's saying let play, social distance wear masks get anyway? Yeah dude, that's cancelling it. saying one follow rules unless allowed play magically everyone will. foolish argument.

The pile = super spreader event god intended. would want mess beautiful breathing system? (/s) Ooh, sexy. Yeah, Sweden model follow. locked masked up, like Norway Denmark, significantly, incredibly lower death rate. could rapid tests republicans many middlemen profiting steps pcr test. like ppe situation. countrywide system flat rates ppe u million middlemen making profit step. comments, trying kill family ignorance ok. isn't. whole point us wearing masks staying home A: Prevent becoming sick  B: prevent others getting sick unlikely possibly dieing. None ""advice"" helpful person commenting going though hard times. teachers get SSI. good news kinda right? Me, neither. retired Army nurse. En Espanol, por favor! “deep cleaning” disinfecting worthless. It’s virus spreading. local schools plan open kids on-site M-T, W “deep cleaning” done, back site TH-F. Ridiculous.  take us? even welcome travel anywhere right now, best times nations worth moving take anyone without college degree, career and/or lots money. go every two weeks family shopping. 

This last trip, went six stores. One sign saying customers *should* mask on, five signs saying masks mandatory.

Saw tons no-mask customers locations. Saw nobody enforcing anything.

Makes wonder doesn’t make problem worse deniers leave thinking, “See? can’t legit they’re taking rules seriously. It’s mollify sheep.”

Never mind, that’s crazy talk. folks wear masks know “mollify” means. Rush zombie Neil Peart Guy twitter posted actually 23, per report received. enrollment school 2400.

Given prevalence spread US, one assume least twice number went school infected.

At least infected others school session. 

The question whether least one among prove superspreader. covid make immune least 6 months, likely much longer. knew already got covid I'd go back licking sidewalks like good old days. That's presidential! Short answer -No “they” -who believe Liar Chief, think science facts simply one person’s opinion think they’re “special” don’t one fuck give anyone doesn’t look, talk, act believe like do.

Sadly solid 40% US population thanks decades anti-intellectualism, dumbing shit down, taking “civics” education fewer fewer know government work, feeding lies disinformation Faux Mews. Straight Himmler Putin’s playbooks-the US become third world backwater deranged lunatic it’s helm. Even things 100% true, whole story of, doesn’t mean don’t deserve eat. US *government* corrupt cesspool, individual people kind generous usual. people board wearing masks stores, social distancing, part keep pandemic down. 

We enough cohesive leadership get organized response. tests contact tracing, tests always free take fucking *weeks* get back us. safety nets take time quarantine waiting results. 

There's nothing disincentives get tested stay home, everyone hackles contact tracing. bill passed allowed everyone get guaranteed paychecks waiting, one would upset. contact tracing average person two weeks lost pay try right thing. Government mandate suddenly, mandatory lost pay one afford. one going voluntarily put bills rent jeopardy. 

But unfair judge everyone make choice ""the right thing"" homelessness, call us selfish everyone thread would walk hell keep families streets. When’s last time something half-ass amazing results? Yeah, exactly Nationwide

Itd service blue collar community suffering retaliating hardest  appreciate humor think glorious right word redditor said clickbait lazy upvote bait! /s Oh wait Karen's hear Colleges: Hold beer bong Cindy Stuart voted wanted accommodations put place vulnerable voting close schools. Melissa Snively one actually pro killing children. also voted mask mandate. live eastern Hillsborough County, sure vote out. truly awful narcissist. state farm business website literally melissrules.com Absolutely could case. increases deaths hospital systems strained. People less likely go ER chest pain hospital overflowing. Based situation US, seems like minority still way larger rest world, even still strictly speaking minority. Europe way slow first wave. Tell evidence I’ll know you’re troll. cases reduced small amount don’t need mass testing. like countries small number cases, able test less based rigid contact tracing fast test results. proof pneumonia cases. 

It’s dishonest say cases higher merely it’s tested more. Look hospitals. Look deaths. 1 every 2000 humans died, would mean 3.9 million died. Let sink  Sorry, you’re wrong. Also, I’d rather 80% protection 5%. fuck right off. unprecedented situation started China. media ""experts"" pushed false narratives start. First tell us masks bad, they're good. tell us fine dance around Chinatown (Pelosi) ""Plain statistics"" rather weak argument strong statement equal number false positives false negatives. create test different number one 5 seconds, called ""tells everyone it"" example. age bracket teachers? US even kindergarten teachers places tend older. ONE dying something containable preventable.

COVID neither. things reduce risk, eliminate it. 20k compared fucking millions US. Like difference staggering mask protect wearer. Without gown, gloves, goggles/shield, N95 needless discomfort. Yes. Teacher less. need three things save us 2021
1. Partial immunity massive outbreak
2. Tens millions doses vaccine ready distribution
3. administration actually gives shit fighting virus ""It magically disappear"" didn’t even calculate incorrect statistic correctly. Remember multiply 100 dividing two numbers. Ohio State considers Michigan rival. goin hospital bandaid tho? I’m sorry cousin’s &amp; family’s loss. can’t imagine pain ya’ll feeling right now. lot people going take seriously hits close home them. know family lost 3 members one weekend 2 wound ICU others suffered home. know another family lost grandparent last week suffered weeks. neighbor described feeling like could use top third lungs, said felt like drowning body. scared contacted middle night alone wanted someone know going case got worse. anti-maskers put jail house arrest putting people’s lives jeopardy. rated key factor. Hospitals filling despite lack summer increase kids sports injuries Pick 3 1 1000 chance. absolutely buy that? compare Sweden neighbours?
They totally different economies, market structure, population, city populations, general population much movement people country...

Would compare belgium germany?
Or Luxemburg beligum?
No...

Compare nation similar economic structure alteast... Nobody said virus gone now, made up. said cant use overall deaths fairly compare countries responses cause virus reached US good month later consequently able learn treatment victims Europe. 

In last couple months however treatment options improved drastically. Let put way. US hit first, death rate would least twice high more. Sturgis brooo one teams might consider Michigan biggest rival MSU. Could go Walmart pick tube Neosporin pay that? 872,595 people died heart disease cancer year compared 165k coronavirus. oh, wish competent leaders worldwide. good ones whole bunch idiots good. Apparently Ireland hasn’t banned us yet. person deserves die Covid sitting Oval Office unless US makes major course corrections respect health care, science literacy economy, we’re getting started. 

Had Bernie 2016, US would much better state cope pandemic many dead would alive now. Spain's response neither fast good. Plus, time Italy already PRETTY bad, Lombardy region fucked health system collapsed, majority (or least -very- vocal minority) saying shit like ""meh, health system trash. best"". includes nurses doctors, influenced common people think way.

I understand taking virus seriously China. read first Financial Times January 21, tbh looked like serious shit even back then. taking seriously neighboring country similar behaviors similar health systems...

I'll give seem great foreign PR though. incredible perspective genocide governent (and main political parties, 'sides') commited differs locals foreigners. Must mass media mass media. Yeah... I’ve noticed same. There’s sizable section population take shit seriously unless someone know gets it. Hell even survive might say, “I survived. Stop wuss”. 
It’s absolutely mind blowing many people lack tiny amount empathy needed right thing right now. 

That said, side definitely shown solidarity empathy. Communities helping risk members more. Money donated. Etc. It’s easy focus negative, lot us really come together. 

This hurt feelings towards humanity, good things I’ve seen kept flame going little bit. 150 000 die everyday. Bay Ridge Brooklyn here. Outdoors people without masks with. Indoors masks lot dick noses supermarkets. fucking stupid don’t think least hope people don’t share opinion? word, no. states many people don’t care something affects personally. Please know everyone feels way it’s enough mess things up. find places super slow internet like artificially slow WiFi down. Ya know can't accept places really shitty internet likely fast Fiber. Even large grocery store like Safeway find WiFi inside slow nearly useless. slurred hasn’t slurred words long I’ve known (20yrs, Sunday afternoon hadnt drinking), said ‘I’m calling 911’ reaction, sat stared me, didn’t say ridiculous. 10minutes took EMT’s arrive lost left side, paralyzed completely &amp; left side face drooped watched. EMT’s Firemen tried help stand, couldn’t. lift &amp; strapped big rolly wheelchair thing, strapped forehead, top chest, legs. transferred ambulance, took hospital. called 911, said ‘I think husband stroke. 16yr old daughter came lifted arms, left arm immediately fell, couldn’t hold up. firemen asked pain, tapped right temple, large blood clot (Right Cerebral Artery). took one hospital, gave tPA (33,000$ one dose, stroke drug breaks blood clots), didn’t work. sent ambulance another hospital, tPA made throw up... pretty much ambulance. (I wasn’t there, wasn’t allowed go COVID, contact Dr’s remembers small parts it). surgery groin, take teensy tiny claw machine &amp; go groin, heart, brain, yank clot out. stopped breathing &amp; intubated, clot came out, started breathing again. regained left side quickly, less awareness it. would things like put legs one leg pants &amp; trouble figuring wrong. couldn’t dress days. wasn’t allowed tie shoes developed bleed brain tPA blood rushing head could kill him. awhile needed help, daughter &amp; helped (he sent home Neuro ICU 2 days). Normally transfer another floor ICU recovery, COVID &amp; experience CNA, sent home. lives 95% normally now, stroke neurologist says recovery ‘Fantastic’ definitely moments gets frustrated.

So seriously, see someone stroke symptoms, *call 911*. 

Slurring, face drooping, hold arms &amp; tell hold &amp; one drops, *call 911*. saved life, would dead without treatment. forget include stadium holding 330000000 people though. hardly lockdown make point. even though lots people played around younger kids somewhat lockdown least awhile. lockdown play date pods whole schools. believe Sweden least social distances possible. open something over. go half way, think bars pack out. 150 000 people die everyday. pandemic literally made extra day death since march Nothing, example normalcy remained. reported deaths. Nice works. look evidence high levels child-child child-teacher transmission schools find little evidence it, whilst finding evidence adult-adult adult-child transmission, suggests something different happening regards transmission children.

Because schools closed.

Duh. Absolutely not. There’s many people mold symptoms didn’t get tested asymptomatic it’s asinine claim death rate actually HIGHER reported. anything it’s significantly lower. We’ll see it’s over. I’m sure there’ll plenty studies. China telling truth? surprises me.  would share secret success.... put context little bit, 1 100 people die annually causes. could (in part certainly is) addition (we know they're tracking Corona deaths live, can't compare, there'scertainly crossover though nobody talks much) since there's 1.2 births per 100 people annually equals some. 

Not trying downplay corona feel like 1 2,000 sounds bigger actually is. either case, compassionate others. 0.05% 350mil 175,000. deaths even reported, likely higher **349,825,000** know folks healthcare mostly work soldiers vets attending parties, going bars, traveling hard hit areas visit friends, hookup 4 times week different partners, visit parents grandparents. I’m amazed haven’t caught yet behavior it’s guaranteed happen eventually. Think lottery chance winning jackpot 1/2000 chance dying.. Would pretty big jackpot buy in! Yeah, people don’t take care themselves. Number 1 problem public health. That's know YouTube videos pre post covid Dude deleted post...was posting propaganda kind kids exist everywhere world.. lots studies expert opinions agree article

THERE STUDIES. NOBODY STUDIED KIDS SCHOOL CLOSED SCHOOLS.

Fucking stupid people think we've trials research last months.

There virtually zero legitimate medical studies happening right now, sure hell legitimate ones *finished already*. case every country...? think under-reporting covid deaths unique US thing 'Tis 'tis Trumps thinking even one stadium, got thousands stadium US, stadium best, even much people. btw payout $12 0.05% died? That's fantastic news actually. great hear anyone know gets sick generally 99.95% chance recover fine. see way offshoring really hurts besides jobs lost. saw approach stranger kindness would buy groceries ask course. Masks worn properly diligently pretty effective especially coupled distancing. mean say there's something learning/experience curve wearing correctly etc. We're human new, foreign habit takes practice. rated comment

Have upvote. I’m ER nurse. Well, maybe, Covid-19 worried about. social isolation also huge risk children. Likely much higher risk C-19.
 
Here article discusses easy answers. knowledge protest Western Europe. compare USA... *that* Easter magically goes away?  Yeah think it'll normalised. 8 months, mask wearing mandatory couple months common see since March. 

So like 5 months, exactly ""My whole world view shattered, mask wearing isolation remember, world distant memory"", unless toddler goldfish. line thinking going age well advice masks unnecessary. Either something really wrong data I'm stupid. 

They 25 cases first week January one whole year? Covid wasnt even thing Florida jan/Feb, cases affected lockdown. 

I'm covid denialist btw. Nordic countries level afford open schools. U.S. not. Better? would hard maintain charade ""student athletes"" put bubble.

More importantly, thought purpose ""student athletes"" pay - spend lot money bubble defeating purpose. always like imagine 'my hometown' big number. 50,000 people. every person ever met hometown sixteen years, every person never met, every person houses, stores, every teacher, every classmate. many people died. again. again.

That 150,000 died fucking appalling. 52 times amount people killed 9/11. It’s like 9/11 week whole year. Look dies. mostly old, frail people. Weird. country lock lower death rate UK, Italy, France, Belgium, Hungary, Netherlands, Spain, Canada. lock down. Weird.... many people died Sweden compared neighbors dude? Lead water. BBC accurately reporting Education Secretary said. news report - actually *read* it, know that.

The *actual* title article Little evidence Covid transmission schools, says Williamson Thanks share. I've looking something data set. virus became politicized. People refused wear masks social distance believe it’s Constitutional right to. Refusing science denying pandemic became way show support idiot president. complete lack federal leadership allowed states whatever wanted many chose open back way, way early. Nobody enforcing mask distancing orders even exist. People scream “the flu worse!” don’t understand statistics. People twist ignore death count feel invincible don’t care others, justifying stupidity selfishness declaring old, obese, POC dying droves, cares them? doesn’t even take account reckless way Trump sycophants handled virus. opinion they’re murderers.

Basically large enough number citizens politicians selfish, stupid, anti-science bigots render efforts rest us pretty much useless comes containing beating COVID. bound get MUCH MUCH worse. According mathematical models, one mutation, least 200 million dead USA alone, based current policy guidelines. point trying make?

TB isn’t big deal first world, it’s widely talked here. Around 500 people went untreated died US last year vs 160000 people months covid. described feel. work church web developer. could job home, I'm forced come in.  Everyone views situation differently. Assuming person you’re replying US like am, it’s pretty fuckin scary living clearly one true power help gives fuck die. Excluding civil war WWII, we’ve surpassed death count every war US fought combined, passed death toll pacific theater way deaths WWII. you’re US conscientious aware.

Plus didn’t say permanently going see things way, expressed concern children learning developmental social skills period, unfortunately it’s going last probably another year year half vaccines distributed enough reach herd immunity. 

I personally reaction media, like it’s obvious something pre-covid, time it’s relatable least bit, watch youtube current content made.

I hope someday, preferably sooner later, everyone realize terrible event continues be. definitely affect children negatively, sending school failing right bat know what’s worse getting lesser education home remotely? peers teachers dying, children catch it, feeling potentially responsible death loved family member. Time open schools /s fuck looking current trends give accurate view big picture then, idiot?

Would say Italy New york Spain fine numbers 3 months ago forgotten? fuckin stupid ass


Everything fine guys called ""the herd"" guy declares last 2 months relevant. That's entire city gone. 150,000 respectable populace medium sized city. death rate keeps going significantly daily. retarded, obviously. shitpost reddit working.  No, government giving extra money places corona virus cases. amount backed government 100%. someone died corona, instead money adjusted insurance companies getting paid hospital, government pays it. money = cases. Wearing mask, going stores touching things everyone else does, adjusting mask face 100 times doesn’t help keep people getting sick. /s much needed. go lol. People sincerely arguing that, know?

I'm nurse keep point things medical system make conspiracy like one impossible. (Covid different clinical presentation pneumonias. million physicians, good luck getting agree anything, let alone vast unethical ""money-making"" scheme (not actually $$ work either.) THREE million nurses guarantee would sit back batting eyelashes like, ""Sure whatever say doc! Tee hee."")

It's ridiculous face yet idiots really believe it. would convincing argue mask based “not sick”

I think arguing. like believe entire races looked singular group, believe homeless people either. homeless people interest job content whatever please?. course. ones legit bad things happen want get back feet?. course. assuming guy(and homeless) falls second group, guessing defient attitude falls first. area better lot others, I’m still super cautious going much. can’t imagine Florida right now, well aware danger, taking precautions, seeing idiots don’t care. 

Best luck you. Stay safe thing gets still number people go, oh, 1% die etc, effect worse course ""it's rubbish, made disease"". society get stupid? Jesus Christ, never go full conspiracy nut.

Our scientists (both European US) already sure virus artificially created, lab. Like Corona viruses animal human transmission.

And throw moronic things like ""AI"" regards virus around. nothing that, know, I'm software developer. Ireland please. love tourism hugely important us tourists badly effected countries welcome. 50plus, Latina, 300 lbs, diabetic. see. Sure thing bub. news stories that? weird longer think crazy Bill Gates might actually kind demon, lizard person instead human?

🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 50plus, Latina, 300 lbs, diabetic. see. husband spoke cousin Florida last presidential election said husband voted. never forget that. angry. Like else do? know it’s something could fit day. disinterested. husband gave stern talking to. moved Florida Georgia last year living consequences actions real time. I’ll ask call remind vote time. Parts Iran 40% seroprevalence they're getting slammed 2md wave.

Where's herd immunity?

You're missing point thread. behavioral changes combined small amount innate immunity population dropping R 1.

If went back pre-pandemic behaviors (no masks, everything open, distancing) virus would go back spreading like wildfire.

Even without lockdowns people's behavior changes fear. Woo inheritance! wrong sort threat made via phone call internet traceable? enough covid19 patients test on, that's why. #sufferingfromwinning know. Democrats sick people. agree disagree. view -

Forgetting empathy great way forget forget people human, usually genuine intentions, counts much. sad there's much misinformation manipulation going on, every human susceptible degree. way complex ""Conservative bad.""

And also, making very, very, **\*\*\*very\*\*\*** dumb choices directly causing suffering &amp; deaths hundreds thousands Americans. crosses line - intention makes difference arena. takes reconsider views, needs happen sooner later, protect innocent people.

I hope survive, fuck them. fellow students making threats need suspended period. Kids also dumb easy catch . Again. You’re engaging manipulation propaganda. 

No one denying virus. 

You’re claiming lie order defend propaganda. Coronavirus death sentence 

It’s 5 percent fatality rate symptomatic positive cases it’s 
A10-15 percentage disability rate post recovery cases study tested 14 different face masks, including N95 mask used mostly health care professionals. mask tested 10 times, time test began person speaking without mask comparison. different masks used

Article goes show 14 masks, none gaiters.

Why saying ""11""? Whisper ""hail Hydra"" ear Lol anti mask/COVID folks going far bullying teenage girls. 

What scum. paired anti-intelectuallism. Hopefully come tell us normals wear mask. also add, divide haves have-nots wide deep. got well compensated professional people, everyone else. I've seen lot discussion wealthier families taking learning pod environments concert small number families. gently suggested nextdoor.com someone looking set five child learning pod, four wealthy families pay open fifth slot low income child. Surprise surprise, gotten lot feedback one way suggestion.

I tell I'm pretty thrilled school age children this. literally easy answers. Also Democratic Party turned Covid political began trying blame spread President Trump state governments. Source counting antibody test? kids 2.5-4 (the two years kindergarten). lot it’s difficult even tolerate shoes hair cut. that’s come in. It’s basically part job de-sensitive them... that’s I’m doing.. since nonprofit funded grants donations; I’m taking chance since school isn’t providing it. supposedly lexicon set proposal accepted. don’t think it’s enough protection staff.


They say kids 10 big carriers adults too. kids k-12 required masks though (we NY we’ve normalized part). Americans care, republicans not. Republicans aren’t Americans represent Americans. Unfortunately they’re still we’re hoping Russia embrace Putin embraces Trump January flees. Anonymity upvote/downvote mechanisms emboldens people reddit confront disinformation. Yes, many toxic communities continue use ban mechanisms, many downvote others disagree with, even/especially participating civil, evidence based argument.

But dysfunctional Facebook, I'm wary calling moron aunts uncles know I'll eventually see again. fact virus different different areas gives governments even worry say opening schools one place country state closing another good optics really need lose 10lbs. bmi 24.3 puts normal rate range. gained muscle, likely gain weight would probably considered overweight bmi standards really use bmi measuring body fat/healthy weight everyone. Nurses keeping paper bags reusing PPE low. sure best approach report based schools reopened summer, fraction pupils (15% max), empty classrooms available plenty social distancing. extrapolate upcoming situation packed corridors classrooms 33 pupils idea. last recession beyond grim. spent good chunk twenties absolutely dirt broke. definitely left mark even though circumstances much improved. everything get sucked lifestyle creep, large debt keeping Jones's. make journalism information enemy, make freedom liberty enemy. 
have fun controlled, idiot. hope enjoy feeling overlords enter you. That’s obviously bank robbers wear mask! death reason, covid whole bunch results like scars heart worth that? money could went decent virtual option least 3 months. 3 months virtual would probably cost less 2 days disinfecting everything.... y'all going every week, bet. US, much virus little contact tracing really hard investigate spread school, versus brought school.

Logically, though, school causes indoor gatherings large groups people, maskless South, hours hours day. fail see increase community spread. nail coffin *could easily* November year. ""There evidence H2H transmission"". Apparently Make America Great order rather promise Snowflake never narrowed time frame.

Other 99.95% managed stay alive despite oh deadly virus.

Back basement now. Ivs used variety reason. Technically dont admister medication get IV. could admister .9% sodium, banana bag potassium replace electrolytes number things. [Sweden w/ lockdown vs Illinois w/ lockdown money Columbus Day weekend. get wrong, lot us care.

Tack like 10 20 bucks need it, friend. ""let"" education go shit. education provided us political class intentionally dumbed since 70s. Corporate America saw hippy movement black power movement thought ""fuck, taught many people think critically blindly support wars racist, classist policies home"". 


The ruling class needs good little worker bees put head question whether there's better way whole 'society' thing. they've (especially south Midwest) dumbed schools combatted teaching critical thinking masses shuttling kids elite private schools become next generation 'leaders'. tried look what's available county Virginia. They've long-standing partnership substantially reduced cost internet access families qualify. partnership Cox communications, qualifying families get internet $9.95 month. work different non-profit partnership provide free internet access families can't afford substantially reduced cost access.

What find, mean exist, means site hard navigate, covid specific free internet devices etc.

This area super technology focused. majority professional white collar workers tend work information technology either contractors federal government federal government itself. they've always little forward-leaning access technology generally income levels area.

The problem tackling kids received free reduced school breakfast lunches. They've turned function Virginia department social services kids school program still get benefit kids actually school. CDC absolutely produced approved list mask designs materials.

They did, state (Tennessee) steady increases metrics (new cases, hospitalizations, deaths, etc etc) like 2-3 weeks ago weird inflection point leveled started declining even though haven’t seen significant change behavior schools going back now. Strangely enough, inflection point corresponds almost exactly HHS started requiring data reported directly instead CDC. don’t trust anyone anymore. passed 5 million cases large portion population doesn’t think real. don’t go r/conspiracy deny climate change complain Bill Gates True, remember masked right away also, probally stopped right tracks. wonder Uniited States started mass mask wearing January, along mass tracing testing, would now?  Option 2 right way. county said cases need 4 per 100,000 open. way open liklyhood outbreaks lower.

That said zip codes county equal, many meet metric now, others 15. Kinda weird keeps getting overlooked comparisons...... surgical nurse wears n95 mask every 10 hour shift, hilarious. 11 referring rivalry distrust US Russia specifically, cold war whole. Proxies whooooolllleeeee different kettle fish yeah, I'm disputing racism ""they're brown people, cares screw country?"" would say don’t care, entire family mostly thinks it’s fake everyone work thinks it’s bullshit ...

People ridiculous I’m middle. 

I understand deadly, especially older compromised. fully agree everyone wearing mask. heard family members masks (same ones boycotted NFL kneeling course) don’t understand big deal wearing masks. I’ve taken two 4 hour CPA exams on, fine. 

But hand, don’t think it’s something shut for. truth death rate maybe 0.2% targets specific people. US horrific job protecting vulnerable (looking Cuomo Wolf) death count high. Regarding arguments “young people die” “long term effects”. reports young people dying conditions heart, spine, immune problems. SAYING it’s ok die, need better protecting them, goes back bad done protecting vulnerable. Covid disease potentially cause long term damage. flu Pneumonia cause long term damage. may outliers, course, still uncommon. 

Also, want football 😫

Main point: Mask wearing across board, shouldn’t shut down. Chile. 

We currently way reporting compared neighbors. alarming number people going Florida summer vacations, planned, children.

Tennessee checking in. know local general practice doctor he's mentioned literally 100% patients tested positive COVID gotten back Florida. Oh suspensions A's coming.  Astros get slap wrist though. Chile. currently way reporting compared neighbors. Yes *logically* think compare deaths within timeframes circumstances. dont care 2 months, less. starting point same. Thats science works. think young men likely laid result lockdown policies middle age men, young women, single women children ...

I think particular, people children likely affected, laid also often cut hours etc work due schools closed. I’m middle.

Paramedics police came scene. paramedics said he's badly wounded needs go hospital asap. Police says, ""Wait! need investigate man dies!""

Of course say, ""Mr. Policeman, get fucked. husband dying"". Neck fleeces, also known gaiter masks, least effective all

but study tested 14 different face masks

The article picture 14 different types masks tested, 0 neck gaiters. article goes say neck gaiters bad.

""Europeans astonished"", ""Europeans say"", asking random people questions newsworthy? Americans care Europeans think them. European countries different approaches deal coronavirus. consistent ""European"" standard. Idk asked questions aside Twitter crowd Europe (less 1% population) nobody would say that. Instead they’ll tell government failed us. lockdowns one thing: bolster Amazon, Uber eats alike. everything opened 2 months, people still buying internet since habituated 3 months lockdown. People aren’t going much. Amazon Uber made billions lockdown still now, 1/3 HoReCa industry Brussels already closed good. 
The little people, working class got fucked billion dollars companies got richer. work restaurant used make 8-9k day busiest street Brussels. now, barely make 2k. Half people fired, half working hours cut half firings come next week. 
So... good job ! America isn’t weak, America strong. inconsiderate governments ! say want help poor via social programs successfully made us poorer ! unemployment benefits fraction salary (70% salary minus 28% income taxes). barely pay rent ! much socialism. Talking Americans stripe chore, miss fucking chance point free similar things happening time, fair. Edit: pandemic know mean Apparently wrong enough Europeans still article written.


I'm Floridian. shocked anyone still looked us role model really anything. Intelligence = communism/radicalism

Authoritarianism accept hick towns ""... also shitty person.""

Wasn't talking you. 

Don't take anger me!

Lots people took unpaid internships worked part-time back then. least take anger others! whole thing exposed terrible idea politicians make public health decisions. Almost like need board medical professionals overrule governors mayors stop making dumb ass decisions line pocketbooks kill people. must eat incredibly fast spend 95% time restaurant eating/drinking/doing something can't mask on. 9/11, bipartisan support War. People joining military. NFL players giving lucrative careers serve country. People gave personal liberties could ""safe"" flying planes. New York Los Angeles, coast coast, people supporting war. 

Worldwide support different matter. even US vocal minority, like Bernie rallying another war. generally speaking, supported. let get straight...

In world view small towns true population centers everyone flocking to, soon everyone starts moving said small town, residents move make another small town? the.....

After 4 months trying convince Covid really killing people, I'm used disagreeing reality. Totally agree. let's hope get done...and quickly! exact mindset conflict...

No maskers people want rights protected think they’re good protecting fellow Americans rights liberties. pro mask believe they’re protecting public health.

Wishing death either side ? Well part problem you’re extremist.. extremism never unites anyone. unite people education understanding.  Ok, much understandable realistic. BTW, know government think I'm under, think I'm China? ""Oh yeah, look real tough open nose throat"" - Bill Burr don’t sound obsessed either.. threw up. Fuck. Wow sister have. best.

Mad’m, you’re listening...

Fuck’em. Well want catch give Rona.


It's like Schrodinger's Covid-19. know, everyone it, everyone it. want catch it, give it, chill weeks. way people know start dropping dead.

In stead got Freedumbs, upset yet, everyone else come play them.  Hey speed US seeing cases, getting people exposed virus getting vaccine problem. often listen Covid briefings? Payroll taxes directly fund social security medicare. already plenty financial trouble looming programs trust funds regularly raided government spending decades. Basically, payroll taxes witheld today fund social security medicare payments NEAR FUTURE people receiving benefits. mathematically possible social security medicare could go bankrupt. course gov tack hundred billion new debt cover shortfall shouldnt happen first place. Fake virus. Fake pandemic. 5g bill gates. Guess aint sharpest tool shed. Yes climate changing, one saying isn't. one said changing either... debate much humans contributing. always debate. 

The data support humans contributing, that's debatable aspect. We've gone similar rapid changes they're common. I'm sure aware of. climate scientist also aware rapid pole change happening weakening magnetosphere impacts entire planet changes weather patterns. 

Look way, last 35 years climate science failed make single accurate prediction we've discovered Higgs Boson private companies going space. Get back tens millions computer simulations based flawed data comes back accurate prediction. tested positive, expect? results come back negative nose swab test doctor still orders urine test, blood count chest x-ray another nose swab test you’re waiting see get blood drawn? didn’t request originally?!

I elevated temperatures two days 103 fine now, taste, smell, breathe fine, temp 97-98. headaches, body aches. I’ve literally work home since March.

I thought likely Crohn’s Disease inflammation figured I’d get COVID test way everyone treating like got COVID even though came back negative?

Is dude trying nickel dime insurance? wanted get blood test done inflammation levels man GI requested/faxed Physician’s office got COVID test done won’t asked COVID test came back negative! asked tested COVID-19, wanted rule out, running tests feel fine!

I see people go monthly COVID tests safe they’re essential workers... It’s shown best non-medical masks 100% cotton. Oh no, please no, unless trolling? extremely untrue. Please expand horizons switch BBC! wonder causal arrow goes direction. Maybe adopt value set outward appearance value. self-worth entirely based appear, bound insecure yourself, see moments one else does. ongoing. Many universities requiring people show two weeks early, many already done migration. example, states universities students moved now. see you’ve downvoted comment truth concern opinion. thrilled think military involved distributing this. Right country little sensitive militarization police, look forward militarization health care?? schools reopening without first managing curb community transmission, wait three four weeks they'll again. majority people we’ve kick store work wanna tough guys. 2008, 2014, 2020. fucking graduated college 2006. barely paid student loans still heavily debt. Good times eh value 100k depends person's situation live. Im single live income 30k per year still money left every month expenses paid. made 100k Id living luxury. Im also Charlotte NC. 100k would make feel wealthy. someone NY 100k trash, someone raising family 100k enough.

Trickle economics doesnt work though, many people uneducated brainwashed, believe companies make money, pay employees more. load bullshit. look pandemic example. Jeff Bezos made records profits, yet given anything employees. Elon Musk thing. Blizzard Entertainment reported records profits billions, meanwhile laid 800 employees known paying shitty wages.

Too many people believe ""if minimum wage goes up, everything expensive!"" flawed mindset..... inflation going wages not. People fail see wealth hoarded.

A healthy economy trickles up. money pocket shop/spend. less money less shop/spend. know.

Particularly pandemic taking place. things work. go up, go down. vaccine? happening Portland suggests otherwise. ask question. whole world desperate doctors right now... Yes. Yes. schools started last week. Population immunity certainly growing. People think I'm anti-masks I'm really not. work effectiveness really over-stated.

Most CA masks orders since April May. opened little cases, deaths, hospitalizations began rise.

They help slow spread cure all. Right. Instead, let's system one expectations beyond feudal serf. show em. every island well NZ, never said islands contain virus need contain island. 2 points countries compared similar countries (so it’s fair compare islands islands) it’s easier islands contain virus non-islands. country doesn’t island contain obvious reasons it’s easier. 

One Hawaii’s problems it’s state country can’t exactly cut rest states. really listening this, really point idea vaccines even work, released. Also depends Moderna finishes vaccine, since RNA vaccine, vastly easier vaccinate country. Fingers crossed COVID. Best luck guys I'm sorry situation.

Also, may want report business OSHA tests positive still make come in. Really August? sure will. want life back normal. want concerts, etc. back. want able go life usually would without fear contracting virus worse, passing anyone else. *Nothing* worse this. Inject whatever want long means over. non area. 20 total cases since March. Right, cuz I've seen hundreds videos shart haired men asking see manager, refusing wear masks... Wait, that'd Karens, I've seen small handful videos men refusing wear masks.

Regardless, care?! virus systematically targeting ignorant, let kill em. September? Dude, go tomorrow. Ok fuck Americans Meanwhile Australia... I'm doctor, that's boss told me. I'm saying right, guess there's reason lie this. smash mouth desperate? peddled back yeah, mostly wearing masks top maskless like said. Sit back enjoy facts. still can't believe health care treated like business. fair, masks really work cargo shorts confederate flag tank top. We’ll see September comes unions oppose surely teachers won’t come in? case, covid final nail coffin major health issues years. condition, pnuemonia ailment could taken down. mean couple bigger amongst millenials possibly even younger millenials that. saying many peaked 90's even 80's.  Sure, lots times.  SARS example mostly reach US, CDC tracking concerned it. MERS.

Trump, hand, listen *today* someone tells 165,000 people died year virus. It’s way months now. u really think much flu season given isolation masks? schools session kids greatest vector won’t issue. district seems front loading lot technology training kids expectation shut sooner rather later. way, shut go remote, won’t shitshow like last March we’ll actually know what’s going on. I’m absolutely certain remote point. I’m worried many people get sick call it. Guessing, his/her foot probably gravely injured duty. led mental health deficits, likely addition crap military go also cause mental health deficits.  every American died covid, nine died something else. Good evil, they're middle ground. take longer pass stage 3 trials they're rarely done middle pandemic hot zones world... cases means quicker phase 3's.

They take longer mass produce vaccine manufacturer would willingly produce something at-risk avoided... government picked tab one. Dude, soon. body ready (I live Auckland). someone graduated Silicon Valley high school 2004, totally get mean. friends high school millionaires. listened parents went engineering, software development, medicine.

On hand, absolutely recognize minority. talk peers age company. Outside tech department, employees age struggling. Articles like popular vast majority Americans financially well off.

But also bit frustrating none news millennials apply you. would assume California recent health official step  systemic racism

I agree everything said this. People taught racist, lots people racist. That’s good school. Universities expected feeders Corporates, graduates expect paid fairly. course, corporatists try conflate every breath want lowest price “good enough.” looking? work public every day see maybe 80 1000 people without mask. We're litterally wearing much anyone else. type reports helping anyone, distracting us real problems. county MD supports well. producing far less new cases based population state whole. Whereas producing double cases April compared population.

Mask wearing also good helps. Today day drove 50 miles get tested. Results 2 days. Yes, something else account for, right. lost development early years starting look like necessary sacrifice save lives, really want stress everyone **it way** know blame. like idea anything sort either, *somebody* essentially forced us consider ridiculous alternatives failures. Good finally come senses Prayers all, must rough. hard times everybody, others. Even coming together harder, share struggles share support interesting take away seeing decline wellness checks vaccine appointments. influenza season coming soon scary me. One consequences really considering, find really concerning. dark like -Homelander, Deadpool Women allways told beautifull eyes. really comment parts face. whole mask working quite well me. mental health problems covid leave wake insanely high costly society. know therapists psychologists already sounded alarm looming mental health crisis. It’s much number teams bubble, it’s length time teams spend bubble.

NHL &amp; NBA - teams already eliminated soon be, exit bubble get back families. follow round passes. another month so, 4 teams remaining league, remains worthwhile teams they’re 8 wins away championship?

In NFL MLB, you’d asking teams enter remain bubble FAR longer maybe get playoffs. imagine guys teams start 0-5 sitting thinking, man, gotta ride another 3 months (away home, family freedom whatever want) zero chance making playoffs?

On related note, would surprised NBA doesn’t use opportunity shift spring/summer schedule permanently. moves away overlapping NFL NHL would competing MLB. Right now, compete three leagues even seasons. 330,000,000 pop / 166,000 dead = 20,000. 


Not 2000. 1 20,000. 


Still, bad statistic.

Edit: bad!!! 1 2000.  Holy fuck... Yeah caught back March sort moderate exercise wheezing coughing. sucks :( agree masks worthwhile science supports that? that’s case, won’t condemn protesters largest spreader anti-mask propaganda? Shit. figured seemed really thin; although supposed also block UV. 

Fortunately, mostly used keep regular paper mask sealed face. think want. shots 🤷‍♀️ irony border still closed unless returning NZ citizen, granted exemption economic purposes (sigh, like Avatar film crew). It’s five months. can’t say forever. Lung injuries slow recover. blood clots lungs July 2007 took good six months wasn’t winded time, another six months pulmonologist say recovered, I’d say like 18 months really felt like myself. 

My neighbor nurse caught Covid back April May. don’t remember ago. *still* hear coughing fits sometimes. I’m going sit say boss doesn’t still issues. won’t even say they’ll probably go away soon. *will* say lot people may effects last year’s, I’m sold permanent didn’t even know Covid existed year ago. union opposing it’s still happening Sometimes makes people dig heels, do? They'll run cliff agree run faster don't. say that, hurt deniers feelings. decide look stupid inconsiderate instead? Tsk tsk. care look like complete dumbfucks? How's Hawaii doing? Hint: hot.

[Hawaii's inter-island quarantine returns Tuesday state reports 200+ new cases per sure emotional-social well-being argument reopening. Yes, kid might prom, how's mental health going fare friends teachers start dying? ""No country testing insanity won’t talk fixing it, think need keep acting like they’ve done competent job""

**stares Ireland** mean we’re already 20 million cases 735k deaths.. doesn’t take genius see we’ll hit 750k soon Oh mean Italy "" Got got it. People really now, even though work pay taxes, expect get something back trouble. couple co workers (both single moms) decided rent apartment together, work opposite shifts, watch other's kids skip daycare online school. life hoped worked for, they're making work. Mid-south informal geographic area around Memphis. Kamala born Senetobia, MS.

Nothing insulting, fact, quite opposite - source effectively calling hometown guy. One article written women’s mental health emotional burden, claim narrative silly? get it! Go find articles men read. read consider point! Either contribute real point article keep scrolling. Pay children good grades??? might worst thing I've ever heard. punish children dont skills kids? Grades often little student effort natural skills. Add that, many elementary schools dont even use grading anymore due flaws system age group. Also paying parents stay home wont fix problem. Many parents home kids choose log worth battle. choice forcing log things house destroyed choose easier option. think sometimes live utopian society arent behavioral students students IEPs. mention since beginning experts predicted 2nd wave fall. sounds worse really is. imagine lot they're better job screening people virus seeking testing. Also, funny media likes jump around numbers report. number new cases ""unimpressive"" they'll focus percent positive tests instead high number vice versa. LOL. Hey, never said Easter. Lmao! Horseshit keep moving god damn goal posts. think central power eradicate virus human biome completely? fool. She’s fighting since April? Jfc also reaction Trump seen NATO, Europe Russia, US trustworthy used be. yea, attitude Trump success Russia China, pushes allies away US. information says voted ""man""? hell downvotes anything Swedish? I'm saying nothing looking weak. men average, lazier less compliant rules. Yep, may try. players aren’t idiots lot power. families too. So, think good chance right thing shut given disaster seen baseball non contact sport. 8.4 million NYC. saying... OK. I'll grant that. People killed bizarre insistence governors NY, NJ, PA, MI CA force covid+ patients back nursing homes worse off. dumb kill someone's Grandma new test manliness guess. also looking leaving country. read Canada slammed calls Americans wanting move since covid outbreak. They've mentioning hair loss thing every week TWIV lately, clinical updates portion actress posted video brushing hair clean brush washing tresses. brushes, hair started come heavy volume.

It's interesting CNN blacklisted sub Foxnews ... President epitome western insecurity, yea, problem... Corrupt, greedy, cruel. Every time wrong, they've doubled down. Spiderman wears mask. gave commenting post, everyone wants point change without stating details. Hey /u/ursusthecub,

You literally went karma farm get around rules prevent trolling, specifically pollute /r/chicago subs.

Here's post: ""[Literally need karma comment account showing 3 years old, never ever commented anything literally yesterday, started trolling hard /r/coronavirus /r/chicago.

Odd. 🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔 Arizona continues see declines cases, hospitalizations, deaths. 

Stats yesterday (note: Sunday stats, weekend stats. Tomorrow might little robust)

Compliments updated chart new AZ COVID cases last months (with today's data): Cases: 7-day avg continues fall, spread decreasing. track for: 200K cases August 21, 5,000 deaths August Testing: Post backlog clearing, test demand low. 54K tests shy 60K. (21 days left ""Project Catapult"" supposedly pushes 60K capacity.)

 Overall PCR positive test percentage dropped 14.1% 14.0% (based 1.026M tests, 6.6% low) average last week stayed 9% (based 43K tests, previous week Hospital Utilization: COVID Hospitalizations dropped 3%. ICU beds COVID patients dropped 1%. (Overall ICU bed usage dropped 83% 81%). Ventilators use COVID dropped 2%. Intubations Respiratory Distress stayed triple digits Data Source: ADHS

About 6800 tests administered yesterday 600 positive. last seven days, PCR around 7%. Well like wanted way. One first things current president Mexico said ‘this pandemic going fought staying home, going hospitals’. somehow expected. unfortunate expected. government sending mixed signals along. local town infested non-mask wearing tourists, matter time cases start creep up

(I live rural England)

I saw around 100 people huddled together, distancing, big groups around 5 people wearing masks

It hell even panic attack scary Covid test displaying symptoms. daughter home husband go work. stays home result negative, fire missing much work. stays home test positive, absence count praise safe. Agreed. loved ones deceased should. Let kill violent parasites society however slowly cruelly like.

When Checnya descented version sharia law early 2000s, let victims family kill criminal using murder weapon original crime. Maybe ideal mordern, perfect Pacifists place justice system, cease exist someone brutally kills someone care for.

Neither morons operates false dichotomy either chop head set free. Yes, point neither serious, well known movies respective actor. part fascist script. nitpick find activists mortal offense. Every monumental -or even deadly- blunder ""conservative"" misunderstanding blameless circumstance could've happened anybody. top heaping mountain bullshit plain ole make suit narrative. absolutely scale up, that's densely populated areas affected.

There's 1.5 million people living Madrid metropolitan area New Zealand (which huge). 

We three month lockdown, state paid salaries private employees (and still lot companies still able restart business), welfare program strengthened, lockdown severe months (you could leave house food, go hospital, walk dog go work essential worker), etc...

It's lot easier social *distance* people live close together, houses bigger, subway system 2 million people travel daily depend on, country island nation middle fucking nowhere.

We're currently spike unlike New Zealand opened borders EU countries, hit harder first place (because we're densely populated remote part world) easier undetected cases harder control densely populated contact people. Looks like improvised solutions: bandanas, scarfs, etc. worst. Fetid. good! Tired winning already... basically anti vaxxers working overtime. Bad troll. supposed least fake semblance good faith argument instead reposting random talking points. handlers getting money's worth.

FL TX track higher per capita mortality nursing homes NY time epidemic subsides, regardless advantages. never understood this. want support guns support abortions????...?? Good point. Also goes back ""just suck up"" mentality. works pushing limits within control. something that's outside control could effectively damaging health. Super Power house world crumbles cuz single bad president little virus.

This decades making. type selfishness born 2016, assure you.  may 100% healthy, underlying conditions addressed article. would tragedy either way, making assumptions young active proper way report news.

Edit-you downvote me, you’re taking time, please take time let know I’m wrong. disregarding facts now? poster 1)broke rule sub changed title 2) reported boy underlying conditions without support article posted. irresponsible can’t see why, need re-evaluate. think attitude showing big part USA's problem.

I think happen elect nore nutcases run things, cause damage. 

Already now, avility handle pandemic third world country level. departments degrade category. sounds like much listening Joe Rogan I'm talking right now. People STILL saying need another shutdown keep hospitals overwhelmed. say wait that's actually problem start wrecking everyone's livelihood again. ""However, also possible deaths causes risen due strain hospitals hot spots forcing delays treatments possibly scaring people away seeking care ailments typically survivable.""

Meaning, COVID directly contributed deaths, putting play.

I put medical procedure months afraid catching virus dying. many Americans same? many Americans untreated illnesses longer health insurance?
We 200k excess deaths country right now. excess testing, asshole. Fragile no, acting normal even plague present.

Inconsiderate, absolutely. get fucks. used way. happening anymore lawyers germs Hello Netherlands!

Many countries gratitude America still World War 2 would come United States, thought good idea, loyalty.

A lot them, like Iraq, involved United States telling deliberate lies.

During Cuban Missile Crisis, Kennedy addressed Security Council described problem, saying, ""We packet photographs member Council.""

De Gaulle held hand said, ""Please, Mr. President, photos unnecessary. word American President good enough us.""

That's rest world used show Americans. America blew away Iraq War Trump, pretty clear United States alternates eight years usual belligerent bad neighbor like Obama, eight years over-the-top psychopathy like Bush Trump. Yep agreed. failed managing populations. Exactly. FYI - edited titles aren’t allowed sub rules. Expect get removed.

Actual title “2019 Puyallup High School grad hospitalized ‘COVID complications’ dies” NYC

I hope moved then... not, know say :( College football dead arrival.

There NFL games year. question many? sure Europe talking about, Swiss part Europe always way around. Well I'll tell we've spent much. reposting cuz last one got removed silly automod haha: 


I happen drive now. wild. Many bikers, mask, freedom. Iono they'll regret look like they'll definitely world hurt got it, mostly old fat ppl.

They're pretty friendly though, smiles waves cross roads, seem good time. seem mind I'm wearing mask, least pretend put masks indoors .

To guys cartoonish uneducated supporters all. They're like group weebs excited cosplay convention. tell cosplayers go convention banned outright. SD explicitly ban large gatherings, event important, pilgrims, bikers came normal people would. That's danger normality I'm seeing here

Just telling guys trying take sides. me, wanting go town asap haha. Masks make things 100% safe, greatly reduce chance transmission.  doubt find pictures Sturgis event anything close mask usage see rally photos provided.

That's think Sturgis rally spreading point virus.

No one know weeks anyways, feel confident large crowd outdoor events safe, feel free attend without mask.

If that's American attitude towards virus, good luck fellow country men. I’ll summarize. Lineup guys comorbidities breathe heavily 3 hours....oh, make push around too. 

Errr yeah, might wanna check what's goin Spain days. Agreed! live WA fortunately careful re-opening schools. 3 kids distance leaening home year. Im thankful Inslee stood ground despite insane backlash.  lost years ago. don’t hear great number people complying. think know what's happening hospitals. shortage, they're allowing staff wear N95s covid+ rooms *period*. time medical-surgical floor staff allowed put procedure would theoretically generate aerosols. Loads staff contracted it. Kind rage-inducing. thought made clear? They're connected. That's real rub. Forget deaths, yes terrible. we're creating future generations people expensive, debilitating health problems going affect us economically, socially, personally. Ok you’re right don’t lot IVs ER.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fewest tests months also highest monday fatality count ever. reduce testing can't hide bodies (well, yet anyways). Yah cuz bill gates science lol. read actual studies unlike people get soundbites info non medical professionals, present narratives form studies. I've describing lately 'literally titanic proportions '. Titanic took 1400-2000 lives sank. losing Titanic's worth lives every day. Try Vietnam Portugal starters. worst performers capitalist countries specifically said one actually worse.

The US atleast half people trying work it. country sadly deadlocked politics.

In Sweden deadlock situation. Every fucking party majority citizens agreed fucking shit.

Sweden rotten core nation. Corrupt hell, brainwashed population, totally empathyless, incompetent. .

Its disgusting. hope consequenses severe. sub hear NYC great! circlejerk.

I mean, place people arguing masks like children deserves praise place calls hoax, ya think? discussed Europe before. this, I’m convinced alien invasion would fact pit us together shared enemy. Instead, people denying existence don’t know anyone killed alien, freaking people unconfirmed headlines saying aliens look like us already infiltrated society, touting cancerous levels patriotism, ready launch nukes countries they’re convinced run aliens. president say “some people killed, is, let tell this, great armory, biggest world believe me, nobody amount missiles aliens might there, might able take China India, even Russia know, won’t think coming US handle it, fact pretty soon we’ll wiped completely know, plans already save rest world. soon? Oh don’t feel tell that, know is, say something like month I’m day it’s headline.” going rant don’t understand doom that’s perpetuated sub. That’s started laughed doomers. don’t see kids 24/7 probably won’t understand, neither reddit downvote oblivion.

Social isolation messed many kids up. Mine kids friends acting significantly more. miss friends, unless older kid can’t things online whatever play other. person Distanced play dates? It’s possible requires full attention one parents ref.

And find time? Unless you’re sending kids childcare elsewhere hiring sitter double timing work childcare schooling. gets exponentially difficult kids type learner. want take break? Sure could, sort break come risk exposure.

And know what, norm last 5 months. Don’t get wrong, love kids. Taking care kids full time job though, we’ve essentially living world crunch this. Would willing work 60-80hrs every week months end sight? expect excel job try grasp straws bad solution comes around that’ll least get head water albeit temporarily?

I wish much probably fighting relief helps everyone, gets kids properly educated allows people work safely possible pandemic. us told choices bad one continue getting fucked, months months shit mentally physically fried don’t blame parents choose make dangerous decision. Chinese nationals never banned entering US. 'foreign nationals China last 14 days'. easily solved going third country 14 days en routing US

Italy actually banned flights China, work attacks immune system people earlier catching coronavirus plus something else time like influenza likely going sicker. infectious nearly everything else viruses like flu gone decline dual infections going rarer. 

Another factor early year peak vitamin deficiency season know impact. W Yeah state's numbers significant drop HHS change. health department made footnote inquiring bc numbers seemed wrong initially... new numbers now. idea what's really going now. data scientist that's terrifying me. is. mean, Obama left us nothing. /s can’t handle right. federal government forced Cuomo put COVID patients nursing homes longterm care facilities (even knew elderly chronically ill vulnerable population) thus leading massive spike deaths? 🤔 happened United Stand, divided fall.

Putin took instruction manual. Wait what? say thoughts again? blame government honest. Half battle managing population. Think Keep Calm Carry poster. 

Our population managed. went mass panic (buying toilet paper store) fatigue (it's back normal). 

Blaming people selfish easy. truthfully fault. way back April estimated 13% whole state antibodies. That's likely pushing 20% now. totally wrong! There's thinking differently there's willfully ignorant. DeSantis latter.

if loosely speculating science internet you, guest, shug. I'm surprised decision. mandatory. PM number, I'd happy send em bird. nearly long enough. Still stupid. North Paulding administrators ought ashamed themselves. also telling I'm getting news far left sites. 

I can't deal right now. stress levels high enough without deal amount ignorance. Americans argue masks needed people left alive. doesn’t make immune. coworker client tested positive COVID three separate times since March. like she’s irresponsible anything. works Walmart. Gotta make money somehow. watching politics, pandemic outcomes US convinced United States Third World Country. certainly want live there. Yea, here. That’s I’m saying. lots places world resurgences too. world doesn’t revolve around US. huge disinformation campaign social media. Thats winning thats losing plus president retweets like dr demon sex video. Soo basically fucked jobs there. car cell phone would extremely difficult. Depends via public transportation and/or walking. bicycle would help. However, I’m sure employer would need kind contact information phone number. It’s possibly could find something. hope do. think people get news Fox living alternate fantasy wirld. That’s whole lot death chronic disease. people think thing fake? planet stupid on? wife deals sick patients work someone went school die it. Seriously, fucking dumb people? I'm curious much Sweden closed midsummer holidays June? reach form herd immunity would interesting. Though need closed population really see herd immunity understanding. Newly infectious people continually entering country still pose risk anyone infected. Seems fine I'm looking archive cases covid deniers mask refusers caught covid. links would appreciated. COVID Effect!   Good point.

She obviously overweight sight, 3 months laying bed. 3 months probably even bigger.  DB's drive bmw's - like drunk fone behind last night. Fucking facebook scientists. Same. I've banned covid politics topic informs himself. also said virus flattening US almost stroke. Except Vancouver Canada America? Though guess dunno Canada reversed bunch stuff too.  lose weight FYI: ""I yet"" really dumb metric judge effectiveness measures. long it, everything done look like necessary - got it, everything done necessary, late anything it. Ohhhhh see. thing I'm really sensationalism emotional manipulation lot news. Jesus could use little Portland. is. Always been. least since Horace Mann.  ""Second, probably takes either direct cough sneeze, face-to-face encounter closer six feet apart least fifteen minutes normal conversation, transmit virus efficiently one person another. course, one never say never anything medicine, still learning lot virus, chances catching virus unmasked, infected person merely walking past very, low....""

""Third, running makes people breathe heavily, potential runner’s panting transmit virus causes Covid-19 probably comes close cough sneeze.""


I guess ignore want see read portions believe prove point? say biking, think like conversation? students hallway photo wearing masks.  Sure administrators packed together like plaugue rats, teens clearly didnt seem understand masks work. lock apartment couple months straight see well hold mentally. 

You’re fucking psychopath. “Required volunteer”. wonder numbers were. expectation 250-300k. hard comprehend village 6,000 quiet souls. like 500 herding companies descending Dodge City weekend.  put gettable, shorter analogy...

In analogy, like getting fucked ass, nobody gets offended. 

Some bad dudes descend neighbourhood. Covillians. 

To cut long story short, there're gonna attack everyone called Gary neighboorhood. they're feeling really mean, yep, they're gonna fuck ass, too. lovingly, gently. Hard. Dry. Luther Vandross. 

Bad news. name's Gary. rather undergo rough unpleasant sodomisation. look phone book. There's 100 guys neighbourhood called Gary. 20, thus far, fucked ass. 

Understandably, worried. According got 20% chance getting torn wide open. That's CFR. Confirmed guys called Gary definite rate getting involuntarily ploughed. 

But Garys phone book. fuck ton records, whatever reason. Garys, number buggerations. 

So actually odds getting F-d way lower. There's still 20 cases maybe divided 1000 Garys. That's IFR. need QUITE worried. 

But still everything stop Covillains, cos attack find you, Gary. matter confident may be, they've attacked weak, position stop way holiest holies. Florida Man hospitalized...again exactly type information need armed talking work heavily pressuring come back office (I’m one still working home haven’t told I’m pregnant yet I’m still first trimester) 

Thank much. Yeah US collection ton small countries way see it. Every state control runs itself. surprising states would worse others. world could use little kindness right now. hope find happiness others someday I'm sorry used thoughts prayers trying stop school shootings. work! God gave us covid19 save children killers, know kids immune Corona. Thank president Chump.  Basically - sub hear NYC great! circlejerk.  Yeah, region close 30% immunity going well now. tell everyone many people died given day, past 5, 10, 15, 20 year averages daily deaths.


And many think Covid-19. Maybe dead baby trigger people re-evaluate. Sad that's takes. People's response pandemic shows true nature rampant anti-intellectualism US. ~300k dead convince Americans address this, nothing I'll officially give hope country. would rather hang COVID ward make everyone ICU get vaccine. much testing Texas? It’s like 6 months pandemic still don’t know basic measures done limit spread. It’s baffling. Oxford vaccine iirc see like 98-99% mask wearing ttc great. Sympathy hard dealing infectious disease like COVID. Empathy maybe suffered like many others. live extra push free demand asymptomatic testing areas virus high, areas poor people crowded housing. uncommon strategy. Exactly. People act like need 80% prevalence reality, based we’ve *actually observed* need like 20% prevalence. reason, biased models better real world data? hate place sometimes Cute, Ned Flanders reference. That's probably places reactionary ideologies regarding spread COVID-19 would also less likely elect female leader. Plus, multiple countries male leaders fine, see Canada, Italy, Spain, etc. Correlation causation. Americans won’t realize anything’s wrong market crashes. It’s metric Americans seem care about. long Dow keeps going up, everything’s fine. COVID made die managing disease 20-25 years it? would like salute Governor Cuomo people New York great job.  happen drive now. wild. Many bikers, mask, freedom. Iono they'll regret look like they'll definitely world hurt got it, mostly old fat ppl. 

They're pretty friendly though, smiles waves cross roads, seem good time. seem mind I'm wearing mask, least pretend put masks indoors .

I think characterization people unfair. They're really redneck shotguns racists, want good time. People unconsciously harm others time, think fair single group ppl particular others. 

Just telling guys trying take sides. me, wanting go town asap haha. Germany literally rioted week ago measures. Cases rising Europe. places ""beaten"" islands closed borders. ""Well way"" beating mean anything. Sucks Asian living Midwest. 3rd largest? Surely include Mexico part North America right?  ‘This unstoppable’

Somebody send New Zealand memo. need stop stopping this. though. players exposed teammates, also exposed hospital staff patients may vicinity. really see even implied that. 

As someone lot student debt, thousands medical debt, someone genuinely prefers work home, expressing yeah, COVID scary. lot problems lower middle class COVID thing. I'm hopeful they'll addressed impacting everyone, instead quietly shrugged away ""that's way is.""

I'll accept downvotes though, apparently trying find silver lining well received right now. Okay. Lousy beatniks! State A, functional health system, concerned government basic organisational skills can't suddenly start testing people State B. That's something feds would organise, know much State B hates feds. Pronounced RUH-gina. ;) would unfair say experience people suffering co-vid, times ive IVs due dodgy Gall Bladder, done give fluids, way give pain relief.

When IV given serious reason, mild case anything shame what? bad outcomes Chinese lockdowns generate? Apart completely stopping virus heard statistic 90% recovered Covid patients experience sort permanent damage...what severity damage statistic true. racist term European colonists saw people Mongolia decided call Mongolians Downs Syndrome people sub-human, term ""Mongoloid"" born.

Yes, double-whammy crappy term. Great post. stick CDC’s .65% IFR you’re getting 1.5 million deaths 70% infected. That’s pretty scary sounding, people also know almost 3 million people died causes 2017? Since COVID-19 strikes elderly sick certainly quite bit overlap COVID deaths deaths going occur anyways causes like flu, cancer, heart disease, stroke, etc. I’m sure public realizes life expectancy nursing home patient measured months even without COVID.I idea number it’s probably significant.

Once people learn accept facts must ask destroying economy years come, adding trillions debt won’t repaid lifetime, etc worth haphazard response that’s even working well? Seems like either needed go way hard shutdown Sweden route. Straddling middle screwed us sides.

Great post. Well think eventually admit 40% country's population incompetent fuck wits reason still alive 60% looks them...

I come end babysitting duties.

They take down. Either. Welcome side dude. feels much better worry actions let others thing Jesus Christ lockdown supporters psychopaths. really hope case mass hysteria done, look back shame things said. former bosses in-laws bought investment property turned small Hotel town never heard called Sturgis.

20+ years ago.

The 1st year , bikers rented rooms TRASHED shit it.

Then bikers went building supply store.

Then built way wanted it.

COME BACK!! WE'LL LEAVE LIGHT YA! Repubs probably. Thank Bit hard travel wants Americans right plus doses? Large, 2L doses on? Would possible? Wow really [signaling Trump /s   others said may rest peace.

Now wonder, firefighters police tx, similar many NC? cool wear mask? hope I'm wrong, see many without. me, would prefer living fool (wear mask) opposed cool person suffering covid19. Reopening never work proper precautions place. They’ll need masks much smaller classes. days need shorter mask day impractical. They’ll also need address restrooms, buses, cafeterias. Oh fuck! mean phenomia complications? Go. Leave comfortable. No, fast anyone needing emergency surgery. Present ER something needs stat surgery result hour. test kits rationed manufacturer, need judiciously used. link literally, explicitly confirms everything said.

“Second, probably takes either direct cough sneeze, face-to-face encounter closer six feet apart least fifteen minutes normal conversation, transmit virus efficiently one person another. course, one never say never anything medicine, still learning lot virus, chances catching virus unmasked, infected person merely walking past very, low.”

And goes say need mask running can’t maintain appropriate distance Best idea ever heard don’t know sure tried best rub eyes, eat hands wash hands often. left nyc emergency shut cautious could Assuming that’s correct, that’s better ones...
90%+ don’t. spent childhood, college experience, distracted education, pipe me, question getting vaccinated. looks like next year bunch different vaccines developed different labs around globe us choose from. vaccine choose, why? Hey friend understand Americans care pandemic. 

I think pandemic shown lot issues American leadership ideology. think news paint story world mock.. report infection/death numbers government public responds speaks itself.

Of course issues everywhere. Quebec rally masks. end day leaders set tone. federal leadership absolutely missing, depending State, leadership state really let guys down. tests got barely went nose important city NYC, responsible seeding US. Even take NYC deaths, NY still top three deaths state, that's bad got hit first time. I'm predicting least one NFL lineman end critical condition season. dudes 300 lbs probably well bilateral pneumonia. Droplets aren’t Coronaviruses. That's thing well-meaning folks avoiding attributing kind responsibility people; hurting themselves, could (sort of) understand -- they're quite wilfully harming others, potentially causing great many serious illnesses deaths (because people infect average infect people, turn infect more, on, degree responsibility whole branching chain cases generate ). 

I think giving free pass that.

Its difficult muster much sympathy people hurt others get taste medicine. like made quite clear serious deadly highly contagious. information around least six months, dealing really damn inconvenient (and individually, often costly) *don't* want listen *punches face*. Where's sympathy victims wilful negligence meantime? Define quarantining case PCR test everyone using essentially machine multiply specifric type DNA - case Covid DNA.

You could build kind test human DNA. course, hair skin cell fallen body would trigger, whole house everything would light test.

So test really good negative test: find anything multiply sure there. there's human DNA, sure there's human there. there's Covid DNA throat, sure there's Covid - exactly care about.

But work ""find particles X days"" kind tests, humans/Covid used somewhere left traces, test find tests really long time. can't believe accurate correct information voted oblivion. sub used suck would actually care finding facts disease. Loads evidence pointing virus receding local area hits 20%. many people seroprevalence tests showing, T-cell immunity coronaviruses may impart partial immunity. articles posted /r/covid19. Fifty years ago, Republicans came plan win coordinating brainwashing susceptible groups. worked hard spent lots money building narrative people understand, repeating over, succeeded ever dreamed. Trump McConnell get away shameless acts one would dreamed possible.

In fact, created monster need keep feeding. harder push true agenda (take rich) purge better crooks ranks favor right-wing wackos. make sure everything line narrative built (which pretty good narrative them). sometimes lose control cult.

Trump successful fully absorbed narrative never strays it. leader cult, also member (sorry Sy....). Nah. You’re drawing fallacious parallels. haven’t seen controlled studies masks type talking either, know work. Here’s another can't extreme filthily levels wealth without poverty like current economic system. Heart attack warning signs age scary! distant friend die heart attack young supposedly flu complication.

I also 40ish-year-old coworker survive widowmaker heart attack. He, however, warning signs. Heart problems ran family prescribed medication ten years earlier decided take never go back doctor again. ate horrible diet healthy heart, American-type obese, hardly ever exercised except occassional 'weekend warrior' escapades. Oh, biggest ball stress I've ever seen.

He's taking medication, lost weight, eating much healthier. Still huge ball stress. lying everything cover spread Covid-19 country,” a recent Trump campaign email. “It’s absolutely disgraceful can’t stand think you’re getting honest numbers countries… really believe numbers vast country called China? certain number cases certain number deaths. anyone really believe that,’ Trump think getting honest numbers countries,' president said response question DailyMail.com. 
'Does anybody really believe numbers countries,' said press briefing White House Rose maintained ""it's surely relevant statistic"" South Korea shows 300 deaths population 51 million. ""You know that,"" Trump said repeatedly. Swan asked: ""You think they're faking statistics? South Korea?"" Trump hesitated, said: ""I get good relationship country. know that, spikes.""

And wonder parrots hop leave comments ""tHeY lYiNg mAKe tRuMp lOoK bAd"" whenever positive news country posted

Meanwhile US close 50K excess deaths counted COVID numbers I’m little bit upstate NYC say gotten lax think we’ve also kinda settled comfort zone willing settle means numbers stay low. 
  We’re back small get togethers weekends, outdoor dining completely tolerable get table take mask off, wearing mask run stores isn’t really big deal anymore get habit remembering it, bars open basically sit eat. Basically still sucks it’s manageable means kids resume school safely, means work stay open, means hospitals clear.

Edit: something done gyms though. Whether separate assistance program put together guidelines get back open. Yeah. felt like 2-3 weeks away clear this. celebrate independence tyrannical monarchy. sure it’s still case, longest time Portland home strip clubs per capita city US. find pretty much varieties party want.

I believe I’ve heard stripper karaoke place. There’s vegan strip club one location literally next door strip club owner owns cattle ranch serves steak bites.
Everything fanciest place you’ll ever see dingiest hole wall. There’s lot strip clubs. inside house causing depression.

Many don’t get mild symptoms manage infect innocent bystanders family members. 

Here’s latest charts Florida, running 7-Day currently 38.17 deaths per 100k population. That’s still well US average 48.83.  rate Florida move rankings soon. get hate... New Zealand island roughly poplulation Twin Cities Metro area Minnesota... Comparing Covid stats entire United States ridiculous. ""Jared, stop buck?"" us care. them? Fuck capitalism failed experiment  lmao weird there. Aussies Irish everywhere cracked wish intentional stress related. I’ve read books entire life learned something new every single day past 5 months so. love Florida average number COVID deaths per 100k entire pandemic yet r/coronavirus trash talking Florida praising NY, state FOUR times many deaths per 100k. species made last lol. mean trump flu? included excess deaths already. confounding variables reduction deaths due confinement, arguments whether excess deaths caused reduced access treatment counted covid-related not. order magnitude less ""fierce"" thought March/April Social distancing reducing ammount cases. Yeah, real issues weight years.
Decided unneccesary risk since pandemics like happen again.
Gone ~140 125kg since may.

Being generally healthy likely countries Sweden like recovered quickly. clearly haven’t “read books manuals” everyone first world country: don’t even IMAGINE it’s like live third world country nowadays. 
I lucky able stay home, I’m emotionally exhausted isolation. haven’t seen grandmother (the last grandparents alive) SINCE FEBRUARY. 
Unemployment peaked, thousands stores closing, insecurity mad I’m even scared go it. 
I’m religious I’m praying whatever God soon. think convinced, sad is. Ahhh... thanks! Come think it, remember ride kid I'm 49. Makes sense maintenance queens now. Sweden extended social distancing recommendations restrictions large gatherings end year. Contrary media's implying, business usual since March. throw Canada justification mess. travelling country, Americans keep trying sneak Canada. Saying USA war 4 years. guess... suspect little bit better semi-rural area come (more toward SW Ohio); though Columbus huge influx college students (multiple colleges) telling be. Could better worse average--but would cautious.

Outside pandemic, Columbus nice city. Lots cultural stuff, reasonable costs, safe places visitor would likely go. Traffic horrible football weekends though. bad right now, seeing crowd gives creeps. 187 infants Covid, one died (of SIDS according reports). That's death rate 5.35 per 1,000, indistinguishable pre-Covid infant mortality rate 5.9 per 1,000. Nationally, infant mortality 2019.

Texas control infections misleading use ""for children"" justification Covid. political bullshit. Fake positives multiple tests one person.

It'll drop election Y'know Chinese communists kick door 3am ad whisk away reeducation center horrible things? That, slightly nicer. Slightly. “nobody tells nothin” mentality. Funny narratives see ones trying push political agendas like yours. uighurs

Do think Uighurs locked something?

 

The US force feeding innocent muslims rectally Guantanamo Bay. done stop it?

How children currently locked cages like dogs US? that. bode well fight global warming. Unless small bunch scientists save us (in cases - making vaccine finding way cheaply get rid excess CO2) we, humanity, utterly completely fucked. America, rest Europe isn’t thinking you, stop thinking you’re centre world. problems. Haha. one, really one astonished Europe. Make America great again.... like bit foreshadowing you’re straight lying, I’m gonna respond you’re comment totally truthful. 

We get it. everyone, most. really suck working within confines resources limited.

Again, you’re saying true work testing facility, don’t care you’re janitor actually thick it. Thank you. Please keep trying. 

The people matter appreciate even don’t understand work involved counting long island deaths isnt upstate ny. reality wouldn’t even count westchester borders nyc hit first. lets count weschester, thats 4583 deaths. az currently 4152 deaths. Soo guess az herd immunity mode right start see amount deaths upstate ny next week. That's quite lot. 1/2000 chance getting killed everytime crossed road, cross 3 roads way work back, live 1 year average. Israel = 2,000 cases / day = 70,000 cases adjusted USA population

rinse &amp; repeat many countries....might think differently USA lot neurological issues. Dizzyness lightheadness, migraines, increased pressure, hallucinations, plus Im gonna list here. bad. Im 28 years old male used run lot Go outside get sun. Take kids out. You’ll feel lot better. Don’t give fear. Fear mind killer Even family friends, thought intelligent enough shit, porch party coming weekend people south North Carolina. volunteers local Democratic Party rural Virginia. utter stupidity rampant country I’m doneskies. wife militant masks social distancing since March, crap infuriating. point saying fuck everyone else, it’s time take care ourselves. April, reported  cost concerns motivated suspending pay thousands Disney employees leaving reliant unemployment benefits State Florida. However, counter furlough unusually extensive noted Parks Resorts Disney's largest division, responsible 35% revenue 2019, two four profit engines battered.

I still think handsomely remunerated executive class furloughed furloughed low-paid staff jobs go (and risk dying harm). is. sub push single payer ? Cuz y’all should. No. mutation. know KCDC said new mutations different 78,810 viral genome sequences registered GISAID database virus run World Health Organization. ""To date, empirical estimates IFR published due challenges measuring infection rates.""

Acknowledged need (however study kinda old-we IFR studies now).

""That's contradiction. Nothing estimate empirical.""

Estimates absolutely empirical. estimate year's GDP drop-that estimate based empirical data showing decline economy. actually essential part science. Making hypotheses, predictions, eventually theories. taken face value (I've railed innaccurate models COVID predictions before)-that mean using data predict bad thing. Especially overwhelming mountain evidence supports fact infected case numbers. mean, entire COVID strategy predicated upon this. COVID really 5.5% death rate virus, would imply non-contagious. would basically wiped now-especially seeing everyone COVID apparently gets pattern matching footprints sand. Statistics Science.

Statistics part science. seems like cherry picking want consider science metaphysics, religion, 90% philosophy, statistics, Contextual Empiricism. know ""I say true"".

On planet statistics equivalent metaphysics religion terms scientific value? Excess deaths still undercounting judging countries. Might hard ever estimate real number - could look pneumonia deaths excess heart attacks maybe. Yeh it’s politics keep nose far possible trump's ass still good shot reelection 2 years. enough Republican-or-die voters forgive basically anything fukcs up. good reason. people wearing whatever masks could fashion themselves, far fewer infections would occurred first place would also reduced exposure healthcare workers. 

Fauci celebrity US compare efficacy recommendations top health officials China, Vietnam, Pakistan, South Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, Cambodia, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, looks like total incompetent. 

I welcome ask associates places whether would preferred Fauci’s consultation one countries actually received. know, sister mother called police 5 times month July. One times hospitalized court signed petition taken psych-eval. bill $1000 there’s way hell I’m gonna pay it. 

Especially since medical professionals signed insane wishing hurt others. 

I’m kinda secretly wishing everyone doubts serious virus gets spreads vulnerable loved ones. could mean could also spread mine don’t wish all. reported sky news... Comcast/Rupert Murdoch rumour machine, would take anything said bucket two salt That's really chilling number. admit, got numb number dead. Yet see comparison like that, terrifies me.

I think, data presented like this, maybe statistic says, many people least one person know died covid. Danmark extensive lockdown, since able reopen almost everything including schools. schools daycare reopened may. last two weeks seeing increase again, measures likely reinstated. nearly age 70. specific one read. Yep... root mental health crisis America well. isolated raised hyper focus detriment everyone around us best shot getting ahead country puts profit else. think god recognise wear mask? America, dont know anyone really astonished anything happens regarding lack healthcare... lack caring Important things matter. isn’t large. voting power super leveraged due electoral college, caps congressional representatives, gerrymandering.  42% Americans obese though - pain mostly, reason, go 4 times, 1 time cos neighbor called ambulance saying sounded like trying give birth (im male BTW). Sure start pain manageable kept getting attacks, either staying hours, whilst people found clever ways give pain killers, could even swallow water. Never never be. prefer say I'm mexico travel becuase hell wants friend American ?? sure hell home schooling option? freedoms. Interesting, country moving societal collapse? charade normalcy needs last elections over.

Which Trump pushing hard make seem like nothing wrong.  house cards fall moment. national lotto winner minted every minute average! Play now! Bill Gates software engineer doctor. get publicly speak Coronavirus make public recommendations? always ignored. Notice experts say ""we vaccine *or cure.*"" knows happens people next years, schools open back up.  sure qualified make assessment Worldwide rise excess deaths started beginning year. Check compared previous years. Achievement probably wrong word. Watching US much interest many levels atm. we're not. Almost every country better, comes slowing infection rate preserving economies. People seem think countires much better US... people realize massive US is... Minnesota island we'd 5.6 Million residents probably good guys did....

But landlocked middle North America surrounded 49 states Canada. different here. can't that! gotta go cases. many unsourced claims post.

[Europe’s population [the 

What sources support claim US reporting covid deaths Europe? Well, value life much, you. implying OP correct regarding numbers. reading thread looks like people want links regarding long term damage regarding covid. 

This still new virus. know Sars MERS similar covid-19 cause permenant damage. good chance covid-19 lasting effects even mild cases. one scary information researchers studied 100 cardiac MRI scans taken two months people recovered COVID-19.

Results show 78 scans heart abnormalities, 60 scans revealed inflammation heart.


Just additional info MERS causing lung damage.  seems probably permanent.  Sounds exactly like mother. allowed see daughter grandchildren. Meanwhile exclaims treat like two year old. 

I moved back MI CO help family issues I’m staying mother. backyard tent since she’s incapable making responsible safe choices. shit over, plan moving back there. heh 69 workplaces  may right. 

I look ""oops found wrong plan"", said that. Owners wanted season. may viable plan. Read article social distancing, look dugout. dollar signs followed ""socially acceptable safe posturing"". meant specifically gb issues. Like made go er. Pains, lethargy, dehydration? ppl pass off. What's going states really scaring me. People comprehending bad situation really in. like meme house fire dog sitting table saying ""This fine"". People refusing believe normal over. Things going get much worse. I’ve seen 3M p100 half face respirators Lowe’s recently too, stick around longer n95 selling out. Lots kn95 surgical masks recently they’ve able keep stock too. It’s hit miss, shipments starting go stores Home Depot probably start getting soon also haven’t already. provide evidence this? I've never even heard case. Imagine 1 half [this Michigan's stadium holds bit 100,000 people Knew recognized guy...fucking Mike Parsons. hate state. would like say Hong Kong free democracy post inspired think that! Sounds like shitty prison beer, true. Fewer people die causes covid compared recent years. People less likely die ""safe home."" using excess deaths likely still undercounting. consider long term mental effects lockdown, too. second highest covid death rate country New Jersey. Quite accomplishment.  Tendency... like aversion case. tremendous 5G light theories believe pretty much exact opposite science.

(not generalizing men, ones mentioned article) Maybe used softer word ""isolated""? ""sensibly paced"" work?

Do disagree statement ""NZ stay 'sensibly paced' rest world years (or eventually give up, let COVID burn NY did.)""?

Should revisit one year, two? fairly confident laws nature eventually prove right. historic example country city ever successfully ""sensibly pacing"" virus 50% people asymptomatic. sorry delusional 'gross indivualism capitalism expense society' USA still is. Embrace old world approach, less individualism weak capitalism, little bit care people.

Although rapidly following USA path .. People playing lottery 1/1.000.000 chance: well MAYYYBE i'll win
People Covid 1/2000 Chance: naaaaaah, chance Let's fair, single people suffer disproportionaly this. We're social creatures, non-single people least one person household interact more. society actually neglecting single people throughout lot ways, since lot strain lot us truly cooped home themselves. core issue FDA allowing every testing facility capability COVID-19 tests actually run COVID-19 tests. mean, hell, \*VETERINARIAN\* PCR machine (granted, specialist veterinarian, GP type veterinarian, still). talking something that's exotic rare. We're talking $15K machine upscale doctors' offices now, common X-ray machines. 

And they're allowed use COVID-19 testing.

My local university put together capability run 40,000 COVID-19 tests per day raiding biology labs PCR machines asking various local research facilities would allow use PCR machines COVID-19 tests. number tests they've actually allowed run?

\*\*ZERO\*\*.

Because FDA approved testing lab. FDA refuses give emergency waiver.

You'd think STATE EMERGENCY FDA would issuing emergency waivers shit like this. know what? AIN'T HAPPENING. FDA running political bullshit keeping testing capacity used time people fucking dying.

That's fucked up. sayin'. President Trump vocally defended U.S.'s testing virus repeatedly claimed country’s numbers high testing regimen, despite fact positive percentage rate tests remains high well.

Well right testing way is, numbers high. testing decent, situation would better Holy shit, knew bad, goes beyond anything knew. thought collapsing economies, enabling genocide. europeans question Americans? Oh better asshole, keep believing bs. ++ virus doesnt dissipate open windows like Nowhere. Stay home! Trust say mostly laughing instead shaking head disbelief terrible everything seems there. 15-20 years ago, elected officials totally starstruck everything American tried move country direction moving funds public private schools hospitals I'm glad attempts copy USA endes fairly limited.  People getting infected refuse stay fuck home and/or wear mask. Good luck, women trying reeducate men cis female biology actually works years now. thought ment deaths per million, since talking actual fatality rate completely pointless.

It's obvious countries hit first highest fatality rate nothing know treatment etc.

Also realize US fatality rate would much higher actually counted deaths accurately, right? Southern states *are* first wave, hit much later New York.

New York Northeast US start 2nd wave. nationalised health system UK get free test done home drive centre within day, results within 48hrs text. succinct summary excess deaths useful metric virus. change fact talk like think better everybody, asshole. makes difference, something make jokes about.

There lots Americans people world stuck away families.

But hate Americans safe social media. Heck MIL 80s found guy old people Tinder (no, want know specifically where) middle pandemic. seems alright like... yeah stuff happening. European bizzare people care much masks. Yeah dont hwve 100% people wearing mask, never saw anyone making scene wearing/not wearing mask.


At employee say ""excuse mask mandatory"" person without mask would respond ""oh ok sorry"" leave. Never saw drama. Rapid tests super expensive though triaged cases really need it. 

I work UK lab, rapid platform takes 1hour routine platform takes 3hours. Even older platform originally took 6 hours.

Testing speed issue generally. Swab collection transport, result checking relaying patient slowdown occurs. I'm saying peoples patience measures infinite.

If hope vaccine looks like years away, people give measures. crazy think otherwise.

Countries world starting see pushback protests UK, Germany, Japan related measures, thats 6 months clusterfuck. sentiment grow time, vaccine hopes dashed add fuel fire.

You stamp scream people die happens, will. find significant number roll dice odds favour would survive, selfishly assume families unscathed it. Imagine reading headline going eh, bad.

I hope one day somehow gain empathy compassion. decided great idea go play Mary typhoid.

Popular international sport centres. Define ""they"" Belgium every 1 1175. Beating y'all. number 1! San Marino small sure counts, less 1 per 1000 certain vegetables boost immune system others, example Garlic. sure others, one generally eat lot start feel sick. heard good things elderberries too. Korea Japan astonished Europe. person’s one career requirement nothing compared structural problems cause climate change. Point energy there. last estimate remember seeing something like cdc something upwards 20 million. It'd higher though, think month ago. something laugh at, asshole. find out, US isn’t powerful nation thought were. let legend become downfall.

What cringe? Why? Would US nukes stop working next day? Would Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg Elon Musk, suddenly take vow poverty?

What chain events imagine happening, would lead US getting ""nuked Earth""? Wrong, Bay Area population 8 million. worked WDW two years late 90's personally know three people (1 maintenance 2 custodial employees) killed rides following rules European. thing Canadians think rest peers, probably whole world. USA example strive for. feel conflicted upvoting this.

On one hand sort punch gut perspective needs exposure. 

On hand, feels wrong. overall 'approval' saddening news. every upvote dollar.
Come peeps, let’s send fella one dollar each. Nobody would known, seen full extent able quantify whatsoever time. pretty much confined local community area back general population got virtually news elsewhere. Furthermore, surely using contagions half population continent died benchmark judge against. token anything would better, think modern science thinking evolved point virus would flare kill 1 every 2000 people (and likely 1 every 1500 soon) 'the powerful country world' 700 years later. **Pre-clinical transmission** concept looking for.

Johnny hangs cousin Saturday. Tuesday, cousin (who went eat Thursday) fever. Thursday, Johnny feels stuffed up, fever assumes allergies. Friday, cousin gets test results, calls Johnny, fever, dozens kids staff exposed. I'm pretty sure rest world enough nukes turn US glass crater... US doesn't.... That's bad example, quite close enough, imo. case, fire slowly spreading prison.

Even then, nothing says need move *all* alternative energy, move once. I’m always baffled every time Americans wants brag medical system uses argument it’s advanced one world therefor justified it’s existence. Like sure that’s technical true even point it’s also system benefits minority fucks everyone else hard? What’s point worlds sharpest scalpel you’re chopping wood? meant sense of, assumption totally wrong. ok idiot. Na he's right. problem caused Americans another country eliminated COVID within borders, really spread there. lottery odds, absolutely buy in.

I'd buy 2,000 unique tickets. Well, UK got hit -20%gdp q2 brexit around corner. 

Ppl make decisions loosing money, (we) forget lockdowns even means dead bodies every corner.

Congratulations Mr Gates foundation. Continue good work. hope really one ""good people"", even believe it. ""help"" gonna cost us pay.

They going take everything. Look happening Cambodia. Bill Gates predicting pandemic might continue till 2022. vaccine. Evangelicals visible part vast iceberg anti-intellectual culture. China welded people’s doors shut buddy I'd get flu vaccine skip mask that's me. sources nonsense? subreddit sucks vaccine sure. Still question behave like flu new strains.

I ofcourse saying stay lockdown masks everywhere. Ofcourse not. long vaccine new strains, measures probably remain. example could imagine public transport shops, masks temporarily required cases rising. Pr handshaking becomes less common whest. Etc.

I glad live cozntry europe virus taken seriously cases death stay low - compared US many states lot seems done millions infected, hundreds thousands suffering dying. guarantee you, everything goes „back normal“ many many die. „0.5% ifr“ seems issue afterall.

Or saying numbers US problem go back normal? way out. wont guts go changes. US fat. Americans shitty health. 

**60%** adults US one chronic diseases: heart disease, cancer, lung disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s, diabetes, chronic kidney disease. 

**40% Americans two friends relatives nurses still don’t take seriously all. really frustrating. hate Americans instead. ones spreading plague amongst themselves. compared coronavirus vaccine buyouts 2009 swine flu pandemic, wealthier countries bought vaccine doses. U.S. many European countries donated vaccines poorer countries, satisfied enough doses citizens. give fight. lead example others follow.

Like hell will. Lead example showing people actual contributors society locking fuck it. Pretty fucking scary think like this. reconcile places like Netherlands mandating masks overall trend rest Europe? I'm belief government requires/requests something, comply, suggest masks end-all right dont think (totally view). think that, usual, things way complex, people like distill ""mask mask"" reflects reality. think greater issue people dont want get educated things, would rather politicize attack. distressing say least.

On note, dont use white masks; dirt waaaay obvious! haha difference US proportion. worrysome thing collapse Soviet Union certainly much help average Russian today, former Soviet states life probably lot worse actually. Koch Brothers obviously. fund everything Soros doesn't. Yes No.No don’t.  You’ve literally left house couple times past 5 months? seems incredibly unhealthy. Glad Australia, fine crossing state borders without proper clearance. cross fake reasons fined $4003 Queensland. think NSW $11000 6 months jail. Apparently, fines needed convince people risk it. US even leaves 37,000 dead

That's like, what... 5000 school shootings? point saying ""I get vaccine available"" 'justified' vaccine currently available.

  

I thought pretty clear., Okay well let’s debate now. Make election issue: people favor following lockdowns, vs people think everyone right isolate little much want to. Corona America matter cure hits someone go “See? wasn’t bad” *only* survived. live Southeast Texas schools aren’t requiring use masks school activities all. day drove local middle school’s softball practice least 100 people single mask sight. standing shoulder shoulder damn near, breathing other, laughing, eating, acting like didn’t care world. It’s baffling single person gave shit. Schools Texas aren’t taking safety students teachers seriously it’s kinda terrifying. South Carolina saw anything 10% months. rocked 20% heck anywhere 15% 20% good enough fling doors back open everything. God bless miss tourism bucks. Almost hate admit normally vote Republican I'm seeing anything makes sense either party, there's ratt quite government wood pile. trump loves small farmers! Stay strong! know truth set free! I'm willing risk life Democratic process though. I'd taking mask best filtration possession taping edges face, along wearing goggles and/or faceshield, elections must go on. baby's first edge post personal level? No.

It's actually personal.  think country better they're here. American here, answer no. Herd immunity exist covid. low-info delusional nutjob fantasy. both? better? Could argue shut orders along delaying elective “non-emergency” procedures increased number deaths due lack treatment? example, routine physicals treatments/surgeries postponed due able go doctors office late?

Or, heart attacks increasing home people shrugged symptoms couldn’t wait longer? 

Obviously, we’d expect things like traffic deaths decrease, couldn’t deaths attributable causes COVID result changes routines, screening, treatment, medication? vent fine needed it. I’m blessed 78 yo high risk mom staying home since March. shopping, anything keep home safe. still repeated convos covid19 spreads, what’s safe what’s she’s really getting it. scares she’s thankfully allowing tell stay home.

What “non-compliant” parents &amp; family deal heartbreaking. I’m sorry. hope loved ones make crisis safe, even they’re stubborn. I’d say majority people United States care. However decent sized minority people outspoken uneducated bring everyone else think touted story [that Whitehouse loves, DT wants schools open etc.] kids spread much. However South Korean study kids home less likely exposed people ~two studies showed kids higher viral loads adults. makes sense could spread even may symptoms thus know indicate family members even it. what’s point.  Let’s see information.  I’m obviously rooting success. Lol fuck hell comment thread discussing statistics apropos pessimist can't believe enough sustain anymore moving money stock market. done March. ain't even living shithole country people's lives matter case fucking pandemic..

[Latest numbers every also work environment I’m looking forward possibility child spitting me, getting bodily fluids me. working children, staff I’m employed wear mask shield. kids won’t required mask. Good luck that. campus isn’t that’s decided small cadre university administrators. definitely look this!! interpret saying: types antibodies produced individuals mount successful response virus, likely protective. So, vaccine trials, scientists assess antibody profile vaccinated (anti-N vs anti-S) look antibody profiles mimic natural survivors infection...as likely protective. Wow that’s horrible long don’t real consciousness people infecting people won’t stop.  testing Manhattan project started then. Something would moved virus testing forward even bug turned dud.

Would paid 1000 times over. mean half eligible voters even bother voting? thus complicit this? Dollar Tree give fuck pandemic. Everything purely assistant manager posted contacted head HR Dollar Tree. told. told absolutely right reporting would investigation store district manager would personally come interview staff.

Three weeks later? Nothing done. contacted reported. district manager never came certainly interview single person. assistant manager quit feel like company taking seriously felt like unsafe work environment. Stockholm never it.

NYC Lombardy locked already spread enough reach herd immunity. You’ll know I’m right schools go back session cases don’t spike. tldr lmao need thin herd. us that's shitty part children dead. flu much deadlier children Covid. deadliness virus increases age due increasing lack T-cells get older. COVID poses almost zero risk youth. COVID previously makes people immune. exceptions, COVID unique that. lot people get chicken pox twice, example --- people still don't. don't, we. Really. Don't. It'd Pont even hear Corona anymore Peaked what? Dying? lol. Houston deaths *last week* april1-july8 combined. already silly goose.  Hey, hey, need start generation war here. Every bracket group stupid folks ruining society rest us want pandemic times safety protocols sucks hate it. shake fist turds wearing masks gathering large groups without social distancing together.  wealthy stay home moms ones pushing schools reopen. Coronavirus's genome RNA DNA, quibble way detracts overall point. Canada recommending glory holes safe sex.  slightly uncomfortable South there's AC. Otherwise known totally impossible people South regardless AC No, don’t. Five million cases. That's literally entire population Sydney Australia. Just.... Wow. mortality rate much lower expected. worry lads, let infect everyone. 150,000+ deaths so""
 
America probably. phase three trials completed knowledge efficacy vaccine. Without information, justifiably skeptical. 

Cool. one offering vaccine right now, correct?
 
So.... Ignorant, selfish right-wing shitheels, surprising  Covid nothing lens see reality things, stripped hopeful striving American psyche. Covid exposed generational funding public health, cold efficiencies profit health care, inherent systemic racism ...and continue expose make vivid inequities, corruptions subversions ‘American dream’ heighten state insecurity Americans feel daily lives. 
We hope clarity afforded Covid lens sustained order effect meaningful change. tragedies nothing otherwise.  Georgia says hold beer Rest world making real strong case rejoined right  Canada, government pays healthcare, want spend little money possible. USA, government doesn’t pay healthcare, want spend little possible. Uh. No. ITT: Americans making false assumptions Ireland, relationship US, status regarding people entering exiting country, more. Nothing said anything Covid response. give up. Lots sure. Russia also.

But I'm pretty sure US hiding numbers too, even since stopped going direct care. don't. I'm sure one people else fix situation. far hands thought move country. know one thing though: teach children really happened 2020. gut wrenching fear history textbooks portray is: collapse United States America cause grisly abuse power power rich. hope ever get chance leave here, I'm shunned, ridiculed, extorted based place born. I'd rather based act treat others. states basically make 40% US population. Technically correct actually follow diet tee. rheumatoid arthritis used inject medication. diet I’m literally thousand times better don’t take medication more. used smoke pot daily drank/partied stuff college. diet complete game changer. never overweight (weighed 165 6 ft male). Lost roughly 30 pounds eating like this. I’m definitely thin feel incredible. get used food. Fruit becomes new candy. Sweet potatoes become gods greatest gift. don’t miss shit food all, definitely don’t miss fun drugs. People changes lives. dont know Icky Thump sprang mind know voted. know lot people like extremely careful gotten it. think understand large New York herd immunity really means. hope compassion majority country didn’t want aren’t supporting it.

Yes. watching train wreck horror. many assholes country, many good people deserve this. Stay scared bruh. Numbers dropping quick across Midwest. Hell, even Florida. really need go lengths, long everyone follows sensible protocol (wear mask, use alcohol hand wipes surface wipes, keep distance, etc.). think hand-out Taiwan pretty much sums up: Enough give shit anyone (or in-group [of guess even American ""in"" enough, let alone fellow human]). ""quarantine"" situation reminds trying look logical arguments misanthropy site top results guy said likes start question ""what stupid people done you?"". Look around dumb-ass. Beliefs live vacuum stupidity causing nothing problems civilization-wide.

This situation makes sense. Especially level philanthropic behavior stem completely selfish reasons.  much care. us. enough us, unfortunately, don’t think there’s hope educating them. addition people said, hospitalized patients significantly less likely die now, UK reported hospitalized fatality rate went 6% April 1.5% June, believe mostly due improvements treatments (less aggressive intubation, aggressive anti-coagulation, better timing anti-inflammatory drugs etc) expect true USA.

Source UK data: haven’t seen controlled studies masks...

So you’ve moved goalposts “there numerous studies this” (though couldn’t find link any) to. “you don’t need quantitative studies.”  ?

Actually number quantitative studies mask effectiveness vs aerosolized viruses.  Here’s one evaluates 11 different mask materials. Ughh Also feel like I’m going insane. many fellow college students going college. say chance death teens extremely low not. parents don’t want go. save money miss experience college. “experience” everything heavily restricted...

Why can’t government tell everyone stay home? college giving fake option hybrid classes reality it’s mostly stay dorm everything online? pay full tuition virtual classes? panaroid? everyone else idiot? remember grade school/middle school/highschool American history? Almost total whitewash me. Mostly revisionist propaganda. America good, allies good, anti Americans bad. skip bad stuff America did. Compared U.S., thats containment. would kill levels. course NZ Taiwan. Oh saying anything bad title lol. meant expression *I* used (doing god's work) usually good expression, seems bad article talking church infections. little joke. dad deserves punishment. Initially safe friend friend’s daughter got recovered. dad isn’t careful tell says “it’s common cold, look friend daughter survived. Nothing happens” It’s shame really he’s 70 years old complications totally refuses believe anything show doesn’t line beliefs. worst thing mom really scared covid never set foot outside house since February dad get killed well since share bed. I’m bracing future long term diseases short lifespan. Yes. cost US system bloat – largely greater salaries better infrastructure. costs billing etc. US used money currently spent healthcare universal healthcare system, it'd far ahead world, even funny. Unfortunately, live state majority believe political issue. middle aged older men coming work say they're glad enforce people wear masks. competitors company losing customers due company wanting keep people catching virus.

Fast forward month mask mandate established end July. We've since March. taken state 4 5 months require citizens wear mask public. Sometime wish state would've bit faster requiring masks. fucking intellectual behemoth! update today's data hours. documented / verified case reinfection? know handful believed reinfections - upon study turned things like false positives, people stay positive extended period despite longer symptomatic contagious, instances wrong. haven’t seen people reinfected (at least thus far.) We'll see long lasts. quite anti-mask protests Hamilton, Kitchener/Waterloo region, mind dozen yahoos protest, mean can't still spread others. CDC test pays US hospitals test positive, requires suspicion, actual test.

Check April 2020 definition. guys risk life limb bring even dead bodies back foreign battlefields? American hostages worth like 10 terrorists swap?

There's one part make fucking sense. No, still lot us quarantine hard get it. New York large population. folks can't fathom can't stop while, least pandemic still raging infection rate still high area.

And even infection rate seems control, reason complacent either. know sparked Japan's 2nd wave? Kyabakuras. Look up, takes long explain suffice say somewhat resemble bars.

Look, so-called 'nerds' social lives would like get back well. Board game meetups, DND Sessions, LARPs, etc. Might idea fun like do, we're putting now.

Don't see can't chill home bit dies vaccine developed. caring thing say millions people never met, thoughtful empathetic local media leaders praise prudent. Fucking hell possibly doctors better handle works treat symptoms may availability resmisvadar? drugs. speculation treatment different early days guess Best part article lol  20 year thing crazy, I’d never heard this. Yikes! Doesn’t scare away lot EMTs getting work? bought 6 sympathy cards target that’s many family friends/relatives passed away past week. pandemic real people you’ve lost. people lucky lost anyone care about, feel like won’t ever affect them. buy ton bread (3-4 loaves) freeze it. Thaw goes back normal. also shop every week months since started. pickup anyways sometimes go more. But, yeah. Bread freezes well. :) cynical easy. take easy way out. yeah, know I'm saying cliche. cliche reason. Yeah don’t get whole “I’m patriot, yet Nazis right idea, lives matter FUCK MASKS bible jesus said rights that’s Bible constitution!” Like .. WHAT?! Fuck em.

They made bed, lie it. shut church. need real consequences violators USA! Number 1! Best! Look chart. Europe! Sad! Numbers getting lower. Sons Covid-y Season 1. hey, long kid, huh?

You want honest answer? Yes. ""we"" decided country. 'My' welfare 'my freedoms' everyone else. 

Its want be. friends family want be. ""we"" country decided. 

And know what? responsible making decision ""us"" likely die statistically. family? We'll fine. let burn. Let dumb, unhealthy, fat, uneducated assholes die maybe take country back. sucks, truly sorry. much democracy freedom eh? damn proud 'Murca. /s I'm saying repeat since day one. 

We took children one dangerous environments contracting illness.

Every parent knows brace cold/flu start year, Christmas break spring break. 

My wife, daughter normally get flu cold spring. pulled school, sick since March. 5 months something didn’t get job done. think anything going change guys way optimistic. America already failed coronavirus response. best continue wearing masks people can’t even seem correctly. Closing stores public places option anymore. 1) for-profit healthcare system makes money based much treatment provides. course populace poor health, people make billions dollars keeping America sick. would teach man fish could charge bucks every time hungry?

2) pandemic even close over. _Super_ short sighted assume experts wrong.  Europeans everyone

Good luck! keep insiders quiet. 

The teet college football always feeds own. may even idiots US elsewhere.

Always funny seeing things written Americans.

It's clear case. Either live shared housing BFE. Rents studio start $1200 occupied parts country jobs actually located. ""I read somewhere"". Lol, NO. 
 
The Infection Fatality Ratio well known, since mid February. 0.5%-0.9%. Princess Diamond Cruise ship 3,711 people infected, 14 PEOPLE DIED. FLU ABSOLUTE TURD. 
 
How fuck given factual reports mortuaries backed stacking bodies refrigerated food trucks, warehouses converted hospital beds, fucking re-think stupidity wrongness? far. cruises opened yet. us exhausted, sometimes wish wake ashamed exhausted country filled anti intellectuals. Someone please help here, need know. thougjt babies reduced risk covid mortality even 200K deaths... fucking joke. Math must hard all.  absolute mind numbing gall describe description sensational, claims made. sign complete ideologue. capitalism. America mostly law abiding. expect election November. see President Cabinet corrupt; shock Americans happened twice, long anyone alive born.

We shocked see President pull power decide inform Executive's Agencies. Again, never seen happen.

The people US rarely participate national protests. seen mid-size large protests public managers, police. think start. manifestacion like France, US, ever anyone's current lifetime. closest protests 1968 one students short National Guard Kent State Ohio. caused flare nearly everywhere northern states. cannot speak descendents Confederacy even today operate illusion lost short while. ""The South rise again.""

What seems brewing violent uprisings, sides. seeing now. 

Without President removed, legally otherwise, nightmare continue without interruption. expert Texas Children's Hospital, Vaccine Research said 2 days ago expects continuing geometric curve, driving infect mortality double numbers today, end December. December, forecast 100,000 Americans dead one month. around 50-60,000 per month. So, every month, number monthly grow.

Personally, believe vast majority American people understand means narcissist. president narcissist, first, last foremost. view death others way 99% American people do. So, voters view death risk, part Trump team, escape death... hoax, ... flu, flu kills more. ...and now, go away soon. voters cannot believe chosen leader would lie them. Again, understand characteristics narcissist high narcissism scale. psychiatrists US describe malignant narcissist.  highlight one characteristic narcissist. term sadist psychopath sociopath. terms way heads majority Trump voters. like Nixon times, again.

The good news 1/3 support myths promoted President dead nearly dead 10 years, gone nearly total 20 years. 2nd 2/3 may may change, young people entering viewpoints balanced dying out. Omg funny clever Sure thing:  interdependence really looks like indentured servitude. Fine listen CDC. Listen antibody IFR calculations tricky, one thing disputable. Confirmed cases accurate depiction cases. Maybe deaths since harder deaths go radar like asymptomatic COVID cases mild COVID cases. Bottom line is, science take debunked idea face value cling it. dogmatic foolish. scientific willfully ignoring science threatens worldview. Perfect. airlines medical reasons too. already lots things passengers want fly. here’s another one, take leave it. Well, opening schools so... generally immunity little after, right true immunity comes covid infection. Especially people mild moderate symptoms seem able re-infected rather span month. would funny true. American, get man shut up. many times Eurobros reddit going shit country? know feel. think we're 3rd world country whatever? Cool, care. love here. Yes, need strike. I've never seriously injured car crash, wear seatbelt anyway. I've never skin cancer, wear sun screen anyway. tons people who've never worn seatbelts never wear sunscreen also gotten injured crash developed skin cancer.

""I've never done &lt;safety happened &lt;safety unnecessary"" terrible argument. song become quite apt mood lately don’t think Ontario get cocky. plan schools pretty terrible stands right now. smaller classes kids grade 4. improvements ventilation, enough money cleaning. could see sudden reversal. Yes know I'm lucky, whole household able work home able fully stay public. understand people go work provide family. I'm referring Entertainment non essential reasons leave house. Unfortunately go back school 2 weeks University decided stay person, soon braving well. Good luck stay safe. doubt we’ve totally screwed whole thing up, question might significant forces play addition stupidity. Weather effects something similar may notable bearing. Hard escape noticing Europe northern US dealt severe outbreaks early year, largely southern US, Latin &amp; South America getting hit hard. 

Again, handling terribly, think lot countries little hesitant dunk us get fall &amp; winter. Hope Kandy K worth COVID Nice. Fuck that. way people going learn hits harder sorry loss :( study shows 3-ply surgical type second best N95. 3-ply ones easily obtainable now. Costco whole bunch sale, made BYD. BYD cranking 20 millions+ units everyday.  Sorry little sensitive bud. 

Wear mask. 20 point 3 fucking percent. control. i’m flx region too- i’m worried happen larger colleges school districts start up, believe RIT alone 15,000+ students world Oh my, yes, certainly good laugh!

No...no suppose testing students... CARE! I’m nurse COVID unit. long ass 12 hour shift today, discharged guy super pumped Sturgis Rally happening fact none going wear masks. 3 weeks hospital, nearly dying, he’s excited moment. don’t even know say anymore. I'll assume asking honest question looking pick fight. wear mask required, favour mandatory masking except short-term measure clearly defined endpoints. think us fear indefinite, socially impoverished ""new normal,"" masks symbol that. Masking months big deal, giving full social intimate life, live music, theatre, sports events, festivals, unrestricted travel, expressions free life big deal. pundits suggest may need give things YEARS, rebel. what's asked us runs counter human nature, threat posed virus justify soul-sucking measures. link peer-reviewed paper? live Texas job requires curbside customers. wear mask entire shift get remove lunch breaks.

It's regularly 98+ degrees. problems breathing, feel uncomfortable.

People damn excuse. almost everybody. Especially major risks. what’s solution then? family Texas. Wish could tell worry, like Georgia fine, giving run money. punching weight register number 5. talking yo.my uncle mentioned anout two month lag things like this. Death certificates insurance tax stuff take really compile. idea got 2 months h ought, take heavy skepticism expect us beyond trying get vote like already are?

To frank, nobody expects anything point. Millions infected, tens millions work, 160k dead (300k expected Dec), almost half year since started. 

You guys shit. fact even think voting going help, previous election literally rigged lmao. Absolutely insane. Even would help, actually willing let people die meaningful work, mail ballot 3 months time hope get better January 2021. job tried pulling move. Fortunately Gov Murphy mandated masks. that, would've quit. Made realize 15 years employment, employer side, disagreement HR, prepared lawyer up. lockdown - light. Can't seem find study - link? Actually, arrest tourists first, large number homeless mentally ill. think percentage mentally ill tourists probably lower homeless.

Of course, local businesses want arrest homeless ignore tourists. Protests PDX mostly masks. Problem didn’t protect getting shot chest tear gas gun federal agent. mom teacher Iowa rare blood disorder causes blood clots. I’m fucking terrified her. Kim Reynolds criminal exception Philippines somehow miracle Duterte didn’t turn situation complete cluster fuck, every country right wing populist authoritarian charge (Brazil, India, US, Russia, UK long time) managing terribly.

Who’d thought elect people hate government bad running government? consolation, answer door anyone, need communicate delivery person open upstairs window talk way, also still leave stuff outside bit, still sanitize everything needs refrigerated quarantine everything else 3 days. Im furious people right now, think family never meet son carelessness, dont want exposed bullshit. 

Sorry rant, im fucking exhausted need venting. fact it’s 9 sure kids long term effects due contracting virus. Stripper Karaoke Devil's Point. good advertised. stripper car washes stripper food delivery COVID. Can't disinfect kids though, that's gonna help. GET COUNTRY Damn. you? would love help DONT think problem particular election cycle.

Millennials are... fans Trump. Less now, four years later.

The 2018 midterms made one clear.

Taking House likely saved LOT trouble.  much houses flipped, enough stonewall worst offenses. It’s simply like president doesn’t really care. truly feel Trump could come cease nonsense fucking said to. weird silence total lack urgency almost single handedly fueling entire issue. I’m American lives Europe (since well COVID) I’m always worried go store walk people think I’m stupid American tourist! see family members here. businesses (even clubs witz resteictions) open quite time. Distancing still place - possible (e.g. hair dresser) masks required.

You make sound like life extremly restricted. not. 

The main things leisure activities like big parties / clubs, concerts, sport events etc. Businesses areas (and tourism geberal) still huge trouble ofcourse. Otherwise pretty much everyone know sea / hear working fine. priority appearing good front masses led meaningless death. Fuck you. worthy called doctor. rest garbage human scum associated with. regret means nothing may karma finds soon. Awww mate, dont that. Things get better, moment scales tipped sides idiots populists, tip back again.

Stay earth fight good! need x can't tie American identity movtivates everyone around world go there. There's two things means American means best free. USA already losing freedom banning information terms Chinese apps limited freedom due pandemic. Remove exceptionalism what's holding USA ethnicities together? u talking about? One day like miracle gone gone. /s Crazy think many force early retirement... since schools opening they're fired they're ""quitting"". Surely negatively impacts things like pension. decide safety pension?

:( Maybe months ago. That's certainly true now.  click deaths map. age people dying covid19 trending downward months irrelevant ONE dying something containable preventable. isn't. get fooled this. 1/2000 \* 100 = 0.05% 1 every 3 Spanish Flu. 

Obviously bad, nearly bad people lived back then. 

Can imagine born 1890 so? may WWI, dealt Spanish Flu, Great Depression, managed survive also kids, it’s entirely possible kids would’ve drafted war WWII. 

And 100-125 years ago!

Things obviously easy, compared ancestors went through, we’re still eating ice cream compared eating literal shit. Humanity? Nono, people around wear masks, mandatory functioning sense comes also help others.

Americans days seem selfish pricks, tho. them. Newsom must go too! POLITICIANS MADE DECISIONS KILLED 10 THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS KILL 10 THOUSAND MUST GO! mainstream media thrown context window. compare per capita numbers, US fine. Significant portions Canada 0-10 cases TOTAL past months. wearing masks earned ability to. said, despite one caseless places, NS made masks mandatory start month, seen single person wearing mask since then. tested positive covid made two weeks. still don’t know got it. got even taking preventive measures thought mightve couldnt find anything search. think must’ve another public health official, wouldn’t surprised had. seems trend Americans live knowing that! huge global crisis, country's handling well done them,NZ like 100 days without single case. guess went hardship quaintining, social distancing masks difficult Americans same? like casually throw claims racism. Also, become socially acceptable say ""colored"" people. think may time self reflection. wrong open schools early Math country broken man matter president idoits still exist maga crowd going go away. Trump job Fox news people still listen him. nothing do. Bad people whatever want people like us stuck inside, come Christmas time sitting inside alone Christmas parties. Sorry mean rant 25 yr old scared literally nothing do. mean 0.05 5%? Now, talk individual tests done scientists. talk mass testing industrial scale happens currently Corona.

The problem tests datasheets available manufacturers go necessary tests get approval. So, high failure rate expected.

Failure essential part every thing done industrial scale. simple example cars. often go back workshop get fixed? wouldn’t even think. I’ve right word. right rude accurate try hide rudeness it’s saving face. understand thinking feeling honestly. young, want live life, guy gets asked hey come tonight, girl fun.. temptation go damn high.

One part problem leadership, state national level, president can't even wear fucking mask consistently, state leaders can't even decide enforce them.

Whilst these... What's better word insane ridiculous? Whilst levels leadership exist people, especially young people, behave erratically illogically. let broken economic system downfall. system relied heavily years believed right way go it.

This result universal healthcare system... business leaders government officials sharing healthcare system general populace, there’s reason act it. first world nations universal healthcare (like Canada), leaders aren’t exempt paying taxes — all. So, act quicker ensure doesn’t overwhelm healthcare service capabilities.

In US, however, healthcare gets better afford millionaires run country rough combination. leaders know families protected....

So, don’t care act greater populace, expensive decisions non-inclusive healthcare system end burdening cost nation whole — hence incentive resolve issue drag feat every 1st world nation took reigns get control.

They didn’t want act epidemic ample time so, hoping it’d go away wouldn’t need spend make happen. Now, backfired. Case point; shutdown. never real shutdown, fear economic plight. absolute farce. Now? drawing even ridiculously long shutdown ends painstakingly slower hits gradual pockets depending hotspots end millions infections, ends practically unmanageable.

Now, senators paying tons tax money lower class citizens could get healthcare needed without worrying cost, woulda busted asses make quick, decisive decisions. 

All all, one things prime break US healthcare crisis brought epidemic. are... Worst country world handling — yet “wealthiest” country world? Make sense you? me...

The US pure greed. pharmaceutical executive making tons money sleeps comfortably despite fact neighbour 20 years losing steam ventilator. It’s pathetic. overwhelmed greed make money, resulting broken healthcare system, many wonder there’s stopping it? Trump cronies don’t care you, lol. Every tests costs somebody money. Every dime give pay rent costs somebody money somewhere else. US built principle spending money help neighbours. country’s foundations forged greed selfishness. don’t change die result replaced millions unemployed. It’s less cost now. bottom dollar matters. Everything open months.  entire economy collapsing right pandemic shutdowns. 

Also please shut fuck protests.  protesters gotten covid19 wore masks.  people involved protests infected law enforcement refused wear masks.

This something commented bears repeating pandemic American people going turn attention complicit allowing horror happen first place mention willfully knowingly obstructed measures taken reduce number deaths infections.  better hope god people show compassion empathy sociopaths shown suffering dying. shit hole country. Bye. sad...why using children labor rats? spread widely. countries work together🤬 see work country, try country? get result? dumb🤦🏻‍♂️work together Gov. world. make mistakes let people die maybe different different result. 

if want jump plane parachute guy work checkt it, would without checking twice? think America care death there’s someone blame. make war it. government trying best so. 
There’s one bomb. yet. 
As soon there’s war, everyone get board ‘protect country people’ Studies showing COVID cause major strokes. husband (he’s 37) severe stroke March, never tested him, even hospital transfer &amp; surgery remove clot brain &amp; 2+ days Neuro ICU. explanation giant blood clot right cerebral artery. He’s great, probably 95% recovered, lot people ever get stroke, still gets frustrated limitations. lot young people strokes delaying calling 911, DON’T this. suspect someone else stroke call 911 *immediately*. Time brain &amp; faster treatment usually better chance recovery. hadn’t called 911 let nap (like wanted) he’d dead. stopped breathing hospital &amp; intubated &amp; put ventilator. called 911 slurred twice (my uncle raised died series strokes) husband examined, treated, transferred, operated &amp; recovery 4 hours. Seriously, see someone stroke symptoms, *call 911* (or local emergency number) Yea like, 5 them, 50% Remind me! 4 months Sad part is, funding public transportation decreasing making less less reliable, fewer people use cycle continues.... know, American dream whatever Rubbish rate take 3-5 decades, country left charge. Yes people good job now, mean good job forever. bet Americans, i'd bet people states get tired wearing masks taking precautions stats go right back OFB.

Plus accounting biggest issue all, schools opening up. Even adults good job, kids going get school bring home them.

Also fall pandemics always much worse due weather flu season. least pointing actions happen state level. 

I don’t trust testing can’t isolate covid-19 specifically. first tests came China I’m sure accurate. standard stat reporting state state makes extremely difficult compare anything. Someone post ages people dead. Haryana state Haryana conduct survey 22 districts using lgG ELISA Test kits. main aim survey monitor exposure general population Coronavirus infection Haryana estimate sero-prevalence anti Sars Cov-2 lgG antibodies among population sample size shall estimated district level 850 participants district. samples – 850 participants – divided two stratas – Rural Urban. Haryana’s ratio rural urban roughly around 60:40. 850 participants would divided two clusters – 500 (rural) 350 (urban).

So understand correctly, 850*22 = 18,700 people study teams visit randomly selected households brief survey. verbal consent taken. Doctor team ask questions person record form. end interview, doctor cross check form completeness correctness. end interview, laboratory technician draw 5ml blood, label store it. end sample collection cluster, samples immediately transported designated laboratory processing. ELISA kit methodology generated estimation lgG antibodies used per ICMR guidelines. death of one man a tragedy, the death of millions statistic.

You're insinuating war started? [The Coalition started merely 4 years took power, monarchs Europe absolutely *terrified* implications successful revolution, let alone one done arguably second powerful country planet time.

The 3rd Coalition War declared royalists, can't possibly blame Napoleon responding back defensive deaths many thousands people

*Hundreds thousands, blaming invasion Europe like blaming Poland Hitler Stalin's invasion country, France Poland attacked merely *existing*, yet actually managed fight back aggressors win, they're framed instigators start dynasty

Absolutely proof ever occuring, Napoleon officially fervent republican [respected (while also delegating power himself, yes, know).

It's honestly accurate say France time still Republic governed France manpower fight wars end left Frances utterly defeated.

The Levée en Masse reaction Coalition declaring war France, again, make sense blame Napoleon military leader, good role model improving one’s country.

France brink civil war facing entire royalist continent storming gates, think fair say miracle even managed stop France completely collapsing, thanks government policies tactical brilliance. view it? Cold. cold. .. snd counting. would make rides fairly boring.

You would severely limit acceleration mass ride make non deadly. Also almost materials LD-50 (Even Water Sugar) (Lethal dose 50% test subjects die)

Anything would consider ""fun"" hold least energy break neck grind tiny bits. US list countries travel quarantine etc country. really sad seeing US Flag group almost 3rd world countries. Feels weird don't. cases actually 0 (where live Arizona, went Hotspot slowing lowest Ro)


The R 3 would virus zero precautions, theoretically maximum Ro possible without intentionally spreading it. yup know 4 million people die US year!!!!!!!!! Let's shut everything right fucking now!!! unacceptable!!!! monster caring!!!! 

Everyone sub trash. used smart people here. know changed taken brainless idiots might well walking zombies. seen intelligent post comment weeks now. utter lunacy. biggest fallacy among conspiracy theorists thinking nation/person/whatever *could* done something nefarious/dishonest/whatever, probably *did* so. 0.05% ?? number come from?! ""Reliable transportation"" Also add consideration lot deaths disproportionately come East coast. Thank NY NJ leaders Uranium everywhere, America Nagasaki bomb concentrated heavy isotopes. ""we reopen schools""

""How DARE imply unsafe?!?""

""We need close school safe""

""You still come back nothing substantial make safe.""

Prediction: ""How dare imply short term fix permanently fix problem?""

Prediction 2: ""we need close school, short term fix permanently fix problem"" sobering heartbreaking statistic. 😞 even keep track bodies slum. Wow. amount sun exposure makes look 50% older regular folk. Holy moly. Americans Finlandcount cases. in, around many cases Finland people. That's way fucking many. bus driver thinking.. party goers thinking... fucking planet living Jesus fucking christ care minister Helen Whately told BBC Breakfast: ""Our priority make sure children fully back school come autumn.""

I would thought priority would health safety students teachers 🤷🏻‍♂️ others can't see friends get job study degree wanted. who's suffering. People joking such, finding situation extremely concerning horrifying trying inject bit cheeriness gloom uncertainty. phrasing serious tone mean content intent serious. provided utility teachers already working multiple jobs survive. Ain't nobody got money that! Yea heard virus dropped schools years ago, that’s kids safe school issues around pandemic, think profit healthcare system racism key problems?!

Lmao. issues, driving pandemic issues. saying buzzwords Reddit loves. problem america anti-intellectualism extreme uneducated confidence, well extremely purposefully divisive leadership. exactly Netherlands, even go restaurants. need keep distance lot us that. Seems like US group people still believe fake news Given respective voter turnout rates younger generations versus older ones, faith country even last long enough happen. 161,000 dead 5 months war, take 6 months war. Sure send kids.   Hahaha. Good God. there's survivors permanent damage body. We'll never forget this. depends you’re interested in. 

For impact pandemic, absolutely. it’s also valuable know many deaths directly due covid. 

The problem lot ways define impact covid, there’s tendency vague definitions plenty unscrupulous people intentionally misuse misconstrue varying ways measuring defining impact. 

Like someone says “mortality rate”, could mean 8 different things. Prognosis number double end year. fucking open Bob, fucking filth piece profiteering trash pile cum stain. constantly wonder what's gonna happen power goes out.... people Trump banned entering country China.  European travelers brought virus US.  pandemic costing healthcare industry billions billions much unrecoverable.  Hospital budgets simply can't cover increase patients deal people getting laid off.  Numerous hospitals shut this. one making profit number covid19 patients have. believe CDC recently revised R0 5.7. Well want see study. claims one largest undertaken interesting see what's he's saying true representation. angry. know anger hust must idk else feel. situation pisses left house groceries basic work necessities only, since March. wife daughter included. Im high risk diabetic sacrificed social basic lives me. can't thank enough. point pandemic killing people america lot USA citizen dying.

Your original comment seemed indicate hospitals inflating COVID death numbers get money. doesnt seem case. Spain former king, started career shooting elder brother, spent time rule passing money mistress, getting kickbacks Saudi Arabia evading funds Switzerland.  Hardly. insufferable sensitive types reddit. 

It comment general attitude Canadians don’t much care for. 

Plus arguing fun. Yeah pretty neighborly you, guys raging trying go everywhere else including Florida governor looked sue it.  Oof good know. Granted, live, housing expensive - something like top 5 nation. Awhile ago, came conclusion I'm ok renting life. wanted house, I'd stay partner. But, I've got leave. feel strongly ignore. Ultimately, life revolves entirely around career might cause travel - I'm ok that.

Nonetheless, good know! Thanks! appreciate ""underbelly"" issues Australia. construction really getting nerves recently. “There isn’t evidence of…” Well, evidence doesn’t happen? kids germ spreading machines absolutely every reason believe situation different. large number children testing positive US immediately makes statements like suspect. feel you. makes u feel better people cougg many reasons. allergies coughing bad dont take pills. Hope u stay safe! Unfortunately tho, mercy luck. way fuckin late. one gives shit bodies still dropping. gotta hltry ride till next year. Yes aggression stand man. STOP putting 5g microchips kidsmasks Windows bullyboy! pisses much future healthcare worker.

Like risk life save theirs, go this???

I'm starting feel like people stupid selfish deserve die, horrible nasty cynical thing feel. Ever wonder person selling bat (that started whole thing) feels now? 

Sorry question bit gruesome, think crazy things like mind wanders topic. musing information posted here, thinking “all bat sold market”. started wonder vendor feels. brain left USA.. I'm okay people wearing masks public sick. one stay. culture there? know masks shutdown never mandated, people generally try isolate and/or voluntarily wear masks? guess it'll last five months Ok, differs areas. outside certainly help. Nothing all! Getting away everyone photography crisis helped me. Less people scare away birds too. cutting back Sept. 8th. Reading fundamental. small amount N95’s left. want extend life them... would wearing cloth mask help cover medical grade surgical type mask? Basically thought prevent exposing N95 everything reduce contamination... *that* unbelievable considering Japanese government jack shit. thing happening terms mitigation population large wears masks. New Zealand Without new York would great. Cumo damn idiot. context. Look numbers European countries. Many worse US. Also, pissed. Unfortunately southern states little zero cases ones defiant first. since changed tune. still seen state state issue. federal government passed bills save economy, people. That’s equivalent deaths FIFTY 9/11 attacks. 

If fifty 9/11 attacks course 6 months, would go insane fight whatever terror behind it. Yet it’s something invisible like virus, nobody seems care. always looking excess deaths make sure reaction containing one virus creating bigger detriment line.

 


There come point unfortunately move accept reality covid cause deaths. prize death? thanks. Masks relatively ineffective... Even cloth surgical masks shown much much effective initially thought. Sounds like know then. wary outsider know judge case. 

I agree you, he's scum. misinformation poor leadership...politicizing topics would otherwise saved lives.  ""Require"" strong word. told allowed tell customers leave refuse wear mask. remain nonconfrontational, ignore is, ignore them. ""required"" keep walking, ignore signs, ignore employees, DT/FD gets keep collecting money. Wait. Seriously? said USA?

Indian  frustrating seeing lots Americans certain mindset constantly pointing Sweden example ""see! need anything, either!"" Yet hit significantly harder Nordic country think reason people think it’s bad life expectancy usually increases thus 200k extra dead last year bad regardless crowd people TOTALLY UNRELATED maskers freaks thought “doing America’s youth” transition away football look ways make safer It’s certainly hell get bill. Well is. plans. 
Sort like Pence promised AZ bunch stuff. got maybe quarter promised stuff. rest hospitals state do. Plus local hospital went hospitals buy brand new US ppe manufacturer future needs.
Government level busy getting reelected. Help me! I’m scared places hit first international travel spread easily mass transit population. extremely new little knowledge deal hardly knowledge disease? places? situation Sweden similar, perhaps different immigrant groups. think true groups less money (in Sweden), family organization is, average, different. 

BTW, Firefighters also high list, much 'Swedish' group. I'm smaller town Sweden half school took bus later half primary school. Exactly. Thank using brain. one else see this. amazes dumb people are. know anything china they'll lying numbers implementing draconian measures. Yes, believe cause deaths week, minus 95% interval estimate deaths we'd see random chance week. UK led group cocks (who elected entered government sole promise massive economic damage so, inherently, real political experience integrity). result locked late. 

But turn political event, deny existence, significant pushback particular breed idiot US seems generate. 

Also, well past worst numbers reasonably stable, Ylyou can't really compare US numbers still rocketing.

Which say US categorically alone elegantly named ""greesed cock"" metric. Probably Americans pretty fat  So, see trying math figure death rate. 162,000/5,000,000=.03. .03=3%, .03% ""I know anyone it, hoax.""

""How many billionaires know? yet think become one."" see sides. lot jobs, wages stagnant.  grew broke. lot people things previous generations did. see young guys taking cars get alternators changed getting charged $20+ dollars per bolt. That's fine person money, see lot broke people stuff like Yeah, im sorry others take place risk group make sure process continues, STUPID FUCKING GOVERNMENT GET HEADS ASSES MAIL VOTING.  sry didnt mean yell, im pissed Lmao think covid something? long left spread freely number going go Added link above. Added link above. ""most powerful nation"" like ridiculous nation correct font sarcasm SpongeBob meme. 
wAkE sHEeP! Nope. grew Cold War threat nuclear annihilation. People age still voted trump pandemic deniers. generation going save humanity. generation ever saved humanity. either run ground nature causes reset. Maybe we’ll get lucky technology get point we’ll able fix everything. still many people though. Quit making new people message generation. really, no, already good start line thinking. im tired mainstream media using scare tactics views. honestly confusing many people comes severity virus people mitigate it. mother cautious best get infected work literally told know hell happening due multiple exaggerated contradictory headlines/information like these. ""misinformation"". fact, necessary context accurately understanding true impact virus weighing costs response it. call ""misinformation"" fucking alarming. Exactly. we're talking deaths, see ultra-small numbers used describe something serious appears disingenuous... like they're trying hide truth behind stats Imagine 9/11's happening every week 2 years row. mean technically, less people compete LETS SHOOT 40 /s rookie numbers!

Let's get numbers up!!

 - Trump http://www.floridahealth.gov/diseases-and-conditions/disease-reporting-and-management/disease-reporting-and-surveillance/data-and-publications/weekly-morbidity-reports/index.html  disturbing - got vaccinated school Dude, Sweden less 1 death per day (5 deaths last week).
And commonly known Sweden counts deaths.

I try skip politicized hit peaces use objective data form opinion, try too...

Atleast try objective critizism... Yeah doubt anyone know die fucken tik tok meme. Remember flu deaths guys lay tests? Lol sucks. Fix healthcare system force shitty government make decent public system instead ripping tax payers Add collateral damage even CDC's number seems low compared England reported. every three Corona fatalities two fatalities caused able get treatment time. wait day collateral damage overtakes. Maybe try people built Berlin wall, managed overnight month two reasonable least Canada/America border. Yeah, note numbers first comments. course kids spread virus grown ups, known! sane person debating longer. debate much spread adults.

Your conclusion absurd, though. reasonable conclusion teachers higher previous contact corono viri adults, lending immunity. anecdote Fallacy, aware see comment. Germany successfully fighting virus crippling lockdowns, angered people. proportion people believe COVID deadly serious different Germany US.

Not say saying factually incorrect, please careful words. words life death United States. 19 days test results... great, terrible. may play well. hard know sure due sorry state science relation understanding pandemics. least pandemic provide opportunity help nail things better coming years. We’re risk. Various levels risk, virus kills tons healthy people. You’re selfish. care agenda lives. numbers lie. virus still spreading like wildfire. numbers going down, might make sense. aren’t though keep banging head wall. funny thing many poor nations hit hard due population younger people spending time outdoor spaces. Survivorship bias. Likewise! Unfortunately live family seem think exempt isolating: 3/4 birthdays July time, brothers sisters in-laws children came visit. went another birthday barbecue yesterday, fact. Whenever try indirectly bring social distancing conversation(they don’t take well bluntness) they’ll agree stupid *others* being, “that’s they’re visiting family.” Meanwhile there’s people family sleepovers, going dates, going bars regularly. 
You safe people live reckless. 1 every 600 NY. evenly distributed. 90% NYC. Even though NYC 60% population. That’s weird way saying COVID-19 .02 kill rate. Maybe beginning locked sick risk. possible partial lockdown, letting herd immunity thing, would give us better result now?

I don’t answer it’ll worth looking back hindsight. .02% deaths skewed older sick. Q ""the best way democrats win slightly less republican republicans""

Stupid Roughly one every 120 Americans die year one way another I've trying avoid sitting restaurants, four restaurants remember visiting previous three months, sign-in. vent perfectly fine.  Seems like needed it.  Hopefully mother realize seriousness soon. know, China's great wall built centuries multiple people. Plus I'm pretty sure contractors dead now.

Maybe people built Berlin wall, similar concept, managed day west Berlin 0.03 atm, actually, going 0.04 0.05 cases.

Just look countries mostly cleared backlog infected, calculate dead vs total cases. Omg. 99.96% American population fine! people insanely cowardly it’s absolutely disgusting. Good thing using worldwide statistics dumb brother law wearing one went pick things sisters. soooo sheer could see mouth it. eye balling appeared useless. told us getting tested Bc exposed. Ugh. like aspect over-thinking this, extending consider real impact was. work well light saying young people higher life value due used much life potential yet. 

If someone late 80s pushed edge corona, would died within extra year two anyway, would involved considerable suffering, loss definitely less. Otherwise death death, average expected remaining life span kind matter. Either way empty chair Thanksgiving. recoil certain offenses, depends individual bit. Killing woman baby (when alternative simple divorce child support) really grinds gears. Scott got lung clots deal, I'd cool that. Yeah, thought didn’t occur number seemed absurdly high. tips get better improving ability myself? OK, thought kindergartens same. kids inside times rain pouring down, besides everything outside.  Covid-19 lasting months end excuse bad earrings. Seriously. Still mean ridiculous amount deaths actually virus. information like extremely misleading trying draw away fact country failing extremely controlling virus. Regardless people dying causes still shitload died virus misinformation like this. LOL health precautions we're taking causing infectious diseases stop spreading much. I’ve never felt much anger towards country before. used proud American, I’m embarrassed. world seeing truth America, Americans seeing truth other. thought knew friends family were, covid happened, complete strangers me. boyfriend watching tv show said weird watch people interact without masks social distancing? want tell back up!! he's like omg thinking too!!! Sure, study done way, first glance see might suggest something different. countless factors could play result though. can't seem find study anywhere, willing bet considering something important. I've seen many studies significant evidence equivalent higher child child transmission outside schools believe magical difference school. op picked worst countries. Germany example 1 death 99.000. I'm proud ***not*** American CFR = case fatality rate 
IFR = infection fatality rate actually 75k deaths average last 5 years, adjusting population growth. select calculate additional mortality. Grasping straws like grasping air. soon join him. imbalance talent? want put money that? Damn. get 6 weeks. 4 weeks + 1 day legal minimum Norway. people get 5 weeks. Thanks that. always say pathological addiction 'freedom' makes US right now, every aspect.

People see freedom actually something also arise limiting freedom.

Well anyway, thanks. Nice see others also see problem. bringing socialism this? Socialism answer. answer educating citizens majority longer stupid. Look hyper capitalist Hong Kong notice barely deaths. public educated disease disease prevention. Uh, no. [It's purely catch geographical ideological sorting complete, even states furthest along one side still plenty people side. Unfortunately can't go detail moderation sub excessive. think revealed dangerous politicizing every issue become. political issue, manufactured one news outlets could gain viewership. feel concerns, excellent contract tracing quarantine practice Singapore, guys lot better number much lower averages per day. Hell yeah bought 100 shares $0.40. I've made enough money afford half Oragami King. you? Darara-rum darara-rum Dara rum Dara rum..

Oo wahahah!! Eu irrelevant shithole

Says 1 americano Canadian population accounted GTA, Montreal Vancouver. 

Try 30%. 20 million people three areas I'd expect Europeans known beginning time tbh Thousands? Smash Mouth concert? managed giving shit. can't said 99% countries Soo neighbors saying this? heard almost positives, minor criticisms that’s life. Like people living day age feeling responsible slavery. “People keep commenting giant horse dildo suction cupped onto forehead! It’s annoying!”

“Have tried addressing issue? (Taking off)”

“NO! God keep bringing up!” optimistic. Spoken like true patriot. Get well soon say revealed, rather reaffirmed. Think we've known something pretty fucked U.S. now. What's absurd comparing country size US Nordic countries.   Nahh, it´s assume Americans don´t know country anyways. j/k course. usually mention country (Austria) writing specific stuff like this. don’t agree article bad news position matter. I’m American. B1G canceleed. Bc annoying 

Fair enough tho bro do. vast majority Americans point pandemic. I'm simply pointing judge people's actions opinions early spring standards now. can't crucify past selves simply following public health recommendations time. That's thing scientific knowledge. constantly evolving, thus, approaches problems evolve accordingly. both? dummies school thought smart informed nerdy uncool. I’d split group two groups. One pretty quiet uninterested imposing ideals others opposite. latter feels sense inadequacy try force beliefs onto anyone isn’t like ridicule social alienating them. Somebody told Corna gonna roll me. ain't sharpest tool shed. Hey half US. Add ignorant, selfish, idiotic though. half actually intelligent cares wanted different past, present, future us. blocked saw it. also accused emotional manipulation pointing mom caught (her friend) would kill her. immigrant thing. also departments get support sometimes need. ""Everything's working fine problems ever surface, obviously overstaffed"" last 4 years telling. correct, points mention pertain quality posts. 

Those points cannot attributed materials posts OP provides though. 

Strange opinion. Yup, overweight smokers health insurance. know they're thinking. guess just... aren't.  Sadly testing extremely low. Now, whether that's people wait long stopped going get tested cases actually dropped? knows apparent testing dropping faster positive rate. Warren multiple times never able explain planned pay things. giving free shit everybody wouldn’t give 400k/yr job teaching 1 class. last 20 years shown pretty clearly. goes back Nixon Especially given push US citizens incredibly stupid highly infrastructurally/life-damaging things through...really shitty memes? poorly-produced YouTube video? Copypasta looks like translated Tagalog Arabic English?

Like, like finding little politicians paid for. Really? That's takes? Correlation doesn’t equal causation though. Vitamin deficiency common amongst demographics hardest hit (obese, elderly, etc.) demographics underlying conditions. think sunshine, exercise, healthy eating, supplements (when necessary) great general health, haven’t seen studies suggesting aforementioned demographics would less severe infections simply increasing vitamin levels. 

With regard virus racist....what? Let's hope gets approved general use, manufactured quantities fast, affordable non rich people. correct? Europe twice many people. Russia longer part Europe? TIL Oh well that's little different. Hope found good work-life balance now.  schools run federal Bureau Indian Affairs affected. Obviously can't force tribal-ran schools open, like can't force state-run schools open. wanted read article every time almost loaded exit realized source. 

Why would ANYONE interested Covid info want give clicks advertising money Fox, alongside Facebook, single biggest purveyor anti-mask sentiment misinformation. 

Fox encouraged anti-maskers protest day one, hyped Hydroxychloroquine, demonized Dr. Fauci, encourage disregard science. Fox considered source information. It’s politics through-and-through (propaganda you’d rather mince words) banned.

By way, we're fragile, USA still lower death toll per million than, Italy, UK, Spain, Sweden, Belgium? Wait noticed ? is. YES! This! THISSSSS!!!! Throw life limiting medical issues lot us totally fucked. I'm gonna ruin parents retirement I'll still living them. said ""most prosperous"" 200 years used GDP growth proxy that. argument stupid proxy ""prosperous."" stand that. like US

That really hasn’t standard US several decades. 8:30-5 thirty minute break lunch common, variation. 40 hour week 40 working hours.  Yes, thanks. saw that, really try read sites original language. like pain. can't seem think single example first world people taking, ""blame"" something do. give example?

 ""blame"" mean ""responsibility fix""? that's generally good thing. lol, misguided idiot redditors thread thinking pack move different country.

Canada especially really strict immigration laws. hope highly desirable set job skills. Millenials general 24-39 really young.  Yup, peers graduated 2012 STEM degrees problem finding jobs quickly. again, I'm Silicon Valley, there's tech jobs people. again, perhaps exception, I'm going feel bad fortunate student loan debt, also I'm going feel bad accruing wealth nearly 10 years now. Europe far behind “handling much better” like Redditors claim? think pandemic fueled hate discontent everyone. Duolingo going #1 app US soon. Gotta get out. Welp, secret out. /s Awesome thanks. point clearly talking specifically England here. figured elementary school Cringe Dining practical, IMHO. people can't get to-go food eat park bench friends can't bear socializing bit? least get go, put lower risk cause risk employees restaurants would otherwise repeated contact patrons throughout day. yeah, I'm thinking capitalism pretty damn good.

I sure millions facing eviction rigth US losing jobs due Coronavirus would agree statement. Also Europe gets many cases including Russia, transcontinental country falls 77% Asia. peer reviewed know methodology flawed.

Super glad speculations though... “China growing global superpower watch America wilt, it’s inevitable gain influence across globe coming decades” 

You: “tHaTs RaCisT”

Do hear ? 

Also don’t give shit stance ccp ? Nothing ever relevant, Christ alive. 

YOU one added racist context. couldn’t original comment stating Chinese businessmen inevitably influence ? That’s read it, one who’s making dog whistle. ever said? Shut fuck up. Yup, that's named Gen X, forgotten generation. Fine me, want part generational wars. mother, EVOL BOOMER, worked ass life nothing show end slow death. I'm participating stupid hate blamefest. people power pulling strings, everyone else trying get live lives. I'm watching aunt go Trump rabbit hole. pretty heatbreaking. said U.S. 200+ year run used GDP growth indicator run. read post respond to? Nooooo! USA bad! one wants live there, reddit told so! Reeeeee! claim thread article specifically young men opposed to, example, young women.

And among those, would expect single parents affected most, parent couple, rest. 

I see guys specifically would affected girls specifically. really. could've easily said need start teaching Russian, cause means same. countries track overtake take US. REALLY going end soon, it? I'm starting absorb never get job field studied major film productions require 50 100 people room. I'm starting absorb things like movie theaters plays common place end\* 2021. I'm really getting depressed. People wearing masks they're afraid looking weak? literally lost dreams livelihood shit ton people believe science. know wake morning. anymore. Wow. sound healthy! It’s actually super cool. know I’m talking wrong person, honestly see someone wearing mask think they’re super cool. internet. grew way fast without enough education use it. Match good portion population know critically think, are. one cares you’re saying. course is. way Americans treat people tried protect far vilify them. nation going sewer real fast silent majority keeps saying nothing. accrual rate goes work there. like 15 years like 8hrs/pp. think 20 goes 10. 20 years get start. 

I work public sector state government, benefits best field. private company might pay usually benefits worse, including things like pay medical insurance (in comparison, NHS tied literal life death healthcare employment). 

But America, insert something BoOtStRaPs get paid dirt tied working death name almighty squiggly green line. forgot says ""a lot people tell me""... also words used sound little sophisticated.   like maybe play game ""telephone"" dozen nitwits, itll perfect end. Except head authority one putting message ignore science common sense. 

If competent administration place Washington still happened, would good point.  hearing College footbal might scrapped alltogether fall, think going hear weekk. least rumblings getting publlcatians like Sports Illustrated. wonder happen MLB? number hundred current number, one month ago. 800-900 medical industry deaths corona. They’re two days clean classrooms. I've playing 2017 video game ""Horizon Zero Dawn"" (PS4 - came PC figured time play copy bought sale ago).

At core, small, localized problem - amplified pride shortsightedness - spread eventually resulted death billions people collapse society know it. quotes story:

""We're talking fall civilization, we're talking extinction!""

""I get it, Lis! stop contained?""

""It's contained! can't be!""

""When asked find cure, expect worse disease!""

This probably good game play pandemic one wishes stay optimistic. Paywall. Impossible read article all. laugh people. It’s reddit everything overreaction anymore here. first time sheltered lives face actual numbers mortality. clue anything put front instantly shocking. 1 2000 pretty small terms terms causes death. Europeans astonished Europe 3x amount deaths Corona US  point pretty much every American lost close loved one *r*mp plague.   dark times pray everyday come November see first glimmer hope 4 years. Well apparently lot people choosing side virus. recognize deaths continue. 
Even triple rate - say 150 100,000 still puts 25 year olds up. 

Covid risk especially older population majority, risk dying statistically significant I'm obese. I'm house working out. :( this? 1,688 1,795 deaths per million people NYS NJ respectively
1688/(1 Million) 3/2000
.001688 I'll take that. I'm Boston we've like 10 murders 2 weeks along packed beaches bunch venues holding illegal 300-person weddings getting fined $3000 (chump change compared make wedding) Unfortunately around half country cares. Half America seems mentally broken decades manipulative news media politicizing everything much agendas. Another large group people care virus non-political reasons. 

I wish everyone understood failing take seriously going make take longer get back normal. T-Cells antibodies piece... no, it’s not.

The herd immunity determined based mass testing don’t capacity currently place determine right shows claimed it...still received it...I'm able buy anything right money left. 

Go buy whatever want! I'm asking buy anything. air never stagnant unless room perfectly sealed, nothing inside moves, temperatures air perfectly consistent 1. point IFR looking at. looking actual test results looking CFR. explanation two
2. find south carolina data linked CDC page actual test results estimate, prove article wrong.
3. i'm it, south carolina reports 1400 covid patients currently hospitalized 356 ICU future deaths make article even wrong. 
4. south carolina reported roughly 240 cases per million day lately means fraction 7,000 tested positive cases yet go hospital along approximately 10,000 positive cases currently asymptomatic test results pending. know latest percentages whatever fraction future deaths make article even wrong. 
  1. hell, math? gotta start adding 10% current covid death total account fraction positive people results yet, since deaths lag 3 weeks want look approximately 40k cases time period, 60k/2k lead 120k/4k deaths cases all. 
5. unless people south carolina markedly healthy average (plot twist, aren't) using actual flu diagnosis drastically inaccurate compared CDC surveillance south carolina residents apparently surviving flu hospitalizations nearly double rate states. someone definitely write paper awesome medical care south carolina. 
6. way article june, deceitful written obviously got agenda posting there's 6 weeks data prove even wrong Depends open area, full lockdown whole winter unlikely. I'm american live one luckiest cities planet lmfao, but!, experience party bus goers tend pretty regular people. Students mostly, sub 25, hardworking n decent.

Obviously shits different states, much really alien place me, fully understand mindset, least first-hand Cheers, ""my dude"". I'm saying dark, sarcastic, deeply cynical sentiment behind joke commonplace reddit really helping anyone's mental state cope truly tragic situation. entire world facing problem together, yeah, acknowledged, US embarrassment making everything worse, pretend like situation even remotely funny us. country would read joke dismayed Americans making light situation continue accelerate it. Hope don’t get it. understand then, guys wait hours pay thousands? one teacher said, old kindergarten teachers never get sick everything already. hope clarity afforded Covid lens sustained order effect meaningful change. tragedies nothing otherwise.

There moment early UBI discussed seriously. armed authright protesters stormed Michigan statehouse Trump's ultimate endorsement go ""liberate"" (blue) quarantine states. like moment over. political grifting sociopathic anti-science populism exploded alongside body count. are. Plague laid us bare *and matter*.

It might game particular militant empire. Remember, Dr. Fauci say schools good reopen. There's way pua denied you, buying it. two near octogenarians running president. think decisions begin change?

Sure, dude. Wait Ireland bypassing Schengen rules stating USA Wasa red country Seriously, I'm tired us giving health officials pass want play politics. say truth transparently, like job describes. everyone fire it.

Its stupid. Company mission, fuck. reminds story PE teacher told us learning first aid. heimlich guy choking steak restaurant. saved continued eat big pieces Quick question: how’s covid thing clashing american private healthcare?
I live Spain weve got public healthcare here, who’s paying bills regarding infected people american hospitals?
Its like cant forget otherwise covid keep infecting people Yeah, works assume errors random source. tests basic ingredients though, may systematic bias random component. example inherent limited efficiency key step every tests needs fo (say, RNA isolation, even though that's example, know whether case), tests bias false negatives - random component top that, generally Gaussian, centered zero.

I produced anything, process large amounts data job. basic countermeasures helped Europe soooo much im sure since UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden higher deaths per capita US saw another, similar post recently: ""TIL 1 every 2,000 residents United States imprisoned life, highest rate world"" coronavirus death count matches life imprisonment count. Far high both. sounds right, it’s months &amp; lot medical stuff since then. We’re still waiting medical records send us papers finish insurance claims. Everything takes longer since COVID.

Even tho UK, Spain, Italy, Sweden objectively handled corona virus worse deaths per capita US exact thing here. go emergency room sprained wrist something minor. serious people come [Found mask used train Go run experience true oxygen deprivation. piss weak respirator. true. hundreds thousands, feel impact one. currently praying become two.

I can't even conceive many millions people going thing. There's ""new normal"". People like masks now, suck greater good nobody besides redditors keeping ends. also point single stat whatsoever. One problems well teaches people useless thing do, pray, important actually taking real proactive measures improve situation. example, line work going putting dangerous position soon due inadequate safety guidelines. safety measures place protect Covid. coworkers concerned, fall back onto old, “the best thing pray” crap sit around feeling sense false security. causes people less feisty concerned fighting improve lot. though Can’t say blame lot people react. becomes safety issue. drive in? assure you, Darwin's theory nothing stupid people

If look excess deaths Massachusetts deaths caused COVID-19, almost exactly same.

Mask absolutely nothing :D live road school want clarify, school virtual next 2 days due cases. school district so. Yes, specifically talking mobile internet phone. Right requirement able use basic services like going office visit, text get Can't go inside. Quite right. based comment based study published yet. Compared what? Oh yeah.

We stay busy, try come new meals get bored dinners.

I kinda fear what’s going happen flu season people can’t get hospitalized. Neighbors always asked general advice wife happily listens, working killer hours right now, plus don’t much treat anyone home (a pulse oximeters otc meds thats truly CoVID19’s sake (lots emergency/trauma treatments every doc know keeps medicine cabinet case)).

Thankfully I’ve always downplayed jobs wife IRL, it’s neighborhood families know dinners play dates started, still lot people say county doesn’t get act together flu season. American cares. Keeping family healthy avoiding crowded places. Keeping kids home (I situation can) school. mask go out. restaurant since kids went spring break March. 


There many think pandemic going on. 



As miserable lockdown it, less miserable things now. access things open, feels irresponsible carry things normal. least lockdown, felt like together. everything fractured cases keep going up. Same. much same. quiet ones care others ourselves. trust had,however little, govt definitely gone. I'm even hard trusting science situation well. trust Fauci says... 'vaccine' boosted administration already trust list. I'll wait see Fauci says end. Plus know clinical trials include pregnant women, never do. So. Sadly, think I'll taking vaccine I'm convinced safe try conceive. I'm utterly disappointed state federal govt. care, comes voted this? Lol. Swedens numbers may be.accurate sure hell arent good. still failed incredibly badly killed 5k people reason. country population 10 million.

But yeah arent fucking numbers atleast ""Virtually immune"" I’m pointing statistics suggest first many. don’t need hide, masks aren’t going away find little uncomfortable wear. feel sorry people living fear areas can’t go bar act normal. caught bad flu start, doctors said trouble breathing there'd point testing •_• guess keep fingers crossed. huffpost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

what's purpose lockdowns?

what 3 things need? article shares idea paying social media influencers young men watch spread message. don’t disagree. media influencers right treating virus non- issue. not. district 100% students, face face, five days week. :( Without looking statistics, guess would Texas Florida also list. formatting left desired think funny person claiming live Sweden live Sweden this. Take blue surgical mask. Cup hands around mouth nose air go front mask. 10 minutes. coffee filter. easy Yeah see colleges shits plans. Like you, hope Cornell making work. Ironically work one quarantine locations students, even cause freak out! 

Lots students also Jersey/New York, I'm hoping know seriousness comply new protocols influence students so. cares Europe.  thank you! Nothing they'd love larger uneducated base. lot people asymptomatic unreported got news media love sell high rate due fear porn Got make sure time print counts don’t go way “supposed” go. dunno... someone city I'm lowkey scared schools opening, specifically subway. I've riding train work every day since mid-June, everybody mask up, crowdedness trains blissfully low. room everyone sit like two seats apart everyone else nearly every train I've past two months, expect good deal reason behind kids commuting school.

Even schools half-on half-off scheduling, that's still injecting huge number people currently staying home transit system. faith middle high schoolers travelling alone abide MTA's mask policy, faith parents carting around younger kids mask up. Hopefully MTA increases frequency trains (currently they're running half frequently used normal, think), quite honest faith either.

Sending kids back school feels like stirring population big dumb economy-motivated stick, evenly mixing city's little covid pockets new communities easier time spreading. Dunno metaphor makes sense feel. people wear masks protests Sturgis rally.

Why fail reconcile information belief system beyond me. MuH aMeRiCa BaD 😏🙄 well aren’t special Weird, seems like statement given Herman Cain went hospital.

It's always sort ""abundance caution"" isn't. revel schadenfreude others.....that's like 75% website. People right threaten her!!! /s Firing whistleblowers others make look bad reminds behavior certain president. can't quite put finger name. I'll ask again. Proof this?

The reason could people adapting taking precautions seriously.. could stranger internet new evidence doctors scientists saying fact correct. one listen argument, long substantial evidence behind it, none providing.

So again, appreciate effort explain away wearing mask, compelling enough make believer. get here

China. started China. Except he’s old interesting term coined previous administration fear public. Seems like may projection. use closest thing ever also interesting. Canada thing worked well here. Granted dont 0 cases (we big population), exception activities still banned, masks mandatory, life normal here. feel like UK! think still lockdown, people going foreign holidays fucking moronic. Yes, Bush Reagan (and others) monsters. still think there’s increasing trend towards right, even worldwide. suspect it’s (worrying) sign times. Somebody recently said Americans “groomed” accept ever increasing levels conservative thought, Including acceptance wage disparity corporate graft. Stay healthy - great hear everything turned fine. minds crazy things much information virus. Hey, perfectly safe reopen. made visitors agree waiver Disney corporation bears legal responsibly cases COVID. See, perfectly safe company. real name James Harris. dude Mississippi. dark wrestling back meant actually Africa character. don’t really ever felt need relationship, able job love seeing friends like family hard. don’t need much social stuff, stripping things need wasn’t really good psyche. threatening child taking picture stupid people.  confronting denial. know level liberal hoax.

Calling ones pictures stupid little harsh. required law there, choice. probably know environment masks nearly worthless, hear parents big deal. They're essentially still children, putting position morons. dentist started push cleanings (me family overdue). pediatrician started push annual checkup kid. doctor pushing annual physical.

I understand hard situation, going hard virus control. Sunbelt Curve fraction New York curve terms death said Sunbelt Curve already decline.

August 10th US sits 165,000 deaths seem forget wasnt long ago predicting [1.7 million point entirely unrealistic number US. holding hands! would Astros fan Social media cancer long time. late stage point fun, checked Binghamton University's plan? tests required students living off-campus, surveillance testing planned all. 


Cornell, least, trying *really* hard make safe. wonder possible, I'm glad working campus fall, they're really pulling stops. truly believe Cornell, isolated is, labs, aggressive testing plan can't make work, one can. They’re likely laid result lockdown policies, I’d say pretty heavily affected. mind? website describes detailed way % people get hospitalized, die, etc. sorted age? keep finding websites usually people 20 59 one group looking detailed data. Summer 2019. chinese spies stole deadly diseases biological weapons institute Canada. 'Murica matter political side, friend. Look, Democrats this, wait, Republicans that... sad.

It’s sad think someone would see lazy consider kids. salary less spent required degree get job. Seriously would work 12-14 hour days. I’d bring work home nights weekends top that. purchase supplies backpacks food even clothes students need it. I’ve gotten involved personal levels help advocate assist students legally court. anything kids. I’ve even happily gotten trouble admin sake standing kids. asthma (with history hospitalized exacerbation due respiratory virus) don’t want risk life, must care students??  correct. Reddit tends run op-eds skewed statistics ""news"" currently nothing propaganda fear mongering moment. 

Is covid bad? Yes. bad reddit making out? Nowhere close. Basically, suggesting stop processing tests 24 hours old give 100% priority ""new"" tests.

It gets rid backlog puts impetus telling infected people soon possible. We'd need sort mechanism inform people test getting processed. Georgia really wants kill citizens. people regularly ""fall windows"" they're told.

In US “law enforcement” officers crush neck public view don’t you’re told. 

I’d rather get defenestrated windpipe crushed 9 minutes, guess that’s personal choice. people making threats, wonder vote for? Hmm problem keep schools open start(despite union opposition) cases start rise substantially close schools. flip side close schools start open cases dramatically reduce. There’s right way fact padded practice pushed back probally first seed cancellation. scared coronavirus. scared conservative virus. bet MUCH higher Florida deduction based virus spreading anywhere Earth. There's reason starts declining far 60% every single area hits. parent. kid learning lot even pandemic - probably much in-person school, brain growing stronger every day.

If sent kid physical school house administered morons would expect brain muscles grow weaker every day.

However, understand kids pain ass. Sometimes wish could hours time. I’m single, thirsty, bored depressed. still choosing stay home protect others &amp; it’s making already morbid depression pretty much unmanageable 😔  vast majority indians live slums.

Although many Indians live slums absolute number people high be, simply true, search around bit making statements like population Brazil Russia combined around 350mi India population 1.3bi, OBVIOUSLY adjustment made much larger

I talking adjustment absolute numbers, talking percentage. article adjusts 500% India 0% countries comparing to. false choice cause effect works. 

Just think something isn’t good doesn’t mean must lie, manipulate propagandize. 

It’s quite possible think something isn’t good still honest it. I'm trying reconcile two things:

* Protests safe even though large group people yelling, chanting, singing, etc.... they're outside. cases outbreaks associated protesting. 
* Sturgis rally unsafe large group people yelling, chanting, singing, etc.... going get outbreak this.

These two things can't true right? wrong. Quick, think there's kids lawn! This, already socially distanced. Way deaths required even remotely taken seriously. someone know love suffers dies...this another overblown Flu. I'm pregnant right prenatal appointments thing leave house for. husband ""essential"" work one except wears masks sanitizes. comes home sanitizes hands touching door knobs goes straight take shower. 

I feel like live bubble im high risk lupus. double danger baby. masks. civil/social cooperation containing virus. hit SARS years ago, experience know handle it. Even Canada, we're seeing attitudes, though nowhere near scale, since government comparatively better response.

I've actually turn invitations friends mine go stuff like axe throwing escape rooms. degrees hard sciences, one one biology. never thought they'd ones irresponsible. They've always significantly social me, guess must going crazy isolation. Oh great! That's 83,000 people getting small enclosed tin flying tubes right huge unnecessary congregation. Even worse expected. No, it’s good. Getting COVID isn’t death sentence either though, people recover. still live life take precautions get sick. Doomers need stop jacking fear porn everyday go outside. Reminds “the official position state nuclear disaster possible Soviet Union” Chernobyl Soon faith based dieing. Mate, i'm already balls deep sub LOL disappear....like magic frustrating think negativity signing blame somehow problem.

But people going die today, due actions person bragged successful do-nothing plan was, seem worried about.

I hope time difficulty, someone tells stay positive, remember hollow advice is. Yeah, enforcement going pain arse sure. doubts well I'm hoping I'm wrong Cornell makes work. county excellent change all. Test software get blue screens death Everyone knows 15 cases soon it'll disappear. Fake news.  home snowflake. stores shop people. services shop people. That’s meant. can't rely ""herd immunity"" save us (yet). far I'm aware, actually know much immunity works covid. still something we're learning about.

There apparently cases people becoming sick recovered virus before, dont know, example, long immunity lasts. there's another concern virus mutate way counters previous antibodies essentially causes second, potentially dangerous wave.

The point being, absolutely can't let guards moment. places Europe already beginning see uptick cases. Minnesota, one person age 30 died Covid, infant. 

The data California seems similar, although demographics differently bigger bins. 0% deaths 18 7% 45. right, thought. Someone sharing opinion rather fact. Mr. Gates bro, release cure safe. get it, need wash hands. We’ve enough 🏳️ ""that's goes"" That's really I'm getting Johns Hopkins data linked. Testing seems dipped nationally past week so, nothing crazy, looks maybe 10-15% less late July (hard say exactly since there's running trend line). filter Texas specifically, think that's talking ""seriously screwy"" - took absolute nosedive amount time, several days like 60-80% drop, including day zero whatever reason. 

By way, HHS ""takeover"" data apply case counts. hospitalization (capacity/utilization) only. decrease cases testing fumbling happening nothing that. Help here, larger .05% 0.00000582524%? latter South Korea's death rate. Anti-intellectualism it’s finest time. Pandemics happen every 100 years. Statistically bound live one. wars.

I'm saying suck. suck. likely happen lifetime. Yeah remember one. Crazy nut job predicting NYC scenarios playing rural America, hospital overcrowding g massive spikes cases.

I said won’t happen natural social distancing people begun isolating seeing NYC.

I right! Thanks bringing accurate predictions. Maybe dig post history more. wouldn’t creepy all. record, Swedens strategy disaster Tegnell massive hack.

He isnt totally wrong saying constantly opening closing would bad public trust though. Staying one consistant plan could reduce fustration confusion.

Swedens strategy disaster cause plan stuck doesnt work. plan work could effective. We'll see long threshold nowhere near 60%. know, antibodies last couple months would impossible antibody tests show total number people virus. emergency cell phone plans get government big deal USA care, back Sweden care considered ""smart""?

I get it. What's difference? Unpopular opinion probably seems like threats fellow students area kids. ""I know lives"" threat dumb ass kid internet. ""We're going jump every girl 10th grade named Hannah?"" Wtf that?

Anyway course right thing assume lot hate got fellow students trolls. Threats absolutely taken seriously hopefully locate idiots. 

I bet took picture show bad realize social media going try tear apart. certainly feel bad attention getting. ITALY too, that’s norm now. Damn. bodied him. Martha's last statement 8/5 said undergrads would tested twice weekly honest, believe that's really possible. weekly believe, vet labs, can't even manage keep maskless students congregating building's common spaces. guys reddit never cease amaze Idk we’re allowed post Venmo @ would like send 5 bucks. Maybe reddit pitch necessities you? smell american tears ? “It depends virus load contagion.”

Completely made top head. be. thought unboxing videos weird. *i seriously get appeal* Hey, I'm sorry hear that. starting PhD in? Anything biorelated? so, feel free pm hold mine biomedical eng. Glad help anyway can. Cheap flights Zoom literally accessible everyone, like exclusive secret friends access to. pretty sure someone preached racial segregation 2020 would call Nazi.

Depends, Nazi sympathizer plain old racist? Someone kills Nazis....not Nazi. America intentional shit show propagated rich(on sides political aisle). going change revolution, get hopes up. America, whole, kinda sucks. Yes live here, yes would love leave. California secede. Two reasons:

No offence, Americans (not you) get offended easily. want risk offending States.

Ireland's economy largely built American companies. Basically corporate tax laws low, American companies often make European bases here. completely jump-started economy. Last time thought fragile lost country. get opinion us get yard order. modern healthcare system freedom choice ever? thought always go whatever doctors network employer's plan. freedom choice republicans happy parade about? we’re going feels like three time.

That's perception, respect feels like that. However, remember First World War 1918 flu almost simultaneous, Great Depression long really ended World War II.

It feels good way think we're unique never happened lets us avoid feeling helplessness guilt - extraordinary situation, there's ""nothing do"". 

There is, however, nothing new feel like people lived periods way stronger less complacent today.

That's another common trope today - Nothing Ever Good Used Be.

The truth many, many things better past generation ever lived.  potential live longer, learn more, achieve anyone us.

We used dealing things like plague, famine, war we've lived peace less prosperity 80 years now... time period finally ending, we're going work little harder little smarter live well. That's problem, I've said we've done before. anything covid19 revealed USA third world country disguised first world country. Yep, sub gone downhill. Europe whole bad people giving shit. It’s easy circle jerk US, we’re world stage 24/7, countries watching news, criticizing crowded bars parties wearing masks. Lets honest, europeans love find reasons shit americans. 

We’re huge country, state handling issue differently. US compared EU whole. that, see it’s federal leadership dropped ball, individuals loud minorities. ya talking Well let's see. CNN talks virus Fox helped convince half country big deal led shit hole we're stuck in. would someone wear mask working outside heat roof?  think depends are. Anecdotally, gym near Philadelphia fine mandatory masks, limited occupancy frequent sanitization. Occupancy usually single digits 14,000 sqft building everyone wears mask. governments responsibility enforce mandates. there's enforcement, there's effectively mandate. Dziadyk told CBC mask exemptions completely “the honour system sad thing able put aside differences work together. look events 9/11. guess obvious difference enemy physically visible capable shot head versus enemy visible naked eye ignored seeing believing (which beyond ironic country dominated Christianity preaches exactly opposite.) country gets go another country shoot brown people, sudden everything hunky dory we're United one flag. fighting starts simmer infighting returns en masse. Scuba gear then? Quiet Riot, that's name hear often nowadays. I'm amazed taken long someone write point. I've saying now. core reason many anti-maskers react strongly fear change fear appearing weak showing fear disease. Imagine dieing over....Smash Mouth. idea honorable acceptable way die, probably better without you. guy serious? Claims cities local governments know school system best mandate masks, yet bans local city governments issuing mask mandates sued City Atlanta it. Hypocrisy finest. Kemp fucking sucks.

Edit: check 2018 campaign ad you’ll see fuck up. ad isn’t rich corrupt see us country. see us machine work them. 50% increase scary sounding mean much base risk already low.

Its kin whole, eating bacon increases chance stomach cancer 300% ignoring fact base risk extremely low. gets me. Considering much lot people hang every word (for reason), even could still finally tell people take virus seriously wear mask, yet stays silent allows keep peddling insane conspiracy theories. actually, would locative, German language one (like ablativus locativus

This sure Dativ: plain Dativ, sounds like one. long specific term, let's call Dativ ;) He's 60 cancer survivor too. put succinctly, solution problem would require America put interest community interest self.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Well good thing bikers known young healthy living  real virus called toxic hyper individualism/American exceptionalism. Let's real here. important statistic every country focusing lowering? 

Deaths per day. Sweden there? Das true bud Nope. love life looking forward long life. younger side healthy.   

Statistically tiny chance hospitalized even smaller one die. I'm fine risk much fine dying stepping house going toilet.    

As mentioned, people genuinely scared staying home. get infected infect someone else probably am. us know accept risks.   

Most us adults made minds choice is. others going remain locked protect family infected. others continue possibly get infected. think that's even primarily *looking* certain way, I've got news you... Wear cowboy hat bandanna.    
Now outlaw!  remember lobbyists manipulate conservative liberal politicians, post wrote mentioned conservative history.  sides jammed full crooks. try research Clinton $$ came from. I’m 37, life, parents taught government (especially federal government) filled self-serving politicians incompetent interested maintaining power. adult life, watched start numerous wars, completely crash economy twice, destroy family unit, victimize poor helpless. light last 20 years, I’m happy pass distrust children. hope self sufficient enough ask government things get worse. Little late this... already cleaned evidence months ago...

""Wang Yanyi, director Wuhan Institute Virology, said others felt unfairly targeted. urged politics cloud investigations coronavirus spilled humans. 

 ""It unfortunate targeted scapegoat origin virus,"" said. ""Any person would inevitably feel angry misunderstood subject unwarranted malicious accusations carrying research related work fight virus."" ""

It unfortunate, speculation directed person someone, directed China country leaders.  Hell, consider called Democrat insulting. They're representing people, trying make better place everyone live in. hands deep pockets corporate masters, deciding vote based bribery.

I think need say anything Republican party, speaks itself.

America full blown corporatocracy. one glad see they’re putting health players first. Oh, worry, soon Democrat president Senate back charge, Republicans become PRO-LIFE whine abortion again. Fair enough but... respond here?  I'm glad works friends, that's answer every single situation/person cohort. person elderly sick, chances getting sick/dying virus practically zero.

So people get fucked, right?

They're useless eaters, right? I'll never forget department manager sporting goods Walmart. One associates got tired putting fishing sunglasses back, customers try immediately throw shelf, took tags shelf. Ta da! can't wrong place right place. right, ""troll"" really right word. tried couple none seemed fit. seem ""anti-whatever-my-enemy-is-for"". 5.8k dead... norway thousands /s New discovery, water wet. like windows opportunity screwed That's reddit general, called extremely insecure. We've spent 100+ years pointing oceans countries saying ""them"" ""there"". 9-11 something ""there"" affecting us, biggest since Pearl Harbor. virus lot people refuse accept boat rest world can't past it. That’s... that’s exactly lineup would expect something like this. There's gas station/convenience store tied tribal casino hill me- I've seen tell people mask leave.

Other I've rarely seen enforcement.

There asshat Safeway today standing checkout line Trump mask giving sermon hoax anyone would listen him. agree one It’s definitely something specific USA. 

In Canada, likely closest neighbours physically socially. sentiment essentially “freedom die”. 

I wonder there’s stark social difference two countries basically surface. I've seen plenty disgusting bathrooms Paris Rome, so... whoever coined phrase “fucking like rabbits” must felt like fuckin genius would seem would comfortable discussing things aviation rather role boy played turning pandemic political wasteland. Maybe that. Yes. much so. 

Source: sold soul became lobbyist. Seriously though, stepbrother's college roommate wanted lobbyist. stupid douche charismatic way him. 

He fact become lobbyist crazy rich. mean, salary get *any* leave. official statements Spanish ministry website, director Coordination Centre Health Alerts Emergencies literally said 1.486 last 24h hours ago press conference, really gets point really know numbers trust lol.

On days Worldometter says technically issue communities counted added later maybe that's confusion coming from?

Either way I'm staying safe cozy home wearing mask leave house lol want money security child's life! insurance would make cancelling think person attendance might happen. 'Retarded', 'Idiotic', 'Incapable basic critical thinking', 'Unable see past freedom fries'. America, get downvoted. would rugged individuals without evil scientists socialists constantly meddling create public lands hunting, keep tap water free arsenic, create vaccines keep ass alive?  actually hurting even interests long-term, allowing virus stick around postponing economy getting better. way many companies think end tanking (the make money expense even money later). anything shown much stupidity hive mind thinking is. right scarier disease one things leads millions dying wrong people consolidating power. cognitive capacity talk politics America still practiced segregation image taken. means belief segregation centrist viewpoint. I'm pretty sure someone preached racial segregation 2020 would call Nazi. one word posted made sense. difficult finding employment Germany American looking leave? I’m fresh college difficult time finding employment here, would like get myriad reasons Germany take mandatory break 30 min work 6-9 hours (above 45 min break). usual workweek 37.5 hours effectively 8 hours away home (+ commute). studies say same. students teachers get infected. get hear ""We know/ realize"" stories made decisions return.


YES, DID. knew ignored. ""We Italians always saw America model,"" said Massimo Franco, columnist daily Corriere della Sera newspaper. ""But virus we've discovered country fragile, bad infrastructure public health system nonexistent.""

What everyone expect? government gutted infrastructure, transferred money military leaving infrastructure barely operate shoe-string budget. government also allowed promoted constant privatization health care suppressing calls universal affordable health care. healthcare tied employment [for reason] lost jobs pandemic lost health insurance. Republican party also demonized democrats anyone agree politicized pandemic point people think hoax ploy democrats ruin re-election trump. government also compromised christian fanatics, big-business corporations Russia. perfect shit storm bring end country know it. feelings hurt, post topic purely political nature.

The intent sub source information news, political echo chamber. Keep on/r/politics Links proofs b.s.... 16 million people live golden horseshoe, Vancouver area Montreal area. Though right cities defined borders population 10 million, beginning argument stating much spread across huge country so. Overall handled pandemic much better distance urban areas. recap, correct whole argument started wrong. back February went without issue  paying thousands tuition? Online learning patchy uni students low risk cohort.

If anything better splits low risk cohort high risk cohorts like elderly. Title read “Nebraska, Iowa voted play” Nah us Europeans rather live small crowded apartments, take overcrowded public transport work, live failing economies make half much Americans say free healthcare. American watching within US. Yes, 100%. never imagined bad would get still can't believe happening yeah, really know people expected. Like Trump going grow this? all. healthcare education systems, worsening him, already mess years prior. people outside US see facade country puts on. Hmmm sure expansive network news coverage us. I’m sure kept wraps like countries well. ugly truth one talk about...that beach look like US beach.  beach looks lot pale US beach Man revealed lack social cohesion, social trust, trust institutions, goodwill, good faith many us commenting ages. unique USA either, pronounced. Going well? I'm ,no,I think ya got wrong buddy boy! point is? Drowning Pool sad. talented member died due medical condition first album. still milking like 20 years later.

For Night Ranger:
You're COVIDing

You'll dead tonight odd shopping list haha else got there? Someone got triggered  German French military that.

Lmao, actually that. 👍 definition whataboutism fucked since beginning. OP called republicans fragile? reply “but California....”

It turtles way broad definition. 

My reply treating states like California. Literally first reply “but Florida.....”

Nuanced dead people addicted political memes simple explanations. Well don’t know mandated institution helps form critical thinking. So, yeah.   exactly media literacy important. one problems people think they're educated believe ""I could never fooled, I'm intelligent"", yet realize degree social engineering going on, live absolute echo chambers. ""New Sealand"" John Wyndham predicted would survive ""The great Tribulation"" Chrysalids novel. side note also revealed European Union unity. Every country eu has/had strategy. understand that’s it’s complicated unite 27 different states single strategy, believe general unified direction. It’s weak example imagine eu gets invaded enemy states react individually, would mess. Dude prescient passage...omg... husband died last year sudden heart failure due undiagnosed bicuspid aortic valve. forties taking walk park collapsed. fully aware condition exists kills seemingly healthy people. you’ll reread comment, you’ll see specifically said, “I hope conduct autopsy look for” cause death. Asking autopsy investigate true cause death literally opposite thing jumping conclusion. I’m one person, want requires combined effort nation matter all. Thats thing happened. changing OPs numbers one another 40x size completely context prove right. debate works. Good, let people's jobs get affected! Maybe actually something shit. treated like aids. nobody dies aids. die complications stemming it. 

al deaths tested covid-19. blood samples needs saved test later testing strained. i'm 1200% Mine way noise sensitive there’s less noise. hears something doesn’t like gets really jumpy. quiet walks lovely. 😭😭😭 nukes... fallout tho Trump care. tweeted kids go playball. Kids go back school. Let eat cake. sister nurse. live mom Wilmington, NC lives near Greensboro (about 3.5 hour drive away). currently pregnant third nephew, two think 6 2 yo.

They've come visit us times year ever before. since Wilmington beach town, keep going beach come visit. Sometimes late afternoon, 6 7 PM, crowded. always. even tried hitting beach morning 4th July, thankfully packed parking turn back.

And say ""we"" go sometimes, feel guilty staying behind they're family time beach. Like I'm downer wanting risk exposure. Even though I'm fucked anyway catch they're visiting. Guess might well live up, beach party USA!

Her mom always criticize everyone else, too. ""What's wrong people? can't listen doctors scientists?"" Drives nuts. gonna happen, question when. NYers, importantly NY government, enough authoritarian regime. we're clearly seeing decline impressive country.

That's overly dramatic. we're seeing part one decline government society country.  certain end, decline we've have.

You're making bunch grand sounding statements End American Experiment seem much knowledge US world history.

Very rarely end nation would call quick abrupt. Awesome thanks like $400 per hour class instruction Dozens!!

Bro... lol.. we’re sharing planet dude. virus teaser shitshow decade. We’re going wishing deal silly virus years. jokes. We’re literally still laughing people say shouldn’t eating meat there’s fucking way whole place isn’t going become absolute hell within next decade two. 

But yeah Americans probably get revolution shitshow system doomed quite frankly. Either revolution government goes “mask off” becomes dystopian high tech kleptocratic police state (I mean you’re thiiiis close already). 

don’t second think there’s ever going “going back normal”. COVID beautifully ushered decades endless decline humanity. working UK four months recently. defend ""an ok person"" every time met someone new ""not typical American.."" embarrassing.. We've done ourself. think term sequestration. Bless heart ultimate faith humanity.

You you. definitely can. homes one return air duct. there's person home quarantined, want stay away duct (the one people need change filter times year). we’re boycotting Smash Mouth Vanilla Ice. else irresponsible asshole? 

Edit: spelling stupid autocorrect stock 1200% He's not. kind shit traumatizing happens goddamn world.  Germany 15k people protesting lockdown. immediately dispatched authorities.

That response difference USA EU. Also would grant boris approach also catastrophic. always UK USA EU. student athlete? exactly question Americans asking right now. money going? benefitting us, hell benefitting? going left own, thrown wolves, dare continue ask tax money! I’m talking cultural difference US states. Idk US, people New York different people Nebraska Arkansas. we're gonna get article every day now? 102 days, 103 days, ... scientist/doctor head response. followed guidance.

It match broad global consensus, intentionally ignore medical advisor. definitely means words. given exam asked simple question respond. chokes yes questions. Stop simping hard dude Big money going online influence. Advertising manipulation changing new tech speak. really was. completed Almodovar Criterion ""collection"" Tie Up, Tie I'm excited watch three. seem like going hair overboard, especially 6 months. That's gotta driving crazy healthy. Sounds like friends kinda went far day. There's certainly healthy balance need find it. Go outside hikes long drives something wearing mask. Invite two friends something outside mostly ignore work related field.

but still would advise people come least B1 continue learning till C1 germany.

CNN currently providing broader factual coverage coronavirus.￼￼

I’m talking television. Want brainstorm term it? 🤗 location location Oh look Holier thou Europeans high horses judging everyone else like perfect. reason rarely hear anything Europe one gives shit. citizens concerned USA's affairs own. live work Netherlands, 9-5pm 25 days vacation year. Also unlike US we're allowed sick get fired it. consider positively negatively impact health well others. men really let appearance decisions rule moral conscience? may propaganda another country. individual, nation

I've seen lots lots threads France presumably US Redditors call French people surrender monkeys use negative stereotypes French people. knew would get hot bothered dandelion. 🤤🤤🥵🥵🥵 Interesting. Wife wear one inside around people, great walks people wear mask outside, pull courtesy. I'll prob use golf course too. much better walking mask chin 90 degree heat. People south? People everywhere country dude American thoroughly agree. Nothing lose Boomer overlords. “Predominantly democratic”

Everything outside big cities Republican. let tell you, disparity locations like LA vs Newport staggering. area 90% republican everyone acting like everything fine. point US I've become even cynical bitter situation. know terrible think but... hope many types people kick bucket possible. need many votes get coming election. Best wishes you. leader pack losers still makes loser. 

IIRC New York authorities telling people, quote ""there's need wear mask, please use subway""

I agree NY better shitholes like Arizona, but...not much. study math? automate things feel like myself? industrial revolution automated much physical labor -- far, believe we're better it. see reason something similar can't happen programming automation. watch agree completely. show spirit. actually lucky enough visit Orville exhibit SDCC last year.  really clue Sweden did, you? 


Explain: numbers (deaths per day, hospitalizations, ICU admittance) peak April start holiday/summer causing drop? 


Why cases infection raise drop June? Could (double) increase testing?  worried barbaric Anti masker shooting civilized Mask wearer tbh ""Actually, countries busy solving varied domestic issues.""

Hahahaha yet everyday post story Europeans giving opinions USA's problems like people actually give fuck. idiots junkies USA news even though even live here. Ignoring scientists doctors irrational. projecting kind lot here.

I feel way all, I'm describing generation thinks general.

It's color ""winner"" ""loser"" whatever means. lot people can’t get lives right now, that’s problem. Nobody telling live, especially asking wear mask. Better leadership would us living want getting lives now. nice day. 

## Abstract

Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) joints, gut skin treated inhibitors inflammatory cytokines. cytokines involved pathogenesis coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Investigating anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody responses IMIDs observe reduced incidence SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion IMID patients treated cytokine inhibitors compared patients receiving inhibitors two healthy control populations, despite similar social exposure. Hence, cytokine inhibitors seem least partially protect SARS-CoV-2 infection. yep, that's think news focusing US. small state would pass US news got higher per capita would vatican city I’ve going gym 2 months. Mandatory masks, lots hand sanitizer. Limited occupancy. feel totally safe. Please one mind Milano. People responding serious story. Alyssa Milano dramatic trying get attention media years. Please ignore her.  You’re legally allowed avoid taxes. Illegal evade. learn terminology spreading tax misinformation across Internet. I've heard thing 10 years old similar adults. thought crazy Australia insists treating 17 18 year olds way school.  

I heard anything young kids carrying virus though. talking newborns something? hit hard early anyone handle this. death rate 5% peak US 50% peak was. mother danger, needs socially distance stay away people. It’s hard concept. leaves house gets infected came contact somebody, that’s fault, fault anybody else. Yes, don’t want get sick, don’t expect whole rest society stay inside live lives forever protect her. whip hair back forth data sources ? limited areas hard hit (i.e. specific neighborhoods) hitting herd immunity? Hooray, can't wait rest us go though that...  Source?

But, wanted $2000 month every American end year Medicare all. amazing many experts changing tune last 2-3 weeks. guess I'm ok people admitting wrong lot experts seem (somewhat begrudgingly) 

A) virus retreating US population immunity major, major factor.

B) heterogeneity, susceptibility, cross-reactive immunity may significant impact herd immunity.


They come around. Many ""anti-herd immunity"" experts finally publicly admitting A) seem openly DISCUSS B) still reluctant discuss strong impact. Nothing free. You’re paying one way another. real men, wouldnt care others think them?  Thanks, bother reading comments posted. Joe Rogan constantly obsessed macho man Even less. early evidence 1 mutation per 2 transmissions. ""mutation"" single letter entire genome. That's based work Trevor Bedford.

However, could get unlucky small mutation could lead large one.

The flu much less stable Coronavirus, since latter error-avoidance machinery. Okay. fact personally dying virus (or be) consideration everyone present. considerations include:


* effects virus lungs, heart, neurological system, organs, still mostly unknown potentially serious

* Infecting someone much likely die virus.  whole population, virus may kill 1% less that. population people 70, number lot higher, unless amoral, matters.

* Even seriously ill virus, may need medical care could otherwise go toward helping someone else become seriously ill.  Remember ""flatten curve""?  still need avoid getting many people infected once. don't, what's happening Texas Florida happen elsewhere... combat triage, people get picked sent home die. raise fatality rate.

* Way list...economic impact. can't fully resume economy people stop dying, period. matter national government says.  longer people care risk getting infected, deeper hole economy in.

* National prestige - US looks like bunch prize idiots, banned travel across world can't get control virus. longer virus keeps circulating without control, damage perception US done.  next decade two (at least) US going convince rest world fall turnip truck.

X% dead virus one piece information, one statistic, sum problem here, deciding whether pandemic serious based entirely ignorant. ""I'll never get brains dress!""

Or article NYMag

Wow... know still listen guy's Covid briefings... New Zealanders stay safe. responsible repopulating Earth. I'm surprised visible HHS data mangling Damn wished lived first world country like New Zealand believe GASP science GASP logic GASP medical experts instead shithole failed state ruled bankrupt casino owner/reality show bozo/twitter troll moron. :( non felony assault, like threatening someone, depending state we’ve never worn masks community before.

A lot countries havent either. Haha wow nothing bias shit. Gotta love ""experts"" use feelings try manipulate people want. 

Experts say experts try manipulate people like shit humans. It’s really going 1 every 100 months isn’t it? fair, depends where. urban areas tend towards favorable views education progressive ideas, rural areas tend backwards regressive. It’s really fault though— decades GOP gutting educational structures rural America done good number many eastern coalfields, it’s much better poverty it’s effects (i.e. opioid epidemic crime). well got thinking maybe I'm stuck rut. I've basic workout routine since high school, maybe time broaden horizons  Same. Another 6 months going give us anyone information. Several years maybe, that's long time. true, Gomes suggests, possibility lower effective herd-immunity thresholds taken center stage public-health discussion surrounding coronavirus pandemic. Nevertheless, possibility heterogeneity pandemic spread would extent lower herd-immunity threshold recently begun get serious mainstream attention. end June, Kevin science magazine Quanta that math bit “trickier” 1-1/R0 implied, particularly actual R figure — number new infections produced every case — shifted naturally time. Then, weeks ago, The Atlantic’s James Hamblin gave hypothesis [its high-profile citing several researchers modelers, including Gomes, Tom Britton, Marc Lipsitch, suggesting heterogeneity could bring herd immunity much faster 60 percent. Indeed, Gomes suggested, herd immunity could happen little one quarter population community exposed — perhaps 20 percent. “We keep running models, keeps coming back less 20 percent,” told Hamblin. “It’s striking.” findings, held up, would instructive, Hamblin writes: “It would mean, instance, 25 percent antibody prevalence, New York City could continue careful reopening without fear another major surge hoping 25 percent represents true ceiling pandemic spread given community, well, almost certainly not, considering recent serological surveys shown perhaps 93 percent population Iquitos, Peru, [has contracted have [more half living Indian many 68 percent [in particular neighborhoods New York though risk herd-immunity “overshoot,” Carl Bergstrom Natalie Dean [warned back early contemplating Swedish no-lockdown strategy risks rushing herd immunity, overshoot scale would seem unlikely “true” threshold low 20 25 course, threshold may places, across populations, surely affected, degree, social behavior taken protect spread disease. many aspects coronavirus, probably err conceive group immunity simplistically binary terms. herd immunity technical term referring particular threshold point disease longer spread, amount community protection spread begins almost soon first people exposed, case reducing number unexposed vulnerable potential cases community one. why, even without interventions like social distancing, mask-wearing, shelter-in-place, would expect disease spread purely exponential way point herd immunity, time spread would suddenly stop.

Add effects even modest, commonplace protections — intuitive social distancing, amount mask-wearing — could expect get infection curve tapers well shy 60 percent exposure. According AAP current data, 7/9 8/6, 179,990 new cases. increase fair... Covid ran fucking RAMPANT Arizona anything it. missing something here, assault felony already? employee enforcing rule store visiting make exempt assaulting them.

The article available read I'm Netherlands. Two weeks... two phases R0? means Europe statistically 4x many cases america. number cases 4x, would imply government policy worked. 


You right, every country count deaths differently. important part Europe generous definition covid death, thereby estimating deaths. America strictest definition, thereby underestimating. 


In UK every single death tested positive within last 3 months defined covid death. Sweden believe 1 month. countries use excess deaths, covid deaths include every medical issue caused death hospital full. 


America... country worst healthcare, actively disincentives people go hospital. Refuse count every c19 death hospital. let alone covid related deaths. Spellcheck, let curse! SHIT. ugh 10 years- residency- medical school- undergrad. Yay That's I'm thinking I'll looking see inform state, how/if test end year, report grades concepts learned, kind stuff. I'm newbie comes homeschooling.

This daughter's last year school, she'll eighth grade, would heartbroken go person friends conditions continues get worse see really choice. We’re pointing that, many times, articles say “healthy underlying health conditions” fact serious health condition pretty much know affects odds dying COVID. 

But person article obese? Buried article surprise one, Moderna Phase III not, fact, enroll inject 30k people week. They're 3k enrolled August 6. 

This still incredibly fast idea getting data mid-October fantasy. Fragile masculinity killing every day Looked up, many cover songs. plenty google ""BLM protests"" click images tab. Obviously people masks people claiming protests lead new COVID-19 cases ""they wear masks"" lying themselves. Guarantee it’s higher official reports. I’d quit kept getting ignored sidelined trying save country. good news? know people actually believe Covid-19 hoax created media kill Trump's reelection. real, I've seen stupidity Twitter. Jokes them, look weak ignorant. stupid. stupid. mention huge influx tourists TX, AL, GA, AK, SC, basically whole southern US. None wearing masks, none required to.

It's free here. Damn feel like I've seen movie before. end well me. stupid. stupid. mention huge influx tourists TX, AL, GA, AK, SC, basically whole southern US. None wearing masks, none required to.

It's free here. problems solvable infinite resources, real world infinite resources. usa invented things rule last 2 centuries: bomb, aviation microprocessor. No, definitely immune level. children smaller nasal ACE2 level.

I can't imagine one got sick would somehow transmit it... (or least read anything intelligent says play game too. Sweden never harsh lockdown like New Zealand look them, essentially covid free well. apples oranges! Lol. use comeback future conversations idiots? quote prefer credit! Case numbers falling though hang mates working joke? Cases stayed pretty low test positivity rate last days around 2-3%. don’t need testing per capita isn’t anything find. Outside testing people random else would suggest doing? We’re already one places know “everyone wants test gets test” true. totally providing case sample topic article got Covid back may work work 7 weeks antibodies. 30 minute lunch break take eating lunch break room, otherwise keep goggles. It’s comfortable thing, wear rest shift don’t think twice it. It’s really big deal. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Food shortages? It’s terrifying. Feels like waiting get horrible again.

I certainly don’t want anxiety proven right it’s hard worry. virus coming contact others disinfection bs show. wish people would understand fooled.

Its thing TSA. Instead security theater, public health theater. 

We're supposed feel warm fuzzies school clean. buildings surfaces problem, people expressing droplets problem. people wearing masks receive threats

No, threatening children all. Nice us Europe first covid deaths last week Congrats baby! us Europe first covid deaths last week forget also highlighted almost complete failure American education system Can’t infect corpse! Wow, that's dangerous! also many crazy governors senators etc. Florida governor alnost crazier Trump.

And past Sarah Palin George Bush II.

I think deep problems, fight hold first world country status. Even better, ""It's responsibility either"", pushing protect employers lawsuits employees get sick job. Italy &amp; Spain also fragile inconsiderate, then? yet strategy worked better US states implement strict lockdowns 🤔 sure Western Europe Statement, know enough comment. however work lot Americans bang Basic Countermeasures. want solution charge pretend like big deal ""the flu"" default makes situation worse. people US wore masks social distanced period 4 weeks would halt path. Agree. RI’s Governor blames current virus resurgence state’s natives traveling state returning carriers ... we’re banned entering neighboring states 😣 makes sick sadness you. Sending strength :( Pretty pathetic many democrats troll subs downvote anyone says democrats big morons republicans day 100+ people screaming locked right way, whatever means, would save many.

Yeah man, people comparing New Zealand, much intense lockdown much longer period time Covid free. apple oranges.

For rest mate, whatever say convince system working price economy dead bodies. way planet survive global cooperation equals. could exploring space instead bombing other. Europe different numbers US level population density rises cases per million. world may fucked acknowledge clear difference continents.  study trash, Duke tested total **ONE** neck gaiter, declared neck gaiters ineffective.

Get real sample size 1, real science least dozen neck gaiters made different materials, get back us real research instead assumptions, Duke. retarded? Correct, that's voting works. Im freaking Swedish lmfao. personal perspective I'm glad deaths ended least pause.

But dont think strategy defendable. Correct, that's voting works. UFC makes much less revenue major sports. However, UFC also pays athletes pennies dollar.

Unless big time star (i.e. Jorge Masvidal, Jon Jones) literally make 10 &amp; 10 meaning $10k show fight $10k win. popular perhaps get 40 40. Compare MILLIONS NBA benchriders make.

It's hilarious need Chinese female explain you. That's silly way counting it.

You limited amount years college move 'grown up', people going sacrifice easily. like 1/4th time college. amount human lives sacrificed sake ego truly shocking. course policies produce results genius asked You’re weak fact COVID really deadly disease outside high risk groups we’ve months panic porn acting like it’s like AIDS, cancer, Black Death rolled one. helps all, saw [NYT noting significant reduction premature births since beginning pandemic, there's entirely positive opposite end covid/pregnancy spectrum well ... rich.

I figured would finish sentence. One neighbors one people. 

""The kids excited college. I'd hate take excitement away."" pregnant sister told doctor babies can't catch COVID. least says has. also told doctor, verified, children age 3-5 can't catch COVID. breath told overwhelming amount positive tests among pregnant women area.

And doctor said it, can't convince otherwise. complete lunacy. CEO says company great.  Without providing supporting evidence, pure marketing stock pumping. Really informative graphics. There's interesting dynamic comments section, people reassured information, people even freaked looking particle animation. 
 
I took subway long ago. Mask compliance like 80-90% there's always one two idiots card mask leaving nose uncovered. Thats 10.5 million people US alone.

But.. but.. Im BoReD, It. Neck fleece**s**, also known gaiter masks, least effective all

So Duke tested **a total one gaiter mask**, declared gaiter masks ineffective? Gaiter masks made different types materials, **one** gaiter mask made of?

Duke, get larger sample size different materials, come back done. real science, assumptions based sample size 1 really don’t get anyone be. I'm person posting there, feel free help build up, kindly fuck back whence came. question anywhere that's ""safe"" remove mask work drink water eat go car? Jack's crippling anxiety. latest case/death charts running 7-day averages indicate new cases deaths beginning go down. Yeah. partly agree. I’m convinced spread schools. I’m afraid Swedish authorities therefore also schools taking risk seriously enough. Right, that's told, needed lockdown 15 days order flatten curve hospitals could prepare coming ""wave"". day 100+ people screaming locked right way, whatever means, would save many. find foolish pretend closing business keeping walmart open allowing people protest massive crowds okay, virus can't possibly spread ways. parent's jobs lost good apparently. company lucky enough survive 8 weeks lockdown many millions not. 

The median age deceased countries 80 years (e.g. 86 years Sweden) 4% deceased serious preconditions. age risk profile deaths thus essentially corresponds normal mortality.

In many countries, two thirds extra deaths occurred nursing homes, benefit general lockdown. Moreover, many cases clear whether people really died Covid-19 weeks extreme stress isolation. Also NY City 24% people antibodies testing. Upstate NY, much. Ah yes attack words instead answering question. literally proved moronic democrats truly comment. Bravo sir We're going Easter! That’s whataboutism is, congrats outing IQ guess dont need pay necessary emergent medical care receive care. dont need pay necessary emergent medical care receive care. body, blood vessels, ACE2 receptors. think depends city you’re in. live organized protests good (although definitely visible without), ad hoc gatherings south side much no-mask. said I’m defending OC I’m pro-protest, trying give perspective mask use definitely varied. friend certain got covid protesting understand he’s one person representative everyone. idea talking about. That’s super damning especially given Iger&amp;co might given base pay, yet eschew forms remuneration pads earnings.

Sadly, isn’t really administration Florida interested holding Disney account. Shame! Joe Rogan? Makes dick fall off. city today finally got go phase 3 today, last province. Limited indoor dining happen now. think fitness centers open going yet. see policy now, want quit, going awhile still keep database hoaxers ban hospitals. don’t want without ventilator get asshole frat boy took first. Central NY, Oswego County. one wears masks here. surprised numbers going roof yet. Damn you’re fucking idiot. Policies produce results. think Europe may talking dumbass. Whatever he's charging, COVID-19 mask sale twice price.  lazy clickbait journalism. is. It'll take get everything sorted, yeah, that's O-K. get people scared frustrated small minority seem poised ruin things; feel you; I'm there, too. God forgive them. dont know doing.  People claim US third world country never third world country. Picture 11 Here's Florida's latest case/death charts, running 7-day 38.17 deaths per 100k population. US average 48.82. Fuck people midlife crisis festival. That's excellent comeback! 🤣 idea Spy Kids. know would want well-known mediocre kid's film.  Right. known acknowledged discussed widely Sweden. FHM expressed clearly. 

I see also high schools contrinue working distance also fall semester, portion it. Good thing rapid accurate tests available coast coast! ..... right guys? who?

She tell us names. wanna talk them, swear. Nah man, can't hug kids nuclear arms. democrats right? Please tell us states democrats able fight virus political views test people dying from.

What EXCESS death Colorado? That's question. show video I've gotten ""paranoid"" ""overly protective"". know George Lopez Sharkboy Lavagirl  Everything's bigger...in Texas. reliable outlets opinion? Trump Administration ordered hospitals bypass CDC send data White House Task Force

This happened. know many times explained.

*Hospitals* sending patient data HHS rather directly CDC.

Testing, new case, mortality data always came directly state health departments. continues come directly state health departments. commenting article OP links data reported ... state health department.

People wearing masks. [34 states mask among (I'm looking you, Florida), still ton mandates local levels. biggest counties Florida mask mandates. States counties municipalities curfews severe restrictions businesses.

And people *are* social distancing. [Nationwide mobility, tracked cell phone data, places currently midst severe outbreaks, much more: 35% Arizona, 31% Florida, 38% California. Gee, that's case I'd hate see what's going happen countries whose lockdowns lead scores deaths famine supply chain shocks.  pity I'm afraid looking dead. I'll keep wearing mine go out, grocery store. that, I'm staying fuck home. Greed, cruelty, selfishness, deception, corruption.

We still full supporting path even now.

We lost, rot deep. America lost. bad, we're dirt streets dilapidated houses. Chill sensitivities, chump. might hurt fragile hands. Nope. Lived awhile. different culturally, politically economically, nothing common US Canada *happens* connected map. Latin America. Reminding Repo King Mnuchin tax dollars table, his. ask anything that

Back density now... weird, sweden started lcokong down. UK initially lockdown, study herd immuntiy, saw rhe numbers began lcokdown, late.

Germany locked down. funny numbers much lower, considering neighbors hardest hit. I'm Californian. let blue-state thing fool you...we deep-redness place. state government impossible predicament.

I think fast re-opening many indoor venues main issue, red-blue divide. Well Corona, definitely cringed system hot take.

Big yikes. wrong people. WTH? gives shit euro twats say?

Always meddling places belong.

Hitler fragile too. obesity rates US gone 23% 60's 42% 2018. That's huge increase. Almost double.

I hate people refuse scientific evidense actual experts field want hurt feelings. Like, need take personally. Nobody saying fat people bad people ugly whatever. saying obesity risk factor, like age, smoking status, immunocomprimisation, respiratory issues like asthma etc etc. people get offended warned experts careful fat people either. personal attack, effort keep everyone (including fat people) safe.

I used obese still I'd listening people phd decades worth experience research field rather someone says ""this true measels"". die self isolating bit longer might well die Rona.  Actually, (and is) happening SK like: current president bombarded newspapers ""pro-NK"", ""pro-China"", even ""puppet"", really truth good story far-rights. Also worry hate towards Chinese (communophobia would word, also degree racism, shamefully.) foreigners general concerning. criticisms towards current gov. display ""caring citizen"" ""political polarization SK"".

The mainstream right-leaning media also try wash away fact actually former far-right government allowed SK suffer heavily MERS, recording highest number patients outside Middle East 2015. example, Jeong Eun-Kyeong head KCDC hero SK amidst Covid-19 pandemic, 5 yrs ago unjustly punished impeached government failure mitigating MERS, government would avoid arrows criticism towards them. 5 yrs, look happend SK... literally went karma farm get around rules prevent trolling, specifically pollute /r/chicago subs.

His account showing 3 years old, never ever commented anything literally yesterday, started trolling hard /r/coronavirus right speak of?

Also, old you? Male Female? Republican Democrat neither? 45 supporters good Nazis. resident well testing hasn’t problem since April here. got tested drive results 48 hours main point issues US experiencing also experienced Europe spring. unique clusters idiocy US sure. overall, issues similar. delayed months. Ok no, I'm Mexican hospitals nice, disinformation parts world overwhelming, people rather believe chain mail chain message whats app fake news Facebook government really makes effort prevent correctly inform public, mean, president outright refuses wear mask, health secretary useless, states starting form coalitions federal government sucks. Leadership vacuum combined population density. one protestor detained protesting outdoor event  protesters say illegal detention).

It say article protesters say illegal? source?

""En av demonstranterna fick föras från platsen – bland annat efter att ha skrikit mot Folkhälsomyndighetens Karin Tegmark Wisell och vägrat följa väktarnas upprepade order om att lämna platsen."" [Brottsbalk (1962:700) 16 kap broke law behaving way did, illegal allowed leave shortly after. word detained mean arrested better translation ""Finally, police called. woman ***briefly handcuffed*** allowed leave scene."" Humans social beings (though perhaps less average redditor). Missing major social events going lasting effects. honest, start stockpiling four soon started testing. Stop stop he's already dead!

(Keep going, awesome.) literally went karma farm get around rules prevent trolling, specifically pollute /r/chicago subs.

Your account showing 3 years old, never ever commented anything literally yesterday, started trolling hard /r/coronavirus federal government get choice open native American schools? trying kill them? Sure. I’m arguing point. Either way, cleaning school nothing mitigate next chain. He's 3 half years since first promised it, rush him! Wow. know spreads ventilation systems yet doctor quotes article saying evidence that. mean literal fuck people. read restaurant study study topic? Outdoor good idea, won’t work state rains 9 months year. also said leadership vacuum. leadership top cities would locked down. is, states cities left fend themselves. large cities means chances incompetent local state governments best: nothing. 

There several large US cities pretty good now. Ohhh makes much sense. also caught wearing mask makes individuals feel even ""threatened"" makes lash bizarre ways. reframing way regard non-mask wearers future. Canadian here. pretty obvious California favors Republicans. Even leadership ""democratic"" state screams red. I’m repeating lot scientists including Fauci stated. CDC stated. 

We hell lot excess deaths US right now, unless second pandemic going around, covid. 

Most pandemic deaths counts fully counted years later. one well.  Male ego pathetic society  elective surgeries cancelled, bunch staff super specialized training nothing them. nurse, floated positive Covid unit help way could, passing medications, assessing patients, bathing patients, feeding etc. patients sick, felt really good help them. 6 weeks there, probably around 15-20 patients died alone families couldn’t visit them. got sick, initially woke Tuesday working Monday really dizzy; much fell shower. took temperature 102.9 called employee health went got swabbed that’s morning. next morning got positive result. first week, would describe main symptoms severe body aches. felt like someone beat baseball bat over. joints aches, every muscle felt swollen painful. really bad restless legs point prevented sleeping comfortably. also splitting headache. first week, body pain went away. hungry first week couldn’t eat enough food. would wake night would make omelette something. day 7-10 lost sense taste smell. can’t pinpoint exactly happened realize much brains “fill gaps” taste smell based memory familiar sights textures. got really severe diarrhea nausea. also really bad lower abdominal pain; much considered going emergency room thought could vowel obstruction diverticulitis. time, really significant mental fogginess.

Americans give fuck whiney Europeans.  think what's disappointing well greatest drivers 2nd wave idiots partying irresponsibly. 

You attend indoor house parties 100+ person apartment parties, indoor jerk chicken/hair salon raves, hotel parties.

It's infuriating especially someone professional DJ, musician, event crew/logistics member. whole industry standstill douchebags pushing us back further. god's name event like allowed take place. local authorities dumb reckless. meant wiping world. 5x amount required kinda dumb. see maybe 1.5x.

Hey youre ER, youll pay

And lungs paying toll

Coughing worse mold know many people won’t get vaccine all, let alone get twice. Single-dose would definitely ideal. think us Americans feel? And, ones think wearing masks freedom. Well, make two months.

Also, many countries (including mine), wave two coming. We'll see goes. doctor socialized healthcare country, American medical practice crazy.

I student debt, college pretty cheap (1000$ year). work 40h/week resident. chance work national health system private system time want earn more. Sure perfect, already earn pretty good resident country cost life.

In 10 years hospital never malpractice suit.

And costs (the expensive world) bad payments american system, people still get shitty healthcare overall poor access it. number one covid cases. yet american doctors would rather capitlaist system world class nightmare. It’s deaths. R1 universities culture. Penn State research university, also huge public university. met dumbasses proud there. Good know. I’ll look no, he's susceptible. 8 stents heart although virus kicked ass months never caused cardiac symptoms beyond couple hours accelerated heart rate (and that's couple hours, total, course months).

the symptoms illness causes map essentially information causes given set symptoms given person. said us cases per capita it’s wrong. think misread post. 

And again, yes, fucked deaths. better now... let’s hope lasts.. :/


... again, FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. them. didn’t shut everything. followed state epidemiologist fauci. Absolutely.

2. *nice* RemindMe! 3 months point is, understand cost staying isolated long period time? yeah, get it. isolating best ability since March. sucks hate it. wish everybody else same. GA, numbers worse months ago whole world shut down. wish over, not. said repeatedly past, aspirations holding office, ever.

I'm hoping changes Trump fiasco... country cannot even contain virus. Leave topic grownups you? seeing posts social media week people early lecturing others wear mask ones partying without one. There’s also kind two pandemics going on. states thing control European/Asian countries. Mask wearing prevalent. Strict precautions place. Death rates case positivity low. 

When people talk poorly America handling this, obviously agree federal level like remind America homogenous. Um. 14 days long stays human body, surfaces food. deactivates way less 14 days exposed something living replicate. Holy moly many people think big deal, blown proportion media, and/or political hoax. HIPAA violation parent tells someone, case daycare provided, result child's coronavirus test? sure pack heat. 'Merican thang ta do. That's happens ~~leader polarizes every issue~~ fascist party *""Don't care?""*

To ask question must listening coastal elite past decades, whose attitudes global, metropolitan -- part meta-culture sorts -- really American. Many site share attitudes vehemently disavow crass morals compatriots. may know it, group talking little international sales team, clothed values, sent sell America. forgotten really are.

You bought, thank you. wish would tell truth. No, care. care science, statistics, think. see broken system, see cost individualism. see disorganization, see necessary checks balances straining, holding now. deplorable people view, love it.

So laugh us: please do. consider us fools: good. shun us every turn: coronavirus every year. may think American exceptionalism best. isn't. standing own. road leads hell, we'll walk alone, eyes wide open. So, datasheets tests? tests approved shown error rates? publications this? Right? I'm Vancouver we've done pretty well, numbers worrying us we're expecting get shut next weeks continues.  
But US - completely baffling see disregard human life there. country's leaders, average citizen areas. sense community caring fellow citizens? Scary watch. suppose facility accidentally catch fire burn ground would sterilize everything. 🙂 Here’s hoping boss starts acting like adult takes care things properly. oh completely agree, empathise position well, I'm similar field. people can't accept wrong. 


although, enough fence-sitters pretty much every issue always worthwhile fight good fight. important, impossible may seem, keep fighting face people boss. give up, win. ♡♡ Takes long. say already heard? Look disasters last 20th century alone yet seem learn anything. agree this. guess hard pull extra inch. single plan NY - problem there's really overall tracking planning state government, responsibility delegated downward individual municipalities, means going get highly variable level preparedness one other.

I'm deferring decisions city/town level, completely hands state level worrisome. particular downstate. proven virus travels quickly. inefficient testing tracing infrastructure. starts spread - time figures back testing indicate problem, already spread quite bit.

I can't speak rest NYS, NYC plan wishful thinking planning. density taking hybrid approach, option children full time remote part time schools. Right bat, solve main problem everyone wants schools reopened - daytime supervision children need parents go back work.

For hybrid learning, NYC DOE plans teacher class deliver in-person instruction kids school day, remote instruction provided remote learners. going providing instruction? platform going use it? changes cleaning hygiene protocols made ensure schools clean enough prevent spreading virus? that's get fact schools NYC often 100 years old lack windows open, adequate ventilation, etc. Right now, assurances NYC employees get priority testing, nothing that. There's dedicated testing infrastructure guaranteed turnaround time. mandated testing kids return school, there's supply PPE provide students teachers now. Considering many NYC students near poverty line much needs provided regular basis, mean mask wearing inside NYC public schools?

The bit remember affects New Yorkers, teachers students. NYC school system heavily reliant public transportation. virus starts moving, it'll get everywhere - NYC, rest downstate eventually rest state. far, seems like reopen based best wishes assumptions likely met practice. Lmfao really type person president? 

Regardless, original post current choices rather real option. wish third party rise break political duopoly currently US. Even non children big deal. age groups outside 65+ IFR .03%. 1 3000 people catch age group die. 65+ age group 5% 1 20. astronomically higher. Here's IFR breakdown age curious:  Yes! fantastic!

I highly recommend [episode . therapeutics, interesting discussion around changing thinking testing could game changer.

It's though teachers school staff completely disposable. Well.... mean uhhh...... Nevermind......🤔 wish Covid-19 Henry Kissinger. Yep yep.

Am teacher. first year 2006 provided health insurance. second year tenth year different school pay US $650/month insurance. young bought married.

They'll listen master, anyway... said hoax trip up, yet again.

Sorry, needs help anyone else that. I'm sorry plenty places locked hard early still got hit. virus gonna gonna do. Trump locked early Democrats crying whenever closed border China? Fuck boss.

The virus spread via aerosols, people, enclosed spaces, poor ventilation, talking.

The Japanese told world back February. make face shields pretty easily inexpensively, spent $12 adhesive foam 12x12 blank mylar stencil sheets make 16 face shields - maybe could something similar.  
Hope stay safe. Oh case going up, 1st idea hmm stop counting case wont go up? Oh 2nd idea open stores, parks beach maybe case go down? Hmmm another one lets put kids back school cade high fk! 97k kids got sick 2 weeks opening school lmao. Nice, still unfortunate absolutely right, early morning bleary brain error part. mom says many coworkers seem think covid November 4th. 

She’s ER nurse military base Texas. level idiocy followers unparalleled. Yeah same. idea vaccine development actually works course. I’m surprised haven’t seen focus prior work done toward Sars-1 never got completed.

I’ve reading essentially theories “asymptomatic” cases could linked prior infections w mild coronaviruses, inferring degree immunity. It’s hard explain ~40% cases asymptomatic virus ends deadly many (I don’t think viral load explains it). Perhaps broad range effects could due surviving prior, essentially harmless coronavirus? It’s worth studying sure, pandemic needs calm tf work properly done likely. outdoor dining quickly tolerable time temps moderating. Come late sept, I'm bit nervous start trend winter moves down.  things much easier younger age, brain malleable. 

Still easier younger body rehabilitation due muscle atrophy. Vote!! Same. honestly pretty infuriating. heartbreaking. Well started 2016 when....

Someone make meme.video fat americans riding scooters walmart freezer trucks responsible. husband thing. taken camping trips get take out, helps. Even though hard spend much time home, would unhealthy catch COVID-19 risk potential long term health effects they're finding could have. Also, want risk giving Covid someone vulnerable us, fair. short term struggle long term benefit. end eventually, permanent. Wow, pitiful No. 35% country absolutely doesn’t care. Death Cult. Wear shield? obesity much common mask induced anxiety claustrophobia.. 'Ask country' long long time ago. Since much transmission preventable wearing mask social distancing, would say many deserve consequences choices. Perhaps make better decisions next time. Forming opinion thought based solely first impression shows true lack understanding intelligence.

It’s important able analyze every situation, individually, evolve thought process information becomes available  reach six pole get closer going get sick. That's world's felt us years let republican White House. unless excise parasites political system *and keep out*, we'll continue laughing stock. sure statistics data relevant policy decisions. feelings say ""squirrel"" damn liberals wanting die completely preventable death. hardly believe stage theories Bill Gates (about microchips etc). However, facts can't trust him. knew pandemic? many money make vaccines? spent life dealing OS many technical issues, focused data gathering? doubts Bill Gates' values.

Anyway, believe high risk groups must take vaccines. must first ones take them, people biggest amount money. fact option, mean person somebody trust. role president USA make USA better place, cost world needed.

How significant marriage whole citizenship process? Like healthcare (which alone amazing! Hope enjoys better healthcare system!) help formal application process too? one months ago, ok crisis known back then, another huge one making looming, populism sycophants allowed stand lowest average competence government generations, pay price. I’ve continually say can’t get together over. It’s I’m hearing “we thought would now”. media creating hysteria articles like one. Every single person dies COVID age 30 several articles news stories it, point fear mongers makes people think tons young healthy people dying. 

Per CDC, approximately 643 flu deaths last season children age 17 younger US. July 11 (most recently available data), 52 COVID deaths age 18. exact source. 

Obviously COVID way serious flu overall. obviously number deaths 18 increase pandemic isn’t over. asked anyone, think children 18 died flu last year COVID year, 100% say COVID even though number 10x lower. 

That’s impact fear mongering. state facts: COVID orders magnitude dangerous people age 50 serious co-morbidities. don’t manipulate news make things sound worse they’re already fucking terrible. wont' end there's vaccine there's herd immunity. Oh drafting spicy letter lol bc I’m loss strategy never get vote again. lost 100% last week ok’d school waivers (private schools open K-6 graders, masks, remain open even positive case - could go wrong!?) THAT'S GOOD IDEA!!/S Sure possible likely esp. Arizona. recently made mandates social distancing. They've consistently bad approach... fair say big chunk 30% teaching kids virus real wear mask. schools AZ even require wearing mask open! 

Of course kids need childhood education education much greater sitting room reading text. entire experience teachable moment children. possible kids learn home much successful future.

Kids going remember thing school year academically - way stressful insane make expect kids learn efficiently many distractions. teachers faculty worried really hard shield long. Kids even small ones smarter think. 

Let's talk effects kids seeing beloved teachers die potentially loved ones also. early trauma seeing many faculty sick even dying. 

This pandemic shown disregarded old young society. old lived world wars deserve society cares - virus elderly worried worked whole life even receive social security time fear going outside. kids future must care mental health trust say effects kids going back school much detrimental kids staying home. People saying high school age kids can't handle staying home alone managing work true come kids grow homes homeschooled go boarding school statistically likely independent responsible adults mature earlier &amp; talking permanent home school one two years max. That's one Trump's favourite tactics too! bad wants wish away instead something. Gonna pick cheap touring bike estate sale three months.

Close borders! feel bad leaders reacting poorly pandemic vs proactive. Lousy thing r/britishcolumbia Americans using Alaska excuse come up... trying wrecked economy?!   Im florida, ive heard EMERGENCY workers talk virus hoax. People literally deal patients. insane. ITT people didn’t read article. would lie make data like masks. realize ""experts"" told masks effective could hoard tell vaccine safe? 

It least straight month everyone reddit repeating ""masks bad useless"" narrative. think ""greater good"" absolutely lie you. Maybe convince taking steps prevent COVID pregnant good intentionally terminating pregnancy? got everything need enjoy. hang boys. Swiss Policy research, known conspiracy propaganda. interesting. silly cuz know confirmed cases often even 10% total cases. death rate point focused people know think big deal. look think sounds really low. also wonder ICU admittance rate is, rate potentially severe side effects. anyone know get information? “Plenty stories” isn’t surprising many millions infected. Last time checked, 5% hospitalized, 80% mild cases, many even without symptoms.

That’s part makes virus dangerous. See, Ebola much much much deadly get - it’s infectious it’s severe you’re sick bed. doesn’t really spread much.

With SARS-CoV-2, people can’t distinguish mild cold. Yes, may still get long term effects (but haven’t read reliable numbers that, yet, i.e. percentage people confirmed infection vs. confirmed long term effect).

So unfortunately, don’t wish suffering anyone, denier infected becoming even denier much likely denier minds changed infection.

People need understand exponential growth, statistics dire consequences overwhelming health care system. add extra words copied essay honestly know think it. basically want friends majority people friends this. one group friends went group trip mountain resort town posed group picture inside restaurant shoulder shoulder. people group later took pictures visiting indoors mom OXYGEN.

Pretty much every article young person dying excludes key fact morbidly obese/serious medical issue freak accident.

I don’t trust alarmist articles.

The 7 year old died seizure fell head. roofer got struck lightning. boy already hospital cancer. guy crashed motorcycle. guy shot head...

I wish kidding stories getting posted reddit proof coronavirus killing young people alarming rates. I'm defending I'm genuinely asking, what's wrong ""more cases tests""? care death population more? still shows mishandle situation sounds logical, fact since test lot know danger boom, doubles ""don't care?"" Effect Terrible source.  Actually ONS coronavirus survey says new cases levelling off. So, probably combination tests, track trace system local outbreaks. Omegalul literal fire, metaphor. feels like we're fire we're watching around us die, thousands dead would still today wasnt ignorance country.

We shouldnt wait death toll raise people stary giving shit. Good. serious complications less common possible age group. don’t obese diabetic smoker wind ICU Covid, though raise risks. Remove first sentence post spot on. public health crisis America decades. implausible think getting Covid already poor health makes worse. Herd immunity exist covid

this super anti science. debate whether worth it, can't say something evidence for. would operate differently almost every virus herd immunity impossible. already shown people develop immunity, scientists estimate mutates rate much slower flu, idea herd immunity bogus. ""Compulsive list kleptocrat throws population bus act absolutely typical hubris selfishness"" Yeah they're lying generational funding public health

Public health under-funded, 90% funds wasted hospital administrations insurance middlemen. 

But nobody knows it, doctors nurses people actually interact patients. mean die it? understand reason also know strong first impressions are. think estimated fixated people would first statements. I’m Colorado. bunch public health officials state local level resign November March replacements incompetent politician appointees zero public health experience. worst testing country. idiots counties outright ignoring scientists.

And still way better state around us. 

It makes appreciate live also appreciate fucked country. Despite fuck ups, governor responded correctly late. I'm quite sure would expect datasheets specific tests, expect could probably find searched them. first result quick search ""coronavirus test sensitivity specificity"" [turns point given test, error rates always discussed terms independent sensitive specificity. claim false positive expected every false negative consequence ""statistics"" misinformation take independent nature variables consideration. could potentially find test happens true, cannot assumed tests. place history approaching U.S.'s sustained growth China, record breaking records decades 9%+ percent growth. source this, currently two months pregnant work retail desperate info. Thanks. problem ""democrats like it"" becomes *sufficient cause* hate something, itself. I'm 24 years old genuinely hope. fully expect everything go back way was, rot continue fester kills someone care about. take more. million tragedies happen every day left wake suffering. see brighter tomorrow. see better day. see greed nosediving us oblivion, can't take one fucken second think anyone ourselves.

""Fuck you, got mine."" I’m cis woman, first off, don’t dick won’t ever one. Dunno missed genuinely didn’t know. 

Secondly, even there’s “overwhelming” majority doesn’t want oppress trans (or LGBT+ general) people, still much people want harm outright kill people something control over. even fraction population treating sub-human (again, something cannot control) unacceptable. 

Thirdly, parents extended family aren’t “ignorant rednecks” still want take away rights LGBT community. dad makes racist comments fairly regularly. live California coast, Californians many things, “rednecks” usually isn’t one them. family also type Christians think Starbucks putting “Merry Christmas” paper cup attack way life. small group people. 

Lastly, corona doesn’t care anyone dick, sure, people sure hell do, that’s what’s actually scary. New adult here. We've got lot work cut us, we're determined make things better. I'm sure could use sympathy I’m new mom babies weeks apart. can’t even fathom people incredibly selfish. Hopefully everyone get together soon find sort normalcy without risking health babies. Yeah it’s real ass. know course workers don’t give shit also lot us do. Like I’m always one volunteer cleaning duty, sanitizing high touch points dont trust people it. even position become looking like something rather actually anything hardy us clean anymore stay register wearing bright blue apron people say “oh look, someone dedicated cleaning”.

Nonetheless, still observed commonality. Well, Mr Watson... you’ll note wording here: “Children might vulnerable Covid-19 believed...” “once believed” they’re talking epidemiologists. went doctor looking sort treatment... said ""eh, live it, fine"" people would furious. 

I came doctor looking help, thanks wasting gas get Just...wow! idiot!

I guess stupidity isn’t restricted US. Imagine 9/11 brought point 0.00105% Americans died 9/11. 80% Kohl’s....... wish would shut everything kept stay home orders vaccine available. would like two years so. That's long time think it? Everything would closed could sort government assistance food medicine drop offs home. could receive like 5-6K month could save re-open. get caught outside violating orders get fine 1-2 years prison vaccine available. sounds pretty reasonable given virus spreading. I've overheard people town discussing intentionally infecting others attempt crash local housing prices. Canada needs keep border closed forever.  aghast .. nothing except watching home. Always show pictures people outside.... why? feels like lot he’s saying- although ends noting hasn’t slept days, maybe he’s unclear he’s exhausted worried.

“""There people symptoms, visits ER IVs little clarity. Nobody stay. people dealing – mean, real. people experiencing lot symptoms hear about, associated this."" hard lock 6 weeks would over. Rip new slogan ... ""we working hard send see god soon!"" I’m sure there’s do. it’s probably nowhere near amount asymptomatic missed.

What’s likely missed, someone getting really sick dying virus someone causes literally changes all?

Since March sort respiratory illness across entire world assumed COVID even person couldn’t tested it. It’s likely COVID-related deaths slightly overreported Iran would done much better put sanctions them... driving couple weeks back, chatted prof outdoor cafe. says theyŕe starting week in-person classes Notre Dame. light that, wedding doesnt seem like big risk. confusing headline ever approve home use antigen tests, though.

Woah, read first asshole would grow teeth, find original interpretation teeth becoming little assholes far horrifying. Who's saying victory? even close. Antibody tests think May suggested maybe 25% city residents exposed. understand back March April.. Maybe even little May.. science support need approach anymore.

But you, thank taking things seriously.  people fraction concern would far better place. majority us give crap want fix all.

The half-crazy, deluded, brainwashed dolts make 35 percent population content staying way everyone else tries get control. actively undermining efforts egged people interested getting things back normal.

I'm aghast fellow citizens Earth faith America pull together times real crisis gone way belief Santa Claus. really pinch pennies might even able afford health insurance. though, nothing dangerous getting gas takeout food. wash hands after. know someone got Covid 7mo lost baby. think related. suppose could horrible coincidence. Still, take risk?  No, bit vaccines flu. flu generally symptomatic aware someone it. know flu functions part combat it. None said Covid. even bothering ask Sturgis idiots wear mask? It’s completely pointless. They’re rebels man! expected honest. Lockdowns ideal, pushing inevitable forward, sadly. see almost every country lockdown opening again. IFR = Infection Fatality Rate

The percentage people infected virus die it.

CFR = Case Fatality Rate

The percentage people diagnosed virus die it.

Since test infected people, since tend catch really bad cases harmless cases, CFR *much, much* higher IFR. hospitals let people die. 

Once becomes triage situation, let people die hallway. many exposed noses killing many healthy people!! Please make stop! 

Btw, unicorns orange. internet says That’s thousands employees risk catch VIRUS dollars... people can’t cook Mexican food f*** homes??? course Yes, Mr. Racist Agreed. waste time money.

Honestly played 5 games season (majority league 15 - 17 games), team might well withdraw, point. Herd immunity massive number infections — deaths — March. New York chose flatten curve — took hit lot death — epidemic mostly resolved. isn’t rocket science. ONE DOT THREE MILLION!!1! could coral in, come back let whoever still alive months later! outsider looking states shit like previous comment terrifies friends there. Legit seems like half population relying gut feelings rather logic science. Good one Yep. double checked IRS website back April sure. Checked July said still qualified ""it could take time"". $20B market cap, I’d get executive job Europe general followed well Chinese example! Great Pakistan 🇵🇰 file partial unemployment happens, encourage file, employer fire you, file full unemployment. PF Changs cut shifts Jan 2nd half slow season started filed temp unemployment shit fucking brick. people caring teachers care shot killed record numbers American school shootings nothing done except say maybe America needs *more* guns.

Expecting caring sociopaths never ending wait, point understand possess capacity exploit expectation realizing error ways patience them. going do, raid church arrest congregation?

Arrest pastor, give masks others, tell go would long, costly fight.

That failure state government. blatantly dangerous things like result jail time. needs new legislation, get done. First article first wearing mask working jogging outside, need practice distancing. makes sense still takes one infected droplet makes way you. week virology good podcast new york physician weekly talks latest treatments. 
You see even daily death rates US many people dying vs many getting infected compared March. 

I know silver bullet treatment several treatments table 
There anti virals help patients 
Steroids help others reduce fatalities among worst cases 1/3
The clotting problems recognized give patients anti clotting medication.
All treatments help add up. “And again, nobody close critical shape...”. Relax. go outside. COVID stay. Learn live again. Braces = totally ignores. Got it.  encouraging kids pipe dream rather trade travesty Yea kid’s school. Closed Friday 3 day deep clean weekend. 

That’s March 13th. never went back. Schools closed since. 2 diseases declared eradicated. Smallpox RPV. Humans lived disease forever. continue so. I’m sure, Black Plague, people thought end life would never normal again. Even partially effective vaccine go long way control pandemic get life back way used be. Yes. independent news agencies found troll farms Africa fake too. moon landing. COVID. Earth round. Sounds like local paper different league paper discussing, case =) Mandates mean anything they're enforced. Many areas sherriffs openly announce enforcing mandates.

Thanks correction. that's wishing much US. wants last ones bunker? large, people pretty good spot,"" Shildt [said Sunday radio KMOX/1120 AM. ""There people symptoms, visits ER IVs little clarity.

One senses indeed REAL symptoms. ""Some IVs"" mean precautionary visits. sounds there's much he's permitted say. #Winning That's pretty amazing!! USA far diverse/free country world.

It's neither things, objectively. Cato recently US tied 17th Human Freedom Index. sliding, might guess, recent years. diversity, I've never seen measure places US anywhere near first. fact, two countries either side US border rank diverse every metric find.

People worshipping violence? welcome - gotta go 2 week quarantine first :-) ... league heavily investing detecting stopping spread leads multiple players admitted hospital going ER news given places opening far fewer resources stop spread less healthy people. Stripper instacart Nice big prediction models include singular events Sturgis? not, big impact might kind event predictions? Like guy dr. infectious disease? think death toll hit 1 million end year depressing drugs like opioids antibiotics raise temperature. family members take opioids (responsibily monitored closely doctors) raised temperature they'd never allowed get groceries. friends mom New Jersey died shortly covid-19 infection wasnt even 60. Go tell friend face covid-19 isnt gravely serious Sir, ~~a Wendy's~~ Reddit. really know sure? COVID hit really early, even testing protocol. 

My sister example (symptoms plus contact trace) March, get tested. would think there's significant undercount New York.

Edit: ok I'm idiot read headline article.... lowest infected rate places since pandemic started, currently control. family Pakistan.. think Pakistan handling competently? Fuck no, capacity test treat, people die. people bringing numbers irrelevant countries capacity properly record deaths cases, know true impact countries years now.

Not countries young population would show sizable impact early anyhow.. traveled ton work. plan self-isolate 5-7 days, get tested know travel come office. 

As coming back, shut asymptomatic testing due shortages. Blew plan water. finished 2-week isolation.

Our state well comparatively though. Senate both. 

That body done anything interest regular Americans YEARS! bunch high-population-density countries right next China managed get control without lockdown taking necessary steps start. Italy caught guard, New York lesser extent, point there's excuse control several months later. thing people don’t need wear mask time can’t even that. really need wear indoors around people. Plus need stand least 6 feet apart 15-20 minutes. don’t wear mask I’m walk give really wide berth people approaching. ALWAYS wear mask covering entire face nose I’m around people also protect space. It’s difficult I’m surprised many people can’t won’t it. I'm torn attend indoor wedding weeks. would need rent car drive 6+ hours attend stay somewhere. safety measures place, mandatory masks/temperature checks, to-go food options, social distancing sitting household. I'm attending myself, can't imagine would make enough room party 1. bride groom close friends really want go, I'm torn. Masks 100% effective. takes 1 asymptomatic person everybody fucked. indoors last hours. clue many people attending got decent amount since asked hurry RSVP since I'm A-list attendees. I'm floating idea attending ceremony leaving dinner starts taking food go. thoughts? Still risky? Republican governor Missouri chose wear mask shop, said wasn’t going let government tell do.  

^ Anarchy. Rude. would want visit medieval castle infested rats plague? world probably better without anyway tbh helps unemployed waiting unemployment benefits to-- oh gee wait, payroll cut implying person job.

It's like mortgage companies nice letting defer three loan payments. thought they'd adding end loan, would super helpful someone who'd lost job. Nope, made pay four times much fourth month! Thank you. *plenty* horrible people poor &amp; weak well. :D time replied here. think drive millions people around world homelessness death starvation flu? I’ve saying years local rest stop.    Send complaint main modmail account. BC tagging title I've barely left house since March. feel same, seems like everyone else moved on. Alberta add 100 cases per day weekend approximately, BC 50 per day, PEI quite possibly zero. Would someone diagram sentence me? Went regional supermarket ""mask required"" sign front. Maybe 50% customers actually wore mask half wearing properly. surprise dont see retailers attempting intervene customers berate physically harass staff members. Yeah killing 30,000 citizens process... He'd probably tell fuck think ""I'm already thing else want"" stance incredibly inhumane. makes blood boil hear someone say ""odds serious old sick."" There's magic number life less valuable. dangerous, dangerous ethical grounds going fuck schism forever, so, add fuckedness. Ban us! Ban us! Ban us!

Right now!

Yesterday would better, fine! real pandemic America facing right huge percentage selfish damned people. That’s it’s called go emergency room treated. It’s fear porn use precise term importantly shows MLB cases aren’t asymptomatic even aren’t deadly.  law life - people rarely get deserve, often get earn. better socialist system has. problem let wealthy f----ers socialize losses keep gains private.

Nah, I'm gonna sides democrats third faults far perfect, although yes better Republicans. can't feel sympathy tbh. Greece taking precautions global pandemic hence requiring forms filled out. Like ofcourse travelling global pandemic slightly harder entire Russia narrative fake news. read stuff foreign countries, always look source.

Also, could NGO funded state department intelligence agency. Also fake news. saw post high school friend morning reposting independent film maker's conspiracy, got minutes presenter started satanic panic route close it. economy meantime? People acting like stating shut cure/vaccine found, manufactured distributed biggey. 18 months looooong lasting consequences Near 100% mask use outdoors less risky indoor church service scant masks singing etc. said, think protests wise avoid pandemic well, suspect role case count downplayed. Many already agents advising them. Agents whose job get rich.

As spread risk, they’re small population overall isolated schools. realize one knew fatality rate was... We're taking thing day day. know sure years this. one lying.. we're working limited information. numbers look inexcusable far. think too. Also throw people's desire things go back normal recipe disaster.

Unfortunately, virus give damn want realization can't conventionally fight something ability kill us absolutely terrifying.

I guarantee many people facing mortality first time scared they're latching onto anything makes feel control out-of-control situation. In... Japan, places?! masks already routinely worn decades? IVs done majority patients go ER dude That’s fine. family. already volunteered phase 3 trials believe benefits outweigh risks considering mortality rate lasting side effects. I’ve years allergies, mowing lawn kills whole day wear mask.

Though allergies would wear one coronavirus concerns situation. fair...

This lands Senate. don’t see single controlled study list. don’t see single study corroborated exposure times results. think you’ve mistaken “less likely” “safe”. get it. wishful thinking. like wished kids didn’t get transmit this. wishful thinking won’t end pandemic. wait, want police enforce mask laws not? I'm confused. still want defund police?

Or police enforce mask laws white people homeless? seems article getting at. Doubtful, 18-22 year old kids who’s entire life football, don’t know anything assessing risk making life decisions.

Individual risk doesn’t exist vacuum, spreading virus spreading virus, impacts everyone. Sounds like Hoax. way babies, children teens could get coronavirus, practically immune! /s submission removed because

Fuck it, here's downvote. I'm trying defend United States botched response covid, European elitism title kinda unjustified considering multiple European countries higher death rates (Belgium, UK, Italy, Spain Sweden) far behind.

I guess doesn’t fit whole “Only Republican states overwhelmed COVID don’t believe science” narrative subreddit pushing hard lately. Lol deserve nuked want kill country. No, doctor decide

And difference triage (deciding lives dies) decision whether continued treatment humane course plan. civil disobedience killed 160,000+ people last 8 months? definitely care affect/ benifit personally shows society! That’s still astronomically low number, though. mean, really. pandemics do.

The US numbers showing average cases per day, giving false impression. Roughly multiply fourteen daily rate get two week rate. EU still larger population US fewer cases registered past two weeks, numbers support nothing saying US deaths less EU deaths...

But accounting population, US STILL higher death rate. Europe followe Korea, Taiwan Vietnam example. China fucked up. Okay, people actually lead country success? Like Napoleon.

It suck though.... live work Europe (I'm American), family cannot come visit us, directly impacting me. person also number lost one number.

They also reduce deficit eliminating part pension expenditure. It’s staying home. Germany little cases. It’s keep borders closed rest year live normal life. beach holidays important thing life.... Stats like prove stupid tests diagnosis are.

Unless going suggest Americans much stupid rest world (even though Trump acted reduce travel early). much might hate Americans going case.

The current 162k deaths well three times combat loss, six months, three times overall total well month. Look population city...

Y’all keep pants, damn That’s infected &lt; 6 million Americans 330 million Democratic party tougher environmental policies, would win even fewer elections, even less would get done. views, correct, impractical. comment man himself! either fall gal underreporting.

Or liking CA government underreporting.

Or shit hit fan California want around does. “The actual numbers two three times government reporting,” Atta ur Rahman, chairman Prime Minister Imran Khan’s task force science technology, said phone. large number cases aren’t reported low testing reasons respiratory failure aren’t counted deaths, said. 

 

I trust Atta ur Rahman Bill Gates situation Pakistan day week. Yes that's 0.2% Death Rate ya.

You know, 4% alarmists use.

Sucks. completely shutting even longer would damage. Yes, I'm weighing human lives vs economical collapse. Every state federal decision lead lives lost, practically topic. inane argument.

That aside, y'all really fucked whole distancing thing riots &amp; protests. **The whole European continent** 740M population, 10.2M square kilometers, USA 9.8M square kilometers.

Borders Europe almost inexistant, especially Schengen Area, closed late pandemics.

Also, they're real central government here, EU never really agreed common measures, almost nothing done level, almost coordination countries, whereas USA supposed least sort national leadership... European, whole ""America Bad, Europe Good upvotes left"" circlejerk super annoying. New Zealand say 5M cases. general consensus number infected always 10x number cases. means roughly 1/7 Americans infected. ""I'm lawyer, I'm used form-filling small print. these, difficult understand.""

Pah. competed thing, simple, mess up, create another one. Took ten minutes, including finding passports  100% wearing masks would better now.. ""individual rights"" prevail. dying. young, healthy people die COVID, however much risk seeing (long-term) damage hart, lungs, etc older people. Imagine US reopens schools entire generation gets virus: means that, much? 10%, 20% people never able join military, police, firefighters, paramedics, etc due health related issues. would huge problem. Maybe colleges could focus education something. praying Darwin Award ? Many hugs. I'm getting 7 hours week work, medical, pretty safe work alone. much, scraping by. long.

I cannot imagine people treat selfish people like medical professionals. Impartiality hard. 

Harder anything even fathom. Especially now. 

Fuck people straight deserve suffer consequences imo. many likely killed people gotten others gravely ill. non-Americans wearing masks brought though. Yeah, remember scientists said one thing changed stance later? believe, virology incredibly complicated Trump actually talking ass? going say examples nations (particularly scandinavian countries) completely outdated denmark least. wearing masks last weeks city becoming increasingly common see someone wear one. news media health experts provided examples mask help prevent spread higher degree. wear goddamn mask. oh i'm sure he'll asymptomatic, powerful people seem be... he'll use downplaying virus narrative Kinda reminds part *Contagion*, like Fishburne learns something shit hits fan.....hmmmmm Fuck 😧  Incidentally that's many died last pandemic had. minimum wage jobs calculated hourly. Plus none wearing masks. appreciated! give up! Stay safe! Healthcare funding tied employer employment. sane one's care. great attitude. give fighting. may feel like drop ocean actions count something. also, never underestimate influence have. 


I'm much ""somebody"", voice alone resulted people guard taking things seriously. 


speak, sometimes, heard. Erie, cases going up.

We went low 31 cases (~3.3 per 100k) 7 day average mid June 47 (~5.1 per 100k). Rt 1.1. 3 day average hit levels seen back early June.

I feel like I'm going crazy one seems care increase. Bars/Restaurants jam packed. Schools planning open. 

Everyone brags low % positive rate. important, going tests - positives going down.

On plus side, hospitalization rate lowest nice think spread (18-29 range testing positive double rate make up) fact less spread wanted go vacation Florida plan first numbers spiked. Decided Alabama staying away people much can. went one beach shops literally one mask like ??? Source? Good job staying away everyone. People think I'm overreacting too. kids keep getting invited hang friends understand parents allowing kids this. 3 people house covid right kids still getting invitations! wrong people? parent saying no? feel like I'm twilight zone. Horrific Texas: go big go home guess friend mine (single mother 2 kids) felt like getting sick last week. Wasn’t sure allergies felt like responsible thing get tested. went clinic told would take 7-10 days get results back that, ideally, family isolate results come back. issue work means kids go camp/daycare. quickly felt better (and chalked allergies), took risk returning life (her work kids camp/daycare). doesn’t paid sick leave used vacation leave gets back shutdown initially happened childcare. 

It’s week still doesn’t test results. 

Without rapid testing and/or mandatory paid leave anyone waiting test results sick, never beat this, people still need feed families pay rent, prioritize things ahead potential risk getting sick infecting others. High hopes, low expectations. ...Even got citizenship European country? [Here 

From first report came nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), found 2011 2013, $381 billion taxes went unpaid every single year.

Let’s say 25 million vaccinated end January 15 million vaccinated every month.

That’s one third country built immunity.

Letting population panic early probably first failure. Humans sustain level concern long. eventually morph something else, unfortunately us ambivalence. 

New Zealand went one approach, hard lockdown beginning, population super worried, erradicated virus. lifting nearly restrictions, instead focusing restrictions designed keep virus returning. 

Sweden went different approach, preventing fatigue. population super anxious put restrictions designed keep virus managable semblance normalcy. clear, they've maintained restrictions comparable phase 2 phase 3. meant higher deaths early on, long term population could maintain restrictions (hopefully resulting fewer deaths long term). 

Finally, communicating clearly, focusing one clear consistent strategy. 

Fact is, know second round business closures. might partially explain behaviour people, get socializing done measures come back place.

On top that, hard restrictions international travellers, inter-provicinal travellers restrictions.

That is, allowing muslims wear burka, promote religion long beard. catch things, even promoting religion online, send camp least several months, untill rescind religion.

Then monitored even closely constant treath sent back camp.

Like people China, allowed 2 children get strong warning third. 4 children, obliged get tubes tied.

It's brutal inhuman. number deaths rising reeducation program family planning program.

The Chinese government justifies reeducation program terrorist attacks years ago muslims family planning program threath overpopulation since 80s. justifications unfounded. really think numbes accurate 200,700 people died usual March 15 July 25, according C.D.C. estimates, adjust current death records account typical reporting lags. number 54,000 higher official count coronavirus deaths period 20% positivity implies testing largely symptoms obvious, tracking new asymptomatic cases well all.

On average, X people die given year, 2020 X + 200 000.

How explain this, covid death numbers inflated ? Thats cute, wrong. average shoulder length 16 inches. line 162,000 people shoulder shoulder, would line 41 miles people. reminds right 2016 election.

T signs everywhere, almost every lawn business front. 

It night day. stark reality people live large urban centers mostly idea people rural areas die hard R. talked neighbor day. said almost everyone knows bad. answer question, Americans care. That’s Canadians tell mortgage house mozzarella. never accurate accounting actual covid deaths. Excess deaths gives us net effect pandemic, purposes tells us really want: many deaths pandemic vs many deaths normal year. really legally over, we're past first wave we're seeing new outbreaks facing lockdowns. Although, nowhere bad US. Hello UK looking outside in...

I hope citizens US see US presidency (not todays Presidency...) mal-treated guys many years.

Carbon dioxide causes that

Perhaps carbon monoxide does, too, high concentration kills study done summer kids school. technically lying.... morally still big cunt hope karma slaps face. could lot worse. People need calm down.

Almost factory workers trouble year line way economy headed nobodies gonna buying shit. long trump prop economy November doesn’t give shit much suffer supposedly lame duck president.

Well America also country prides ability practice free speech (good thing) they're louder prouder culture. culture leads chunk assholes loudest heard (bad thing). 

Point is, may US assholes, lot vocal assholes compared Chinese, even British cultures passive aggressive Money Life This. somehow manage make future, expect able afford house.

Me, I'm wearing mask I'm public I'm best go grocery store, work, home. background knowledge UFC finances occasional fight, figured $50 ppv bad. Dont bother. America lost cause conservatives country literally deniers science, left wing would able get something done. half people country straight believe entirely lie, there's much one party do. Ok, I'll come back post two weeks. chat many dead 'done'. See champ.

RemindMe! 14 days whole world rooting timeline global effort. answer likely yes based various vaccines developments. 7 vaccine variants least one bound effective. far Chinese UAE ones look promising use inactivated virus vaccine. really insane. lived Italy sept 19-Aug 5th. live Colorado now. Seeing way handled US vs handled Italy astonishing. I’m sure come next week article gains traction. “healthy 29 year old dies COVID” seem go way, turns obese cancer survivor autoimmune disorder. 

It doesn’t make less tragic, aren’t many truly healthy people 20s dying. could rip mom's off.. mean....

This whole situation kinda proves though, right? precisely feel. delusional think left-wing shitheels(never heard one before) gathering too. something big Sturgis, gathering. mass shooting 21 people gathering hundreds DC weekend. What, think Young Republicans? Please Without consulting taxation texts, can't US citizens? taxed less? what's preventing us copying northern neighbors that's working well them? Yeah, brother thinks ""silly"". spends lot time Facebook become obnoxious political extremism. Facebook toxic place internet makes hate family friends, go unless need contact them. Honestly, COVID isn’t even worst pandemic US. one really kill us stupidity source posting excess deaths per state. keep looking Texas wondering total deaths due Covid false. compare small states (MD, OH, MI) Covid deaths vs total positive COVID cases Texas 1.5 3 times death. Probably lagging, still doesn’t make sense. understand particularly difficult kids still worth risking family's health. Technology good enough ease need seeing people, better times see person.  saw speaker series poet named Nikki Giovanni said ""do moment. can't anything responsible less it"".

So idk try. sad thing stayed suspended, family would safer classmates. think that's people struggle. stay say ""Hey, right need fix it"" MAGA'ts scream saying ""WeLL lIKe aMazIng cOUntry leaVE tHen?"" decide leave, giving want also people saying quit country. That’s wild coming back New Jersey Texas (we away home went came back medical procedures done month ago) attitude immensely different. Texas felt judged wearing mask get groceries anywhere else Jersey see virtually everyone even going walks parks masks respectful social distancing. feel much safer Texas. (although likely always) realize “the American dream” fucking joke? mean, guess Jeff Bezos, likely 300 million Americans. 

Your forefathers set failure capitalist zealotry one day would inevitably implode. feel bad guys. misguided top levels centuries. also top levels ton decisions made wealthy politicians US representing one globally hated images nations. stand alone, confused helpless become utter laughing stock rest world. It’s quite sad.

‘Murica greatest. Hell, work science lab, people still going vacations states away, partying, that. ""It's like flu."" ""don't tell management I'm going state, dont want self quarantine you?""  question excess deaths is, undercount number deaths, since people partial lockdown driving much dangerous activities often? instance, 100,000 people typically die certain time frame, 20,000 car accidents, 2020 150,000 deaths 5,000 car accidents, true number Covid deaths underrepresented. Also know, Serena wife founder Reddit. wealthy need make public donation known nothing drop bucket them. addition, foundations high powered attorneys protect astronomical taxes. discount donation, believe admirable wealthy people/celebrities choose scream public. behalf daughter terrified mother returning school one-on-one autistic student special needs classroom, thank you. parents like you, fearing mother's life. care ""winning"". Italy, 50 people left ICU entire country, 3x population NY. Herd immunity real. wasn’t careful. walking around without mask. young, would get infected? am,” Martinez said

That's stay home rest lives? Get real. no. like weeks ago. Look change comments. They're going come house enforce that? Get real. send note superintendent says intend homeschool now. vindicated soon. wife son still locked down, left home(instacart, domino's amazon), since march, except vaccines, care, they're stuck home like us. Even immunity, unborn child too? Seems like lot unknowns. brightest lantern you

The irony hurts me.  feel like whole thing deep clean makes personal responsibility thing. dirty handed students fault making happen, uncontrolled airborne spread poorly ventilated building, leadership requiring mitigation strategies department. I’m also tired hearing “new normal” myth never true matter circumstances. Canceling college football season wake people up. Unlike, know, thousands deaths. No, Europe, US care... would willing get Covid-19 order watch concert Jimi Hendrix, Orianthi, Freddy Mercury, Janis Joplin, Keith Moon playing all-new songs written Bernie Taupin. get exclusive permission record post YouTube. That's I'd set bar. fact well established koodie. couple countries managed swing little bit better whole bunch worse.

CDC lot crazy stuff. listen little. took one recently similar question focused basically idea take soon became available wait bit all. certainly possibility. Xposted r/covidgret cannot understand people okay told work daily basis can't bothered told something simple wearing fucking mask? Seriously, people unbelievably stupid.

If one anti-mask people, please feel free enlighten thinking. Yeah underground satanist child milestones another problem. friend mine teaching elementary school told kids come positive, quarantined room another staff member. solution feels unacceptable me. We'll burn together world, it'll hell time. Thankfully we've gotten good virtual happy hours, screen sharing movies, virtual play dates/story times. Simple solution: admit anyone pot belly, bad tattoos, dentures. wise man said, know signed for! Yeah same, fear them, fucking everywhere!!! hyped virus. read somewhere California actual numbers positive high death rate like 
.002% realize low is. many many times lower seasonal flu!

The real issue still know does, hence fear mongering highest scale. unknown scaring people death rate.. people say deaths? mean people dying right? Yes sadly live world thousand die daily. never hear common deaths anymore covid 19.

Once find exactly is, gone tommarow minds millions torturing today.

I wish answer this. One thing know answer putting fear everyone. changing civilization know it. know found exactly is. move ahead couple weeks fast forgotten.
Still stay safe wise use intelligence fear guide Sleep deprivation big one. sleep hour two less previous generations average. unprecedented levels competition attention, blue light inducing wakefulness, busier lives, stress, etc. Gee, sure silly they’re locking reason. Kinda makes look dumb, right? 

I mean, would one thing 5 million people US gotten sick something don’t really understand. hundreds thousands people hospitalized left lasting chronic damage forever change course lives. 150K Americans died - know what, I’m rambling.

What stupid idea lockdown is, right? uncertainty disease overwhelming me. moment's worry virus I'm 63. I've done research, looked original peer-reviewed studies, feel confident belief virus way worse flu elderly sick people, STATISTICALLY worse flu healthy people. certainly lethal enough justify stopping world. ""150,000 people deserve die america bad"" god people delusional let government tell do. Unless police. I'll let them. People relaxing bit, think dangerous places still locked down. Dining remains outside saw entry data building office in, 7 percent last year. 

I assume typical city-wide. 

(wear mask) place makes KY look great. KY one saying mask mandate doesn’t work. I'm 100% convinced story would much different democrat white house. stoppable, morons. come subreddit everyday get pissed every time many many people think covid doesn’t exist. work overnight christian camp weekend retreats....schools open 2 days shutdown. open back up. shutdown. reactive instead proactive. blame stupidity. that's reason still going Piss pants maybe?  Yep. Staying home. Wearing mask go out. Wiping groceries/delivery/take-out. Washing hands goddamned time. going absolutely wacko least month lack human interaction. fudging real problem here, else.

Please accuse 'adding couple zeroes' I've done nothing sort. heavily brainwashed believe country freedoms actually start believing people oppose freedom. America testing Europe?

HIV virus working vaccine/cure one decades. Somehow Coronavirus complicated HIV already conducting vaccine trials. miss something? Hell, I’d free. Getting paid too? Gravy. person lost everything choices. others done. They've shared enough Reddit see much. Life air. It’s also money. fact you’re basing argument able one shows you’re arguing bad faith haven’t actually thought argument logically enough come simple conclusion. Thanks, read article thoroughly without finding useful information whatsoever, realized probably can't read Chinese. Finally american said truth rather excuse.

The first step realisation. Even many people comments still talking personal stake this. yeah do. live Stockholm

Pippen! People don’t mind risking kids’ lives long get pictures taken stranger mouse costume. 1:50 people infected Covid Florida. use 28 day cutoff Scotland has. makes sense sort cutoff change weekly figures etc. comparable countries. According John Hopkins UK higher mortality rate tho. guess American research facility also bad math I'd say Covid lot that. also deadly disease, starters.  Total deaths year probably give real picture. let in. NYC 30% infection, major neighborhoods 50%, main reason. need 70%, seeing places like Italy/Spain, daily deaths near zero.

Testing shit back day, getting test unless hospitalized. Deaths metrics go by. “Actually Trump nothing would better.”

Sounds like way described management inheritance beginning presidency. Ok, density + healthcare system designed serve whole population. Nowhere near need pandemic. That's going USA wide issue. No, lord baby jebus gonna protect them. Famous last words. Inside EU, home country EU citizen pay bill. might need show paper work show insurance home country. 

&amp;#x200B;

At least case 15 years ago used system, showed insurance card drivers license, bill seen. Yeah including San Marino list always bit joke. Italian micro-state. walk Western border Eastern border hour. 

Obviously Italy, got hit first 42 deaths. puts worst death toll world per capita 1,238 deaths per million. 

But still 42 deaths probably statistically valid picture since population sample low. population whole Republic 33,000. context Italy got hit first Western world least prepared probably say much. Also, laying 165,000 people next shoulder shoulder would stretch 30 miles. Absolutely staggering loss, we’re even close done yet ""They not."" - Ron Howard wanna fuckinh kill myself. now, wanna live world anymore. Feels like things actually falling apart slow motion, good news always/only relative. Fuck. 1 2000 AMERICANS ALIVE START PANDEMIC DIED. 
A PERSON AMERICA DIES EVERY 56 SECONDS VIRUS. China invented SARS Coronavirus 

Change mind Honestly Europe, same... hope, hope, hope said done, people recognize underbelly America people come together something it.

Sometimes think back Uncle always said, world better place South war. Yeah, slavery would ha e around little longer, least would've rid worst lot. always thought mad, hindsight listened him. #1 anti-mask idiots per capita lol put zeros. Looking Netherlands, 17m inhabitants 6157 confirmed deaths, that's 1 2800. less control moment, I'm shocked difference US NL big. US control now, time, US probably showing way unless find right medication. American constitution gives rights?

/s

P. S. I'm American. Unfortunately specifically mention (neither graph FAQ). since specify, would assume standard 95% confidence interval. exact metric used calculate interval depend upon statistic use. 

From one [papers](http://www.healthdata.org/research-article/forecasting-impact-first-wave-covid-19-pandemic-hospital-demand-and-deaths-usa-and) talk using ""a mixed effects non-linear regression framework"" doubt specific ""Statistic"" using. Honestly always going cycle restrictions reopenings vaccine available. Neighbour west here. notice convinced time summer we'll back stricter measures. handling first one gives faith second wave restrictions also properly handled though.  degree separation style thing. Or, people still dont seem understand debilitating long term average person, half wont trust believe anything see. happening Internet US days? teachers Internet home? mean ones significant portion population looking politicians lie tell want hear instead Truth? know voted for, know getting guidance certain politician misleading this. Agreed people selfish idiots reason shut economy costing people know jobs medical insurance came job. shutdown kill millions covid would killed less half million low quality life could care less death. Trump say US gonna keep winning get tired it. I’m maintenance guy died little foresight would gone long way. Like realizing lying public masks order prevent panic shortage PPE would seriously eroded trust...

Like maybe one time really mattered politicians could tell fucking truth? 

Nah, fuck lie, pass laws anyone disagrees even slightest get blackballed. Toss em jail slap em fine.  always works. always always will. That's plan... Americans

Actually, Americans 75% mask compliance rate, higher many western countries, including Canada, UK, Germany, Australia, Finland, Sweden, Norway,  Yes, is. people talk over/under-counting using excess death. gave example declaring number get way makes intuitive sense excludes over/under counting. many times gonna watch scenario play out? like lemmings following cliff. give away good luck?! Pffft yeah right! Reminds bit leftovers 2 percent people disappear many 12,000 death u.k. 20 years old? required kids, parents threw major tantrums rights trampled.

Where fuck parents started putting guns schools myriad ways schools slowly become child prisons years? amazing bunch Karens never showed authoritarian action schools *temporary* measure put place wellbeing everyone.

It's rights freedoms people, willful ignorance denial shared stewardship communities. Certainly, deaths Black plague would evenly distributed. Probably whole towns wiped short amount time, others remained untouched.  


I'd say we're bit smarter now, whole lot. Half population still thinks big deal. politicians sending people back work school, could still beginning it. History going kind us. problems breathing, annoying humid. Definitely uncomfortable.

I suspect claiming never uncomfortable bad idea. kind thing backfires people looking excuse go ""it's uncomfortable therefore circumstances special"" take right there.

It uncomfortable. WEAR ANYWAYS. little discomfort kill us, it'll keep us killing whole lot more. that’s case, isn’t post previous one also deleted? making cold, clinical bet, I'd putting money hitting well January. Schools opening much dramatic change credited for. also means people returning work who'd staying home caretake. thus social contact increased mobility. Think standard rush grocery store ""grab something dinner"" like 5:30-7:30 pm. Oh, can't that. wanna say, ""You mean instead thoughts prayers?"" what's happening painful crazy watch +1 convinced finally get book I've lived worked friends colleagues multiple cities, doubt ever even set foot country, *I* consider stance goes China? Ha ha okay.

I disagree numbers like west might 10x number infections confirmed infections. Also CCP sometimes covers shit up, also agree that. say Scott does? even around here? guys also spend cheeseburgers lol stop fat. agree ""this"" two years. mroe trust people wise illness deaths get closer them. longer abstract thing (relatively ineffective) masks people feel confident choose reject. 

Instead, will, increasingly, real people. 

That's horrific thing also good one people likely respond *direct* experience knowledge something thatis fundamentally still theoretical far removed. avoid civil war royalists republicans coup d'état.

The man quite literally saved France internal destruction fought European monarchs terrified implications Revolutionary France, think cancel invasion Napoleon seized power turned republic empire? Napoleon much fervent republican, actions much reflect it; institution civil code foundation slogan ""liberté, égalité, fraternité"" main ones.

Hell, 2nd 3rd Coalitions giving Napoleon excuse invade Europe, revolutionary ideals French Republic subsequently French Empire might never left France. Belgium would reinstate asked nicely?

You probably said joke curious belgian looked .

You regain belgian citizenship. 

 Belgian nationality**  lost Belgian nationality past, regain certain conditions.  1 January 2013, persons principal residence Belgium (with registration population register) basis legal residence permit, regain Belgian nationality.  information conditions concerning regaining Belgian nationality, please contact civil registrar municipality.  lost Belgian nationality due cancellation declaration regain Belgian nationality via naturalisation contact Belgian embassy Washington D.C. info. meant joke , least learned something today. Ehhhh kinda feel bad kids, shitty situation, skip school fail, ruining life, go school possibly spread covid ruin life Yeah interesting! I'm surprised there's slight emphasis interdependent culture compared US's extreme independent. Given proximity Eastern-based interdependent cultures, makes sense. Interesting y'all term it. point can't see clear cut solution return shut *much* stricter enforcement (possibly even martial law) distancing guidelines. We've still exited first wave. Well going say mask deniers since sudden growth sovereign citizens - something thought American thing, maybe right. OK Yale University US government started clinical trials develop effective propaganda persuade everyone get vaccinated, rest  Lmao tell it, work base. civilians current plan sounds like going cause us crash burn cold flu season rolls around... article June Coronavirus peak Penn fan. Norte Dame fan. Michigan State fan. Wisconsin fan. Minnesota fan. 

There lot colleges consider Michigan one biggest rivals, despite Michigan really considering Ohio State big rival Michigan State Norte Dame lesser degree. Jesus Christ... definitely want disinfect surfaces. Disinfecting ineffective, separate affair ""the infected spraying saying everybody room"".

Saying ineffective like saying fire extinguishers worthless. They're worthless, putting step five feet right set something else fire, there's fire room again. Keno once. Scary think greater chance dying Covid (I didn’t die, obviously, walk park). ensure able get time reliably experience. I've worked places people call late bus or, show min late car pool. cool bosses eyes policy put in. wrong? never gone effect. much ""democracy"". actually shut whole country people selfish idiots. could side quarantine June people could follow simple guidelines.

and ""to save old people"" save people ages, including children.

i honestly understand fucking dense. Disinformation campaigns appealing to, justifying, stubborn willful ignorance succeeding beyond responsibles *wildest dreams*. Shocking actually watching country tear apart. Dont worry, it’s natural selection Sort of, let dine done safely outdoors now, along church/nails/barber. SARS cov-2? I'm sorry hear that. can't even imagine. mind sharing? give shit. reason majority fo country religious insane ones tolerated less insane ones.

The less insane oens come 'nOt rElIgIoUs pEoPlE tHiS' Tl;dr: 

India's death counting incorrect would compiled end year. Currently India 40,000+ deaths according report might 190,000 higher. statistician friend mine predicted deaths 300,000 500,000 end 2020.  fair, even it. One fine day, could like ""Nah, fuck you"" stop funding. He's kindness see anything wrong that. Plus, fact contributed much money already - that's gotta count, right? So? People get covid. People jail still people. get covid. IF, doubt it, higher incidence getting are, probably done whatever put jail. people USA seem realise get lot LOT worse still act now

Imma call BS one. We're seeing numbers decrease stabilize even states low compliance masking social distancing. Arizona's number new cases way example. things going get worse happening. people wearing masks taking precautions Reddit gives credit for. White House... cases definitely need decade plan thing. doubt difficulties, I've close friends move internationally months prep.

If planning decade, something wrong, nervous actually leaving something keeping tied. Funny. one likes American tourist middle pandemic. Me, European, never almost 30 year life understood US portrayed dream country precisely reasons ever since started learn history. glorious image liberty, freedom self-expression, unity beautiful patriotism complete bullshit. eyes country economic powerhouse built bloody sweat hands exploited people power, general, little stop exploitation look now. political social unit/country, US nowadays disappointing social problems unwillingness address proper position. also holds true majority rest world, country including, much lesser scale. 
And honestly sorry you, Americans, live incredible amount self-righteous, ignorant egocentric citizens raised believe 'American dream' importance social justice, social safety social welfare, will, swept rug far long continue healthy society, importantly - community. There's simply sense community national level, much divided function one, least that's get various channels information. Sounds like results pandemic Based Exactly followed rules today. like upstate ny nyc today. herd immunity even real thing need around 70-80 percent population. 

Florida 530 thousand cases covid Ny 430 thousand. according theory florida already herd immunity. Lol countries need keep us out. We're literally plague carriers globe. Maybe would open small percentage folks eyes severity disease. dont ""never leave house"". realize. However, America incomparable upswing.

Also, I'm concerned Australia. thinking last year hoping leave early next year. now... Americans doubt going excluded countries. Rightfully so. Singapore student-to-student transmission school. School closed April May. 4 weeks half capacity school June (alternating weeks home school), full school afterwards.

This article says thought first case student-to-student transmission school (July 10) turned false positive i.e. first sick student spread it.

 

The level community spread Singapore low precautions school re-opening planned centrally [Ministry Masks required, although young children can't tolerate masks wear face shields instead. 

South Korea also quite successful, also category low community spread good precautions schools. month re-opening school, [one 5th grader spreading 2 made news first possible case transmission school (not sure schoolmate 2 different classes attend group tutoring session outside school). may view failure, think success story small cluster considered big deal. think makes sense include confounding variables though. Excess deaths measures many people died would hypothetical 2020 without covid. seems like intuitive meaningful statistic me. Sure, deaths indirectly due covid, deaths actually avoided due covid, want measure total impact pandemic seems like right thing measure.  Dude...that’s realllllly good point. know amazing athletes, howeve, increased risk. bare minimum increased risk compared athletes. US like collection 50 different countries. vast majority medical lab staff work government; work private organisations. federal government cannot order people move different states. would huge outcry happened - China essentially force nurses relocate Wuhan months, kind thing unacceptable US. People would quit private jobs. 

Furthermore, cases everywhere US. Every state risk going toilet give skilled personnel. People freely travel states, carrying virus them. like there's one region like Wuhan Lombardy borders could closed medical troops could dispatched without sacrificing rest country. bears largest share impacts pandemic response

Uhm, really young guys? Cause know several demographics young childless men would guess affected more. Russia? Lucifer cast heaven pride, pride largely gotten us now. seemed appropriate first. became delusional. Now, borderline nationalism. Depending next year so, things may change better. may not.  problem people AREN’T that. Good you, live chronic illness yeah sucks isolated, manage organ day every day, know nothing worth this. I’m doom gloom. I’m putting health first unfortunately people never experienced major health problem don’t get it. don’t health nothing. It’s live die. Also people caring negatively affecting access medical care, fear get much worse. live southern town. 

My whole life feels like I'm something wrong. whole town full speed ahead basically hold trying depressed. Oh, terrifying. 500k 20% positive rate suggesting aren' capturing cases (I know math, 3x number reported, then?). Yep, that’s pissed. Looking old posts lmaoooo save I've 25 states, many to? They’re already number one cause bankruptcy. Prolonged hospitalization sooooooo expensive.

I GREAT health insurance. feel GUILTY. feel like rich person dystopian society we’re access treatment others not. But, it’s basic need rationalize shouldn’t feel guilty. can’t help DO. 

*head hands* don’t know do.... took vacation Jamaica, exception hotels airport, go town nobody wearing mask giving shit virus, incredibly low numbers cases deaths. numbers high U.S. there? I'm suggesting conspiracy(although never know), really searching answers. confirmed cases deaths substantially lower relative population. 

Also opinion, imagine humans around world going foolish things like wear mask go crowded areas try return former lifestyle. words, think behavior American. cases high U.S.? test more? 

Also one quick note, regularly display, MSM otherwise, number recovered virus? saw something yesterday said 55% covid survivors ongoing neurological issues. Dogshit click bait journalism. got bunch shares, 7k+ upvotes, one reads fucking article. Makes claim title say word page. Riddled spelling errors. 8 short sentences lady stretched 11 paragraphs. They're pumping stories get ad revenue. actual journalists cared this, would interview doctors experts it, care published opinion piece. Fuckin posers California fast close, re-opened way fast (faster standards), county boards sheriffs' ignoring state mandates gutting public health officer mandates.

At least governor admitted fault. CA power debt printing press like federal government does, think would handled lot better. concept ""we best world"", ""land free"", ""Number 1 things"" breaks completely. Many Americans grown sense superiority rest world strong sense entitlement. 

They need understand biology everyone elses susceptible diseases. do, get cases control, rest world suffer. Tourism US dry up, health care system (such is) suffer (you cannot get money people dont job) economy deteriorate. game changer sooner US realizes this, better everyone good point think lost welfare states Europe.

I maintain strictly virological perspective responses ultimately make suboptimal decisions society whole suffer greater long term.

For altruistic ambitions mean anything lives many, definition, allowed outweigh deaths few. Callous sounds, life quantified probably should, too. yet see reasonable ethical justification months left 85 years old merit destroying prospects 10 years old - fundamental aspect Swedish prioritizing. said, morale could fared better nursing homes hit way were.

Lives ruined ways virtue nature disease almost wanting needing different - circumstances robust - economical system actually one effect. likely successfully implemented fact successfully reconstructing aeroplane boat going emergency landing ocean.

Forgetting fact probably healthy psychological reasons. neglecting situation describe helping anyone: blaming needs pinpoint accuracy addition relevant. Otherwise frantic flailing hurts good. Today August 10. Disney cuts back hours Labor Day.

Have downvote participating lie! mutates every two weeks. really huge deal power Christ compel virus away I'm sure /s \*freedumbs people realize massive US is.

What realize used argument explain US failure contain pandemic. months prep time (with experience countries) ridiculous population density overall.

*iT wOuLnD't WoRk uSa* BS excuse. probably could worked, sadly may never know 160.000 dead US alone.

In meantime Europe roughly equally massive US, twice density population, registered half much covid-19 cases (2.1M), despite contaminated months before. realistic estimations end year likely 300,000 deaths COVID-19 US. 

These numbers we, scientists, work with. got excessively individualistic.

Freedom responsibility two side coin, hear Declaration Independence Constitution elsewhere ever since Freedom. hear Responsibility.       

It also help sick vitamin deficiency, magnesium deficiency, insulin resistance, basically eating junk food. Even children's cereals nothing junk food. really bad. 1/80 die year causes lot people going die within couple years anyways. San Diego Republican, surprise. cut back hours every fall

Do idea carbon footprint is?

This appalls me.

So believe climate emergency exists? simply care happens future generations?

I heard climate change 1980s. 2000, changed life reduce emissions almost completely. really hard - expected everyone it.

But released much greenhouse gas since 2000 history that. one changes anything.

I'm older; kids. kids, intend to, expect explain did? ""Sorry future destroyed. Daddy flew 100 times year because...""? Sure, would terrible outcome, nobody wants it. moment government trying anything prevent us seeing close get. get valved mask. useful pandemic, like painting house carpentry. Yeah sure lots people wearing mask DT vancouver. tired rude people zero compassion don’t care people keep dying could prevent fucking selfish. Idk constant protests lack social distancing comes it. Chronic homelessness. Good someone 'inside' brings facts table. Thank you. 1 every 800 people San Marino also died. actual trials completed RCT underway right now. example look ICON protocol observational study conducted Broward Health Doctors Jean Jacques Juliana Rajter. Bottom line results good treatment viral immunological phases disease. cheap off-patent drug high safety profile.

Docking studies show leads may go nowhere might shine light new biological mechanisms. sceptical open mind things know yet, look know. went rural one SC. boyfriend ones wearing masks everyone acting weird us wearing them. children understand taught mean catch corona either.  non capitalist country handled well covid? Shakeup Caofirnia recent Covid testing issues maybe would found evidence links COVID-19 stroke risk larger sample size imaged patients recovery? back thread, made prediction us would 20 million cases million dead Christmas.

Doesn't seem exaggerated now. think many countries ordinary citizens create pandemic response. case seems going herd immunity. strategy, resulting lots death quickly ANYONE KNEELS TRAITOR &amp; WITCH MUST BURNED STAKE care side getting libtards pwned American negligence arrogance may eventually backfire American economy entire damn world. rate, China may well pull ahead US. American schools would line word. Unless Edu Secretary arguing virus likes American students more? Corona _not_ H1N1 virus. probably thinking swine flu, H1N1 flu virus. What’s niche business? You’re comment compelling rude, I’d like compete you! Closed month late. Opened month early. Almost nobody wearing mask, nobody required wear mask. wearing masks wearing n95 higher protection. Nobody wearing goggles. Everyone continuing go enclosed air conditioned spaces highly trafficked. People staying least 21 feet apart. People decontaminating disinfection surfaces properly, including food. I'm literally stuck. know languages, bunch money, college degree...

...at least I'm south spread like wildfire non major populated cities. Take LA CA, 5k deaths 35 million people. what, Americans? maybe people understand cause-and-effect get vote, *just* people voting electing political leaders. Sensational headline based totals. Omits NEW cases trending downwards. hand, friend works Disney store gets significant discounts everything, used fly NY FL least twice year visit

It's like climate change even exist.

I get it. people really care biosphere devastated? care descendents' lives blighted forever? bet Mexico get bulk rate discount. imagine entitlement idiots willing go Disney middle pandemic. Holy shit workers must tired. China? I'm Portuguese and, even though know sure, suggested explanation seems lot people illnesses simply avoided going hospital. think read something like millions doctor's appointments postponed something along lines. I'd definitely would say making concerted effort under-report deaths (obviously numbers 100% reliable, like everyone's). irony afraid ""being sheep,"" concept fact real sheep. switched raffle tickets set December. Second wave? established health officials Europe havent even crossed first wave considering categorisation second wave could gotten rid first zero. beyond baffled still hasnt national memorial something make people realize humans dying.  I'm normally prone hyperchondria, pretty sure I'm coming covid least half dozen times since March -- wake next day feeling great, foolish. like Sweden zero lockdown, many people switched work home otherwise took precautions per recommendations, high schools universities closed, elder care facilities locked down, etc.

Also, significantly, Sweden higher percentage single person households US countries. default setting already helped socially distance. EU 26/27 functionally. Europe ~44 depending ask, that's arbitrarily drawing lines dividing integrated Mediterranean system. can't comment - live US. outside looks like country lot housecleaning do. Maybe also learning bit countries. infiltrated company keep...the odds, statistics, one whatever. mean damn thing. 

Be smart. safe. love, don't, get sick too. means statistics, odds, one whatevers company keep.  👀 president empathy? We're unfortunately. Anecdotally feel like one cares Sweden well. reason done much better US lol.

Like never quarantine, almost nobody wears mask nowadays people stopped talking covid-19.

Atleast memes see seems like americans care lot covid-19. shows true enemies Americans... ya they've alluding weeks seems me. also weird news choosing say cases clearly exactly expected? Eggs water get ( loans dad got me). Cash App, would better UberEats. Ya fucked America. 10 fucking years late trying educate them. 

Your Gen X Millennial generation thought feeding iPads television better idea spending time educating them. Absolutely! Happy Cake Day I'm you. neighbor educated guy, comes bitching whole thing. tells fake flu part Bill Gates' plan inject us microchips. said anger.  honestly believes it!  I'm like... need chip? phone, dum dum.  Australia closed everyone everywhere except Australians even go hotel quarantine 2 week come home. WTF anyone letting bloody Americans in? **Buy FOXNEWS put facts there** matter ""politically correct""? messed way thinking. Well know lot people appreciate work large serological survey NYC end April mid May came ~23% population NYC antibodies.

The IFR obviously average, error bars large. depend medical resources factors. NYC likely IFR lot higher 0.65% medical resources overwhelmed peak. frustrating see behavior people close you. mother one lot times keep nose free. kept telling pointless wear like many times.

And can't even view extreme, washing hands whenever come back home, trying touch face outside wearing mask leave taking come back.

I find weird people leave stores pull mask holding breath 1 minute. rampaging virus, crumbling economy corrupt president. Americans never anything halves. I've home 8 months else bruh. I'm single extrovert I'm staying isolated even though shit driving insane. brain feels like eating itself. social interaction discord online music lessons teach. I'm fucking dying fucking idiots go party prolong garbage. I’m 6 months quarantine. It’s infuriating isn’t shit idiots sacks old piss, government not. I’ve healthy far, I’m great full that, sad imagine end this, learned nothing. Complacency spreading faster virus...that leadership government Sounds like ready bash skulls in. I'm far behind thought 30,000 less tests day, 50% less weeks ago. Antigen tests, like covid contributing cause deaths, reported Texas. That's depressing.

Actually, know I'm singling kids, there's plenty adults see, seen video, doing. guess schools close quarters makes worse. ah yes, compared rest world, communist... Uruguay? No, that's right, Norway? hmm, no, maybe Taiwan? hmm, still quite there. That's obgyn told me- pregnant people public (other prenatal care).

Surely something right, think? 

And Denmark surely something right well sending kids school restrictions, no?  100%. huge misstep deaths accurately reported, yeah go back up.

But deaths accurately reported, kept going up. fact they've gone even though cases month ago hospitalizations still odd. post removed because:

Stop false equivalence. Old data   provide sources 'statistics'. Unlike cancer statistics covid numbers lot less accurate due [misreporting [false positives PCR exponential curve terrified happened statistics showing even [in countries low mask Interesting thing right lot countries [reporting seemingly linear statistically unlikely, perhaps false positives inaccuracy tests used. Fooled reality ohh noo think is? US population number 300M, European countries around 30-70M. Makes sense countries less people higher death per 1 million population. US, country bigger population count, may less death rates per 1m pops. still highest death count. search saying anything cunt. Still young buy tickets 

Rekt Ah yes contagious schizophrenia That’s calculate death rate. death rate isn’t calculated based people country, based people who’ve got disease. calculate correct way, death rate 3%. Lol, day now. well x million compared britain USA USA nearly 15x deaths link.

but according title (1/2000 USA) link, (1/1500 UK). exactly Glasnost? tried read online seems concept movement, political party? (Or get mixed up?)

But seriously, it’s fear many 24/7 news cycle needs fodder yes, there’s market fear 😣  Please research commenting. Move Europe!  facts room made opinions.  Thats size entire city!! hell needs stadium big?! Haha I'm scientist believe that's new figure? Technically yes, interest loan, realistically likely make less dollars interest months, yet temptation spend far greater.  people get burned didn’t set aside pay back later. Ireland's important ""sector"" world's largest corporate tax haven. claiming ""right wing"" people gathering? third fourth ""mass shooting"" gathering heard past couple weeks. Mass shooting people violating social distancing lefts bread butter. hypocritically quiet these? Hmmm misread comment thought referring overall death.  population actually still grows pandemic well that’s factor. That’ll nearly impossible spot since country least half brain-broken anyway majority population vulnerable smallpox well.

Let's underappreciate enormous efforts done contain SARS. absolutely way gone pandemic work hard stop it. would rather say points towards pre-corona immunity quite important severely infected. Public transport obviously bad, black magic public transport makes viruses contagious places. Certainly kindergartens! take 200,700 ""more deaths usual"" stat, probably accurately representation true covid deaths, U.S. rate becomes like 1 1,600. 60% us care 40% unfairly holds majority country there’s much do. Well, I'd say quite worse, US, going numbers.

Just statistic give info well: 2 considerations are:

1- countries hit. Italy example great response, first hit unlucky.

2- population size. Smaller populations likely outliers. large population really averages response, correctednees, lack better word, response shown numbers.

If look US states, bigger population countries, like Beligum, they're quite worse. That's guy organized every single country that's worse deaths per capita, add San Marino.

Also, US quite literally next + much resourses. Honestly, one I'd truly include ""fuck citizens greesed cock"" much US, Sweden UK. UK even much maybe. sense make compare small country like Denmark entirety USA? can't even compare individual states time. Denmark population density Florida. think Florida capable handling coronavirus pandemic like Denmark? Oh ok phew! True. It’s mess first confirmed case coronavirus U.S. reported January 20. 35-year-old man Washington state, came back Wuhan long ago, reported symptoms persistent dry cough, nausea vomiting.

He US citizen. statement dumb racist, USA could easily minimized outbreak government president took measures early. Nope! Victim blaming easier right? partner works NHS caught back April. Spent 2 weeks barely able get bed, usual symptoms reported. still dealing symptoms day (lack taste/smell, lack energy, extremely vivid dreams happen covid). definitely ongoing thing people deal long time graphs mind boggling Get it, welcome shut down!!!! Lock idiot mask deniers get lives point. whole world didn’t conspire create virus together could lockdowns. people even listen ridiculous sound?? Ffs Ah yes, contagious car deaths. Get it, welcome shut down!!!! Lock idiot mask deniers get lives point. whole world didn’t conspire create virus together could lockdowns. people even listen ridiculous sound?? Ffs they'd ever tell us sure, took seriously certainly enough stranglehold population see stamped fast. Somehow doubt well, though.  1. see reason school can't taught home. internet now.
2. Airplane circulation prevents spread disease. can't wait standard air circulation airplanes achieved every setting must gather. Though, see education must gather situation. think probably right, also get impression Trump emboldened strengthened voices dumb-dumbs American population. whole anti-mask thing proof that. reluctance promote wear mask, back medical experts impact.

Throughout presidency, Trump really fuelled fires anti-science anti-intellectualism. Ah ok. Good virus then! Oh, plenty care. bad president doesn’t “real steel patriots” don’t either. idiots without masks spread even it.   America. “concern” mental nutritional health underprivileged kids it’s 40 years concerted effort expand economic gap exploit low income families. tandem, lowered unemployment pay course going disproportionately impact families. Reconsider every sentence wrote. Places like Belgium WAY better job numbers. count assumed deaths people home etc. real US numbers much higher. Within time frame? there's .5% chance dying every time get car must one fucking terrible druver. Many countries front loaded. hit hardest fastest didn’t time react US Feb March. 

Spain Italy particular locked hard fast reaction pandemic. Britain similar hard aggressive course correction extent pandemic spread apparent. 

The Swedes believe similar “let be” response US seems paying price. 

I’m overly across South American countries, certainly Brazil notable ignoring pandemic. 

There clear pattern success amongst countries strong swift reaction didn’t. clear pattern countries able close borders early cut early spreads. 

The data clear anyone wants look 5 feet front face. Thanks obviously intelligent individual capable careful thought articulate mature manner disagree another's point view. Putin *rubs hands glee* adjust population somewhere site didn’t notice? 1 100 1%

Also 731k deaths worldwide 162k comes US.

Even country, densely populated country people judged really slow taking care pandemic, 100k plus case, 80k RECOVERED around 5k deaths total. Granted, put people thought pandemic conspiracy spread false information public jail there's punishment wear mask public still... adult can't watch shows movies pre2020 anymore without double take like, whoa hell masks? crowd!? goes awhile kids grow going confused Unproven since study used confirmed cases presumably asymptomatic people get tested, probably given lots people ""asymptomatic"" merely healthy enough notice slightly, ie minor cold symptoms Europe much better second wave hitting hard, tho. 21 people getting shot large gathering magnitudes less issue biker rally? Lol, sure laws prohibiting mass gatherings? American know could do. Complain city police force guess? effort Australia make sure Trump doesn’t get re-elected So, afterlife?

Anywho, here's ticket thanks playing Covid exposed racism? Yes blacks gotten Covid higher rates, theres scientific proof isnt due actions taking virus less seriously community, especially among younger generation already statistically reckless begin generally. idiot Trump real virus. scares deaths per million France actually close US Yeah, full christmas markets everyone cold sneezing anyways sounds like nightmare... Ill back Germany december New Zealand, please sensible guys, managed too. 20,000 protestors who'd influenced American political propaganda spreading via social media. America country gone hard politicising mask wearing.  hit point. huge number tests, could even end majority tests wrong results. always news people tested positive three four tests despite symptoms.

At end, testing help. important would figure fatality rates countries different. read 1 2 000 died Corona. Singapore locked 300 000 foreign workers dormitories. 50 000 got infected. None died. Why? Swedish health agency, FHM, recently said clear teachers underrepresented COVID prevalence. look data bit nuanced that. 

But kindergarten teachers find relative risk 0.7, clearly lower professions average. primary school teachers reported number 1.1.

Professions high risk Taxidrivers (4.8), Pizza bakers (4.5), bus drivers (4.3) , group call ""translators, linguists, interpretors (2.9).

They low risk people child care quite remarkable considering schools kindergartens never closed huge portion people professions worked home crisis. it's.. not? one Russian spy bots.

Ooooh! Maybe need turn PRIMARIES too!!!!

Yours privileged position take. Especially considering many sacrificed right. “They”? live CO never heard called anything resembling Trump boot licker. Wasn’t implying that. highlighting majority (by however small margin) representative elect 👍🏻 Interestingly wealth Boston suburbs seems work kind way. seems fair bit education levels age groups though... 40 year old PhDs, MDs etc tend disciplined things.

The 70 year olds sloppy, PhD prevalence among far lower might that.

We probably high concentration public health degrees anywhere planet. Doubling down...sounds like Trump move... Quebec, please mess COVID-19. I'm sure anyone would want live city, surrounded noise constantly. sound voice must soothe Note 95% confidence interval 3.8 8.9. 'true' value could anywhere range, possibly even outside (unlikely, impossible). early reports heard covid affecting overall functionality penis. lingering effects found caused COVID-19 related topic help get guys... Hmmk. pointed healthcare system really focus prevention much treatments. Heart disease particular requires efforts people avoid unhealthy lifestyle. Kinda like wearing mask, unhealthy. Using numbers CDC excess deaths death count COVID-19 US 212,979. population January 1, 2020 predicted December 30, 2019 US Census Bureau (which taken approximation number people alive US start outbreak) 330,222,422 

That implies death count higher still, 1 1550.5 Americans alive start outbreak..!  initially broke Wuhan nobody knew talking about.

Sounds like did. Oh fuck right off. don’t see removing China shilling political posts. school state offering wifi families access? arent countries opening schools? Ad populum nonsense. Why? many US states worse margins. unfair compare dense, relatively lowly populated european nations fucking subcontinent 330,000,000 people manages compete. People Florida keep calling Plandemic. actually driving insane.

Instead need say “I think hoax head far ass regarding Trump.” Terrific : 1) great size, amount, intensity. 2) causing terror. Outdoors far safer. small droplets expected carried smoke behave much like it, indoors virus would likely build eventually infect someone, outdoors would drift away, unlikely reach lethal concentrations long practice basic distancing. think country would able test much per capita U.S. does. German testing capacity per week 1.2 million, 500k last week july, U.S. 6 million tests last week july.

But Germany currently need testing - (and many developed countries) reduced imposing lockdown slow spread. Less people infected means less contacts require testing. way, Germany, less half testing capacity used, results usually return next business day. Surprise - aren't! told buy wanted sure some. Uh run business? thousands workers tends gobble margins conservative colleges 

That's pretty good oxymoron right there. 

Don't dumb enough politicize it. Syracuse University, 100% conservative, pushing fans games already returning students start person classes Facing order anything shut down. could add churches list. way remove Covid-19 air then? Doesn’t heat kill it? 
 
Trying figure anything school Obligatory put /s numbers still awful one thing credit Sweden statistics accurate guess. [1.5 Michigan U Correction -- actually *no idea* percentage population infected. That's practically impossible accurately estimate virus's deadliness quote Stalin, know responsible tens millions deaths.  Try wearing gas mask. going run lifting weights burpies firemans carrying mate. Also put 15kgs webbing. Oh... run faster. Haha, course, there's never evidence is. time evidence exists late. make decisions using reasoning logic strictly evidence. Scientists dumbasses times. 100000 college football stadium packed fans. It’s 66 World Trade Towers. It’s entire population city live in. Easy conceptualize, impossible forgive. kind agree you, would much rather live country everybody decides contribute instead simply saying jurisdiction. Viruses care jurisdiction jurisdiction matter we're sick dead. That's normal though - hardly anyone builds homes withstand temps week two. know anyone Aircon UK. tend run houses weather gets good, beach/park etc whereas Americans tend group inside especially super hot states temps much higher sustained Ah okay, thought rallied more. impression things gotten little serious Boris caught COViD. honestly followed closely. reply someone says ""that means be"" This! many causes death, numbers way lower year, almost everyone changed behavior. 

And different infectious diseases. Think many people die car accidents year - it’s easy see, numbers **way** lower months people lockdown pretty much staying home time. talking thousands thousands deaths avoided.  

That’s another example factor, needs taken account, look back estimate final toll COVID-19. 

I hope someone work, give us numbers *(as best possible)*, “hidden” numbers added overall equation - sure hell won’t current administration :| nice stat read return work today get schools ready kids return. took pills stay near 1000 deaths per day think lose 10% population New Year's Eve. point?

At least long I've alive, cancer research treatment thing. really serious, hundreds millions dollars every year, thing. one ignoring cancer.

Heart disease also plenty campaigns, plenty efforts either directly indirectly aimed people CONSTANTLY screaming McDonalds go business, people stop eating red meat, special taxes soda places banned capped- Michelle Obama even went crusade public health focused eating right. US MASSIVE number cardiology doctors, whole army them. numerous different heart diseases getting better better better understood day even capability performing heart transplants trying save people.

COVID-19 entirely mismanaged every level US, NOTHING whatsoever many people dying cancer heart disease US

Acting like ""nO OnE TAlKInG PeOpLE DyINg"" MONUMENTAL jackassary feel bad absolute motherfucking moron problem statistic number 160k deaths figure would died even without Covid19 last 6 months so.

On hand, lot people died result corona related issues, economic decline.

 get better understanding actual impact covid19 related lockdown measures, worth looking ""excess deaths"", confirmed covid19 deaths. Amurica! F yeah! Dunbar's number idea upper limit number people form relationships and, putting pretty bluntly, consider ""real"". actual suggested number varies 30 250 100 seems reasonably common nice round.

At 1 100 people dying covid that's case everyone knows one died it. 1 1,000 everyone knows someone knows someone. per 100,000 adjustments useful, stage reach 'the olympics problem' fundamentally different compare big countries smaller ones. coined olympics, adjust per capita medal earnings, suddenly smallest countries managed get one silver highest US China earned hundreds bottom. article wrong.

I'm immunologist/microbiologist currently working lab. I'm spreading misinformation. incentive that. would love nothing over. also possible tired abuse. Fauci security crazy people blame COVID-19. sure attracting share crazies well. It’s selfishness, rolled ignorance, sprinkled paranoia; toxic stew bad faith sentiment magical thinking, know ...‘Trumpism’ still scary fuck.

You remember Covid's IFR extremely heterogeneous. depends scared for; old people yes, keep hearing nonsense opening schools ""sending kids die"", total nonsense fear mongering.  wait massive spike August 23 250,000 idiots Sturgis rally start showing ICUs.

Any guesses body count mid September? curious, Australia, deaths influenza reduced significantly, similar case US? beginning know fatalities names.

Now numbers. ....1 66 contracted virus US doubt it.  Noone really knows goes there. Ah, actually read article came South Carolina Department Health Environmental Control, includes actual test results carried out. favor actually read things I'm posting commenting future. 

Also, logic apply even CDC case we're talking IFR, CFR, full count coronavirus infections. CANADAS WAIT TIMES!!!!!

But virus hates arithmetic, ABCs, algebra. 

So get back work peons.... heroes country appreciates you. lot people dont like michigan, also dont see rivals. fanbase super nice. valid question considering corruption Pakistan. hopefully numbers valid want select timeframe deaths fit theory American response worst?

based europilled Yup. therapy since April, helping. nparents dudes really can’t afford it. egregious crime RFID chips Vaccines monitor 24/7. Google nanotechnology. less 8% Italy, economy relies mostly manufacturing (3rd industrial economy EU, second manufacturer iirc). So, yes, like tourists, burnt ground? likely. even little, take texas example, positivity rate still high, 20.3. %. around 30000 tests per day 60000 earlier. Something change, 200.000 people gave died usual pandemic (official count 160.000). serious conversation next, understand crisis mishandeld, really try hard mess like this. southern border air tight.  lots back forth travel northern borders. like federal government's job though. Complaining feds like European ass complaining EU. Health falls jurisdiction states. ""market structure"" keep saying that? 

You incorrect Sweden anything screwed up. Sweden population density 25 per Km2, Belgium 383 per Km2.

Maybe Denmark 136 per Km2 population total 5.8 million 617 deaths. even double still Sweden significantly. Tsk tsk thing right cerebral artery. describing likely right MCA M1 occlusion. Half year, still know nothing spreads.
Unlike 1918, tools hand verify it, no.
A handful anecdotal studies, hunch virologist.

For fomite transmission, half-life could minutes several days, depending conditions. Viral load surface could vary 10 10^10 virus particles. measurement published, another one differing order magnitude more.
Minimum infectious dose could 10^2 inhalation, 10^6, know. Two former coworkers died. high school friend died. friend husband's niece died early 20s. I'm mom tiny state never goes anywhere. I'm fucking pissed. None people died especially young woman. association cause. thought learn object permanence toddler... Covid 19 killing nearly double per day fucking simp. Oh, see took red pill. science backs dabs. would move US somehow got really successful company something. average person? Never. would rather move third world country, atleast everything really cheap buy fat house. get ""chilling"" number, I'd like see age range lives lost.

Here, like 48 deaths town 30 elderly people assisted living facilities already passing away next couple years.

It 100% sad people dying people blaming government failure act people still gatherings, dont use masks nasty washing hands ones blame. Also complicated high number Covid cases cardiac involvement.  agree, military lockdown there. numbers wouldve way worse. 

I remember reading articles March Wuhan number urns ordered 10 times higher normal months. idea 5k death seems preposterous. Cdc flu page explains math. take actual flu cases use calculate estimate. counted covid cases way we'd get even massive number. food cooking need disinfect. package let sit day opening fine.

Use brain here: contagious via surfaces everyone would gotten already. 

But lick package lol probably steep decline deaths car accidents

It pronounced effect might think. roads gotten less crowded, cops things minds besides enforcing traffic laws, people sped way up. lockdown, saw drop number accidents, jump fatality rate accidents. states saw outright increase total traffic fatalities. really understand legal though. something similar teachers live ""high risk"" given preference online teaching. see legal systematically base employment upon people's medical history. Maybe private entity like NFL is, definitely government job. Steamroller flat first could build bridge moon! Well well aware like then. everyone else remembers stuff. shop thr dollar store unless ways trying save money. Generally lower income people shop (I know I'm generalizing) lower income comes less insurance rates, decrease amount sick time available (because employers suck).

They really requiring masks No, become monsters too. Everyone treated humanely sake, theirs. US government managed full50 state plan, adequate funding, staffing, coordination, proper guidelines (i.e. mask mandate), would problem.

But didn't, do. Estimates absolutely empirical.

Bullshit. show class observe experience Statistics part science. 

Statistics pseudoscience. Junk.

Science useful **FIRST**. theory cannot reproduced, use. Statistics **not** reproducible **not** science.

Statistics Science fraud. ask Newton.

Nullius verba Yes, need talk TB. 

But also 700 000 COVID deaths 6 months. COVID serious. Inwood, same. less trying make numbers palatable. 1 600 versus 3 2,000. totally exact far Thank much. government big share blame got point lack clear policies gives people reason act responsibly. like... expect abandoning common sense, reason, appreciate science-based solutions . 

The federal government good people work it. people suck right now, corporate capture. TX shut yet? issue wearing masks, lot people states required. Finding better option could lead higher compliance. less trying make numbers palatable. 1 600 versus 3 2,000. totally exact far Bruh I'm Karachi, Pakistan. dad talked spokesperson SIUT(health center Karachi). According still, center still overwhelmed COVID patients.

He spoke Friday, day two ago Lol too. Growing dirt poor advantages, need frills shit. insane number consider light we've gone past 6 months. seeing well 1% population infected yet, get feeling next 6 months going wild compliance fatigue cold weather arrive northern hemisphere. found socialist! Venezuela go! used this/prepared deal rest life, care dying one specific virus? Whenever someone justifies ""well nobody else wearing one...."" I'm like *THATS EXACTLY SHOULD, SHOULDN'T* closed ago. going keep ""winning"" race herd immunity. we’re teacher shortage is. don’t know think imaginary army willing teachers going emerge from. Completely total insanity. lot evangelicals think Covid hoax. terrified Bill Gates Dr. Fauci think evil people. put trust, faith hope Trump God. live Bible Belt kind crap I’m hearing. live Austin, Texas city complete overwhelmed cases still see people gas stations without masks including workers. Georgia. Ya. sure caricature. new York undetected cases due outbreak occurring March even earlier testing done. new York 1600 deaths per million. Lol, there's always white person comments talking ""peaceful"" capitalism is. Yep it! Holy shit exactly could prevented? Trump fail would saved lives? opposite flattening curve? spiking it? wonder many deaths would involved scenario i'd called ""former WWE wrestler"" something since mid south promotion he's active wrestler either way.

this relevant: (related wild Samoans kayfabe) sort goes like this.

Many us do, can't afford stay home, either get sick, go homeless, vast majority us. Furthermore, try might still many care. We're stuck wearing masks, group willfully coughing air, we're stuck working bone, getting sick dying go homeless. 

Many people think Americans dumb, ignorant, uneducated slobs, millions us stuuck, there's nothing do.  fuck's sake, decay country sickening. wish they'd think long term too, instant gratification thing care about. care workers left make money end. thing matters right now, one person quits, another quickly fill shoes due desperation. Yeah due process state murders sooo pesky... yeah go there. thats best bet. 

Your statement based solely assumption everybody shares sense humor comes coping unprecedented amount stress. 

Unless suggesting I, along others use type humor cope, people. would weird suggestion, 
but can't rule anything country would read joke dismayed Americans making light situation continue accelerate it.


I believe said anything funny, I'd imagine *most* reasonable people would able detect facetious nature statement. 

If another country read single throwaway joke random person internet made assumption represented general consensus public without sort additional research I'd argue problematic worms.  care europoors think lmao It’s kids that’ll fix country still standing then.

My family already back putting trump pedestal blaming liberals Democrats everything. Covid might well even exist. I’m sure they’re alone.  Well, yeah, heard immunity certainly thing. think numbers NY anything close what's necessary heard immunity must fully understand phenomenon.

Also, currently 3 states higher infection per million population NYS. experiencing heard immunity?

Nice try though.  lost 6th Coalition, insist son inherit title French Emperor? reintroduce slavery colonies? seem like Republican things do.

I would also argue ideas French (and American) revolution, really start taking hold WWI, almost European Monarchies collapsed, weight, compete certain ideal ended Romanov royal family east. ideological battle rages day. Spain talk real numbers ones faked government (around 45-48k) 1 every 1000 Spaniard died COVID-19 I'm Italian, article perfectly describe feelings towards US situation. personally cannot even imagine got bad signs improvements. mean, government plenty time, examples data best treat pandemic, failed everything. people treat like big deal best like hoax worst. wish best ones treating seriously, ones don't, best luck months, trump voted again.

People complain, voting? Nah. Agreed. kids. seems majority NYC prefer remote 2:1 margin. I'm afraid would rather remote would rather reply hybrid save spot person ultimately keep kids home. born 86. grew saver graduated college 2008 jobless market, got really good saving. covid, feel perfected art spending even converted free-spending wife ways. I'm bad consumer. =) Yup went life American constant feeling pride American. years ago high-school alot us GENZ starting realise fucked are. parents elders think we're delusional society says suffering normal expected. whole ""pull bootstraps"" got bullshit thing I've ever heard witnessed. hypocrisy politics MASSIVE divide rich government vs. everybody else astonishing double standards ridiculous, Obama got assaulted online wearing fucking tan suit. Meanwhile Trump GOP traitors actively blocking attempts help people stop election security bills bragging cheating winning alot people base claim ""America **Freedom**"" encouraged it.

No matter parents, friends, family news say. going back normal. History going made months idea side gonna writing it. live America moved 99% white suburban area lot people retirees.

So far everyone I’ve met tried shake hand give hug (old ladies); decline offer elbow bump similar receive incredulous stares though I’m accusing infected.

The best far one old lady first met proudly declared would happily die covid protect grandchildren, also live her......... it’s fucking surreal.  come votes Yeah. Always china. 


There people arguing China imperial ambitions Africa, they're investing ""out good heart.""


Sometimes white people's lack self awareness history blows away. voted perfectly reasonable comment. Tells something.. he's big dude used oil back know risk banned ""inciting violence"" I'll tell you, frankly matter life death survival State.

Step 1: Document people, them. programs Snowden warned us make incredibly easy. find intentionally spreading infection are. Even without government helping way, database created private citizens recording people phones compiling information app would work well.

Step 2: Use 2nd Amendment. ever time 2nd Amendment show worth, now. government fails protect people, falls people protect themselves.

Step 3: Round people up. like America get out, could behavior put Americans travel ban rest world. mean time, sent totally concentration camps border Mexico set immigrants trying come Mexico. want spread infection, let among conditions decided fine others.

Step 4: difficult, method infection stopped. pretty, without peril, without sacrifice, save American lives, save American economy, save America itself. Without doubt people resist, people refuse comply, people protest, right thing always popular thing sometimes hard decisions made. long previous steps followed, vast amounts documentation show latter steps justifiable justified. i'm assuming coincidence Lols daily reminder trump cares friends family, that's it. 

How conclude Republicans stupid? Nurses doctors hospitals, worst part crisis, bit control situation rejecting patients already sick bedridden. Hospital staff ability control safety indoor environment incredible extent, engineering HVAC recirculates air.

Teachers take bunch energetic children--generally 25-30 children *per adult*--and somehow keep masks *and* space six feet apart. ""as long follow public health guidelines"" statement hilariously toxic snowball's chance hell so, phrasing so, smugly blame teachers failing schools become superspreader events.

I never seen school keep six feet distancing human bodies even *quarter* standard capacity. guarantee schools HEPA filtration HVAC systems prevent airborne pathogen spread. 

The opinion article linked addresses absolutely **none** health concerns laid post. think thinking well. also mention forever-closing window opportunity beginning this? Wish someone could get new phrasebook something. Ok well need trust ask yourself, none prevents getting assistance. Sounds like letting past get way future, wish best luck. That's gonna late me... Mid-south territory came fame WWE right? Back came wrestling divided territories. 

So factual insulting. He's Mississippi he's American although known Ugandan giant. 

That's also wrestling back then. looked Samoan crazy Samoan monster. black hard head, Texan, Mexican. dark skinned straight Africa. way back unfortunately. Oh yeah, 150 000 deaths could prevented fear mongering. viruses pandemics happened throughout history live reality. That’s it’s widely accepted. I’m scientist studies viruses scientists decades experience do, say man made, believe them. opposite believing whole world conspiracy, including experts. I’m sorry can’t believe randos internet know do.  According ESPN, power 5 discussing cancellation college football asteroid would improvement point. fuck borgerland Car cannot help try get Google voice number? know consider able read 8th grade level. know seen people tried showing news article super simple, could read words, really understand read, i.e. terrible reading comprehension. Isn’t Reddit form social media? I'm comparing deaths different nature (additive vs multiplicative - although said hundreds thousands also due incompetence government, community individuals).

What I'm saying pandemic, freaking virus, undetectable eye. Easier said done. terrible scenario means. catastrophic (yet least, things get worse sure). respond properly. 8 months, still independent investigation. 

If open clear start, could've avoided. I'm saying originate here, all. me, still possibility investigated independently. refusing cooperate that, make look good... guys worse, Melbourne Australia stage 4 lockdown, still see many people ignore break rules. Even people know work with, drives insane. is. even know long term effects COVID are. risking child entire family's life, mention staff's, better choice? rest world quickly starting see America good claims be.

Just people shout 24/7 great is, make true.

The American privilege going mean anything future, especially blacklisted travel places many years come. Maybe, maybe, outsourcing majority PPE production China dumb idea.

Whenever pandemic ends, stockpile must rebuild would wise make sure plenty PPE producers making stuff states, atleast north america Free higher education federal subsidies housing transport studies?

That's get nation educated less prone whatever read online multiple countries EU higher death rates. US middle pack. Coronavirus.data.gov.uk someone another forum collecting data daily updating percentages Perhaps send in-laws colored charts support? mean, mean schools open, tried whole pandemic. level spread almost two orders magnitude peak. So, worked Sweden. fine. since monster, hope countries stop harming themselves.

It course emphasized schools, although open, run new protocols. Interesting . Ill reading this, appreciate answer. ""Blame proles!""

Americans fucking hopeless. agree look sweaty? they're talking about, phenomenon that's fairly common US, someone certain political belief, say example; 'transgenderism real', instead forming political group fight cause, start medical association put articles magazines give beliefs scientific group sounds like it'd pediatricians become members keep latest developments, not. American Academy Pediatricians is. American college pediatricians right wing conservative anti-transgender rights group. fantastic analogy 1. Face mortally-threatening pandemic
2. Take measures avoid worst-case scenario
3. result, avoid worst-case scenario 
4. Whine measures unnecessary worst-case scenario never materialized Unfortunately truth :( think fundamental misunderstanding airline ventilation systems, would indeed prevent spread. close quarters germy surfaces planes counteract effect though. see person responding trying say, they're right ventilation systems themselves, rolling places designed used would take years, would make little economic sense, still fix issues cramped quarters germy surfaces. say good luck everyone 65 reopen?

Yup. smartest thing do, ""we"" society chosen route. American way. Go get yours, fend yourself, good luck everybody else.

Maybe cause people wake realize society work, now... choice. Mortgages/rent needs paid food needs table, government going single thing actually help that. 

You health, like always America. sucks, that's way ""we"" want be, now, even disagree. Michigan hear... love across street large yoga studio. 3 times week outdoor sessions parking lot. enjoy view impossible find street parking it... literally neighbor couple years yeah shady af.

No one thought going skate. question degree. problem case evidence circumstantial. sort landmark case far could punish someone circumstantial evidence.

That said clearly it. unlikely unknowingly infect parents HIV. Yep. really bad over. Still. 

The US handling thing horribly. number suck. other's numbers bad too.

Of course difficult measure interpret data. Total cases affected number tested. Deaths always attributed covid been. Etc etc. said number deaths per million UK, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Sweden higher n US. France far behind. course US numbers continuing rise certainly look like we've peaked. *It seems trend slowing European countries possible exception UK. 

 cases quintupled last month people getting worse worse comes ignoring health mandates. 

In greater Vancouver area alone we’ve had: multiple house apartment parties lead outbreaks including one 100+ person penthouse party infect 3 police officers went break (and knows however many attendees?) well multi-day, indoor “rave” sponsored local beauty salon leading outbreak.

We’re getting American-style freakouts restaurants, bars, stores people losing assaulted trying enforce health mandates. Hell, anti-mask, anti-science protests getting bigger bigger across country point.

Good thing schools opening 3 weeks seeing absolutely details plan safely want open 5 days week using cohorts 60-120 people. 

BC well flushing toilet now. That's way like confirm, inconsiderate expect rest cater them. Okay, realize US still one major reasons WW2 allies right?

Yes, Soviets shed blood fighting, back American Steel bankroll.

The saying WW2 British Intelligence, American Steel, Soviet Blood actually pretty close true.

Allies wouldnt WW2 without US, like without USSR.

Shit still way complex that. reddit afterall. Edit: thinking it: Almost everybody 60 speaks English.

Not true. encounter younger people work often lack basic english skills. (All MSA higher.)

If want immigrate Germany, german essential. Short time work: survive depending work. Yes, we're careful. problem emigrating there's basically place would take us point. feel like simply weather current storm look get next one. A-FUCKING-MEN! know making joke literally America founded on. Free speech big freaking deal meaning matter stupid crazy wrong someone may be-they still get say whatever fuck want. 

Which good bad. feel like companies saying ""we're together"" trying show solidarity want people keep buying stuff. Everyone knows we're together, global pandemic. phrase I've heard much started actively piss hear it.  I'm fortunate enough live western Europe deal crazyness. can't imagine deal worry president think injecting bleach good idea might push fake half-ass ""vaccine"" population political gains. 

Can't believe specify obviously talking ""real"" vaccine undergo usual testing prepared controlled serious scientists best ability. are... US same. American.... we’ve screaming something wrong years. one heard us till I'm expert field (and may also wrong perception qualification), fear accounting wont get *that* far.

Because (from laymans view) accounting rules &amp; laws differ countries would work day 1 100% German paperwork delivered clients. guess steep learning curve. 

Please note: Germany regulated system in-firm apprenticeship independent / parallel universities. Accounting taught universities, apprenticeship system. accountant formal professional qualification, university degree. guess degree accounting may include advanced skills German accountant would have. Maybe could qualify (and aim) higher-level jobs e.g. controlling usually require university degree economics. guess skills positions specific countries, industries.

Hope helps ;) possibly zoomer comment time matter. saw big 10 cancelled season. conferences join, moot point LOL.

For first decade workforce worked average 65 hours week. salary, means got paid regardless many hours worked. call 24/7. 2 weeks personal time year. One hour commute way. medical, dentist car repair appointment, use time off. 10 years full consecutive week vacation exactly once.

Yes quite victim though, sorry. see aids hysteria 80s pretty wild. Id say fears back comparable covid 19 today. novel virus little known treatment/vaccines, id say hysteria well warranted. 

Would rather lax see folks die, overprepared though subject stricter measures limited freedom, less folks become victims plague?

To add that, shame though disenfranchised groups became victims unwarranted attacks bigotry prejudice back (ie. Lgbqt population) (asian americans). doubt it. business owners, maybe. isn’t air. I’m sure kinds small knickknacks shoved far nose ears would rattle. I'm American, I'm everything stop spread COVID. Also, fuck care Europeans think? want add *chewing* mask on?

Low initial rate infections Feb/Mar + controllable region + well communicated plan everyone adhered.

I'd say also stopping people border putting mandatory quarantine also great thing. Europe already causing trouble. Berlin 100 cases detected since started testing arrivals. knows long flying infected people around.

I blame every single fucker refuses wear mask take serious. blame family, in-laws, who-can't-be-named-by-the-mods politicized virus. talk also mention lack fear. death rate COVID low compared March probably consider whether worth caring Correct. compare countries. That's entire point lol. 

Also really think area EFFECT infrastructure, way things distributed, efficacy services reaching population? aware invented teleportation. bit research sanitize dog

If dog like mine, I'm guessing putting chlorox wipes ground watching roll around like greatest thing option. American here. get 4 weeks plus 9 additional days facility closure days (like two Christmas, two Thanksgiving). get additional holiday specific days beyond four weeks? Vince loves big, sweaty men.  Nope, earth flat. Nice try though. 

Yes many agree thing, agree severity. extreme ends predicting parts US would water now. hand individuals saying impact extremely limited. 

The big issue they've admitted using adjusted data raw data. They've admitted using inaccurate data. That's big acceptable field. COVID. virus helped show many deep issues America facing refusing tackle head on. need strong leader afraid piss people get shit done, long, long time.

Almost every aspect America due rework. we're busy fighting political parties get anything done. severely behind countries aspects. shit education, healthcare system life support, capitalism robbed country blind continues so, can't plan farther noses. Internet scarce many parts country, we're stupid proud change life style avoid total environmental collapse sometime 2050.  Let’s check back couple weeks then.

But yes, wrestle control back hands. I'm sorry dealing this. can't imagine like parent believes science right now. son thoughts. ""joke"" literally right wing talking point discourage people voting though. what’s death rate per 100,000 compared ours? actually true manipulate viewers believing everything say truthful valid news source. - never always created entertain rather inform people. I'm huge fan Bernie supported primary, understand people comfortable Biden. parents like Bernie lot, nothing scares four years Trump, concerned Bernie easy demonize radical socialist. Trump's trying thing Biden really sticking because, come on, Joe Biden, who's spent 40 years building reputation centrist ""regular guy."" AIDS quite hysteria back day.  death sentence, saw people get die.  also saw Magic Johnson get HIV, went drama.

But fundamental level, HIV avoidable. I'm married man, wife HIV, extremely unlikely get it. afraid get HIV.

  However, go grocery store buy food family, could well catch (covid-19) even though take every precaution. afraid catch coronavirus bring home family, parents, neighbors, friends, etc.  guarantee impossible would pass HIV parents.

So, different. much scarier. May smart minds prevail Respectfully, think means overlooked different keyword phrase comment. Dude I’m trying talk people showing annual biking event you’re talking raping wife? retarded one scenario? hospitality workers town want happen? exactly that! course use advantage like 9/11 Katrina. new world over! Less people AI working corporations. People losing homes STR Airbnb’s. tinfoil conspiracy theorist feel skimming pot. 1% plan include working class poor. think virus showing behaviors! Sending people work quarantine. backfire though! win this! know football baseball different. pretend they're same. amount contact much different. worry we've always said that. I'm sure DNC admitting rigged primary Bernie COURT nothing it. people running primaries outright come say right impartial, gigantic problem. vote matters counted there's faith system counting it.  don’t live nanny state use bad data without knowing vaccine come, trigger turn society completely. 

And many countries needed “fragile” America bail annexed Germany? least paint cans ball bearings them, people make much noise air heads? Thats scariest maddening part. Theres end sight. circle jerk sub impressive bought bike. quite indictment state American man. fact masculinity fragile worth risking life self around really cause self reflection. Furthermore increasingly display weak ""strongman"" someone whose vanity far outweighs intelligence. magical thing caring one thing time. AIDS funded. people fighting everyday. much money go around . AIDS lot easier avoid covid. Yes it’s deadlier don’t get aids know got it. priorities.  really seems like Executive Order Memos thing giving Trump good press expected might actually something Congress. would thought America 🇺🇸 full ignorance selfishness

I read ignorance selfies reason.  too!

I got banned 'trolling' masks help data covid, experts suggesting efficacy countries like China, South Korea Singapore advocating masks reduced community spread.

Therefore probably least effort gains. nope, direct evidence wear masks. (in early days covid? need direct peer reviewed evidence masks help?). 


Look first post. Highlights reason announcement made day news emerged large [number arrived flight Skopje, Northern Macedonia Saturday Turku, Southwest Finland, confirmed coronavirus infections.  Monday evening, City Turku's welfare department director Riitta Liuksa confirmed **24 157 passengers flight Skopje coronavirus infections**.

&amp;#x200B;

24/157 single flight currently considered ""safe"" THL include: South Korea, Georgia, Ireland, Iceland, Italy, Japan, Greece, Cyprus, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Norway, Rwanda, Germany, San Marino, Slovakia, Denmark, Thailand, Tunisia, Hungary, Uruguay, New Zealand, Vatican Estonia.

&amp;#x200B;

So practically world considered high-risk require mandatory quarantine, including neighbours Sweden longer matter voluntary quarantine. first time Article 70 Communicable Diseases Act used,"" said.  noted individuals follow quarantine orders could face **three months jail fine**.

&amp;#x200B;

Jail time fine breaking quarantine order. Russia big hand play meddling, military, nukes, economy nowhere near large enough kind power. 

couple GDPs thrown ya, 2019

USA 21.4 trillion 

China, 14.3 trillion 

Japan, 5 trillion 

german

UK

India

France

Italy

Brazil

Canada

and Russia 1.66 trillion Yup CONFIRMED fact they're fucking liability. wrong Walter, just.... well, wrong. Bad math... I'm sorry crappy health insurance, US hospitals butcher shops. People travel world treated here.  fast breathing actually wearing something limits oxygen intake. point, oxygen deprivation. 

Mine go heavy pt session gas mask truly experience oxygen deprivation. I'd interested see dainty lungs could handle it. Glad came senses. It’s worth damaging communities attempting force normalcy abnormal period time. absolute disgusting death cult ghoul. post history said right carotid artery makes sense supplies whole right cerebral hemisphere. Either way technical thing thing right cerebral artery. Hmmm ok. stay dwelling basement. I'll friends people celebrating ends. loser, honestly. hope trying troll not, pity you. Happy cake day! Stay safe there! makes conclude want people die?

also, done virus? Covid Duty: Black Ops. infect terrorists Covid watch die. definitely get young men believe covid real.  Ope, found midwesterner! No, mean like Trump's responsible one horrific, unnecessary, body counts, starting death cult reality denying ghouls like you. 

Btw, China also make NZ handle better Trump? woops look reality again, better go murder old people instead, fucking ghoul. ones care wear masks right things. ones constantly arguing we're mind controlled. winning. can’t stand around full time longer. This. day long this.

Maybe want another wave embezzle money.

I lose sleep government catch virus, I'm beyond trying bigger man return class warfare. know numbers come saw something sgowed looking death numbers since year started corona deaths **the world hit 40 reported deaths per 100,000 (1 death per 2,500)** almost month ago point blown past that. 

Stats: flashes across screen 1:31 much hate say this, feels like stepping backs people personally affected virus; think bad enough kind change need become reality. 

I hope I'm wrong.  Thanks governments unwillingness/inability formulate coherent response. cases going far open defiance guidelines nothing inflated egos circle jerking/looting w
We already incomprehensible rate, tip iceberg. 


It's remarkable listened guidelines followed countries examples deaths happening scale headed, really mean joke actually statement fact.

But yeah, joke issue. something New York making argument stance person never claimed hold. Yeah like people engaed reality instead murderous death cult, deluded ghoul. ask headline from, everyone knows from

why 3000 people think applies here?

so: went first post, admit could handled better

ok - how? concrete terms. say ""people need believe science""

a simple list 1-5 things fine country care. It’s small minority super wealthy stole wealth get care run country. live plutocracy maybe people wake realize China also responsible NZ fucking things up? 

Trump killed thousands thousands rather focus protecting death cult. make money 5 years? understand lol Thats opinion, without scientific evidence right? highest, means lowest, bigly! =\ yikes. examples used article seem obese medical classification (admittedly, see full body picture first woman, second clearly obese). 

People keep overlooking this, perhaps politeness anything. 

People very, *very* skewed perceptions overweight/obesity. example, I'm 6ft morning, 179lbs. look thin rail, everyone would say I'm skinny, yet officially I'm bordering overweight. pounds I'm there. I'm actually trying lose 10lbs despite everyone telling need to, fact need gain weight. context, 1/2000 people USA died last year accidents unintentional injuries. test happened tho People retirement age also pay taxes. Greece financial problem right now. Fakelaki economy Exactly. Try square toilet paper coffee filter well. Things think pourous actually easy breathe children get lung complications COVID alarming rate?


And still no, long teachers practice good social distancing public health guidelines fine. lot schools smart this, like splitting student pop two groups attend alternating days keep occupancy low.


I like opinion agenda free parents get working again.
Into incinerator everybody! markets demand blood sacrifice! mean yeah, worked well US, could possibly go wrong itemized bill, rough breakdown? Really curious. Well yea course, demographic largely affected virus(in terms deaths) isnt taking seriously. mean, me, every time get car, higher chance dying covid, worry covid? clear: safe. nothing is. think abundantly clear closing schools much stronger negative impact positive contribution stopping COVID-spread. Closing schools one additional semester, countries seem plan, really big fuch less well-off. border cities rely gringo money nearly entirely? Yeah I'm sure feel way death cult mind, think makes deaths ok? diseased, death cult mind, think it'd fine kill people 60 respiratory problems? 

Are death cult think all? 

You fucking murderous ghoul. American ""destoyed"" one worst things could happen world almost sense term fact understand explains lot. Yes things broken screwed here. correct way fix problems here. problem don’t plan advance ready late. American ""destoyed"" one worst things could happen world almost sense term fact understand explains lot. Yes things broken screwed here. correct way fix problems here.  data comparable different countries.

What wanted show forum incredibly silly judgements success failures dissent countries, yet something lot focusing on. ""Antibodies dissapear fast"". Please provide evidence this. 

My wife lot hospital coleagues COVID tested atibodies weekly nobody lost antibodies. COVID around March-April. Yes maybe, one objective compare anything.
But way shallow shortsighted.

Denmark half population Sweden.
They dont economy globalized level Sweden.
Denmark mostly trade works European nation.

The dannish goverment handled early hit well that's handled better Sweden.

Now Denmark Sweden less one death per week steadily declining.

Both nations stategy (pretty much), difference hard hit beginning. 100% americans die talking men 30, predict “wins”:

Other: bravery message


1/15 sample assigned message describes firefighters, doctors, front line medical workers brave. choose get vaccinated COVID-19 brave.

Or “Personal Freedom Message.”

If using Yale students, pretty sure science message would enough either gender. yawn, one reading this, dude. write novel Shut up, moron. Get yourself. north 7700 combo particle/organic vapor cartridges. easy breathe vs. thick cloth mask. I'll enlighten you, fast breathing environment, able exhale easily big problem inhale resistance. I'm Europe. Netherlands. packed beaches weekend. dude shot death intervening watch theft. illegal party 200 people using drugs. Four people drowned. Finland, Estonia Latvia closing borders us. would first hand knowledge 2020 Pandemic based living 2 years early 2010s? fault didn’t put /s, I’m student couldn’t get go school paid me! Seriously Karen’s killing us US. don’t care facts Facebook tells damnit. Well can't speak Europe, majority people cares something change it. call democracy works kinda great. try it! It’s possible MSM media concentrated effort spread BS. 

I chose share point absurdity kind mentality regarding within government. Sure, there’s quite assholes “most Reddit” cold-blooded sociopaths. absolutely shut US March. honestly think delusional insane. nice day. Hey even smaller percentage population. mean fine drown blood? I've sanded drywall 12 hours day lunch break 2 15 minute breaks wore n95 mask without exhaust valve fine. Yes uncomfortable first get used it, alternative worse. Obviously till winter past would say using Black Plague, mostly otherwise famous case widespread disease. think one that's even kinda famous epidemic hit Alaska back early 1900's. Even Spanish Flu receiving attention comparison, yes, people using Black Plague compare to. mention believe entirety US probably around size Europe (could wrong this).

But modern science, almost evolved, appears diseases also evolve (there's part half believes Higher Power decided play Plague Inc entire human race). problem that, due variety reasons, modern thinking appears evolved.

Plus, wonder many Europeans commenting thread. numbers sound scary, reality many people American (and sorta mean North America entirety this) realize HUGE country.  I'm talking survival rate relation population.

Lethality rate determinable. Tests reliable death numbers skewed.

Wake snowflakes. older kids it’s problem don’t know work younger kids. safety comes first Dumb frog remove wool eyes soon control group gets infected. Brazil soon. US might starts next week poor timing current hot spots decline. shame done month ago South, we'd probably results already. mutated contagious virus. ya Certainly, closing kindergarten primary schools best decision Sweden took (among many mistakes). think pretty clear. argue best choice given information time (which honest arbitration), hindsight 20/20 clearly correct choice. Yeah Europe would tell fuck go home. Everyone B1G rival. 

Except Rutgers. Illinois.  Ah gotcha now. Yea, cant breathe beach towel. mind prove murder actually bad? Good! children shocked see pretty much parent friends want kids go school. 
""She's learning anything sitting behind computer"". alternative risk disease death! want kids go school bad?  understand joke actual healthcare top notch. payment system however comparable Europe 1965. Cops want enforce n***** beating laws. Happened Orange County, San Bernardino county. Idk California escaping bad press. It’s shit show here. think 10x factor permanent. definitely worse early (before effective tests March), testing ramped underestimation get less severe. 

You see seroprevalence studies CDC. Minnesota early May round suggested least 10x infections confirmed cases, early June least 3x higher. 'at least' coming antibody levels sometimes dropping significantly months following infection. literally people think lmao  closed November 2016  storm? Spoken truly someone never ever worn gas mask, I'll enlighten you. exhale, inhale. 

Get nice thick blanket, double press face barely inhale it. ready? Cool. Go run. people lost lives covid-19, even indirectly, personally would count too, though know standard approach... Shoot up, i'll take 10%, picky level protection Lol Probably young people tell voting doesn’t anything politicians never solve problems. yes, extent. McCarthyism may start, surely point return. Thank comment work. Hope things get better soon. Lol, ""it's racist, ideological, like cold war!""

Jesus christ, really proved point. think cold war racist? war two white countries used brown countries Cambodia, Laos, Iran, Afghanistan, Honduras, Brazil, Nicaragua proxies, killing millions non-white people world, destroying economies, often forcing brutal junta dictatorships?

The cold war racist war!

This meant said white americans self awareness understanding history. rest world sees cold war racist war! Completely agree. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* yes, depending person. deny truth even point death. sure seem insistent believe believe. wonder can't accept people get outdoor gatherings move on. Japan may great @ masks, remember 1918 flu broke hard San Fran thought masks trick.

It that, masks + social distancing previously protected San Fran'ers 10% might see much approvement. yes saying. small sample. Try Johns Hopkins. Sweden become thorn side everyone world; people obsessed.

The conservative right hates sweden social policies generous immigration well run country. left hates sweden U.S managed make face masks lockdowns politicial issue rather scientific one, sweden budging.

You're ruining day reminding sweden exists! China covered initially, let people travel Wuhan, shut flights country world. let virus spread. Speak yourself; nothing astonishes comes American stupidity There's comparing dude, assimilated fantasy narrative reality think comment. posts heavily observed antimaskers. Take upvotes sorry. Turn Major League Baseball watch athletes play surgical masks.

BuT CaN't BrEaTh Sorry don’t buy “marking America less safe” argument.  continue social distance, wear mask, etc locking away house. 

People make America less safe every time look phone driving, go craft brewery 1 2 beers drive home buzzed, drive 80-85 mph highway. 

Airplanes packed again. Grocery stores open busy since day 1. Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target etc busy. Tens hundreds thousands protested across country. 

And haven’t mass outbreaks activities.  Thanks. already bit creative translator wanted translate ""obligatorisk sovmorgon"" cause wanted make ""mandatory bedtime"". :D picture whatever like

I picture Wisconsin ass hat replied ""T cell reactivity number"" (sorry I'll read know tmr), wanna know ""antibodies waning rate, time"", ""light cases"". scientist thinking report assumed witnessed? looks like anti-hypothesis ... know reports antibodies look permanent (around 6 months iirc), speculation? used mutter 1992 everyone taking victory lap would create Moscow inside USA This, THIS, good, insightful shit. cannot speak place knowledge USSR USA exactly feels like. America completely naked, staring mirror, seeing every roll fat, blemish, tumor. words, USA semen-stained motel room pandemic UV blacklight? sad still battle mask misinformation far along pandemic   Sorry don’t buy “marking America less safe” argument.  continue social distance, wear mask, etc locking away house.

Airplanes packed again. Grocery stores open busy since day 1. Home Depot, Lowe’s, Target etc busy. Tens hundreds thousands protested across country. 

And haven’t mass outbreaks activities. Ik sorry went left sour taste, spent day yesterday rabbit hole NYC major global transportation hub community spread national lockdowns distancing measures taken. established earliest ones result quick spread one densely populated areas country.

Florida - evidenced fact many cases first able manage lockdown measures. quickly abandoned them, hospitals full people dying. That's shame right - could spared American lives chose to.

It's OK, American lives apparently become disposable some. dismantle everything immediately make money remove *most qualified* people key positions utterly outright ignore still ""gut feeling"" defense, looking death statistic frame magnitude deaths portray things differently. Saying 160K dead obviously scary, however, saying .5% (low estimate) IFR majority passed age 70 certainly frames completely differently gross number. important keep mind context sides science- initially thought would much worse, mean mitigating factors made better. sating that, neither statement wrong right, looking two different sides think deserves credence correct scientifically even doesnt sit well emotionally.

Also ""x number would disagree"" statement simplistic taken seriously, example, 2 people die rabbies US every year, exactly consider something worry daily basis I'm sure 2 people families would disagree. fact PPE availability site reserved tracking video game consoles rare toys around Christmas shows bad things explain mom site people used find Nintendo Wiis hot commodity used see Amazon PPE webcams stock peak 2020. Isolated islands going easier time it. saw dude wearing mask cough hand use hand touch gas station pump Whomever creates first successful vaccine choice share.

Every country world use carrot, ask nicely, give money...but also show stick, threaten war, on.

Imagine every nation world suddenly breathing neck. schools meant primary I'd understand, doesn't. US South push refer kind data primary schools say also secondary schools safe enough open, even precautions followed. meant primary school that'd different question. actually give fuck oh. my.

GOD. Relax. Anti body immunity isn’t immunity.

The joke ignorant people virus. Everything bigger Texas. expected tourism back lockdown. entire EU tradind COVID19 like hottest thing planet earth. Article says feeling mild symptoms moment, hopes soon. Even numbers seem improving some, though. agree you, people like poke US fair US far country struggling right now.  lame duck period got lamer No. individualism founded America downfall. small, low-density population island shut movement across borders might helped teensy bit. conclude want people die every action causes people die. also fits republican ideology republicans never placed particular value life post birth. always strong thread Malthusism ideology. Florida people also don’t live top one another like New York However, take europe whole deaths per 1M lower US. Especially biggest country, Germany, low death rate. know explain care people. Look case chart Sweden. follows pattern exactly you’d expect based approach: initial spike long steady decline.

They’re done. resurgence Sweden.  feel ya big time. gotta frusterating dealing shit everyday. U.S complete mess right sucks people like actually trying make better. Wear fucking mask people. hard. Jesus christ. remember mom trying warn virus late January. take seriously. end February, realized dealing with, told there's way America gets end year. one going want follow rules. said overreacting it'd 2 months max. better information, underestimated stupidity American people. Women’s sports aren’t going anywhere... despite news last years would believe, Title IX sleeps campus. Universities required equal programs men women. actually follow updates guy spreadsheet. 

In reported new confirmed cases split age groups was: 7% 10-19, 33% 20-29, 17% 30-39, 10% 40-49 (+1 ICU case), 18% 50-59 (+2 ICU cases), 6%, 3%, 2%, 1% groups higher that. three deaths 1 70-79 2 90+ groups. specifically talking about? listed 4 different types lot ""friends"" care. went grad party weekend 50 people close proximity people got drunk.  Pretty sure NPR legally obligated give equal airtime parties request it. National Public Radio, private entity like FOX.  Aussies: ha ha lets crap USA they're horrible!

Also Aussies: oh crap better lock down, sorry infected NZ City epidemiologist Anders Tegnell

Clarification: Anders Tegnell [state (or chief) city epidemiologist.

(Statsepidemiolog vs Stadsepidemiolog) is... like poor school shooting survivors harassed right wing :( Intend since that's know things absolutely safe.   Privatize schools. pandemic boon push privstize/vouchers. Make teachers look lazy/uncaring health concerns undercut support schools watch kids flock for-profit online schools year. evil genius. agree you. went down, I'm sure, assume many symptomatic people presenting hospitals get tested. example colleague covid outpatient + ward shift recently, 2 patients come OPD get tested 2 old admissions look whole shift. testing far either symptomatic people hospitals, symptomatic people home, private testing testing flights. understand coming **I know situation bad definitely underreporting deaths. trying downplay it.** look what's written adjust prevailing under-registration deaths poor coverage MCCD, multiplied reported COVID-19 deaths multiplication factor. 5.29 India calculated inverse 18.9% (the coverage MCCD among total deaths based 2018 CRS 2017 MCCD reports). gave total 1,88,938 estimated COVID-19 deaths taking deaths per million population 138. contrast widely prevailing notion deaths low India.

The problem see this:

* assumes MCCD % sates, article states not.
* Top 5 states India account roughly 50% cases, take account MCCD% states since weightage number deaths?

Then article goes onto say estimated COVID-19 deaths per million population higher Russia (96 per million, 100% MCCD total deaths), similar South Africa (137 per million, 92% MCCD) lower U.S. (477 per million, 100% MCCD), Brazil (440 per million, 99% MCCD), Mexico (362 per million, 100% MCCD), Peru (588 per million, 57% MCCD), Chile (498 per million, 95% MCCD), Spain (608 per million, 95% MCCD) Iran (202 per million, 90% MCCD). countries (but Peru) high MCCD coverage. Hence, need adjust reported COVID-19 deaths countries.

This absolute BS, trust article reading this. Comparing India's numbers countries like Russia, Brazil, Peru, adjusting reported case countries. source data countries.

MCCD meaningless deaths reported. percentage certified deaths **reported** deaths only. comparing MCCD adjusting based misleading.

There lot variables this, like increased deaths due pneumonia many countries. Certified deaths also wrongly certified since people dying underlying conditions, adjusting that? 

This article half baked, take account lot things hence, misleading. 

If ask opinion, see true numbers countries years, data overall deaths somewhat realistic estimate. Found drama queen.  doubt logic behind decisions. students staff tested come back school? assume infected ones allowed couple weeks. Try breathing them.

Ya, millions us have. We're fine. That's see asians breathing thru even 20 years ago old pics videos. 

But keep trying **MASK MISINFORMATION** tho Im coming October. Keep trying talk him, dont give up. know tough. Jon Oliver video show friends family falling conspiracies. father Yes, wait times specialists particularly live one major cities actually longer contemporaries. Overall wait times non-emergency services quite similar Canada. 

The people system better parasites profiting misery suffering. why? stolen wealth collective class interest among various parasites means virtually major media networks owned people vested interest maintaining status quo. leads formally known manufacturing consent - drown propaganda designed normalize ingratiate us evils system. Way trivialize utter depravity WH right now. inevitable something feels like parallel universe many things there's things completely except everybody showed parallel universe time nobody's quite sure new weird customs medical professional READ blindly anything...this 1918 first ever vaccine ..yes get vaccine proven work clinical trials...just like right stupid die, right use knowledge live...that's wear mask stay away stupid people Maybe. hallucinate downtown Chicago shredded overnight? business failing unemployment claims breaking records? 150K+ dead COVID bad dream? worse kids. Glad i'm rich enough bribe way cats' ways cat college. There's good chance one dozens vaccines developed world save US it, everything go back normal, sadly. ""normal"", described above, far normal. Sounds like really need wall, then.

Cant get wall, less people detention centers, less risk illegals officers.

Done. brave.  don't. Trust live there. Saw list, soon saw Brazil closed it. talking pediatric team one docs said something terrifying. along lines of, ""COVID-19 going get much weirder tragic ways.""

The allow virus circulate, we're going see rarer complications.

We really discovered childhood inflammation process virus ran unchecked NYC schools. countries became overwhelmed started confirm similar cases.

We're really committing human experimentation children here. even stands. Football full contact sport. Unless go bubble strat like NBA, can't/won't, there's way spread like wildfire. I'd bet amount money cancel season prematurely players strike cancel season. 

College football already scaled way back flat canceled conferences already. teams outbreaks already. that's without travel. 

It's fuck load money, they're holding hope prayer salvage something, going happen. reality going set eventually. OP say most, 90% people claim fits description. Upper east side matches experience. case probably best choice. excess deaths likely conservative lower bound estimate future. side use Sweden scapegoat.  disappointing people drop mic pretend one solution better other.

Even said could last another 10 years.... early judge anyone. interesting see shakes end. Looking back don’t even know thought Americans could actually overcome quarter us probably don’t even put shopping cart away correctly parking lot.

Honestly blame 20% government, 40% media 40% American people lacking critical thinking skills. understand us part stay inside clearly wasn’t enough. Cats catch coronavirus. mean dont pee outta vajayjays? /s  say US soldier says: 'I soldier, want get back war'? You’re subreddit called CORONAVIRUS. Stop bringing terrible anaologies try deflect away issues. don’t know news station reporting facts? Sounds like you’re one watching news taking needs taken terms fear mongering. People know died healthy month ago, keep arguing stop say, I’m sorry loss? Here's latest case/death charts Texas (as yesterday), running 7-day state currently 31.01 deaths per 100k population, ranking 24th among US states. Today show right said 97,000 kids tested positive last 2 weeks July! I'm sure nothing death threats harassment receiving bad lol looks like left shit hits fan people start assigning blame. Impending comment ""ya could blow up"" vein ""my Dad could beat Dad"" incoming Don’t trust anything coming American market right now. 

I’d willing adopt first year eu gives blessing purely political cdc/fda.

Transparency let American people decide side asking unreasonable unrelated stuff, vote chance. Right now, allowing media decide report on. Given media's biases, certainly getting whole picture. 🤣🤣🤣 think outside box! (TM)

/s actually registered republican 4 years ago. realized disconnected reality science people are. switched. They’re ones running around acting like fucking morons pandemic. Ignoring science pushing reopen. playbook respond pandemic incompetent precision, republicans wrote it. really depends. I’ll break you. 

Florida gives two numbers per day. first one promote news. That’s new positives/all people tested day. second, usually little higher much, positive people/all people tested day. tested positive re-tested looking negative test indicating cleared infection, you’re counted denominator both, second numerator. 

That redditor uses metric. find difference new persons tested, use denominator, use new positives numerator. problem many people multiple exposures reasons get test past five months. tested negative back May newly suspected infection *now*, added redditor’s numerator denominator. 

For personally think it’s ridiculous try qualify counted where. Instead, use second Florida metric counts one test every person tested day, counting positive tested positive negative. catch people trying see they’ve cleared infection? Yes, CDC isn’t really recommending anymore know little virus. Even continue test people, still think it’s accurate measure two measures.  shut testing load goes away.  thing find interesting us concept rugged self-reliance real. Survival TV shows prove that. possible survive difficulty, still allow accidents illness. lone pioneer/cowboy/mountain man mystique Americans false narrative.

Desperado Zorro! Best wishes baby. sounds like husband everything possibly can. Nothing said wrong, think Americans feel consider that. Canada I’m sure rest world never underestimated stupidity ‘Murica. Covid opportunity prove us wrong. But, well... isn’t worked all. 

They verified 😂 Last week, state officials confirmed many 300,000 records processed computer clearinghouse system relied upon provide local officials COVID-19 test results reported labs daily basis.

Thanks starting fires fanning them, situation minority countries virus allowed spread control wherever pops part. took 8 hours pump low quality, racist crap.

Spend time anything else. You, world, better it. Don’t be. Cops anti-mask tend Republicans, especially ones running things. Trump anti-mask, are. silver lining think there's chance Dump might actually lose this.

Like said, I’m side COVID extremely serious, USA beyond mishandled situation, haven’t seen friends indoors since March. media doesn’t need fear monger, simply report facts that’s already scary enough. going 300 4000, that’s problem? screwed, there’s way out. build company say 15 employees begin generating multiple millions yearly revenue, I’m stealing wealth pay myself? invest investment vehicles generate revenue it’s zero work, I’m stealing someone? Interesting perspective. every head public health everywhere. So, wouldn’t surprised threatened too.  side either party laughable comment. Clearly democrat People wearing mask threat.  Ugh well, too... appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Nobody America trusted anything China says does. work well us, it? locked several weeks earlier did.

(probably rightly so) Imagine craziness going pay security guard guard people potentially stealing something selling $1 (which means probably purchased half less). margin ""elevated hospitalizations"" ""catastrophic loss"" wafer thin.

Infections cause infections spreading space soon start impair options action.

In terms dynamics, much different ""managing"" fire sawmill lumber yard. reason usually put fires out, instead letting burn little. It’s misleading. Many hospitals whistleblowers coming forward saying incentivized say person died covid even didn’t. reporting state state varies many people whose deaths reported covid simply tested positive death. I’m saying it’s big deal clearly many people actually dying it. skeptical things read (even comment citation) everyone agenda now. ...that part might sad covid mean yeah probably. think someone would speak family member die virus. disappear course /s   
nothing see here... invisible virii floating about. past week credibly-sourced article lots reasons Covid19 less deadly early on. 

Younger people getting it; elders especially care homes better protected; hospitals learned hospitals around globe avoid mistakes implement learned help: less ventilator use; prone positioning; steroids; etc. absolutely believe could least avoided lockdown economic hardships accompanied it. wouldn’t “out it” behavior virus, bet least 100k people would still alive. definitly....odd *certain* spaces.

Please read [this summarizes studies France South Korea showing **elementary school** children transmit virus high rates **high school** students transmit virus teachers high rates adults.

Still, there's people can't (aka want to) wear one time go reasons. damn mask, wear shut up. going kill you, would kill wearing dammit! One would think species could send ship beyond Pluto would show bit intelligence; however, amount sheer stupidity I'm beholding pandemic really astounding. Yeah, else gonna buy weed? Maybe another week really start circulating among student population, two weeks spread everyone else yeah pretty much… looks like Diego short hair (not really).  Trending dooooowwwwnnnnn.

You hate reddit hating south, also blame south putting rn It’s pretty incredible federal, state local levels US proven dysfunctional kleptocracy PIGS EU supposedly failed states propped Germany.

I truly believe US point return, federal government never able reform bureaucracy function. We’re going see 50 states break apart one way another.

 Either states going break form smaller countries (look governors realized early made regional coordinating groups help early on) simply devolves city city anarchy like we’re seeing riots autonomous zones. Lots examples history. Gonna fun time! love lawsuits concern outbreak 😂 USA!USA!USA! Nah, already knew this. mean least early 2016. count data, line PCRs.

I know single model trying use serological data moment unless came purpose-built random screen. data biased: That's Stanford Santa Clara study tried ended biased sample got ripped shreds.

As example, like taking poll Breitbart readers trying remove noise come unbiased nationwide poll: Sometimes data issue skewed use. racist exactly? fact mentions China? began?

Put back deck mate. virtue signal harder might punch hole atmosphere. agree 100%. Clear cut universal information based evidence based research given American people calm informative matter. Obviously accomplished are.... 5 million cases later American people still debating usage masks virus hoax amongst things. Clusterf*** sure. people Austria, Germany, UK, US Netherlands murdered people Sweden. Yeah it’s depressing. something magical workplace prevents spread?? 

It produces CEO bonuses, magically disappear workplaces stay empty. big threat bunch executive orders might illegal, best give 5 weeks mediocre unemployment benefits zero stimulus payments. blew negotiations.

However, that's take away fact UK handled pretty terribly well serious blunders response show governmental incompetence well cultural issues à la America. Even tiny little child roller coasters could kill someone hit head. comment wasn’t political.

But know people hate sub! ✌🏼 I’m guessing realized fake EO’s didn’t give bounce public opinion weekend back negotiations! buisness mandating masks enforcing them. fucking pr stunt not? risks late teenagers nearly zero, reasonable precautions profs fine well. Fellow Wisconsinite?  Ya sweet sweet crude small group people immensely profit shitpost article. “Let’s appeal machoism comply”.

Have seen pictures? Fat grey haired men... What’s even frustrating one seemed concerned spending money stockpiling controversial drug ventilators? lab could used future expands scientific endeavors? spend unknown amount money warp speed expand labs needed testing? listen - link would help

It looks like based Berlin, die Covid-19-Epidemie Deutschland erreichte, hat das Land schnell und gut reagiert. kaum einer anderen großen Industrienation sind wenige Menschen der Krankheit gestorben. Diese erste Welle haben wir besser als viele andere kontrollieren können, weil wir früh testen konnten und zwischen Gesellschaft, Politik und den Infektionswissenschaften größeres Vertrauen herrschte als anderswo. Unser früher und kurzer Lockdown hat der Wirtschaft viel Schaden erspart. Nicht nur den USA kann man beobachten, zu frühe und dann wieder zurückgenommene Lockerungen für die Wirtschaft bedeuten”


Yes Germany well! critique America organizational failure. Germany better data. Point 7 took german research. Hey look everyone, fragility article talks about

Right time right place bud passing eastern TN late last week. Stopped get gas, saw masks all. even hanging ears. Sheetz employees....not mask sight. thinking along lines frontline worker healthcare ie nurse, doc involved Covid treatment. Yeah kinda true except loses deadliness region time doesn’t kill anymore matter restrictions region Trump looking like figurehead passing day. disinformation. federal government prevented NY using labs test, seeding vulnerable communities silently. time things hit south, demo shifted younger population doctors knew treatment. FL TX track higher per capita mortality nursing homes NY time epidemic subsides, regardless advantages (lower population density, time prepare, testing, etc.) I'm really sure youre trying achieve here. Well thats depressing. 

Again Sweden needs severe fucking consequences shit. murdered people Sweden people countries aswell. 😂 man people imbeciles. utter bullshit. Maybe newest trains one ride along time ago AC barely works. going ride train anytime soon. Hey even though buckeye fan, still think UM 2016 bad spot 4th conversion JT Barret. comment responding stated “NO ONE” goes US healthcare false. Saudi Royals well 100k-200k annual figure pieces evidence dispute claim. 

Also provide evidence US hospitals butcher shop quality (whatever means)? mean. already are? suggested learn Spanish Mandarin second language YEARS. like graduated high school 20 years ago Mandarin recommended due business world. 

Why education bad? Please explain. I’ll wait. Sounds like failed geography nation refusing take seriously can't exactly described good. fact USA leader encouraged anti shutdown protests astounding. Yet Liberals every day 3 months tens thousands packed like sardines refusing social distance. science deniers seem think covid doesn’t infect people virtuous cause protest rioting. certainly could super spreaders. I’ve read comment Youtube someone said one grandparents died Covid-19, conspiracy theorist told investigation wasn’t virus doesn’t exist. Yeah, lived state pretty damn well versus vast majority states. But, know, send em school! democrats want (and passed). 
We know Trump objects to:

* funding states (because states currently need ""blue"")

* post office help aid election.

* wants new FBI center re-built (just happens across street hotel)
  
Summary Democrats plan below:
Among things, bill

* provides FY2020 emergency supplemental appropriations federal agencies;
* provides payments assistance state, local, tribal, territorial governments;
* provides additional direct payments $1,200 per individual;
* expands paid sick days, family medical leave, unemployment compensation, nutrition food assistance programs, housing assistance, payments farmers;
* modifies expands Paycheck Protection Program, provides loans grants small businesses nonprofit organizations;
* establishes fund award grants employers provide pandemic premium pay essential workers;
* expands several tax credits deductions;
* provides funding establishes requirements COVID-19 testing contact tracing;
* eliminates cost-sharing COVID-19 treatments;
extends expands moratorium certain evictions foreclosures; and
* requires employers develop implement infectious disease exposure control plans.

The bill also modifies expands wide range programs policies, including regarding

* Medicare Medicaid,
* health insurance,
* broadband service,
* medical product supplies,
* immigration,
* student loans financial aid,
* federal workforce,
* prisons,
* veterans benefits,
* consumer protection requirements,
* U.S. Postal Service,
* federal elections,
* aviation railroad workers, and
* pension retirement plans. Brain trembles. 2020. year. nazi. Thank opinion. Care explain opinion ridiculous you?  total number tests matter, especially countries keep catching covid cases coming yours. weird though. Normally, would experience onset brain inflammation. grew get vaccine shots ESME brain inflammation ESME cause deadly. However, gets critical experience dizziness, possibly nausea, vision might impacted things like that. 

So listen body symptoms related brain inflammation. fact decently treatable death might preventable. Likely, thought mentioned video felt fine quarantine. Perhaps ""fine"" merely ""bearable"".

Makes sad read stories like these. Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh south got hit. every state hit time, cases trending back across sunbelt Midwest without ever reaching levels New York handled “well” did. agree Democrats could much effective Republicans would stop blocking them. Difference? wear masks. 

California comparable mask orders long longer.

Like said, let's check back next March see things tally then. put perspective Maryland usually around many tests day, sit around 500-750 positive. self-centric sociopath rule country? see that....hahaha. functioning healthcare system, boy, blow repair buildings destroyed, maybe finance insurgency groups mistake (WHOOPISE) country almost two decades now. ok begin with, bc shut EARLY compared places, reopened, way fast. population huge. worker protections good bosses decide be... places pretty dang safe, (bc started.)

 every state , regardless leadership, still problem strong weakest link terms deal this. Democrats also cave money pressure... death threats anti maskers Orange County.

 Oh also... testing setup pretty solid April/May. Since gotten harder harder schedule test data mess. Bureaucratic nightmares exist everywhere country right now, especially bc basically national plan strategy. Everyone own. mean, foundation running 20 years focus public health diseases. time learn new field sir. /s I’ll take step further, right thing student UNDOUBTEDLY saved countless lives. want go church, go! sign waiver saying reject medical treatment 'god take care you.' exactly it. Nova Scotia took much firmer stance they're virtually back normal now.

When BC originally took stance enforce rules, cases going rate far zero, hard argue stance. Now, people proved can't trusted make right decisions, enforce grounds ""we gave chance ruined it."" There's much longer govt run ""be good citizen"" routine gets hand.

I think hefty deterrents people caught hosting parties breaking rules.

What dont get, aggravating part me, people followeed rules short time, go back normal faster. want party? Cool. Wait 3 months abide proper social distancing rules party heart's content. Can't bothered wait 3 months, well large gatherings allowed 6 months plus. Like difficult understand?

Its like experiment give child gummy bear say dont eat 5 minutes get another gummy bear. can't dont possess cognitive ability understand delayed reward. essentially people breaking rules smarter child.  I've noticed many Americans think ""we best healthcare world"" get sick, doctors save them. little need watch weight, salt intake, alcohol intake, worry infectious diseases. die. happens people worse places. like say data reported weeks There's difference racism satire petal. 

Racism believe it.

Playing stereotypes satirical comedy done years. 

Look South Park, Adult Swim. 

So, small following; I'm independent creator, got someone stereotypical Chinese accent made fun Chinese President way, people (Including myself) Trump time okay accuse racist? 

Please, take hand arse remember baby, china numba one. Finland didn’t open Sweden. However, can’t stop nationals going there. god protect them. /s. Fucking idiots. know shortage enough one lab completely cancel contract state Arkansas labs, including hospitals, running far fewer tests capacity run. governor indicated nationwide problem, state specific. think might easier people see positive results mask-wearing. state rural enough limit communicability *just little* masks indoor gathering policies, nearly stops virus tracks.

In addition, seems above-average sense personal responsibility compared parts country. I'm ""essential worker"" must travel (domestically) extensively work, I'm able compare real-time. I'm Corona ""hot spots"" multiple times per week. mind-blowing seeing people RESTAURANTS towns 20% positivity rate. get it, good business. But, using GrubHub Uber Eats, much less chance perpetuating spread. open window, schools anything like la schools, can't open windows much. basically admitted get around putting heppa filters, means hvac updates.

If cleaning classrooms hygiene theater, temperature checks? random temperature checks, purpose? Yup. Owning libtards. one afford 8 wives meth addictions? Must loaded and/or fundamental Mormon Walter White. Technically, droplets school suspension. Shooting second concern? 🤔 tried proactive acne once. Irritated fuck skin. 

Ever since proactive anything life. reactive Except *federal fucking government* taken stance science, rational thought, safety guidelines prevent schools reopening. picture America care live die. ghetto poleizi Jared’s goal. Make everyone else look good New Yorkers die. reincarnation Hitler. virus burning expected. Mods seem care, hear though. Okay, say? wrong approach ensure virus widespread within population? I'm confused. vaccine hypothetically never comes (or takes long time), think countries say 'screw it' let burn population, matter risks? still know everything makes virus tick, right? Sounds like scary gamble me. one cares fake concept freedom. Universal healthcare real freedom pandemic. Australians worry medical bills get sick. report 722,285 deaths 19,462,112, 3.7% Well need filter least pandemic isnt matter opinion.

We don’t need entertain people “think differently”. Also, fact religion absolutely nothing save anyone help anything can’t suppressed basically

In addition Aarhus Ringsted, authorities focus Silkeborg, Glostrup, Nyborg, Solrød Sorø.

756 confirmed infected coronavirus past week, says Minister Health Magnus Heunicke (S) press conference .

- **The big question whether reason worried, say yes.**

The authorities focus particular Aarhus Ringsted, also Silkeborg, Glostrup, Nyborg, Solrød Sorø, 20 infected per 100,000 inhabitants.

In Silkeborg, worrying trend , says Magnus Heunicke. Therefore, requirement face mask public transport also introduced here, also encouraged wear face mask in, example, shopping centers.

- Viruses motion society, says Minister Health.

*Here hardest hit municipalities Denmark: [chart]*

Seven municipalities 20 infected per 100,000 inhabitants . country, would discouraged traveling there. infection pressure, also called contact number Denmark, also increased recently 1.4.

This means corona infected person passes virus 1.4 people average.

#Virus never disappeared

Director Søren Brostrøm National Board Health makes clear virus never disappeared society, says recommendations face masks expanded, but:

- important say. never solution, supplement. good cloth face mask better face mask, want lot people use face mask, says.

The outbreak Silkeborg associated outbreak Aarhus, says Acting Director Danish Agency Patient Safety, Anette Lykke Petri.

- Silkeborg delimited, Aarhus infection spread municipality. arisen private parties, workplaces on, says Anette Lykke Petri.

#Press conference status infection

Present press conference Minister Health Magnus Heunicke (S), Minister Transport Benny Engelbrecht (S), Director Søren Brostrøm, National Board Health , Professional Director Kåre Mølbak, Statens Serum Institut, Acting Director Anette Lykke Petri, National Agency Patient Safety National Police Chief Thorkild Fogde, National Police. 

The press conference announcement come wake weeks number infections Denmark risen sharply.

During past 24 hours , 76 cases coronavirus registered Denmark , decrease compared figures Sunday Saturday, 128 169, respectively.


It especially infection Aarhus worries authorities, politicians experts. 76 new registered cases infection, 40 registered Aarhus.

The increased number infections Aarhus has, among things, meant requirement wear bandage public transport.

As map shows, however, also many infected Ringsted recently. [see map article]

The Danish Crown's slaughterhouse city hit hard outbreak. approximately 850 employees, 142 found infected, Saturday led Danish Crown close slaughterhouse week send employees week self-isolation. Here's latest case/death charts running 7-day averages cases deaths recently turned down. interesting see continues. 

Florida currently 38.17 deaths per 100k population. could reason wear public transport Aarhus, Silkeborg, Odder, Horsens, Skanderborg og Favrskov. recommend shopping centers well. Rest Denmark still general recommendation public transport. Oh yeah. understand that. looked trends. example. pneumonia trends per year extremely stable. year much much different...in half time. Lol based rhetoric I’m going wager spend wayy much time reading internet. enjoy poetic fear mongering though, keep 👍 Okay link quoting? Source means, tell find talking about. lots viruses cause inflammatory reactions inside nose lead lessening olfactory smell, neurons... thats broad statement. actual data shows 60 years younger .0002% chance mortality covid 19, 42% deaths elderly nursing homes 
people pre existing conditions. Dr Fauci said multiple times majority people fine covid 19, well cdc, numerous doctors around world. downplaying virus, bad nowhere near trying claim is. BLACK DEATH. even close. Positive going down. Good sign ""now I'm fucking casket coughin (coffin)"" Greta got called lot legitimate reasons, write speeches, control social media, follow practices. Went complaining single use packaging taking picture surrounded junk food said packaging. People called puppet. However mean deserved threats aimed way. 

This girl exposed serious health issue school getting death threats.  Anyone insight cases decreasing Florida California? policy changes people taking mask thing seriously? even harder breathe keep head submerged water. add extra layer protection wrap mouth nose duct tape cover head plastic bag. 

But could also purposely restrict airflow make conform desired false reality difficult wear mask properly. Well win win race killing people New York holds crown double state 3 times state New Jersey

They chance learn mistakes New York made March/April, March/April NY like many states countries surprised pandemic, enough masks, equipment, hospital rooms, many medical professionals prepared, protocols treatment plans adjusted fly, etc. Florida got hit later mask shortage longer issue, ER care doctors protocols knowledge many months pandemic experience NY, NJ, etc. Europe. Much easier contain deal decease. NY learned lesson, changed strategy, implemented mask mandates, etc. situation improved drastically. basically foregone conclusion concerning local outbreaks going on, still nice see right decisions made. Additionally, lot chatter rollback current limit (nothing official yet though). Yeah, house vote live stream YouTube. PPE question could supplied Canada, certainly working turning hostile nation. sure communist part. Well China builds outbreak hospital days city isolated rest China need smart know something up. Try locking thousands people USA like Vietnam Muh Freedum's crowd would load trucks guns ammo take state capitals. would rather spend fortune car repairs, everyone able fix car. I'm horrible working tools anything handy, I've accepted I'll never one people who's good that. even tools space work wanted to. everyone pays car repairs they're lazy. Motorcycle super spreader event? nobody cares giant protests/riots going fo last 3 months tens thousands people bunched like sardines standing shoulder shoulder ZERO social distancing, ZERO hand washing many people wearing masks wearing incorrectly?
The scientists doctors say way stop spread stay home unless absolutely go things like groceries medicine. get together large groups matter what. Always social distance wear mask. 

Despite media politicians say special caveat BLM protests riots. Covid pandemic doesn’t magically skip virtuous protesting. pixie dust barrier forms around rioters virus believes cause. science denying media, politicians social media political radicals take hypocritical stance possible claiming BLM protests/riots aren’t couldn’t possibly spread covid every small gathering gym opening super spreader that’s trying kill grandmothers. 

If large groups social distancing spreads covid can’t make exception political protests/riots agree with. likely top reason pandemic grown continued spread. Governors mayors gym owners arrested opening business even though enforce social distancing cleaning rules allow thousands “protestors” break social distancing rules day every day. completely ignored post. scientist, picks data seems support conclusion. 

Also, tell that, insecure? school trolls. Sorry snide comments talking about? Snide style suspect may misinterpreted something.

I still want news, scientific research, I'm aware subreddit primarily kind news I'm looking for. #Translation:

The ceiling assemblies remains 100 people far.

Meetings 100 people allowed Saturday otherwise planned.

Here, ceiling number people allowed assemble raised current 100 200.

But part reopening put hold due rising infection rates recent days weeks.

Therefore, government believe present right raise assembly ban 100 200.

This stated Ministry Health press release. 

- epidemic increasing globally several places Europe, recently seen increase number Danes infected coronavirus. crucial maintain good position Denmark in, epidemic control, says Minister Health Magnus Heunicke (S) press release.

- Therefore, government believe present right raise assembly ban 100 200, continues.

The decision comes academic director Statens Serum Institut (SSI) Kåre Mølbak Tuesday said recommend opening society time.

#Support Folketing [parliament]

Unity List, DF SF also announced would like see people wait raise limit.

- situation number infected increases infection spreads. Therefore, also think makes sense send political signal step little limit, says Unity List's health spokesman, Peder Hvelplund.

The Conservatives also objection decision.

- increasing infection pressure, must course lighten foot accelerator moment ensure open absolutely necessary, says party's health policy spokesman, Per Larsen.

- infection spreads further, may risk slow earnest, certainly need business industry. think makes lot sense.
#Can hit lectures jogging

When agreement assembly ban entered 8 June, press release stated plan ceiling raised 200 people 8 August, 'if things continue go well'.

Should epidemic flare again, says 'a tightening assembly ban one first things look at'.

Had assembly ban raised 200 people, would possible organizers covered so-called sector partnership guidelines hold events 200 participants.

It could, example, event standing reception , lecture, museum events small athletic run 200 people.

Organizers covered sector partnership guidelines may, however, already today still like hold events 500 people primarily sit comply distance requirements - seated concert.

For private events, recommended limit also remain 100 people. However, legal requirement.

The government meet 12 August parliamentary parties negotiations phase 4 reopening. According plan, nightlife venues allowed open, Minister Health already announced opening hanging thin thread.

No one questions  Victoria lockdown. pretty strict restrictions travel states looser restrictions states social distancing hygiene recommendations.

Western Australia pretty loose nightclubs, gyms bars open reduced 2 square metre rule (2 square metres per person including staff unless venue holds 500 patrons).

Queensland nightclubs businesses re-opened one person every 4 square metres, 2 square metres smaller venues 50, venues 500 needing level government approval depending size. Seated service re-imposed recently though.
South Australia tightened restrictions little precaution limiting household visitors 10 restricting service bars seated patrons.

Sweden like small pizza bakery every little city area. local place one guy working takes orders, makes pizza serves it. guess comes contact lot people work day. indoors well.

Bus drivers. Sweden everybody needs show blip ticket bus driver see it. Also lot questions drivers.

Well, becoming banana republic, no? 😉 need lockdown measures people disobey guidelines. bad country cases Covid doesn’t give fuck cooperation. ""herd immunity"" fancy way saying failing.

It's simple piece cloth. six feet distance. eating outside restaurants going crowded bars. everyone things could open could send kids back school.

Edit: forgot add number Civil War Imagine masculinity threatened mask False premise.  Face covering protect anyone, especially close proximityfor minutes. POPULATION wears face coverings, transmission rate lowered.

We need get correct thinking society sustain kind protective measures. 

We need think mask wearing like public exposure radiation. public exposed TIME, exposure levels restricted.

The limiting factors exposure time, distance, shielding.  Much collecting enough viral bodies transition exposure infection. take polls. virus faded across hard hit areas.

No hard hit region resurgence all.

So doom gloom. silver linings... hopefully materialize. like country bases decisions crystal ball?

Come man, think clear said anything like that. approved test then.

Why? point sensitivity specificity independent variables, FDA require approval tests. Producing example approved test totally irrelevant point. I'm claiming source datasheets expert particular test, I'm making fairly elementary argument tests general. harmful asking approved test?

Nothing, reason asking one. asking support argument, asking google something you. unreasonable is, I'm fucking sucker arguing internet, anyway. 


From FDA FAQ coronavirus FDA issued 200 Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) tests . **EUAs allow emergency use tests** COVID-19 emergency FDA determines certain criteria met. criteria **include test may effective diagnosing** detecting antibodies COVID-19 known potential benefits outweigh known potential risks.

Here datasheet [Quest Diagnostic's Qualitative Real-Time RT-PCR \(Test Code published FDA. Again, literally first result google search ""coronavirus test fda approved"". hard find, choosing search it. 

Here FDA's [current policy approval including email address one request EUA approval. 

Here example [a test Chembio Diagnostic Systems authorization unreliable.

If seen movie yet, highly recommend interesting similar people really sometimes despite moral arguments try use prop better party. Lol military would likely refuse ordered instead coup. Pointless rule ashes. universal healthcare cost trillions clearly unaffordable. Yes, please swallow gravity without consulting doctor. long charge, get control. people like Scott Gottlieb finally started admit: virus going burn next months.

A vaccine probably going come well faded away.  average vaccine takes decade develop.

Much due fact proper testing inherently requires extended period time.

I'm eager believe time different, particularly pushed claimed would miraculously go away April. things can't hurried without consequences match. 4-6 weeks. clearly know talking about. can't narrow science want be. Furthermore, data used incorrectly assume death rate 5.5% also based statistics. Honestly, helped ease mine. I've one lucky ones working home.

You're actually quite American right now. revision facts, order make US look nice hindsight, American thing (and actually common liberals, conservatives ""proud"" violence/racism/etc)

In 2015 poll, Americans claimed opposed Iraq war 2003: 47/38% oppose/support 
But actual data 2003, ratio 34/63% oppose/support illegal US invasion Iraq announced, support whopping [72% claimed, democrats likely lie republicans (30% vs 20%). thinking country united behind 

This false, **the country behind Bush.** people likely deny reality guilt. 

I see many posters, especially r/politics (which consider good source news, read articles comments) thing. pretend Trump represents something new, America always fundamentally good, essence they're lying guilt. Gotta love Total Cases China practically unchanging since February. both? realize part problem playing tribalism focusing one party. two party system scourge. country divisive ever.

Death rate currently accepted roughly 0.2% especially factoring large number non-symptomatic infected. Still 10x worse seasonal flu. world.

It’s also phrased wrong title.. didn’t «die» Covid-19. long died would counted covid death, even truck ran died immediately upon impact. missed point. societies can't keep spawning multiple world wars, get act enlightened deaths per capita COVID 20% lower America.

I think that's quite long time. spanish flu years, we're even worst yet. I'm saying people classroom getting greater protection someone airplane recycling air 6+ hours. Classrooms reopen, airlines allow passengers wear masks. Look ""CDC excess deaths"". CDC website. ""excess death"" number far ~213,000. breached 200k week ago. look break weekly deaths state, matches almost perfectly outbreaks COVID-19. Like there's large spike deaths NYC around March-April almost spike now. there's large spike deaths Florida spike deaths March-April smaller. Quebec, business owners control kind behaviour, get fined.


The government basically transferred police work bar owners. 


Wouldn't want shoes, aggressive customers...


Now everybody needs bouncer... Thing is, anywhere near 50% closer 10%

*Society breaks 10%* I'm curious well. friend recovered, he's got side effects. Nothing major, he's noticeable change ability higher heart rate. works goes 150bpm stop says feels like he's gonna pass out. I've labeled/called drug addict friends family recently. I'm completely sober, last time drink back October 2019. can't extrapolate indefinitely. number people available infected goes down, rate infection goes down. That’s wild since family East Texas seen first hand little people respect guidelines there. Maybe area exception then. Memorial Day, state stay home order place. People supposed staying home. Gatherings 10 people law.

A veterans motorcycle group commemorative group ride every veteran's day. 10 them. blatant violation law. police fuck it.

The stay home order expired. order limiting gatherings expired. BLM want protest Floyd George killing. police come force riot gear tear gas. BLM breaking laws. think done Europe? 

This end beginning. No, not. kids primary school kindergarten. missinformation. change routines dramatically, true. One difference kindergarten everyone outside since start primary school. kindergarten teachers getting sick little high school teachers could mean infections happen home, way work shopping, kindergarten. EU relatives Florida ye funny actually funny idk damn Ok? also halfway total casualties US suffered WW2 governor WI state USA instituted mask order. half counties enforcing it. dollar store place town requiring masks. fucking Swedes better enter chat. Well... died *with* it. They've already made clear they're counting deaths unrelated. never fully properly shut down. had, like places did, would going back normal existence now, addition masks etc keep down. Ya dragging 10x longer needs be, ignorance alone it. economy also wrecked can’t get together get control. Would better get control people get work school. won’t get control like this. think it’s good economy hundreds thousands people die? answer no. It’s also good there’s much uncertainty. People don’t spend money. None super difficult I’m really shocked confusion. ""Nearly $20???""

""Hundred. 16 *hundred*. seventy-five."" purposeful. 3/4 prison already it, man dream, can't he? border closed best times literally shoot infected. would expect country better? \* thump * makes okay? feel you
 girlfriend gone groceries, always wearing n95 masks using hand sanitizer since March. bad live Florida, knows long gotta keep this. cannot even tell many people I’ve met truly believes coronavirus disappear election over.... truly dumbstruck people country. Protests important. dinosaur print?  Death rate still even 10th percent tho  guys agreeing, bud. That's like, crazy high, numbers people using initially broke Wuhan nobody knew talking about. spent little time googling recent rates could see streptococcus pneumoniae florida 2018. source years rates? rest world collectively shaking head. aware, americans?  mean he's entirely wrong. Look happened protests. media stopped giving damn Covid new juicy story cover. election likely same. matter wins think we're shit. Thinks closer 210k total excess deaths probably undercounting covid 40-50k. compare ""loss life years"".

That's ageist fuck dude. that, anyone thinks that's good idea needs talk long hard look reexamine morality. Life valuable many years left person life valuable *is*. give murderers pass victims already old. Ditto! presented data like (we know are) would call fake, using fearmongering. remembered Netherlands small, densely-populated country hit early. would fairer compare NY state Massachusetts whole USA.

Netherlands: 1 2780 
NY state: 1 590 
Massachusetts: 1 800. We're 60-some deaths 70+ million people Thailand; guess Thailand done even fantastic job.

It's contest; Thailand lucky, over-reacted appropriate way. unattributed deaths cases surely got through.

I really get point using basis nationalist sentiment, least impacted countries go great are, look others. Contexts like Olympics that.  Well it’s America. countries higher death rate.


1 every 1175 Belgians
1 every 1457 Brits
1 every 1485 Peruvians
1 every 1639 Spaniards
1 every 1718 Italians

BUT it’s going America lot countries trending down. CDC refers excess death count. interesting study New York shows probable significant undercounting COVID-19 deaths. us retail workers fucked. getting death rate 0.2%? Shouldn’t number deaths calculated number cases entire population living Americans?

At rate, I’m concerned fixation death rate going among pushing swifter reopening. strikes cavalier face still arguably unknown disease unknown long term complications. don’t think it’s unreasonable exercise extreme caution least effective available therapeutic treatment options. Maybe be. looks like Karen It’s still low number. Even positive cases low number compared total population.

That must blatant lie i've ever seen =)

From i've seen LE using masks every time, though admittedly face shields kinda make likely.

On hand, ~50-70% mask coverage protests. fantastic. significant portion people wearing stream.

Keep mind masks make immune. reduce risk exposure. Clamping together days weeks opposed risk factor. mask, partially completely invalidate due length exposure &amp; distance infected people.

Doesn't take big brain understand protests directly contradictory lockdown order, especially gross doublethink media, praised ""protests"" riots, condemning white house meetings, anti-mask protests people wanting go back work.

You condemn gatherings, none. per capita places? 5 million 1.25% 400 million. European country close total population US. needs put foot down.

(Of course, help ""Leader Free World"" refuses wear one he, himself, incredibly weak insecure.) thing made clear article written people like you. That's little overkill. like putting solitaire confinement. close damn restaurants cause care rules cause way going followed. place I've seen actually enforce mask rule Costco. Everyone else ""requires"" actually anything it. wearing urban sombrero really man all? mother, EVOL BOOMER, worked ass life nothing show end slow death.

Did even read article? easy think nice sentiment, data proves objectively untrue. enjoyed significantly lower cost living much higher wages, benefits, social programs -- eliminated reaped benefits of. Fine me, want part generational wars. I'm participating stupid hate blamefest. people power pulling strings, everyone else trying get live lives.

That's fair, people rise power own. ran selfish policies voted in, ballots commerce -- primarily one generation. next season chance. I'm sure NFL still going find way even year scout well. going give entire season drafting kids playing year.
 
And ultimately, chance someone make safe everyone. Sorry. Life bites sometimes. Literally. Oh compare states countries suits you? Typical. Correction....fragile, inconsiderate, entitled  Yes. That's friends done. cheap flights Zoom, there's need city friends more. risk bringing politics mix, may confounding factor. Supporters President Trump likely men woman large margin (""gender gap""). Supporters President Trump may less likely wear masks listening signals gave early (when refused wear mask first months recommended) listen right wing media outlets tend discount magnitude pandemic discount importance masks. I'm going continue watch world criticize isolate safety home. Every country struggling virus. Even ones like Japan much better masks usage. mindset taken far become harmful

You could almost say becomes...extreme? think taking extremely simplistic black white view complicated piece history. American revolutionaries politically racially diverse group included noble ignoble men. Similarly, republic built deeply flawed still substantially absolute monarchy. Look everyone, idiot village (Retstortion) say something moronic! Bless downvote show appreciation! And, turns right, info today higher figures days. link horseshit isn’t backed studies - read it? Heads lads, we've got ten man bomber remove tho?

Oh know! Maybe invent virus vaccine actually microchips people makes die? 

/s bet love recording absurd interactions Chick-fil-A. How's homemade swastika mask coming along? Sandy Hook parents, 9/11 victims families, WTF wrong w/ right wing bozos? Foxnews? talking to? obese. don’t agree assessment. work science well aware errors colleagues make. article playing speculation proven can’t point. Here’s interesting thought, indulge: think likes Timothy McVey would able pull OKC bombing age internet? wrote whole paper Mass Killings class last semester, operated deep right-wing fringe groups. Groups strong online presence today. 

I hard time believing that, modern society, specifically someone like McVey would able pull attack. problem is, many people US, caring Corona means wearing mask, among things. that's one problem. wish Americans ""don't care"" least like you. they're worse, much worse.

Also, point out, corona killed 4 times yearly amount deaths car crashes, year even yet. anyway let us know findings observe. experience opportunities India different, necessarily better. India country bootstring entrepreneurs. Everybody brother tiny business trying grow expand. cost entry low, lack regulations nearly nonexistent enforcement existing regulations. mean run ads metro encouraging people pay income taxes.

Opportunities America much higher cost entry. educational financial. ultimate potential much greater.

Basically ladder India short, anybody start climbing it. ladder America tall, first rungs missing. opportunities countries, different types. really liked government pays extra $600 everyone unemployment. take consideration us labeled ""essential workers"" pandemic. know job thankful. pisses someone makes sitting home, working. covid effected personally, yes! quarantine 14 days. ***A lone banjo distance starts playing*** Sturgis. good fun. Ate yesterday. really nice especially since rare thing days.  Americans always selfish racism largely hidden outsiders Trump elected normalized it, always there. Almost 1/2 voters okay open racism misogyny foreign election interference Trump promised meant might harm Americans.

You least 50 percent Americans care less Americans winning. crazy, saw news New Zealand new local cases 100 days. can't even imagine US. I'm reminded Greg Proops comedy bit... 

(paraphrased)

They celebrate Thanksgiving England, call Thanksgiving. called ""F\*ck off, Puritan"" Day. knew this. even rewarded. better? Get work pay. kills true is. 😭 chronic fatigue symptom covid, sign recovery/post-covid, please. Would appreciate anybody sharing situation experienced/are experiencing currently. case people general. trust familiarity issue. Great... conservatives gonna read double down. 

“I’ll show fragile inconsiderate! ‘Murica!” part people understand US 'different kind European country'.

United States, following free market system produced far prosperity talent pool, IQ levels, lifestyle choices would allow it. punches way means, end comes 'rich third world country' rather 'crazy first world country'. said I'd happy look data come conclusion. Region 1 person Bolivia basically responsible 1000 cases+. First infected whole company he/she worked whole nightclub basically. went wild there. Surprised took long.. Sean Hanity approves message! Growing shadow 9/11 used always think American spirit really showed times true crisis. ability mobilize work something could proud of. 

But now, don’t really see US anything special. Cost living low sure medical costs high. 

Ive studying prob gonna move somewhere else next five years result sorts small things. Would mind sharing kind material used, one might order it? example name would use find Amazon? said NBA, NHL MLB gonna play though.... vaccine 75% effective measures like social distancing enforced masks absolutely go away.

The virus getting eradicated. 75% population immune would herd immunity levels would mean hospital surges deaths similarly greatly reduced become accepted like flu deaths. Yep, daughter's school Virginia plans open come hell high water even though three nearby counties going 100% virtual.

Oh, sign waiver school responsible contracts Covid. sound like admission can't protect her. Na, Americans argue anything everything. national past time. united thing argue us whole nother ballgame Customers must also wear face coverings time servers, bussers, personnel approach table.""

Um waitstaff need trained come asking everything put biggest scoop food mouth. Yes, let's real: picked newspaper ages. politically informed. would like people think are, without put effort evaluating current political landscape, lazy-as-shit ""both sides"" BS comes from. looked us before. Nothing new. he's beloved actor brought millions people happiness work, millions people would sad died. new planet?

Also entire sub full articles dangers school reopenings?

Two things true time? Perfect description governor’s head.  Auto-Mod previously deleted posts using political terminology. insult could use little work though. Damn... really liked band too. Why'd gotta go stupid now? user said, Russia huge part two different continents, European side way smaller Asian one, fair that’s citizens are.

So idea guy trying say, Russian cases counted towards Europe’s total be. world family, America would loud, obnoxious cousin tells racist jokes, tries sell everyone new startup idea coughs food disappearing silverware. whole life wanted ninja wear mask. get to. don’t get it... cost promoting anti-collectivism letting corporations run amok, destroying trust scientific authority figures keep making breakfast candy/using asbestos/pressure cooking planet money. bunch people help trust scientists doctors. Prime prey foreign power infiltrate media sow discord.

Obviously everyone, way way many. well past tipping point seems. mean, they’re still coronavirus deaths many could prevented healthier lifestyle. 

People healthy weight seem much better odds obese. IMO, shouldn’t deny fat seems significantly increase chances dying COVID. 

And, it’s worth, obesity causes approx, 300,000 deaths US every year. So, COVID obviously big deal, obesity epidemic. Let’s stop normalizing fat. I'm sure certain ""weakness"" factor big part anti-masking tribalism, included political views, well anti-vaxers hoax believers. firmly believe ""mach-man"" theory plays tiny role biggest influece tribalism That's on-brand conservatives going TUM foreign friends/colleagues taking path right now. someone relapse mean duration also ""reinfected"". sounds weird. want approval matter crazy sound. dad believes 5G thing. move talking weather. countries realize there’s world country everyone’s actions impacts rest us less. bands suck imo God depressing. Shameful. can’t wrap head around badly US fucked up. Things getting worse too, sad. Donald Trump elected knw something pretty wrong US, longer power opinion kept intensifying. Covid handled, im sure Trump gonna re-elected one massive shitshow. slightly arrogant think grow way. Nature laws. curve new infections. Obviously. Drops like rock holiday starts, picks finished.

If right new infections creep steadily. update cases several days. makes quite suspicious. oh gonna trump aliens attack friend absence rapid testing aggressive contact tracing airlines zero incentive make flying safer. know highly unlikely anyone flies comes covid able pinpoint source infection. got plane, also travelled went airport, baggage claim etc. 

Airlines realize traveling inherently UNSAFE cleaning pretend band aid anyways cuts profits. Gabe Newell chose right time visit Hobbiton. Racially diverse? Really? RACIALLY diverse? call Founding Fathers US A, racially diverse? white caucasian. 

There even case made spaniard portugese among them, case would something case. Let alone someone mixed heritage gods beware black indian man. 
So yeah... racially diverse not. 
And even political diversity went far. Although front things got bit interesting, that's sure. shocking news sun rise tomorrow morning. Europeans love drag America they’re acting ignorant US is. even America stupid. It’s generalization. #antiAmericanism Death rate per capita Cali Canada. metric matters. anything lead food colorings? mean youre trying control nation actively make dumber. 

No need poison them. make person stupid without harming body putting anything food.

All need get early childhood. United States good we've even implemented mass production system. Think next time hear plan get children public school year earlier still.

Stupid people vote right way. Stupid people buy stuff shovel them. Stupid people fight wars want fought. Stupid people invaluable (to some). UK same. Even employers shops super markets like Asda wear masks, even though became mandatory since 24th July. hormonal swings -- yes, men get them.

Women already know this. knowing quit long time. can’t even begin wrap mind around idea life ordinary again. sounds ridiculous. fuck people 20 hours unpaid work every week?!

I 37.5 hours I'm ever late manager starts complaining telling log off! TIL like bubblegum pop harsh US, dumb people everywhere. It’s news. It’s categorized such. seems general phenomenon Reddit. 50% users non-American, international opinion strong influence here, sadly US image considerably degraded last decades, hence constant negativity.

Also users relatively young, seems many young Americans frustrated country views closer Europeans, Canadians Australians. That’s probably leads Europe/Canada/Australia taken model watch emulate. mean *are* idiots though that's fail. NBA player left bubble went strip club Atlanta. Like 1/3 Marlins went fucking party season fucked. NFL players NBA &amp; MLB combined. way hold together 4-6 months. lowest case since Whitehouse took control CDC data.

Weird, think know anyone died virus. Yes, that's issue hand.  without accounting density, social life, *bunch* factors, no. I'm American talking America. 

That study differentiate asymptomatics mild cases, although I've come expect fearmongering disingenuous arguments like sub. 3500 deaths state 10 million people, 80% deaths nursing homes, unfortunate, warrant shutting rest country. many people going die anyway near future? Sorry bro, elderly sick people die illness time. sucks families, going beach restaurant affect that. 

The virus isn’t going away anytime soon. stay locked forever? Fake news /s Well may turning normie-spreader University researchers used optical imaging approach — involving laser camera — test differences effectiveness 14 types face coverings, including N95 masks, surgical masks, knitted masks, cotton masks, bandanas gaiters. study’s goal demonstrate simply setup constructed, findings worth noting, particularly problematic nature researchers found neck gaiter — sun-protection staple never designed intended coronavirus-fighting measure — actually disperses largest respiratory droplets multiple smaller droplets, stay airborne longer large droplets sink faster. words, speaking one masks seems create lighter, longer-lasting, virus-carrying army.

I'd like see studies maybe health officials steer people away gaiters towards scarves, bandannas, disposable masks especially since get pack 50 $10 production caught up.

We're nowhere close proper estimates worldwide deaths covid19. 

We've yet even include unexpected cardiovascular deaths calculation, though bet OP would demand included covid19 death calculations. threshold covid19 people like OP always extremely conservative influenza death extremely liberal. they're compared comparing confirmed vs high estimate possible, declaring we're panicking.

But nature deception: half truths deceit. guess I'm dumb understand comment trollish. Check state data. 

Just google (Insert: State) COVID Dashbord.

Arizona's hospitalization's 3517 July 13.

Arizona's COVID-19 hospitalizations 56% 5 weeks.

I use Arizona drastic. states (Like Texas) like 15-25% last month. still even remotely close carnage flu seasons 50s 60s.

I look like menacing beast 3M FF-402. Shutting portions economy prevent collapse healthcare multiple countries. said, US wrong. Shutdowns occurred hot spots opposed nationwide. Obviously, hindsight 20/20 I'm blaming anyone.

Thank you, yes, pray. swear fuck, run pasta America, study become political legend save world one noodle time Although fairness know nothing whatsoever long term implications happens hospital systems simply fail leading lack emergency care. even know sure virus prevents reinfection, much like flu. know pretty high confidence tested positive, direct death rates make worse odds roulette, final audit taken historians, even 1% hits whole population, that's 350k people dead. That's 9/11 several times week heading back daily figure. 

We may discovered things reduce direct mortality rate, that's looking one hopeful figure instead shitty overall picture average reduced lifespans lower quality life. Thank you! loss taste/smell almost nose congestion, I'm pretty sure that's is.

It’s selfish, worried “rights”, overly patriotic, don’t care ruining everything rest us.

They embarrassed they’re doing. Yes - insisting sign reopening plans, less month NYS plans completed yet many areas, thorough reviews going be? state DOE really going hold district reopening based feedback plan submitted two weeks they're bound open?

I agree end poorly, economic impact going worse half-assed attempt failure would delayed yet carefully calculated reopening. human impact sadly much worse. Brainwashed lol matter remember Trump not, America elect another egotistical dotard again. Hell, Trump still might win election don’t get vote.

It’s longer words typed Internet. chance vote focus. 

Get friends registered vote informed. lots reasons could happen. single case might exposed everyone small amount virus. knows. know asymptomatic people exist. probably driven range factors - pre-existing immunity exposure dose two big ones. Honestly numbers continue stay low. think New Yorkers saw bad get best keep largely well said. stripped veil America exposed complexity problems politicians try cover la la land USA. Cute. I’ve lived worked three continents countries probably count. eyes open. buddy Texas saying gonna blow November election. 

It’s show people, nothing worry about! /s thinking thing. Even stop gap partial vaccine. I'll look vaccine candidates using attenuated inactivated cold coronavirus, they're not, maybe someone should. believe candidate farthest along, Oxford Univ, uses attenuated genetically modified chimp adenovirus cold virus base, Covid's spike proteins shunted onto it, far lay understanding comprehends. anti maskers throw trash anyway. donate useless stuff? Also said anything conspiratorial aside media media sell news lol sells more? bigger number, saying ICU beds max capacity conveniently saying many ICU beds hospital trauma center. Absolutely wear mask fully support it, also fully support social distancing.  bugs me. It’s US idiots. way people wearing masks sub would lead believe recent numbers seem prove that. Please hold raffle.  think Gates longtime philanthropist considerably huger interest pandemic average billionaire. People following leader. (Not much one.) Sorry luck😔. UK Sweden great, too. Anyone wants president ulterior motives, disqualifed. need find better way find draft leaders. So, absence better guidance, think respecting CDC guideline 5% positivity rate makes sense. threshold admittedly arbitrary maybe lower least protocol.

Theres trust military police America. would riots. possible. going work distrust police? would absolute mess. Add prove whether went deliver groceries. never able stop small gatherings less 5 America. wasn’t denier. Maybe actually read article commenting. Also keep mind sometimes, know it’s wild theory, news headlines aren’t entirely truthful.  flip-side, money put aside sounds like something lot Americans would wishing right now. clear. one got reinfected.  doctors greedy. mad hospital administration creeped authority drains healthcare system. anger misplaced. Gotta love it. ""*The thing worse talked talked about*"" known Singapore hast absolute fatality rate 0.0005%? So, done countries?

The steps Singapore took well documented.

I know every country city sized island peninsula another country bridged shut down.

I know countries want follow measures.

The ""circuit breaker'' sounds fun.

Maybe politicians scared enforce them.

Maybe citizens refuse submit.  sad. go much, weird feeling do. wear mask, try following arrows. need respect other. ❤️😊 trying malign people work. get point workload doable reasonable period time? won’t Well, UK 'B' ark folks. nursing assistant wearing mask pandemic? That’s definition dumb someone known better.  No. do, I'll extremely disappointed. Bars open right now; restaurants, open, need rigorously maintained social distancing procedure.

Let’s stay safe hold reason shall we. 
Let’s turn play hands fear machine. 
Peace brothers sisters! Americans also individual disregard health. Look obesity disease rates. personally think one steps better healthcare America cultural awakening comes owning personal responsibility bodies well being. accomplished, know. love feel good stories. Hilarious. live one liberal states country (NY) going back person school. country never shut again. wont happen get here? Common fking sense lost called best country world. 30% though. yikes. 50 people owning it. far none stepped fixed health care system failing infrastructure tho.... thought answer pretty obvious now, goes back president. beginning he's lied danger, precautions, recently said children immune. Plus reason, Karens think wearing mask violates ""rights"" ... Oh 20 something guy yesterday asked ""wearing Muslim shit"" jeans, t-shirt, mask. assume meant mask.

So, stupidity. entitlement. weird racist/superiority complex something? 

I even know anymore.

Nah, Trump Admin. decided give tax money away donors leave everyone else fend themselves. I've known people sick 20-25 years. Congestive heart failure, diabetes, etc, above. Covid could wipe people like out. people keep saying ""everything covid!"" resulting lack critical thinking skills

The education system, predominantly functioned last 50 years so, focused pushing kids away developing critical thinking skills favor enforcing ""obey authority"" mindset. Answers Joe Youtube. 100% going happen.

Consider Fall football officially canceled yet NFL Universities. going cancel lawyers finally getting tell schools play document ask players sign remove future liability.

Those players get many get sick. may die many long-term effects sue they're longer dumb 19yo kids 40yo men pain. 20 years we'll seeing Covid commercials like Asbestos, etc.

Yet, mostly canceled really want want want football. set us shit going normal ACTIVELY HELP MAKE NORMAL. longer don't, longer normal again. fucking insanity. Exactly. look around globe every country fucked comes nursing homes. anything shed huge light problems facilities face neglect huge. CDC estimates infection fatality rate (IFR) COVID-19 USA 0.0065, i.e. Right. every medication ever safe released. Vioxx, Accutane, Meridia, Thalomide... 

I'm pro-medication, extremely pro-vaccine. (med school effect). literally everything put body potential risks. claim otherwise anti-science, boldface lie. [Deaths likely underreported, point, 200,000 people likely died coronavirus, 160,000 figure.

We'll find precisely months/years line, epidemiologists figure ""excess deaths"" happened time period. grim. Sure, much doubt small town mayors preparing sorts things. 51 weeks year Sturgis sleepy farm town. attractions feed store tractor dealership. idea prepare pandemic, especially direct opposition state feds, something realm fantasy them.

Of course, America, stupidest thing possible always happens. actually Google well, since knew slur offense synonym someone Syndrome. never seen etymology referring regional group. Looks like hit double whammy. Doubtful. Plenty stories people believe bad wound hospitalized weeks, even months. course someone gets mild case make defiance even stronger. people happy reducing chances catching disease 5%. Others want get 0.1%. pretty uncalled label others OCD risk adverse are. going miss dead person, going misattribute death something like pneumonia extra people die every year, called flu, pre-existing conditions, old people. ~ Covideniers anything bad happened yet? people incapable learning without long term consequences. one dies they'll go ""see,covid isnt big deal can't believe shut country this"" feel students staff must terrified happening option endure. Cases mean hospitalizations, many report stuff often conflate two. actually relative works hospital Houston, they've identified dozens cases past week, one required time hospital, including one entire wing 17 cases, rest wing set hold 70 people empty. Basically, we're discovering virus, still deadly, appears nearly bad reputation would suggest.

Also, nobody hospital least, sent home died COVID-19 thus far.

To clear, I'm saying every hospital Houston empty, COVID-19 potentials area gets pretty full daily basis, cases least call hospitalization. I'm saying though sensationalist clickbait media headlines exactly that, sure read whole article carefully usually find 'allegedly' 'anonymous sources' clarification 'in entranceway hospital.' Netherlands also performed less 1/3 many tests per capita US stupidly fucked.

I don’t know many buddies wife’s medical school class went hospitalist roles haven’t fill CoVID19 death certificates worked anything close normal work week months.

The whole thing sucks people trying act like big deal, blows mind.

I hope wife’s supply N95’s holds out.  show it? I'm conceptually that's ridiculous phrase.

In America absolutely trade, monetise sacrifice 'lives' left-right centre god economy. kind national model.

Healthcare, drug policy, welfare, prisons, regressive tax policy etc etc etc infinitum. American human life calculable totally finite value. Psycho mindset also known poverty. rock hard place little comfort.

 Much high value say USA 1.5% population tested positive v.s. .3% population tested positive EU (with much less testing)?  
There needs real data people use instead garbage. Example: 21 day trailing new case data show places trending.
 Low value stats really annoy me.
Also, EU high % old people nursing homes? high percentage US cases nursing homes spread like wildfire. EU lot elderly people living children (like know Italy has) lower number could partially that.

I’ll amazed isn’t selling pyramid schemes time family Christmas. You’re moron worth noting study never meant US. meant UK far fewer cases US. 

I've seen many comments trying say ""This work US"" never meant US. entire post misinformation, fact

You 100 % wrong. Europe whole 1 million, wrong. Plain simple. know were.looking at. Huffington post article? 
The European Union ""more double population US."" (The European Union population roughly 440mm, US population 332mm.) 
""Six seven times lower""- even suppose mean? 
 
Here link actual table European Centre Disease Prevention Control US numbers US deaths LOWER European Union: US 162,913 EU 183,777
(Johns Hopkins / European Centre Disease Prevention Control)

Testing discrepancies vary EU lag behind US exception Denmark. Meaning mathematical necessity cases here. spreading misinformation, really think virus going infect 330 million us, need get grip believe 3-3.5% confirmed cases (cfr, case fatality ratio).

The 0.5-1% estimated ifr, infection fatality ratio, meant cover infected individuals confirmed cases better estimate deadliness lack better term. Japan terrible place, like everywhere else. terrible place different ways countries language barrier prevents people understanding stupid things happening. need see scientific study ... one right? Right? Netflix need. I'm confused. reducing conversation insults instead actual discussio? Yes. Sports fundamentally Labor issue. Like industries, value derived labor, compensation labor minuscule compared wealth extracted management owners, depend labor wealth. 

I'm OK owners inventors getting something extra, differential abusive, unsustainable, lead disaster. motorcyclist find title offensive misleading would prefer title

""Defying virus, thousands Trump supporting Harley Davidson enthusiasts flood small US town"" I'm due February hoping Californians stop selfish take heads asses (our governer/government trying). America. Freedom applied rich since day one. Ex-president &amp; Ex-cabinet walk quietly mansions &amp; sleep like babies perpetuating much death. 
Fucked up. maybe consider people mean say? 


Is virus really scary? deaths low people mainly suffer two health problems. Yes young people get sick maybe damage three weeks rarely permanent.

But get hit car tomorrow.

Why everybody sub scared? Yes lecture morally want. Morally differ.

But fear? everybody suffering several health issues? father law got covid worst symptom splitting headache would budge It’s size use it! lol god ""Coincidentally I'm seated directly across one"" least better average American

yeah really setting high bar. maKe eXamPLe hiM!!! American, Australian. Publically funded research. Jericho fucking idiot, say fan  Can't effing plague carriers STAY HOME?!?!? Yeah that's it.. feel like people even that. put sign outside local grocery store asking keep 1.5 meter distance possible, swear nobody follows lol, way enforced.

Both &amp; everybody friend circle around 3 months ago (all who've tested antibodies tested positive), we've flattened curve, think worst fortunately. stop mattering they’re womb. USA far diverse/free country world.
 
Countries stricter government (South Korea, China) easily track citizens US lot harder. tiny countries dense areas(New Zealand) easily control virus spread.

We followed Sweden example imo. would successful strategy given government set tried opening page reloaded 4 times gave up. question, Japan mandatory masks? impression not, case protest seems odd. it! safe, course. bonus, get enjoy New Mexican food here.

If feeling really adventurous, even buy balloon ride. It'll probably cost $200, afford it, worth every penny. Although probably need Fiesta happening. website name, website category (since lot reports website get linked here), know future. able repost since link posted recently, reinstated?

Look Germany's antimask protests week. US still worst, that's let crazies take control goverment, country immune stupid. Particles landing mucus membrane it, includes eyes. cripples, forget we're disposable too! Fucking eugenics... estimates average 8x many cases probably around 40 million.

You’re throwing misleading numbers without reference. disqualified votes talked arrived late. arrive late polling place vote won’t count either. many people OnlyFans though.  supposed see Roger Waters Orlando Wednesday, (rightly) cancelled.

It’s almost you’re projecting? kind weird tactic don’t even know educational professional background. even read fucking article?
It literally said Ireland gets 2 million tourists Canada US every year. Honestly, you’re probably uneducated broke bastard shitting people wrong reason. states COVID control spread completely preventable could controlled unified national response.

NY early epicenter, held example went wrong went right, fair early stage pandemic lot left learn, including best medical practices, manage pandemic modern times, prevention (masks, etc). 

I'm upstate NY, hard shut down, many businesses closed, still bars (now: outside, food required, distancing required shut down), gyms still closed (though classes held outside them), etc.

mask compliance much higher used be, many businesses someone door making sure everyone mask enter. 

There still occasional parties spreading COVID, also outrageous Ozarks.

But south, GOP governments watched happened thought, ""nope, never gonna happen here"", ignorance false bravado outrageous, get it, GOP governors want like Trump, huge mistake. 

NY could done little better, maybe, done one hell job given metro NY area larger states population wise, high population density, lot travellers coming leaving.

If anyone Sturgis, FL/GA/TX government ever reads subreddit (or scientific discussion COVID) stop idiots, people get sick die, mostly preventable. That's taking conversation *even away* allowing opportunity start talking immigration instead. need keep simple direct immediately back topic discussing first place. mean, ""go for"" time life, IVs. dont believe connection Gallbladders Covid 19. surprising people fetishize lethal form transportation would poo-poo pandemic. mean, curve isn’t flattening chance so, isn’t much do. people get thing eventually, never planned case. plan simply delay treatment capabilities caught make less lethal, happened many places. spent February, March, April, May 100% locked went shop bulk food 3 am, carefully sanitizing EVERYTHING risk factors, isn’t doom gloom feared. It’s bad, course, world never rid average person can’t sustain lockdown long. mask up, wash up, don’t go places people wearing masks. Aside that, risk bad. fake thou. like flu. family Ohio. alarming number people going Florida summer vacations, planned, children.

Yes, also acting exactly like would expect get back local community. Similar issue, get groceries delivered go work go home, live grandparents along family think it’s hoax.

Let's see sources have. Google nothing lifetime damages COVID-19, probably since less year old. good thing doctors reddit predict future. hope countries smart enough stop travel US control. testing extreme cases. 

likely reason. r/leopardsatemyface

'cause natural selection real here, measured Freedom units Texas. Wait school two weeks, numbers skyrocket.  Italy many deaths healthcare system bad couldn’t handle numbers.

And politicians started “hug chinese” action imported 20000 Chinese per ship slave labor. Yea lets go back feb march. president kept saying would disappear mayor governor begging test. march 6th America whole done 2000 test south korea done 140 thousand!! march 16 nyc shut city. Majority states luxury thousands test daily yet still losing 1000 plus Americans per day august test form Harris county took 14 days get back. FOURTEEN DAYS. took test July 10th. high rate testing enough. Biased towards worst cases. necessarily represent population. disease get you, civil disobedience economic depression will. hell, let's throw World War 3 led India, China, Russia US. Cant wait see final episode reality show might even die .....The bartenders says, church next door. certainly sounded like joke line I’m sure congregate drink wine church group anyhow. That's one way avoid overwhelming medical system, export everyone else's medical systems... plane ticket probably cheaper way getting treated anyway example might looking Italian study. percentage people needing critical care per age group.

 

**Probability symptoms critical disease SARS-CoV-2 Personal im immunocompromised cant physically social media. call someone whose feet tied concrete block bottom lake ""stable"", yeah. definitely sockpuppets/bots hard work threads get thousands upvotes, i'd say they're pretty successful inspiring others copy hateful evil posts too, knows many authentic. bee like years. pick clues like lots people using similar adjectives, unusually standard grammar, etc. etc. marketing firms kind work governments, corporations, political campaigs, etc. upside, test takes long hear bad news over. mention lifetime damage there. Try again. petty shit like buying drinks bar, flying Florida eating shitty birthday cake = important people dying  *Cries Medieval Europe* Trump payed sex, payed votes. Stay strong 💙 What's point? I'm talking gates nobody else. get empathy can't show empathy everyone else distancing wearing mask Yes saw video people traffic jam drunk going 80 slams kills many CPAM, je t’aime ! 5 year old sometimes says, ""careful, coronavirus there"" wishes would already. Nobody ever starved death communist country /s went motel lake NE Washington weekend. surprised find people adhere masks distancing pretty strictly rural Washington. Seems like people small towns aware summer tourists could deliver aren’t interested.

On sad note, rural Washington towns already falling apart. amount businesses seemed closed shocking. HEPA FILTERS. EVERYWHERE. ALWAYS. Here's report CFR Johns Hopkins. Much better source.  basis next YouTube millionaire  school starts three weeks! YAY!!! also steals source code IBMs trash make first home pc. Live nearby, work fast food. Id say remind 1/6 people put mask on. 1/3 wear itnproperly. Ive 2 people medical conditions, 1 get mad asked put mask nose conform by-laws. fact 3 weeks ti remind people put fucking depressing attack devil 

As son pentecostal pastor, one triggered me. accurate. fucking everything “attack” devil? brother sister don’t get along? Must devil. car’s AC broke? Probably don’t tithe. Coming gay? Definitely attack devil steal promised life supposed have, sow discord family. drink alcohol? Must possessed spirit rebellion. 

Luckily neither parents covid deniers, still. kind “explanations” everything make fucking blood boil. grocery deliveries beginning pandemic praying catch Covid since help take care elderly father. pandemic killed business. Unemployment opened self employed people, took stayed hunkered home much possible. unemployment getting cut start paying rent again. work. first delivery I've done far apartment delivery. furniture delivery guy hops elevator me, putting mask does.

He asks speak Spanish. look answer him, fucker TOOK MASK could eat apple. WAIT ONE MINUTE??? told Spanish put mask on, thankfully complaining chewing. got soon possible. 

I've tried finding jobs. I'm comfortable right deliveries since people area ""fuck it"" stage comes masks. I'm willing take reduced unemployment figuring make work means bring Covid home family. gaming experience Americans taught anything, ""me first, you"" global scale. mean, clearly mind ending coffin OP argue lot harder seems qhen vote take consideration others vote fore weather vote wasted. Take trumps election instance, tried freaking hard get bernie office look got us. votes could trump end trash votes.

And record voted bernie, wish could say right decision honestly dont think was. we've officially gone mad. Maybe also lowest test rate general last weeks? hope 🙈 lower number daily newborn Americans far outpace daily deaths every day. December gap widen. Good. Time clean state good Napalm. Cases rise testing. Look data pillar 2 tests, compared June. percentage confirmed cases tests fallen compared June. memory, last week 0.37 opposed 0.69 June. media won’t tell fear sells papers diverts traffic websites Yeah, US time countries. deaths big countries occurred March/April... PPE available til late peak outbreak, ventilators.. couldn’t get hold masks til May! showed early coming US chose worry toilet paper instead 🧻

Do maths see death rate time since first case you’ll better understanding difference US EU. car crash simply stood line behind someone going one.

Look false equivalence. America months warning Europe. That's point, hoping US would learn went through. Upstate ny didnt get hit hard similar population Arizona. never wondered government agencies demanded filters rated .3 microns?


 Let's go CDC NIOSH standards manufacturers new particulate filter tests, NIOSH certify three classes filters, N-, R-, P-series, three levels filter efficiency, 95%, 99%, 99.97%, class. filter tests employ penetrating aerosol size, 0.3 µm aerodynamic mass median Designation  Minimum filter tests employ penetrating aerosol size, 0.3 µm aerodynamic mass median diameter.


So Minimum catch certain percentage particles Penetrating Aerosol Size .3 microns.

Again, that's Minimum... Penetrating Aerosol Size...

So allowed better .3

And almost like stating sizes penetrate easily...

Because thats exactly get really small particles – like particles 0.3 microns, things start getting weird. Particles small little mass actually get bounced around like pinball hit gas molecules (known as Brownian Motion). move random zigzag tiny particles small enough fit HEPA filters if flew straight. fly zigzag patterns, end hitting fibers getting 0.3 micron number comes time. weirdness Brownian motion works magic 0.3 microns. easily understandable filtering works magic 0.3 microns. two processes overlap weak spot. Particles 0.3 microns lie two, makes hardest particle size capture. Researchers call penetrating particle size even links studies there. Even NASA ones.


But that's masks rated .3 microns, hardest size catch. Smaller objects like Covid would even easier catch. would single Coronas, stuck drops spit mucus, would larger.


Masks block Covid-19.

Even homemade masks. could say genetic material accurate without confusing. Dude.

Hospitalizations Florida breaking records last days.

Your absurd short sited view fucked up. time slight dip. immediate claim resolved. insane.

Covid take month kill. take weeks someone need hospitalization. getting better. becoming less deadly.

A thousand people day okay. think talking too, idea think lol. made finally go gallbladder issue? fuels by, well, telling attack him. mind attack him. hamberders teaching covid? ...and Trump. He’s exposed rotten core America real comment I’ve seen Everything situation sucks I’m sorry that. 

Just wanted add though internet (if that’s you’re posting vs library something) don’t phone - get free voip number use that. Google voice comes mind. Many others too. 

So phone (number) need tied computer. 

That might help time being. So, engaged selfish idiot here, probably wasn’t best ambassador this, guys attitude epitomizes type people causing stick around.. proud boasting gone several vacations eat bars.. told life sounded sad making voluntary choice limit contact others.. segment US population believes selfishness narcissism good traits something embody.. voluntary sacrifice sad pitiful.. definitely aren’t majority proxy interact interact semi-regular basis. 

Additionally without solid safety net place many people work pay bills keep roof families head, don’t think blame people, understand family, idiots can’t go week without going bar, restaurant, gym, water park, etc despite impact it’s selfish.. thought Conservative sub wrap head around posts fearing virus, trusting administration, otherwise informed reasonable replies. yep, still learning. exciting learn new things this. sad US prematurely pulled trigger speculative vaccine production, wasted money. still try prevent deaths implementing strict safety requirements car manufacturers fine people wear seat belts.

The thing need remember, unlike normal statistical cause death like xxx people die cancer, xxx people die drowning. Deaths outgoing outbreak exponential, 1 today, 2,000 day 6 months later.

Beside, already know roughly estimates, every 1 death, 20 30 others still suffering severe form COVID, previous SARS outbreaks early reports induced long term disability suffered lower quality life.

So that's 1,000,000 additional people need support cannot work all. pandemic America ends today, not. love California That's rich coming nation controlled rich. makes judgement worse. implicit denier due taking unknown spreadable deadly virus seriously. Whether bias irrelevant. someone extra careful unknown. Also, young people carriers.  care whether live die? agree. I’m 18 sentiment among young adults know “we won’t get it”, “if get we’ll fine we’re young” “I don’t care anymore”. Again, among people know. 

I know multiple people who’ve gone Kelowna past two weeks, going restaurants that. haven’t really following coronavirus situation Kelowna, knowledge it’s still hot spot. 

Or know someone went Kelowna (Before Canada day), came back lower mainland, went Bowen island days, came back, went parksville days. quarantining cities. 

These people 20-25. 

It’s frustrating seeing this, count one hand many times I’ve left house see friend last 146 days, it’s frustrating seeing people preach social distancing, quarantining mask wearing say fuck go travelling. thing scary watching UK people USA seem realise get lot LOT worse still act now? UK population quite 2 x California 5x deaths. us locking almost full pay everyone. 💙 Theyll go right back screaming hoax 

You read article. volunteering care corona patients caught virus march, time authorities giving *very* mixed signals regarding efficacy masks. I've success far telling people politely. ""Oh sir, mask,"" point like forget put on. course know intentionally wearing it, mad hell them, gives little room save face instead getting defensive. Personally, believe lack culture people might answer. people refuse right things people barely read books. uneducated lack emotional intelligence too. 

Our current culture simply revolve around previously called kalokagathia. current values superficial deceptive molded people question even basic things: earth globe, corona real, know I'm talking about.

We're basically paying price created society focused appearance materialism. say Wilde's words, people know price everything value nothing Same! Delivered package guy yesterday replied standard, ""hi sir, doing"" ""I'd lot better took mask off""

Lol, yeah nah.

And guy look well; stick thin, smoking cig, 40 going 50...like bruh, somehow think good spot roll dice here.

What really blows lid exercising freedumb enough. angry ppl (sorry, SHEEPLE) following advice health professionals, feel need force cuntspiracy opinion you...which like meta irony. documents called datasheet. Every mask manufacturer provides one certified masks.

And exactly data sheets say that's soooo.. well-known. Yea Tripler pretty good test times! Also, I'm happy hear negative, hope feeling well!! reliance philanthropy due us taxing rich. Burn live mountainous area went local river today cool summer heat. vast majority people crowding trails river banks travelers stopped area, evident license plates cars overcrowding parking lots—and many even parked totally blocking road in. Lived 30 years never ever seen kinds crowds. won’t happen....too many Americans literally don’t give shit. Wow shows little care citizens. media telling us awesome we’re doing. Take like 3 minutes google covid heart scarring, brain damage. like happening 1/10 survivors. like 7/10 8/10 respectively Delivered package guy yesterday replied standard, ""hi sir, doing"" ""I'd lot better took mask off""

Well it’s known professional athletes shower together Corona affecting lower income communities / essential jobs due lack protection necessity go outside more. Add cost healthcare causing people need treatment / testing risk it. Minorities making people categories disproportionately affects them. Obviously viruses can't racist. saying thing months family thinks I'm crazy there's nothing wrong they're fine. really wish many people would get heads open freaking eyes see shit show happening us. Still dont understand fits discussion people usually idea impossibly difficult emigrate another country go thru steps permanent resident status, regardless similarity culture. sort thing usually takes decade planning. Drop dope dab abd parkour, duh Thank you. wish known before. spent $300 weeks worth scrub pants shirts, washable masks, face shields myself, bands help tighten masks around nose behind head. Aussies immediate family come though sarcasm.

Not saying was. example things cause misunderstanding Internet. There's nothing wrong straightforward. Cool, I'll risk families' lives school guise essential services. Lets emulate worst Nordic countries. counterargument would generally people bad enough shape end hospital tested, whether flu coronavirus. So, number deaths due flu coronavirus pretty accurate. could true flu numbers underreported, case possible greater testing total number cases would go up. However, deaths since people already tested. result would lower death rate flu, coronavirus would still look proportionally deadly. 

All assuming reported flu numbers derived actual test results. article linked to, true. However, health organizations report annual flu cases US globally, they're using modeling techniques account fact many cases go untested. Yeah, like .2%. Absurdly low. Amen! Man thought see online Florida man joke, hate say think use head right way bang head. #4 run rampant. think exactly they’ve done years science, medicine, anyone functioning brain, ignore them. Dismiss them. Forget them. Relegate typical, racist, conspiracy theory bullshit rhetoric dustbin history belongs. source? Play ~stupid~ Darwin games, win ~stupid~ Darwin ~prizes~ awards. JFC, story many countries. America got independence doesn’t mean countries chilling around waiting handouts. There’s difference profiting getting people killed Prius high. Yep, typically viruses spread easily winter. indoors = close contact. put people moon, can't get organized enough beat this. Really, 2 weeks everyone complying social distancing rules could bring country safe levels. 2 weeks could happened back March. curve lockdown states vs FL, TX, etc. looks dramatically different. Instead U shaped death curve, they're looking prolonged tail unnecessary deaths. exactly inconsequential approach. also said think could get young wear mask. Sooo.... use words understand. Us 🇦🇺🙏 publish names shun future. need mask laws hAHa rEddIt 69 nIcE mOmeMt SecKs kEanU chUngUs blame rise both. It’s actually worse kids Whoever wrote article went Ricky LaFleur school grammar, Jesus Christ. people even read shit publishing it? real?

There's plenty people long-term complications Covid. Like getting early February/March still exhausted cough today.

We even know yet bad going year two (the real consequences). death vs full recovery.

When Americans take virus seriously? Half million dead several million lifelong health complications?  PEOPLE STILL FLOCKING VEGAS!!!!! could go rodeos motorcycle rallies! Yeehaw! There’s groups donate PE situations like this. well, ask people 3d printers make honestly, bought online China Word. feel like like i'm trapped cage meth addicted baboons. right? fool Ouch.... Agreed. originally wasn’t going vote figured candidates shitshows wouldn’t matter got office, first debate watched convinced vote Trump.

I barely made five minutes appalled terrified made far. Satan tempt Jesus jump building prove powerful was? mean sinful take precautions prove God protect you? Sound like time send children back school. waiting vaccine hope don’t die then. neighbors huge brunch party. one gives crap live I've heard. looking hot them. Yes understand abbreviations use them. feel like we're seeing natural selection actually turn quite awhile. sad caregivers medical professionals put position possibly getting disease. less devoped country mean can't handle pandemic jeez. could argue lot orders along delaying elective “non-emergency” procedures increased number deaths due lack treatment?

In many states restrictions ended months ago. guess could still delays backlogs, doctors ability rearrange based priority. 

So reason, excess deaths slowed heart attacks increasing home people shrugged symptoms couldn’t wait longer? 


To fair, emergencies. people emergency, need go ER.

If scared go media reporting pandemic, would media started giving reports strange illnesses. People disappearing hospitals weeks, contact families, released, dead. media noticing ""increased"" deaths. answers authorities. China style?


There's lots people survived heart attacks, cancer, kidney disease, etc... years, full lives. Even people multiple problems.


People try claim Covid-19 want. people dieing something would totally survivable, get back life months, live full life years, Covid-19 screwed normal up, thats bullshit excuse. true. California reported 80% drop fatal car crashes. Michigan reported 65% drop fatal car crashes. Illinois 55% drop. said isnt factually accurate? Excellent idea.  get clean, good meal. Bed ... coffin. Either work here. could've suffered ten weeks social discipline like Spain Italy, instead 60 million people believing ""Democrat hoax."" Almost. DSM manual *disorders* diseases. Disorder little different reflects departure ""normal"" functioning, really require condition disease. 

Typically things DSM distress dysfunction qualifier, means diagnostic criteria constitute disorder, person must experiencing either significant distress, significant dysfunction. So, enough person different enough people trouble important tasks feel distressed. 

Keep mind, things like addicted nicotine also DSM typically talk smokers mentally ill mental disease. Cmon japan you’re better parents even telling kids positive? implying conversation follows:

Parent:""my kid sick. time go clinic get tested, enough time stay ill. 14 days later clinic said boy covid, despite fact probably speak English, also violating HPPA telling result medical test. But, son continue go class defiance van. 

Teacher:""oh, can't take word face value conversation never happened, I'll run another test child response symptoms, wait 2 weeks results doctor can't legally tell outcome, close classroom really positive. 




 like school testing kids separately. 100 billion. long makes feel happy.

But hey, life back normal China even expats living confirmed it. cares facts feelings say otherwise? live dollar store care.. fact , wear mask anywhere around people stare snicker.. Nah man, ""coronavirus"" dissappear election news something else yalk about. 

- idiot overheard liquor store There's 5% people covid actually develop antibodies prevent covid (current strain). That's pretty damn low, herd immunity catching able catch achieved. pass around around vaccines ready.

The sad part could majority it, next surge would later year. People refused fucking mask up. batching quarentine 3 months ago? are. Still going idiots ""rights"" spread diseases Americans? That's funny way spell Republicans. majority Americans care, find acceptable zero power anything it. responsibility squarely Trump's lap top McConnell's head. !Remindme 83 days time seems like crazy theory, Trump, supporters going killer virus, dying, support Trumps narrative.

Its nuts, things year, might craziest things it. really worse off. similar situation. Imagine interracial couple walking there. That's main thing worried about. Possible depression. user explains Florida numbers every day. According them, positivity rate around 18%. I’ve remote since March; I’m torn. I’m therapist special needs school also work hospital. make matters little chaotic lost father covid April.

The regression see horrid. parents stressed out, tired, scared. meeting DOH requirements, kids don’t wear masks September. choice remote person. capacity can’t reach 50%. purchased disposable kids masks therapy room. I’ve don/doff masks tele therapy sessions hand washing. 

In hospital, get swabbed 2x week, temp taken daily. difference appropriate PPE made incredible. Everyone remained covid free staff; still allow visitors. Mecca one point. 

The way try explain parents masks, it’s like dog eats chocolate. little may feel off, whole bar he’s vet. One single masks masks chocolate bar smaller. 

PPE important schools. aren’t abiding it. It’s one thing we’re staff going take hands. obviously can’t share j shields; get medical googles cheap! Given mothers blood exchanges everything baby across placenta, lot references COVID causing increased clotting blood, seems reasonable hypothesis affect pregnancy. 

Apr. 17, 2020  Well, set example sharing. Problem solved. 

I'm sorry, use dark humor cope. Truthfully heart breaks you. wife teacher returning class Wednesday (no students) work directly Special Ed department district office. know stories well. Drinking SpEd literally like drinking war vets. shit different flavor. you’re talkin’ crazy What's point oh idea, looking home depot im there. didnt know stores carried better n95? ive never seen half mask replaceable filters (P100) lowes/HD doesnt mean anything, havent seen friend mine works medical field colleague earnestly explain COVID-19 vaccine(?) causes infertility women men sleep them.

I weep US. people risking lives drive boomer Harleys pretend biker Gangs.

Not smartest people. Well one good thing. good portion harleys wont ever make sturgis cause theyll broke leaked oil long get there. No, that’s blame capitalism for. read news, like, past five years? I’m cis woman heard many stories people scared trans peeps look wrong way. 

Covid’s kinda hit pause button anti-trans rhetoric we’ve got going news—since one’s really using public bathrooms past months—but people legitimately hate trans people here, person replied justified fear. add msg packet simple example. know single details. failure rate one test 0.1%. words, one 1 000 tests deliver false result. 1 000 000 tests, 1 000 results wrong.

This failure rate include failure taking sample. Transporting controlled conditions etc. real life, 0.1% test results wrong.

In addition, many tests proven cross-sensitive. common people dengue could tested positive Corona.

It long list things influencing test result. That’s single county reporting couple hundred backlog. much states tens thousands tests returning rolling 7 day average time high 2 days row. may paint racist whatever true President says numbers high testing. people tested every time flu like symptoms cases would pretty high flu. like guy said people say fuck eat campbell soup. It’s FloriDUH leader bikers trump. one group get infected karma make sure it’s themz don’t know you’re talking about. signed huge ESPN TV deal. They’re rolling would surprised hear S. Korean media disparaged government's reponses failure compared New Zealand, Taiwan, ~~Hong Kong~~, ~~Vietnam~~~, etc. criticized government sacrificed innocent citizens save economy 'relation China'. actually feel sorry person. That’s rough way learn. 4 people died Benghazi Republicans went nuts. 150,000+ people die Covid fucking crickets. 
 
Terrorizing citizens better Isis Taliban ever could have. care President sure doesn’t! Exactly, trump knew us wad thing, could stopped this, could prevented deaths sickness. much want put blame much also falls citizens wont take seriously wont wear masks. headline might well ""Defying rain, thousands of..."" 


Or ""Defying nitrogen, thousands ....."" 


Because that's attempting. I'm buddy guy. Thanks support. going ask doctor antibacterial eye medication pink eye initially covid shortness breath/chest pain took priority doctors appointments. pink eye went away forgot recognize sentiment thrown around European officials, ""Don't care?"".

Until US clearly going able manage lockdown, stick plans let alone them, Swedish ""failed experiment"" held leading example to. plan, set effect long time - reliant arrival vaccine imposing little strain possible society citizens alike.

""Don't care?""

It asked concern Swedish lives then, certainly concern US lives now.

It was, is, remain gesture local audience. show force way able point perceived bigger screw-ups situation success measured relative degree failure.

Hell, even write guilty self-reassurance. Only, know Sweden achieved goal breaking medical services seems unlikely deal guesswork safe reopen anytime soon.

The situation US making since 2016. Trump never going unifying leader time crisis, simply leader, effect core body voters would jump cliff opposition said stop. top, US socioeconomical issues dating back 2016 primes large portion citizens risk groups - virtue long lived rather lived. Pair welfare social security ""communist evil"" and...well.. 

There nothing balanced US copes, never place balance act from. ""concerned astonished"" Europeans bloody well know this.

If asking ""Don't care?"" Sweden vanity, asking US borderline cruel.

No, flattening curve always meant buy time. Time get PPE, time source ventilators, time implement quarantine procedures, time get sanitizer supplies, time develop vaccine. 

Most importantly, gives time observe virus, plan next step. 

I think crazy expecting anyone know exactly *novel* virus. That's strategies flux: idea dealing first, people would react unprecedented situation. That's good answer. respect it.

Why think recommended wearing proper mask touching mask thee hands without sanitising first, wearing mask longer hours, even reusing masks without washing them

That's you. many people still unconsciously rub eyes sometimes? takes one unlucky time.

How unconsciously rub eyes they're covered goggles?

*Cannot wait hear answer one.* people diligently wearing masks washing hands still died. Nurses especially. 

I love way people like always compare healthcare workers treating infected COVID-19 patients.

The person replying talking going grocery shopping. working COVID-19 ward.

Yes, healthcare workers COVID-10 wards still catch there's high viral load even 5% gets N-95 mask still give large dose virus.

That apply shopping grocery store. Bill Gates ton experience dealing situations like 3rd world countries.

Meanwhile idiot president pushing unproven drugs telling people inject disinfectant also suggesting somehow put sun inside us kill virus? vote guy lies constantly, must weird fetish have.

Yeah, someone else mentioned too. Good know. think fomites main source infection I've hearing anyway. literally giving comments companies trialing vaccines. giving best case time lines.

Do math.

If, companies BEST case scenario, start vaccinations October 31st 2 doses month apart, 1 million EVERYDAY would mean 10% would vaccinated Christmas time.

This everything goes right.

People waiting vaccine simply living fantasy land.

Sweden: Beginning 19 March 2020, entry ban applies foreign citizens attempting enter Sweden countries except EEA, UK country shutting down, Sweden saw opportunity invite EEA huge Covid Swap party.



Then trying blame schools taking winter break week later surrounding countries Disemboweled Covid virus. F**ing right on. 

Pretty much DeathSentence. enforce it. Trump seemed able mobilize feds pretty fast protesters. You’re wrong cut flights regions won’t feel singled out. know you’re won’t go ballistic....unless it’s slow news day. pick good day announce ""Good news"" specifically fuckin idiots think Corona fake wear masks, fucking troglodytes go grocery store that’s period . comment weird understand it. effective way reducing mortality. Lawrence means, spell out, football players black, may home life medical coverage team provide. Apart bit presumptive (they speak themselves), recently read injured football players college teams sent home season's end medical ins. cover rehab. many cases never happened, thus ending football careers. effectiveness masks known, long pandemic. even mandated Spanish Flu. lied due PPE shortages failed prepare for.  It’s spelled mangoloid ya homo Sagan wild, surely “unsafe” many reasons CDC might care SaFe!! ""A portion US population, well key legislators, emphasized vitality economy key issue stay-at-home orders business closures enforced @at beginning pandemic.""

How write without mentioning trump. Key legislators bullshit pushed trump. stupid realize responded rationally admitting problem addressing it, prevention methods, increased testing, opening quickly. resulted many fewer deaths infections would made unbeatable coming election. That's happens national emergency's occur leader responds appropriately. Fucking idiot. guess. I've made argument enough times myself. hard witness people thought smarter that, able understand basic fact, feel like took lies manipulation get ""waffling"" ""lying"" ""exaggerating"" conclusion. feels like stories people tell afraid. stories certainly amplified, encouraged manipulated would turn us other, and/or say, weaponize misinformation.

I know would able collect unemployment case clearly getting fired cause.



I would fully expect employer fight unemployment case win, pay back money made it.



Like, really. know state literally show work get fired collect unemployment.


They likely backed gotten around reviewing case. 


Did legitimately think could get fired cause collect unemployment? one first 100 people download this. Sadly, works massive numbers people install it. privacy health people understanding works trusting technology, fear never hit saturation point unless someone becomes mandatory way obviously near impossible. aunt works 4 letter auto maker OH. socializing back late April, got sick tada covid. smoker, COPD, overweight, generally unhealthy.

She went pulmonologist last week can't work line mask. almost passing out. Pulmonologist put medical, wants work go unemployment.

She audacity laugh Mom (her older, healthier sister) cautious got sick. long term issues. stay away fucking VFW (which still operating lockdown.) rationale sound though. Cognitive dissonance strong one must kids. Movie theaters back. live here, confirm biggest fear! Stay fuck out!!! even admitted hospital. 

Deniers must know better doctors scientists, right?

So save dwindling medical resources people deserve it. Well taking efficiency two different testing methods yea. got back June got fast stiil quarantined 3 weeks. I'm feeling bad I'm seeing moles getting large red, hope move lymph nodes. I'm 27 listened doctor removed 5 years ago. point short-cutting standard FDA procedures rushing production. take it, please do. need larger test group take it. me, survive little longer mask dont need big beer Applebee's bad. post history says first symptoms pink eye.   “It is” 

- Ireland too, apparently reason getting vaccine soon can. think realistic expect avoid getting covid forever pervasive community spread. Even chance side effects vaccine KNOW long term side effects covid (people heart damage, lung damage, neurological issues). agree politicizing pandemic hence I've stated need vote administration office. embarrassing. wish Canada best. I've handful times met many nice people. really like government handling it. 

There's things leadership done perfect. Especially Prime Minister. lump Canadians one way thinking it. 

If anyone forgot I'm trying point Americans care pandemic. news painting story world mock sure. I'm saying care lump people, regardless country, one generalized lump. 68 Gronk would opt get 69.  Amen that.

I feel sorry folks who'll get infected indirectly directly idiots like these.

I WISH anyone get sick. see epidemic denier get sick badly - call karma.

I feel them. feel people wronged. chastizing folks e.g. wore masks (I bet made fun hard) worse yet - infecting people infected people... morons blood hands. They're morally better murderers. wish death murderers. feel either, rot jail. Yeah compared much learned NYC area fucking fire nothing. told wear masks, wipe groceries mail, effective treatments... learned much afterward. store enforcing masks cop/sherif enforcing mask mandate . It’s lip service. Denier? exactly, article says nursing assistant volunteered help pandemic needed money. think needed concerned infected personally. never thought could get virus. asked nursing assistant early weeks pandemic. “They told needed people, although experience, easy. said yes despite risk needed work daughter,” Says guy suspends female students wearing skirt 3 inches knee. Another person here. think fudged, much. Otherwise see imported Chinese cases coming South Korea, Hong Kong, Macau, Vietnam, etcetera. imported COVID cases places like EU America. repatriated expats come statistically anomalous number COVID cases. None outgoing patient numbers China indicate unshown epidemic secretly ravaging China everybody's head turned either. 

So no, get add couple zeroes number unless actual proof aside conspiracy theories. yes, urn thing literally debunked already. god.. actually list Glory Holes example. downvote move on, literally couldn’t care less reasons Even find vaccine (highly, highly unlikely) seems burn (BASED small sample size two locations) around 20% seroprevalence (NOT immunity, decreases cases) jack shit would go away year us dont enforce fucking quarantine good points, right People able understand time/data/experience means better info. fault shitty ignorant public case

In age weaponised misinformation feel like blaming victims. anyone dumb enough look sheriff going find eyeballs caked shit Similar experience here. Also Midwest. honest, think lot people getting COVID fatigue. 5 months getting hammered wall wall news coverage, appears people essentially decided they’re going get sick accept it. It’s bit fatalist way view things, suspect happened lot people otherwise reasonable beginning. Yeah, point know spreading Covid spreading while. every person 9 interacted risk. Trust me, loads loads educated, highly functional, cultured Americans would love live somewhere else, dream often! large percentage Gen X younger understand major issues way life extremely difficult US compared first world country. “Americans think greatest country world” thing myth; don’t know anyone real life thinks that. lot gaslighting uneducated working class, denial, everyone knows things better. 

The problem moving another part world get stuck young age. could afford move, would! start lives loads college debt. Families cannot help us get start life paying college starter homes debt low paying jobs high cost living. sold bit “American Dream” though school years, over-extend purchasing things houses think able afford later make money careers. 

As children; told dream big, get good education work hard, get want afford comfortable life. issue though literally everything Capitalism!!! capital C rich get richer rest us suffer. Privilege thing, class division. Wages stagnant, families expensive, college tuition raises thousands every year, people prey poor high interest rates (and private prisons expenses like cash bonds fees make poor decision turn crime improve station life) BIG money issue millions Americans- healthcare costs. 

Even lucky enough good insurance work, still pay prescriptions, ambulance, deductibles 10-20 percent bills (things like 25,000 baby bill still costs 5 grand insurance). This, STUCK job forever stay thankful insurance! Sure, jobs offer basically vacation- maybe week two paid, maternity leave- yes, take six weeks that’s unpaid!, culture “if work 40 hour week minimum won’t get ahead lazy!”. That’s work culture America. 

Does anyone actually wonder US handled pandemic terribly? slaves labor, slaves cost healthcare. work, savings. MONEY matters anyone especially politicians, get elected support (bribes) lobbyists wealthy corporations. politicians bought paid for, nothing people vote them. 

I’ve teacher 23 years, masters degree, work second job way make teacher one-income family US. single parent, responsible raise two boys alone. 

Teachers put tons money supplies things need, also direct musicals plays school year work 15 hour days month straight four shows year. school wouldn’t even let take hour lunch long days actually able rest little, got 20 minute lunch contract like everyone else. leaders schools parents government asks us every year (always kids use guilt us, know works care students number one priority!) add work extra pay. days also include safety issues live shooter drills; train school shootings barricade classroom door throw onto kids keep shot (completely unnecessary automatic rifle one wants US like 2% country). It’s heartbreak heartbreak LOVE teaching best students possible! Kids great’ deserve much better US one inheriting. 

Oh, pay.... 23 years teaching, masters degree, started making annual salary 57,000 dollars. hey, principal teaches children sits around day thinking things “improve school” (without discipline cannot ruffle feathers dear parents) makes 130,000 dollars year bit money education fat cat top administration! 

I get heath insurance school, family plan. family health insurance plan district costs $1400.00 month! Almost half take home! struggled every year find plans could afford actually helped us. Healthcare family always nightmare us. 

Now even social security retirement something risk US. paid social security every year life since first job - 33 years straight. grew farm, able get agriculture jobs working corn fields etc. age 13 on. didn’t wait work 16 like laws now. I’ve worked hard entire life, nothing getting better US, worse. money I’ve paid social security probably gone time I’m supposed get back. 

I cried days Bernie Sanders dropped (was forced out- didn’t bow money wealthy overlords; weren’t going let win). wasn’t man, HOPE millions us. embarrassed furious Trump every day. 

This long reply, oh boy! guess nice refreshing empathy. Love fellow man seem something rare around watch news. get feeling like rest world thinks deserve get. backward, lazy, selfish, uncultured idiots portrayed tv :).  us are, make news! 

Thank letting vent, kind words. guess needed kindness today !! 

What country from? hope visit someday ! better yet move there! woman deserves punishment threatening people with. wish optimism! enormous fear never find vaccine doge virus forever Yup Good luck stay safe! know lot ignorant people Cherokee listen guidelines. agree last part bs. people clue would keep country open I've known US teachers buy school supplies food students. Sometimes warm clothes shoes. Im sure lot schools give teachers nothing prepare this, buy too. add, totally understand point. would difficult even school setting. send kids back school. That's really best approach. mean anything deaths go back up? call ""Ball's Law"", one Steve Ball first articulated principle me:

""Any sufficiently advanced negligence indistinguishable cruelty"".... appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Dude rest post history straight pessimism like said can't slap ""best case scenario"" saying change mindset think places would easiest enforce mask wearing, would schools? distinctly remember allowed wear sweatpants school example. wear crop top school. Schools certainly seem problem enforcing cell phone class rule. would different?  Booo must looking different data sets ...and Sadopopulists still charge, notably USA. make go drive line, always 20 cars. proven cases reinfection. possible, likely damn thing hid cells separation bloodstream, e.g. brain. body thinks done job, disease returns. *might* explain long-term problems people experience, so-called ""long haulers"". Look Lombardy, NYC, Stockholm virus ran course. Deaths per million reached certain point virus transmission slows crawl.

Use figures deaths per million extrapolated US, 500k would top end range. we’ve also learned treat people successfully, nursing homes better protected. 

I’m confident 300-400k end total US. Ehhhh...no wouldn’t unless enforced extreme curfew penalties. Many people would get money keep doing. FREEDOM!! virus flu.  Places busy usual least outside. Inside open maybe one wanting go inside maybe people getting used curbside service. eat fast food much first hand examples have, mom wanted Panda express birthday. ordered ahead husband went inside picked less 2 minutes. drive thru line long blocked Kroger gas station 25+ cars. son friends used go buy one get one Buffalo wild wings nights , dining room open, son said might 5 tables used, curbside now. know Chiptole husband's get supplies business next door strip mall times week least. 

I wonder change industry, pick type orders , less server jobs? city little economic impact , lower unemployment today last year know servers seem hardest hit group (that vocal ), hard find another job pays well professional server moderate upper end establishment. Baseball. Hot Dogs. Apple Pie Chevrolet. Gambling, Steroids, Profits Everything.

Fuck MLB. treat players like chattel. realize I'm operating early pandemic point view. however, point, really become habitual. Like hand washing hand sanitizing wearing mask. Like feels weird it.

My husband saying day fully expects start wearing masks public pandemic pandemic, we're going like fact we're coming home cold every season, let alone crap. pretty small time commitment wipe stuff down, certainly anticipate keep it. completely hear saying. Outside GTA here. 

I went costco really busy. saw one person mask, two people mask nose. Coronavirus approves. period weeks reported maybe 40 new cases per day. government started open everything we're back 600 cases per day average. horrifying. drove one beaches Bay Area California, tons people small crowded beach like nothing.... smh bet trump celebrating. finally hit milestone good him.......... correct. Additionally sickness linked pill wide range potential causes, service members exposed wide range toxins. lol. part INDOORS understand?

I know say grocery stores okay they're quite different. sitting next anyone period time. symptoms virus again? That's symptom psychos that's cure. tell Bavaria, Germany since regional differences within Germany certainly significant differences various European countries.

Here everything shut except grocery stores, pharmacies, doctors/hospitals. it. Nothing else open. Even stores departments groceries forced keep non-essential departments closed allowed sell groceries. hardware stores open, liquor stores open, gun stores, etc. Basically essential meant that, essential. Meanwhile, kept reading places US somehow deemed “essential” therefore open reality aren’t essential all.

We weren’t completely locked though allowed go outside together people household. girlfriend wanted go ATM one evening managed walk couple minutes police stopped us ask living together. I’m runner go running 5-6 times per week never problems police (being myself, far away anyone else, obviously exercising) also saw police stopping questioning every group 2 people. happened often streets practically empty around clock.

Now, don’t know exactly neck woods reading many reports businesses US able stay open seems fairly obvious lockdown less severe.

Another difference masks required every business public transportation. instance, supermarket yesterday 100% people wore mask (although see couple dick noses). It’s every store. Sure, stupid selfish people well thankfully far people realize matter annoying masks need use moment acting together better chance getting pandemic. this, early on? Understandable, drive add extra possible risks. need best make smart choices. Glad best wishes family! Hey Europe 🖕 Yea.... department work call report things. follow algorithm let know you’re safe come work. office mate came work weeks ago daughter waiting test. Doesn’t feel right.  baseball players really old MAGA: Make Americans Go Away I've looking this. Early on, prevalence masks varied, long near-universal. Everything else aside, nearly disease-prone Sturgis event. would advise stick even though shitty situation :( Depends. Plenty scientists sell conservative cash time. Remember lead okay, leaded gas big deal, smoking bad? Imma real one cashiers. want us use masks corporate sent us uniform whatever, DOGSHIT. plastic metal bit helps keep mask nose. say 5 words customer falls beneath nose. wash hands, put back up, wash hands again. It’s huge pain ass pisses doesn’t stay No. Shit. Sherlock. There’s pandemic. Save people give rest year. No, isn't. False positive rates false negative rates given test independent variables. Without understanding [sensitivity test, assumptions making valid. making claims without understanding works. know basics are, again, quite literally alternative right *which nothing.*

And, again, think formal bill passed. still give complete control - masking distancing lowers risk, eliminate it, especially go work use public transport live people. choice either living worry masking living carefree managed convince virus hoax, guess sounds better? [OH AMOUNT U.S. FLU DEATHS VARY 100K-500K, EDUCATE SMOOTHBRAINED  Stupid kids, wanting food. Still first wave think. Cluster outbreaks expected, doubt get bad peak. Time tell. Happiest Birthday cp710. 🤗 mean that’s feels intuitive! avoid community spread, everyone household stay home right?! Still didn’t answer simple question: 

What best way handle this?

You keep saying we’re wrong, tell us right. don’t earn much you’re hook premiums + out-of-pocket expenses ACA. might surprise know lots people easily able afford health insurance/medical expenses prior ACA, go without insurance skimp doctor visits/medicines.

The ACA provided coverage many desperately needed it. restrictions insurance companies raising premiums out-of-pocket expenses, hurt surprisingly large number. (Yes, limits law. However, insurance company cancels policy rewrites new, nearly identical, one higher premiums deductibles year.) Yes, absolutely freshman especially without direct path planned out. dreaming think lockdowns, social distancing norm forever. Humans social creatures barely managing handle restrictions 6 months.

Laughable think people keep virus 0.5% ifr. Especially vaccine starts rolling early next year, say vaccine may discovered. one never made guarantee people go back normal anyway roll dice. I’ve reading 1918 pandemic people didn’t think real either. really need re-evaluate “avoid like plague” phrase turns people didn’t that. many American politicians take much money insurance, finance, pharma. We'll lucky ever see real change. closest got Obama/Biden giving us watered-down version republican state's plan since torn shreds partially dismantled. meant older nurses doctors. Ok follow 5 steps:

1: Get subreddit

2: Step outside 

3: Go walk

4: Go back home browse r/upliftingnews

5: Repeat next day day used credit card. Dispute charges services rendered. 

There way cant cancel resonable time happen. Say 2 weeks month mean China locked allowed citizens freely hop flights world? downplayed problem scooping global supply PPE? pandemic revealed shocking number absolute mongoloids power, incredible. time look source right now, guy kept quoted media - fancy-schmancy forecast originally said there'd 500 deaths.

Then issued non-apology apology revised 5K. kept making ridiculous adjustments, finally claiming 50K ceiling pandemic would August. Experienced teaching research? Research yes, teaching, no- necessarily.

Anyway, internet there's anything I've learned point arguing I'm going change mind. good one. shut team soon infected. Management every MLB team finger pulse monitoring daily.

They multiple days neagtive tests quarantining resumed activities got reinfected. agree ""trusting people right thing"" valid idea? Yeah really tickles optic nerve. societal shifts occur direct result pandemic fascinating read day. now, uncertainty frustrating frightening. 20 million cases worldwide 
25% US
50% US, Brazil India Nope. plane crashing put oxygen mask help loved one neighbor. CmYou can't help anyone sick dying relearning walk. first intelligent comment thread award us economists give much damn political affiliation. Heterdox programs exist ideologues, go. mainstream, mainline, standard school thought want good, quantifiable, evidence-based policies. went target Best Buy first time months today Houston. packed families groups. Texas going ignore thing goes away. we’ll see rise strokes heart problems Stop Again, point ignored, he's lot illegal things several years now.

It's thing Hunter thing Dems really care about.

And weird see it. late family dollar, one cares health wants shop store anymore. Wtf bgr? 

This article horribly written filled mistakes. dude’s blog? Think want.  unfair generalization.

Boomers overwhelmingly support Trump oppose commonsense reforms would ACTUALLY make America great. MLB cannot stop spread bit public schools think can. Beijing Wet Market found handful symptomatic cases went tested everyone come within 5 Km place found dozen connected cluster.

This school Diamond Princess waiting happen. shut remote learn. Pregnant women get Covid experience worse outcomes women similar age. everything get it. Why? specifically referred someone younger Biden. play games get smart me. People literally dying Oxford/Moderna likely safe Oxford passed safety trials COVID Moderna working technology long time know work? made judgment equal blame. projection.

But absolutely blame Dems fighting blame Repubs shit.

And would extremely reasonable allocation blame.

You're lazy, I. mezn smallpox, ever managed eradicate disease? wear mask friends people seen local news. Thank you!  one thread seems heard Chicago, Detroit, Minneapolis, Cleveland.

Chicago starkly different rest state. People masked here, gov mayor (Dems) lockstep using science drive decisions. Cases creeping Chicago, it’s rural part state bulk new cases. guess what, mask use low they’ve tried sue gov numerous time restrictions he’s placed. 

It’s nerve racking I’m tired shit. watched movie “Groundhog Day” back May nod going thinking almost done. August...same fucking thing everyday! Unpopular Opinion: Everyone peddling “it’s reasonable skeptical COVID vaccine” closeted anti-vaxxer. overly pessimistic. Oxford still track September US believe. probably even get EUA straight approval Mr. Hahn said correct (if data suggests works might give vaccine outright EUA). Vaccination probably start happening right paperwork filled out/approval. Then, start emergency distributing fast can.

I think either us know numbers. could well right 1 mill vaccinations day/10% vaccinated. However, think since work working shortage COVID tests still get 500k done day much quicker easier vaccines.

In either case hope, better winter would obviously great even things work we'd still pass largely thing control/over spring Educate virus need eradicated pandemic end.  educate It’s Q-Anon thing. line Q-nutter conservative blurring days. Citation needed. large gatherings allowed. c19study.com number flu deaths vary 100k-500k. 405k falls firmly into. 

Keep kid getting somewhere. Unless go remote learning older professors don’t operate well environment.  thing Trump gives great advice exact opposite whatever tells do. got nothing conspiracy theories. want see actual evidence, would bother much, would believe hand?

I'll incredibly happy UK's death toll lower reported. claims people getting hit bus counted covid seem ridiculous monumental fuck true, want see evidence. See y’all month 10 mil someone living Indiana, I've noticed gradual rise daily cases. Seems like people either know care impending covid storm. sort proves point. complicated risk management problem involved deciding kids go school, killing kids relatively small risk. Spreading virus may problem, may educational impact kids, may child abuse raft risks. MMR vaccine 19% affinity Covid-19. can't stop one getting infected, mitigate severity effect. know 50% Covid vaccine would mitigate severity effect. vaccines available 50%, anyone cut risk instead waiting effective vaccine becomes available. different strains Covid-19 like flu different strains ultimately determine effectiveness. flu vac ~30% effective.Btw, flu kills large numbers. Lousy beatniks. imagine difference Trump got TV February, admonished people weren’t taking seriously, stressed need isolate wear masks, virus real dangerous crisis? Mobilised twitter account common good?

All morons would fallen line. He’s got fawning Putin FFS, getting take Covid seriously would walk park. I'm anti-vaxx- vaccines, including shingles get flu every year, can't imagine trusting vaccine approved administration - especially one available election. forget happened England swine flu vaccine rushed market early: vaccine ended permanently disabling group first people got it- kids- gov't indemnified drug manufacturer problems rolled early, ended settling 60 million sterling. kids actual narcolepsy epilepsy host neurological problems now... May well get covid19 faulty vaccine alternative. live work retail. terrifying, wish to. many people caring masks arguing it, bringing tiny fucking kids mask can't enforce them. unbelievably selfish, makes blood boil. i've seen guy knowingly covid touching fucking *children's remedies* can't anything except suggest waiting car prescription (CVS, also pharmacy) call police, 20 minute response time cus give shit either. already knew city full idiots holy shit, know yet even paranoid have. Rock bought it’s back action 2021. story line... interpretation Fauci’s comments he’s trying set expectations public — idea level efficacy vaccine Phase 3 trials complete, Fauci trying communicate there’s spectrum vaccine make virus manageable, one eradicate within months. public likely thinks vaccine either works perfectly, doesn’t work project failure. He’s saying *won’t* effective, can’t plan though best case scenario definitely come pass act magic wand. big restaurants staff business many small ones closed permanently. nice. Ireland one European Union countries still allowing Americans visit all.

Literally digging grave. people sub legitimately dislike freedom though. Like petulant 2 year old facebook groups tell us care. someone else doesn’t empathy means also don’t empathy? guess go serial killers Bundy was? Terrible logic. We’re humans. make mistakes. Wishing celebrating giving fuck someone getting sick dying sick, even people didn’t wear mask, bask infected say “fuck em”? Why? People sub like vegans. Superiority complex runs rampant here. what? Bay Area 1k deaths since began. don’t seem look things carefully. 
New York transmitting virus anyone knew US. PPEs various hospital staff equipment readily available. spread rapidly via high population density. Florida, Arizona, Texas however benefit seeing happen time prepare. STILL let spread massive amounts per capita, months later, prolonging pandemic. consume western culture almost much theirs.

Of course look us examples going emulate see. YOLO good reason take seriously? longer couple days waste. happening over. stay home 14 days? blame didn't, that's realistic humans without form public support like they've done functional countries. send full time full classes would anxious it. hope every day half class mandatory masks live.  European perspective, think problem politicized issue beginning. 

This political issue. committee made scientists, economist representatives make standard decisions nationwide: (when county needs lockdown based infections, outbreaks, masks mandatory indoor least, etc.) way, parties can't blame stay relatively political fight.


USA become hardly polarized lately that's hurting policy making. People hate ""the side"" aknowledge others good idea. Maybe 2-party system failing.


The whole ""it's right wear masks"" hilarious.


And common comment hear around is: I'm glad live there. (Which pretty sad decades ago like this) wife boat. Except house shared one grandparents elder disabled aunt. Living Canada. aunts US coming using loophole. They're claiming take care grandparents aunt. CBSA denied claim take care grandparents, allowed entry take care aunt. know CBSA allowed since son(40) here. yeah, majority aunts living States Houston... /r/quityourbullshit know it’s fun shit America idiots everywhere.

Hell - 20,000 protesters demonstrated Berlin past week right wear masks. course wearing masks.

There idiots abound world. 1:1000 schools opening. means ""what done?"" fact poor can't donate $45 billion charity can't clarify care public health. Also fact donated amount money public health can't explain needs gather personal data. relation pandemic, mean anything. Maybe donated 45$ billion, earn much it. jobs work.

What done? wear mask every place people, try explain mathematically (because master math) friends must wear mask discuss dangers pandemic. J do. money, would donate money Bill Gates public health, problems also world like poverty, wars, course violation private life, something Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon Google every day. Lol take bit slower virtue signalling Suddenly y'all thinking ""national security"" (trump's polls) played part. Damn. wonder Venn diagram /r/Coronavirus users /r/conspiracy? tend agree. ""Flatten curve"" ultimate low hanging fruit beginning; admission failure inability start.

Now worst worlds: shutdowns interrupting things, long enough actually effective, enough full shutdown happened (and continued longer) first time. exactly government doing--protecting households crisis. Instead, paid businesses half-assed open (unsafely) cash-strapped households primarily serving irresponsible subset consumers.

Targeted shutdowns work. Anybody thinks differently bothered count Arizona license plates beach counties--which 3-6 hours AZ border (during time among worst). months since upstate ny low numbers. majority 3000 deaths happen around time majority nyc deaths Someone made comment catcher, Molina, “catches everything.” unamusing pun. Fucking heard every word that. got back camping Lytton weekend. first person saw (other me) wearing mask got back home New Westminster. dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Fuck people thier disease stupidity. mask laws enforced. That's local level though argument parents.

""It's ok we're family group""

Uhm no, guys go eat nearly everyday shop bored.

Sorry, sorry family visit outside wearing masks. grandma hypochondriac constantly calling home care doctor services telling symptoms covid any. 

Apparently called one 20 times last weeks they're sending somebody wellness check her, think think got covid. Ummmm ain’t it. Getting COVID pregnant also showing high mortality rate child birth. mean, sounds useful. Much stated. “founded rebellion authority” explanation retarded. America today get x decades unfettered capitalism, propaganda, dumbing anti-intellectualism, profit motive, defunded schools, evangelicals, etc. 

Lol “we rebels heart” sure fat fuck. seen whole lot US media, scary see much politics played guys, ""counter petition"" crazy. 'knitted mask'? know avoid. realize get reinfected right? cases people catching COVID twice. certainly get better people see problem leave. voluntary, going work.

It needs mandatory, forced quarantines required testing. pose greatest problems least likely cooperate. Dumb fucks hard believe insane 1 month schools opening flu season starting. Americans got one worlds arrogant people. past generations know nothing sacrifice. soon though!!!!!!!!! Remember dumb population easier control. annual flu shot different story, educated prediction flu strain expect coming season based countries opposite season. flu mutates different strains year year out. Sometimes correct, times not.

Notice can't say chickenpox vaccine tetanus vaccine? solve it! Let's again!

So, school going continue odd idea unlike dress codes etc can't regulate wearing masks?

Idiocracy meets plague. saying there's chance last sentence nonsense you’re doctor you’re mom. I'm worried still barely getting started. Meanwhile, Sweden...... We, people US seem forgotten made great country, patriotism, values, helping fellow neighbors.

 turned selfish. Idiots think giving liberty told something simple wearing mask. Look New Zealand. Corona gone everyone pulled together followed simple law. Wear mask! 

You think PEOPLE would want everything possible keep fellow man healthy. Covid 19 real hear stay PEOPLE pull heads asses.

JUST COVER FACE PROTECT OTHER! IG full young people partying.

Do fucking favor blast US map. Maybe relax little.  


\-An American government job master's degree Blah blah blah problem factual information blah blah blah handwavey racially motivated garbage blah blah blah Single people sensible people kids. Yeah generally 400 people week die covid-19 hospitals clears room. I'm Utah tell level ""but freedom!"" dumbest levels. work group home. woman presumptuous care. chased us around group home, naked trying hug us. I’m still upset hazard pay week (we got two weeks later July 31st)

We also client spits. She’s working - still every then. sucks. Yeah, hear you. know opinion tremendously unpopular voting. Honestly planning posting CMV next election. feel like little controversial people it, want accused trying manipulate election way. 

But curious short comes specific points. 

If 10 people voting, vote counts 10%, significant. 100 people voting, vote counts 1% less. agree people vote less individual vote matter. 

I think self motivated people tend passionate politics. think also tend better educated political issues whole. say universally all, higher representation. think voting trends among group generally represent better points crazy ones still mostly get lost noise. Though third party votes still might significant enough warrant retry next election cycle. 

The majority people though, believe vote party line, always vote Democrat Republican.

Therefore feel like best interest parties convince people voter turnout important, keeps power. actually takes away power people, even though seems counter intuitive.

I think people vote, right would personally die fighting protect, obsession voter turn outs campaigns like rock vote, vote die, get vote, feel like designed that.

I feel like parties already way much power say.

Ultimately however points matter much need serious voter reform. First past post archaic silly. even use kinds voting systems reddit see silly people vote, ESPECIALLY default subreddits. use moderators, even though theory need them. exactly electoral college supposed do, always poorly thought solution. Thanks rewriting history. NY watched Italy, Spain China unfold nothing early on. paid heavy price early inaction. Now, they’ve since righted ship Cuomo deserves credit that. new narrative NY everything right early troubles unavoidable simply true. didn’t lock quick enough. Even watching happened several countries. Oh ok Chinese put 160,000 American corpses ground, I'll admit almost big threat us guys.

Almost. Y'all would still winning 2,000 case. today. Shit, never thought that. ancestors came fleeing pogroms, pretty much flavor Tulsa massacre. parents third generation polish jews New York, almost totally different experiences understanding world long-term midwestern families... point, would anybody astonished anything happens here? Remindme! 3 months “this one going really fun” add, severely insufficient amounts tests available around mid April.  Fuck Disney, fuck anyone whose going pandemic 


(Fuck Disney 3 1/2 hours waiting phone cancel annual pass, couldn’t cancel someone call cancel within 48 hrs knowing last day cancel 11th month). Yes, delusional prize moron, got China, objectively failed stopping it. easier owners billionaires. college programs able test easily professional sports bubble. Put camps put American civilians ww2 everyone could something ridiculously simple wearing mask avoiding large gathering things like trying make work environments safer. Things could mostly normal months ago without significant effect economy.  live Minnesota, already midst pandemic itself. staying inside aside work essentials months, boy oh boy, wrong side history books sure flout give fuck. Oh well, fuck get sick possibly die. vaccine works... Personally, prefer South Dakota: Come motorcycles, stay ventilators. I’m gonna need XL dose please. Funny, nature doesn’t give fuck kids either. Natural selection takes prisoners. would even say term “very unlikely” putting mildly. point, six weeks enough.

In February, six weeks would enough. now, least eight weeks needed, eight weeks would need stringent.

Of course, put long enough, Trump dream postponed election. would feel lot safer Japan would  sure could be. strong trust science affected US bad. needs attention.

It's real affected ""them"" personally.

Once does, it'll real threat situation somehow ""different"" others. Peak hospitalizations already reached Houston.

Lol
Lol

Lol Lousy beatnik parents say dislike Fauci says? No, son. saying dont put eggs one basket. He’s Superman. 

We got shit do. So....Bye.

And one thing, nice call people names dont agree you. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Im 8 weeks pregnant im staying away everyone everything. Im Canada people think im reacting people still acting like pandemic. cousin asked could come visit stay us weekend. Like hell no. Surprisingly, masks found quite ineffective, specifically folded bandanas knitted masks.

This way shape form surprising. know I’m looking deep it, connotation word criminal insanely effective ostracizing people. It’s intentional we’re real. Someone high recognized this.

You smoke weed, get arrested convicted, become criminal. Donald J Trump, never convicted crime, immediately better person you. Regardless it’s true arrested two homeless people - one white, one black. real problem Americans know bad. never look outward world. idea people countries live.

They know countries free university, free healthcare, actual politicians, social programs, etc. 

To average American, America. Homeless people get treated like subhuman, different category discrimination altogether. Many suffer mental illness, American taxpayer cheap fund mental health treatment long time let people rot streets prison.

Racism real. absolute disregard homeless people's wellbeing. Two separate issues.

Sure. essential workers, families, coworkers expose along way there, way back, home sure didn’t choose exposed virus brought along ride. Good lord. problem it’s students school staff affected. people school building leave building every day. go communities, stores, etc. People need remember doesn’t stop doors school. Apparently mild-cases much likely reinfected second time may dangerous. theorised resistance proportional viral load.  me. went without working, finished college, burnt savings, maxed credit, hoping things could go back normal someday.

Now, work close proximity people care asthma, want become homeless. Soon borders open again, I'm getting fuck Huxlean Dystopia. Denial (It's hoax. flu)
After Anger (China! China Flu)
After Bargaining (Deaths up, people old)

Comes Acceptance (it's impossible contain) This. Exactly. fascinating coincidence vaccines, attempts lower incidence coronavirus, attempts lower rates obesity US met similar arguments dismissals uproars despite happening different years.  Remember time someone suggested kids school served healthy options help curb childhood obesity? Although smaller public scale, similarities anti-mask movement fascinating. wild privileged people without chronic diseases are. said drugs, meat, alcohol, thought, ok? anyway plus gluten. God salted fruit good. I've never liked sugary things fruit delicious. keep saying this. school going personal cruise ship....but worse account sharing busses day traveling teachers. gifted teacher rotates 4 schools every week. Siblings different schools. disposable surgical type masks easily obtainable days. surprised many people still using homemade face coverings. everything, specifically, yes, racist. Something like 3% reported cases included pink eye symptom, within there’s guarantee pink eye first symptom there’s way knowing wasn’t virus circling back body infect parts. 

Basically chances contracting via eye are, moment, thought relatively small. nothing guaranteed. Ugh totally understand feeling! eat patio months, yet even friends feel like taking seriously going breweries, road trips, eating restaurants. sick always person say ""No, I'm comfortable unacceptable risk"". seeing social media posts top real made question intelligence people previously thought smart. really pisses we’ve essentially lockdown NJ states goddamn ridiculous. never get back normal. go back college two classes person. going catch accepted, president says, ""it is."" ....... plan moving Canada finish bachelor's. Living north Buffalo area attest that. Here, coronavirus taken quite seriously heard single Karen trying get area without mask on. see people wearing masks, that's much crowded approaching somebody, that's wear one. part, mask things, life pretty much goes normal.

That's say New York safe. Buffalo still wide infection rate densely populated, NYC slow meeting requirements reopening. favorite picture. [Getting flipped car Double plus! WW2 US sacrificed drew together country. COVID-19 country needed draw together, people threatened lives health officials right get manicure.

This great power shell self. even unite time crisis. Trade schools make sense Especially public transit out. 

And lot places like, wait outside car we'll call come in. So, really can't basic stuff without phone internet. Can't fail try

*taps head knowingly* realized America doomed. Nothing shocks anymore. leather shall protect thee. sad. Contact tracing difficult country app it. People required register take temperature entering establishment. suppose Americans would scream violation rights lol.

Let Darwin sort out. red team doesn’t care. fight benefits. Rather population eat caca help. us do. Sigh. Don’t pack much you’ll back October Okay fuck decide open schools. just... what? well least one enlightened ones wears mask..good guess..  think best way we’ll able sort compare different countries different lockdown experiences fact see there’s common pattern Covid. I’ve heard anecdotes people delayed elective procedures proportion resulted death? two month period, many truly “elective” begin with, although number could rise time due things like missed cancer screenings. also need figure many extra deaths due truly Covid never tests autopsies necessary confirmation. example, point heart attacks interesting one, it’s possible certain number people avoided ER late, we’re also learning even people mild symptoms Covid later found higher rates heart inflammation found viral infections like severe flu. recent tragic case death 27-year old basketball player [Michael thought fully recovered Covid collapsed heart failure training. Hopefully autopsy reveal whether suffering continued heart inflammation related infection even so, may necessarily count Covid death. grandmother passed away last week.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* care. took many precautions could, people work taking precautions living life normally. home, presumptive positive, waterfall diarrhea, trouble breathing. angry fucking livid now. dad live gets this, people want family fucking die! already knew little people country concerned others, I’m ready fight anyone now. silence keep peace. That's fair. pairs families going still, social pressure something. Well, considerate people like there. meant (and you’re right drawn different conclusion comment) refer population quarantine; y’know, folks taking subways, etc. who’ve since day 1 probably already gotten it. recently coming lockdown around many already cannot transmit it. That’s understood sort things. Fairly rudimentary understanding, I’m thinking population density. eying grandmother's house? like this? Pretty sure second amendment things. people still call flu never heard flu anything like I'm sure news stories people got covid couple weeks. large issue USA's low participation social distancing, masks, etc, little enforcement. Normally, would something police do, a) lots people really like cops US right get mad suggesting cops ticket arrest everyone violates rules egregiously b) lots cops super psyched enforcing rules right a). Oh yes, also people get mad potential enforcement uneven impact socioeconomic/racial lines. (I totally disagree, btw, given huge houses parties reported LA recently.) Anyway, US much homogeneous society high social trust (eg, Japan, Finland, Sweden) everyone follow rules, also even enough cohesion cops trusted, rightly wrongly (I could care less correct; covid much, much important literally issue), enforcers state mandates supposed be. Nice right, else got? zero risk youth.
 
That's key word. 0.2% mortality rate children unbelievably high nearly preventable disease. infection rate US has, going result lot kids.
 children dead
 
Children died US COVID. 
 
Also childrens lives important ones? 45 year old father three? That’s good movie though. love theme song: Americaaaa...fuck yeah!” ""If kill bunch people, ok chose give fuck"" ""Focus control, let go can't.""

I hate basically everything country. Sadly, would say it’s virtually impossible. CDC absolutely produced approved list mask designs materials. absurd people using less/non effective masks achieve technical compliance mask regulations. Trust get accident bike highway, wearing helmet make difference it’s likely fatal guy bike. That’s there’s joke bikers needing insurance lol I've asking exact thing myself, like thought government smart Even 10% comply work much. hard polarized country agree something. low level people charge stipid. high level though, care. care give fuck die. see sports Hollywood seriously affected think ""Hmm, maybe something this?"" retardation Let Kushner help them!!! He’so talented!!! Thoughts prayers!!! It’s really supply problem!!! NBD!!! Kids: Hold beer. say best wrestling gimmicks guy playing characters personality dialled notches... absolutely well said  Christians gullible motherfuckers.  really hope sold already. always miss deals like these. male models? realized suspending student ugly reward, punished lifting suspension making come back school. Looooooool Maybe borderline paranoia, risk justified. wouldn’t advocate though people swarm trails even more. narrow trails run people it’s impossible close them. it’s busy means near constant close exposure random people. That’s go me. Maybe deep backcountry brings back fuck suppose get without stopping gas, using public restrooms, stopping fast food etc. it’s justifiable opinion. anyone asks advice would say no. time school start! Lord help me, I'm teacher. One other. Catholic Church organizing regularly superspreading events can’t complain leaders caught deadly VIRUS... addition old frail Would shut world flu? flimsy sheet paper like ballot would save us this! FTFY I'm beginning feel tinfoily side, cause they're popping world. Germany WELL. type think store run 2 employees time 2 people stock shelves, ring register, blow balloons, clean store , get carts, check masks. Oh ok. ""For presentation today, model solar system.""

""Why Mercury big?""

""Because favoritest planet the......""

""NO MASK YOU! NEXT!"" outdoor service take quick break lunch march protest fact can't indoor service. 

That's totally allowed. Paying Disney instalments lol maybe coherent message drummed populace since March.

""Behave like covid-19 want spread it""

""Be kind other""

""Behave like covid-19 want spread it""

""These step going take achieve goals. metrics use reopen economy."" 

Etc etc. 

Clear messages bi-partisan support delivered capable leader compassion. 

The US got remotely close coherent national strategy. Instead turning political issue rather public health one. 

Country size determine success failure. Look South Korea. Look Canada vs USA. Look Germany vs UK. don’t get it. many deaths unreported? people ignoring social distancing ones say dumb work. often point surges say, see social distancing didnt work. Ignoring bars packed, restaurants packed, clubs packed. really social distancing. test negative 14 day quarantine yes. fucking weird. rich trump-type uncle like this. insists everything fucked he's going die 5 years, sees reason double elitisms. Unable face fact they've lived lives waste cruelty, aee generally good people, driving lot current insanity imo. They're absolutely flailing mentally.  stupid ignore pandemic? selfish risk OTHERS lives wear mask? word karma exists reason. read related medical testing industry switching dual flu/corona tests Ahhh mask fashion phase evolving. Weirdos... awful feeling one, single cross-country superspreader event. 10M probably closer November. maxed testing capacities her*. think large part people forced work around people day. think much adding fun time around people too. god everywhere also attend zoom meeting... cyber sex , online friendships zoom based religion SAFER time being... ignorant arrogant. known hydroxychloroquine since early February, first studies China SK. extremely hopeful back then.

I’ve watched subsequent, properly structured studies fail discontinued. I’ve listened front line clinicians explain doesn’t work (in field). 

I also *common sense* know HCQ game changer, 100,000 people wouldn’t dead Brazil.

I’m optimistic dexamethasone lowering mortality rate bit.

I genuinely hope you’re able find way fog politicized misinformation conspiracies. That's exactly point. 

*Americans that.*

In US, contact trace name people. means contact tracing situations outside households, certain kinds workplaces certain kind personal gatherings next impossible.

Contact tracing US bar going difficult. weirds hardcore deniers. 
I've done deep dives diverse group strong fears: controlled behind scenes (anything deep state reptiloids), government taking/gonna take children cause pedo rings ritual, microchipped/enslaved, lives taken etc virus, obvious there, sidelined. feels absolutely bizarre. feel is, sadly, norm. That's went office, too. Oh certainly will. Easily 500k. aren’t nearly half way rough this. believe you. deal cattle singularly focused there. part time feeding gig living 100% work cattle feeders. Even farming involved all. cross talk hear right seems like otherwise hit mark. Agreed, also VT glad see atleast 90% mask adoption rate. glad live here. Sorry hear crappy masks! state live (not NJ), wearing cloth masks don’t think supplied Wawa could wrong. wear better made one? I’m worried bc shit ain’t right. able wear state says permissible work tell corporate suck it. Sorry troubles. I’m disgusted companies... especially ones don’t really give rat’s ass employees. trying sound cliche, I’m praying ass day us going work everyday. days feel like that’s I’ve got. live, shutdown really happen, people still mask on, grouping together socially, absolutely mobbing places business still open. Like whole families hanging walmart day ""bored."" ones hear bitching loudest again. even try first time. area can't place happened. got pregnant October, idea shit would happen. Every day pregnant stressful incredibly paranoid. gave birth hospital 41 cases covid, still incredibly paranoid. baby born 7 weeks old tired scared. 
The mask thing. wear it. Stop large gatherings. 
These certain people think people situations like mine. literally thinking mask inconveniences short period time. literally amazing me. Dollar Tree cashier checking $1 &amp; $5 bill (this back December). said people passed fake $1 bills store. like spends time fake $1 bill get dollar tree item free? said happened one store check every bill. live rural Utah! came say this. I'll give kids tried true tested vaccine. giving one developed 6 months rubber stamped Trump's FDA. No. found virus's RNA Diamond Princess 17 days later necessarily viable virus. early media reports wrong. It’s unstoppable, you’re bunch self entitled twats. Testing less positivity going back almost new high. anyone know testing reduction deliberate ore capacity/processing constraints? That's fine. wife take theirs! parties climate deniers.

It's still climate denial anything, suggest solutions orders magnitude insufficient. want quarantine next decade guess. eventually majority people say especially vaccine. people taking extreme faster lose support. Yea, maybe go back started stop using school tuition fund alternative season pass stupid fucking sports game Yes bold claim make. what’s idea social distancing? don’t see Americans socially distancing all. right wing Facebook friends nutshell. don’t know even fb account anymore. People dumb Australia managed sail pretty squeaky clean first big outbreak weeks ago, escalating one highest population density cities led 6 weeks hard lockdowns.

I think numbers low people matter getting lucky playing russian roulette, eventually spark likely ignite flammable tinder. yeah, i've criticized cuomo de blasio acting late, earliest time would realistically taken action would early march opposed late march. competent federal government, governors would notified threat time january federal government itself--which run deficit spend amounts money state governments can't even come close to--would established nationwide testing contact tracing infrastructure. many state governors acted late expecting kind federal assistance (though ever expecting they've four years see kind people charge executive branch senate mystery). state-by-state strategy virus ignores state boundaries unworkable, US's failure deal virus lies squarely federal government's apathy. Swimming lessons neighborhood still on. Ppl send kids over. What’s wrong them? Via phone cell tower records accept maybe sports best idea PANDEMIC? playing beach volley (my favorite sport) really worth superspreading everywhere??? chance get anywhere near many.  Thanks. That's exactly would've expected. Lmao Fuck people. aren’t Christians. kinda park ranger, wouldn’t surprised. People work woods tend eccentric best way possible lol. open proven wrong, can’t find anything recommending masks outdoor settings appropriate distancing easily maintained Answer question 100%. We're seeing little jump cases province, touted example follow, Canada right because, hey, guess what, people throwing big house parties crowding bars. like, duh. masks help little, also washing hands, touching face, ears, etc., washing mask, etc etc. huge elements procedure; masks be-all-end-all. 

So many relatively harmless activities getting ragged (let's shame cyclists!) big kahuna still Social Distancing. called months ago. Haven’t missed call yet. questioning authenticity article too, badly written. I'm still 100% misinformation. Oh. troll. cries *everywhere*. EU deaths elderly homes. one country managed timely protect vulnerable (and include medical personnel without proper PPE), despite China forewarning virus attacked primarily I’d rather people responsible maintain social distancing much possible, sure fire preventive measure taken slow spread covid.

Instead people YOLO’ing large gatherings picnics like nothing happening. That's human trafficking... farm stimulus poorly executed. least cattle feeders.

That's big surprise, parts economic stimulus perfectly executed problems. Yeah, totally impossible enforce wearing masks. saw friends FL arguing this, guess denial NYC handled shit. Got Covid test free post, took 2-3 days get results. America really really need universal health care. honestly dunno clinical name usual name worse, sound rather silly  even know content message was.......

You know content message directly responding to? left Grocery store Walmart (forgot necessity needed run in), NW metro Minnesota (Shurburn/ Anoka cnty). 99% folks wearing masks attempting social distance.

Is perfect way first time grip I've seen majority community trying right thing. Hope continues see fruit actions continue incentivise stubborn refuse see data. best numbers. Huge numbers. Ask anyone. 'experts' tell numbers biggest ever seen before. ask me, Mr President, best numbers. think biggest issue doom gloom like people say “fuck it, gonna die anyway might well go Disney World go college party”. 

Posting stuff implies never end doesn’t seem like productive way get people board right thing. Um, [literally State testing like week FL hurricane. short 3 day dip. lag testing labs what's hiding obvious data. Grow pair make decision big 10 way million US deaths. Way go! FINALLY. feel like I'm one 2 people taking public transit ever actually wear mask. stressful. annoying. likes listen talk playing music. That's generous you. Lowest \*reported\* infection rate

I'm hopeful enough people saw hoax take seriously also Trump/Giuliani state I'm holding breath

I found nationwide mortality statistics overall specific NYC, numbers lot higher reported Covid deaths

I'll believe data points best numbers. Huge numbers. Ask anyone. 'experts' tell numbers biggest ever seen before. ask me, Mr President, best numbers. believe he’s looking it. Wife surgery Spain. Took PCR emergency room waited outside 1,4-2 hours test came back negative. That’s fast, they’re using new kind test routine developed Basque uni north. 

Routine testing thousands people
Occur daily here, based outbreaks registered certain places. Get result day.  knew gonna comment like lol ok America ? seem I'll. ? Im literally terrified alma mater high school go back. went school prison pipeline school everyone disadvantaged poor fuck. parents already struggle predisposed ethnicity conditions. sickening poor make u easily get virus. Theyre 2 days remote 3 days home. even fucking do? kids cant normally go school. Yesterday girlfriend went Costco. walked walked time another couple. guy walked mask (which currently required), got past greeters, took mask shopping, put back walk out. FUCK wrong people? didn’t heart lie medical condition like everyone else town. 

Probably 1/6th people come business medically exempt apparently — that’s case, BIG fucking problems environment Yes, care much! difficult around quite people either dont believe worse flu dont take seriously me. Rio come! No. one stupid fucking country cares. one ever cared. one care even kills them. Seriously? Sounds like POTUS, less testing means fewer cases.

More time means feedback people vaccinated. data points better less. I'd rather get feedback 3 million vaccinated 30,000. additional time see there's significant negative side effects worth effectiveness. know like blindly put stuff body without knowing much could do. still think hard shut 4-6 weeks, could get back track. national guard something deliver groceries can’t stock prior to. everyone hunkers down. Gradually open everything back *functional* contract tracing protocols place. 

Shutting everything 4-6 weeks less economic impact stretching half ass attempt mitigation months end. Congratulations, invented PABR! surprised r/leopardsatemyface people think [this suggests case mortality rates flu coronavirus almost identical? data particularly interesting come source year.  He’s Latino doesn’t count lot Americans. Please make difference polls. Literally everything said ive seen said people telling people keep faith flat earth, anti-vax, Bill gates microchips, etc. means nothing. sound like housewife whose spent much time Instagram. 69 days? Nice.

This ironic many ways  cruise ship allows everyone go home spread germs every day. Sounds like sweet vacation. actually fierce people warning fought vigor lethal pandemic flu would be.

Instead, everyone wanted placate whiners short-sighted businessmen. Well, virus incapable caring hardly intimidated bravado. That's protocol nursery work at. child shows symptoms, employee isolate classroom parent arrives, employee child leave. employees elderly, isnt great. scared kids get sick, I'm also really scared me. remarkable selfish, self righteous people.

God lived he's still good shape before, still trouble breathing. shits joke, can't everyone little respect people's health safety? really hate here

Oh, telling people happened dad still make change Negative. replying say people similar situation you. You’re delusional. You’re likely sanest family. I’m sorry family reckless unsupportive.

Not doctor scientist. *shrugs* Politics. may base, essentially answer unemployment pay / one time check US went with. Except everyone?

Its much simpler solution since, like check (in US) recieved, rely states deliberately crippled unemployment systems. Egads, that's terrible. little 24 hours mother-in-law back April. thought maybe testing good there. live \~\~state\~\~ \*country\* majority believe political issue.

FTFY. also live said country whether want live sick become political issue. really hope get lucky second wave dire predictions come true, even many facts lending towards exact end. Sad celebs governments job need sort figures hold government accountable numerous bad decisions. No, really care.

N c e exactly

No exactly means. careful whatsoever ignorant wear condom face prevent COVID. science right? way get total picture situation excess deaths. important know many people die COVID specifically, lot problems count numbers, honestly relevant question we're trying answer ""How much extra life lost result COVID?"". 

Lots people lives lengthened road, tons shortened covid specifically, lots lives shortened able receive care result hospital capacity. roll one number, it'll mostly wash +deaths -deaths, except covid, best, least manipulable rough estimate get. Make sex. 69 heh people backing Republican party make lot money privatized health care. truly sad Asia Europe gone stuff goes air. they'll wear mask. first time American's gone get sick, family die wake up. 

This going shine HUGE light lot stuff broken needs change. college football basketball system. majority players black. College rely money fund non money making sports, like track, lacrosse, volleyball, swimming, baseball more. mostly sports black people would play (besides baseball). sports make college money, need football players play. care health. players want play could loss college scholarship. 

People film production work since February. Less movies shows come 2021. 

Mortgage eviction protection expired. renewed see wave people selling homes home prices fall hard 2021. 

The people wear masks make people wearing masks. Wear masks way 2021. ignorance lack respect. follow see leaders wearing them. 

I'm realtor huge wave coming. want make money real estate market. Shared living make money. rent rooms. whole place family room. always. want read book, wtf $40! 



Time check library... point think want catch die already. RIOTERS SPREADING COVID RIOTERS SPREADING COVID RIOTERS SPREADING COVID RIOTERS SPREADING COVID We're lot positive syphilis tests hospital COVID stuff. saying. itching dump kids back school problem either.

Are parents actually like this? Well, suppose working families buy Trump conspiracy lies (weird preface conspiracy lies) might since less means provide/secure childcare. Shit, way I'm sending kids school, \*even\* tried provide distance learning. 

I'm also telling young people highschool college work distance learning value lives might live with. Hell, subbed university I'm seeing much clusterfuck whole student dorm situation there. 

It makes sense one learns university business first, place provides valuable education young adults second (or honestly sometimes even top ten considerations depending school go to). Sounds like game developers, teachers, nurses, increasingly doctors, EMTs, I've learned professors basically increasingly controlled business interests. pay jobs go management insists lucky work field many would dream in. 

I also find ironic business minor growing small business environment I'm aware antisocial things business person/owner, easily neutral pro-social things. sucks unless laws holding \*all\* businesses account, guys like eventually get edged competition willing cut corners behave unethically get lower prices customers, many hidden costs outsourced society. costs mostly borne vulnerable. yeah, regulations bad, enough regulation absolutely necessary. 

Sorry got onto rant, there's much shit going on.. Hey hey hey! Everything fine... classes come back again. I’ve seen bunch n95 better Lowe’s recently. places Ontario allowed open restaurants indoors gyms etc. Due low cases refreshing see COVID still taken seriously. 
Less 30 active cases city free-for-all re-opening (mask wearing, designated time slots, hand sanitizer everywhere, limited capacities). 

Now worried school starting.... issue public knowledge dissemination. bar across hotel (that doesn’t serve food) open covertly whole time local police openly refused enforce mandates so... else do? great fascist said, 🤷 Seriously? Wait weeks/months fucking shitshow? Yup! Except 5 million cases number testing started back Feb/March. number active cases.  I'm still shocked lack media attention getting healthier this. Sure, masks masks masks. losing weight, eating better, exercising save life better mask. obese better waiting year+ vaccine. nah, push solution all. lockdown like countries Except article title horribly misleading girl none things age, everyone try come, place. never many birthdays get celebrate together! Knowing way chinese govt thinks, probably put ban markets lift years. Step 1. Ignore everyone says this. 

Step 2. Read Virtually impossible stop [in US] now. way round, since antibodies studies results started show up, death rate proven way lower projected, time many people decided move lives . Late April mobility data started strong recovery. mean. Walmart Iowa. get much lower that, kind expected. folks say don’t need mask god protect people say need gun protection. Also Hudson Valley! Never thought would see someone else. lot people everyone’s wearing masks. really say going volunteer nursing assistant deciding wear mask around incredibly insane. exactly resolution anecdotal predicament? trapped. isn't. Several countries getting second waves. Brussels go back lock down. stupid? true all. Majority fail wear mask properly give fit make excuses told to. people given dumbest people never cared since beginning. gave honestly, care people anymore. failing wear mask denied treatment vaccine. Gavin Newsom irredeemable fucknut serious future state's children. haphazard rush reopen resulted storm new cases, he's done fuck turn tide, instead preferring go twitter every day whine mask wearing. saying end political career downvoted. editorial boards local bay area newspapers beginning agree last.

Santa Clara County, case growth continues hum along 200 new cases per day. time Gavin leads gets fuck way lets someone take wheel. Job wants car, cant afford car long term job. cycle continues grow. can't rely CA case data right data reporting system broken. huge scandal. got sources prove Covid causes lifetime permanent damage? something wrong wealthy celebrities able donate wealth schools, schools money, somting wrong tax system well priorities nation. anyone think virus planned? I'm normally conspiracy theorist, know people dying world, worse US. believe virus bad say, Trump puppet puppeteer? can't Putin. I'm saying yes, sucks daughter developed anxiety pandemic situation, good reason go back normal that, many people die. hasn’t given dime unenjoyment. 

Maybe dime, sounds like there's lot unenjoyment given. People revel schadenfreude, people getting sick spreading unsuspecting low wage workers etc diligently wearing masks. pandemic, us vs mentality terms humans vs virus.

Not mention people still laws OP. OP might right probably want see spouses family die. May God mercy us all. Imagine Mr. Rogers became U.S President? We’d nuked Earth next day.  get it. young too. probably feels like jail kids.

And likelihood 20somethings get need hospitalization. However, I'm fat 42 year old mild hypertension I'd prefer get take chances. mean easy issue commands couch, towards specifically, see LOT comments like, ""what do"" ""I'm hiding goes away"". attitude allowed stupid take control narrative. voices reason? Lol HIV cure. Lol ok COVID-19: ""Ohhh look, open buffet line"" Small town bars, diners, gas stations spreader. Especially small town places less stringent others distancing masks. Yeah Sweden fucking fine now. Texas. tests cases. give up. ""Trevors"" think immortal. outdated. Oxford's vaccine (for example) [mRNA vaccine candidates would also flexible durable germs tend evolve mutation, coronaviruses, influenza, HIV. could help lead universal vaccine would work multiple strains virus, says Margaret Liu, chairman board International Society Vaccines. Theres commercial cable, youtube hulu advertising super low airline tickets saying ""thay may never low buy tickets now!!!!""  Protestors wore masks. There's plenty research show large spread virus. contrast, absolute morons like Herman Cain anti-science right wing morons died, infected plenty others total stupidity. 

Luckily, problem rapidly taking care itself, though cost rest us remains open question. 6200 dead moved people nursing homes along side vulnerable. played political point scoring cheeseface. Hardly great job. man cried cried enough ventilators got wanted never used get late. majority never used! could mandate lockdown, could mandate masks, could enforced rule law instead allowing protests kick Spending fortune paint stupid ""BLM"" message outside Trump tower unironically giving 15 police officers protect it! man politician. mouth substance low character snake opinion. like violent brother ran park days apparently catching covid week pretending isolation. Yeah great work. comparison, UK positivity rate 0.50%. country handled badly European standards well... European, I’m confused US don’t impose hard lockdown?

Like Spain, Italy, New Zealand etc. back March?

Your government really don’t care they? make light number, indeed getting frightening think much, much go. imagine Europe Black Death witnessing half human population die disease. 50% previous immunity related coronaviruses. Plus 25% got Sars2. 75% immunity. way NYC ‘got control’. NY terrible job, didn’t suddenly start great 2 months pandemic. ran fuel fire. fellow teacher, sorry. Sending strength. r/holdmybible anyone? No. 

&amp;#x200B;

Americans selfish give shit others, exposing all. Well cared millions Iraquis, Lybians Syrians died name ""democracy"". many killed terrorist groups sprung countries harm countries. 

They gone, americans care. 

So suprise guys even care own. Yup. Thank help! preop patient dual laminectomy. I’m lot better now. minor hip pain that’s left. could barely wall testing sights us (drs note required) testing sights everyone else. looks dangerous.. can't wear masks? What's problem?? Really? still way less 1% chance. Elections consequences. 3 live NY New Jersey :( carney work back highschool, older rides like originals becoming archaic point. basically require constant maintenance.

Maybe wouldn’t deal shit still exposing problem. Schools open fucking doomers. Stop going science. CDC ya boy Fauci agree Yes course you’re right, one side deserving threats, would maskless, idea commenter trying convey. 

Still, threats bad. dismissing fatter peolle worthy caring treatment you’re doing. Fat people obviously get heart attacks need vascular interventions. don’t deserve either? point people people, death statistics matter even fat people. mean apparently took mother 9 months hear us complaining.

I’d rather not. I'm going defend people people masking summer, forget discouraged wear mask early parts spring. look post comments early article links sources, cares ""It's OK insult you, dare insult us!""

I’d like hear exactly? Right. MASK makes look weak. God dammit want fucking truth. don’t know believe anymore, can’t trust government right now. Good news seems fake, it’s hard think Florida improving. 23 states, half deaths nursing homes. 

Given concentration deaths places specific use, I'm sure data valid draw conclusions here. would probably exclude nursing home deaths totals evaluate density claims here. Ya aluminum standoff come dumber time.

A lot people states deposits aluminum cans (Michigan) recycle covid worst.

We created aluminum shortage :/

But ya need team Canada. least trade, visiting understand want US country better? Name one. 1. Avoid indoors spaces - e.g. get groceries delivered curb side pick up
2. meet friends trust onsite jobs
3. Wear high quality (N95 better) mask go public indoor space. They're available Ebay.

Otherwise there's nothing need do. Outdoors 100% safe, go enjoy summer :) Roger that.

The annoying part understand healthy mindset right now, can't seem shake it. Keep leaning that, pretty soon realize waste time fake religion is. Thats good.

And personally still good person godless. TL;DR:

A fitted, non-valved N95 works best. surgical mask works almost well.

Typical pleated semi-fitted cotton cotton/poly-blends work well, valved N95.

Single ply cotton quite well.

Bandannas KNITTED (?!) masks work well wearing fleece gaiter seems worse going maskless breaks large droplets smaller bits float around longer.  Yep. coffee. teach Reddit awake.

I’ve working home going anywhere. person we're talking about, math problem mean countries who’s held schools open without everyone dying getting sick. 

I don’t think unnecessarily much doomsday helping, schools still open couple months without everything going hell. It’ll easy say “see, die”. 

Well shit, perhaps keeping open caused another 50 000 die.  dankest timeline can't help think country failed, grew thinking checks balances could prevent somebody unqualified becoming president are, 160k+ needless deaths plague ravaging country feel ashamed live here.

OK

But USA fragile &amp; incosiderate, euro countries got hit hard! K. interesting CNN blacklisted sub Foxnews

Yup, everyone went Bay Area route early stuck it, would fare better including NY.

Avoiding indoor public places smart, even states mandatory mask laws smart. Wearing high-quality mask (N95 better) rather cloth mask smart. Restricting circle people seeing smart. keeping kid indoors smart - 100% safe go hike public, even people there. walking around town - virus spreads indoors. China South Korea excellent examples scaling containment absolutely effective done properly.

I'm arguing can't contain virus larger populations. I'm saying *it scale* much agree policies NZ can't overlook factors explain they're well.

For example need disproportionately contact tracers densely populated city person contact people. scaled need amount per 100,000. think Trump teach us maybe little social media management good while. think paternalistic restrictions work country like ours. wish developed economy way utter destitution threaten us. fight lost long time ago repellent shit show pandemic response get live consequence. I'm right ya Here's 'Recovery' trial website. definitely used acute critical care UK, would imagine developed countries.

Much work needed follow patient outcomes, look dexamethasone use variety populations.

Im aware trials looking Dexamethasone, lot suggestions various publications works needs done second wave expected happen October (sonce that's cold flu season begins)? speaks nothing death rates compare country Europe (or EU?). honestly think country pretty well far best help allies. numbers rising again, yet government acts proactive people enrage barely freedom taken away. unable provide family hilarious 😂🤣🤣

Quick answer last question: YES. Nobody receive threats. women treat men harshly can’t get erection.

Not harshly men treat women it. experience man trying blame ED. Telling fault. Going completely psycho me. Sadly, common experience women try discuss sex issues SO. 

If anything women expected (and indoctrinated) tiptoe around men's feelings. protect us getting beat murdered. even tell woman simply don’t want sex.

It women fake illness get sex. Shit, society makes jokes it. Like tell man headache expect ""no"" answer funny. Afraid looking weak? try ventilator look sometime...

Ace, re-examine priorities / conclusion... Yeah agree. People need wake realize good chunk country still extremely racist; good chunk country poorly educated manipulated; good chunk country give shit anyone vote interests. people hear likely majority, likely loudest, mean exist, large numbers still. There's problem US people either saying problem everyone else, problem Everyone moving goal posts. I've moved goal posts. Doomers have, optimists have. still pretty bad though. hell watch?  Right? Apparently everyone amnesia months ranting “lockdowns leadership work! look Europe! got right, fucked up!” There's lot data nextstrain: basic conclusion Influenza Covid single stranded RNA viruses, Covid larger genome (~15 vs 30 kbp) proofreading mechanism causes less mutations per bp. effects cancel total number mutations equal. someone speak German, hard would move Germany? Obviously, I'd work learn language time, much would knowing German hinder experience meantime? Canada averaging 400ish cases day 37 million people. 

California, similar population Canada, currently averaging around 7000 cases day 15-20x cases. 

We're definitely immune stupid people, great job compared US. Jokes them. look weak fuck without masks.

They look like village idiot. look like discharged phlegm society. fellow college kids move ins that? I'm still going school seems wonderful job handling COVID. staggering move times, requiring masks everywhere campus besides dorm rooms making social distancing possible common areas.

So seems, way, idiots deniers really Darwining gene pool. woman Spain. know read? even capable reading comment? seems clear answers people care, shocked this, taking appropriate measures, one third denial keep pandemic going.

I'm American living Thailand, crazy different response here, unified. in-country transmission corona two months there's way could get train without mask on, walk around grocery store wearing one, even now. surprised minority seem care, probably like 5% population.

Asians inclined take group thinking; American individualism seem help. shocking conservative media saw division take up, denying pandemic real, following Trump rejecting use masks important. 42% Americans affected this. means, vaccine work THEM, people around protected.

Just FYI vaccine probably come end 2020 might long. Reminder: **FOXNEWS** highest ""news"" viewership USA far. They're ones pushing doubt science, masks, etc. ""talent"" like Hanity Tucker Carlson nothing snark seriousness virus. cannot convince people watch FOXNEWS nightly serious issue. Lol, registered nurse here, know ECMO is. Google it. TIL, guess. deserve walk...IMHO stereotypical American live today that's POTUS.

Yes. woman. know read? thought weird Americans fear zombie apocalypse easy stop. understand why. dad told stop sheep choose wear mask waited outside take out. multiply 3 Manhattan ghost town. mass population exodus, real estate prices crashing. 

Not sure Florida, but, I’ve seen things quiet busy Orange Volusia counties. Real estate florida absolutely booming. actually easy stop. Americans fuckin stupid stubborn listen reason. I've reading OB nurses post reddit talking they're noticing higher incidence stillbirths. article found. I’m sure you’re getting enough encouraging responses, I’m add it. First foremost, shit scary it’s best interest intelligent bastion quality genetics within family safe survive. I’ve fucking depressed, hopeless, unemployed, watching roommate go god knows what, sheltered home, last 3.5 months. pneumonia like symptoms 7 weeks still thought flu. Anyway, Finally got dads 1200 miles away. Still unemployed, found way around someone takes serious do. People going need get ill fuck, watch friends die, befriend someone working front lines believe shit since folks think fake news. Jackass chief ol’ bonespurs helping. 

As job, I’m still looking, 10% America. 

Also, dough came government thought wasn’t going get damned thing. Stay positive. You’ll get bailed out. risk family members care grandparents. Long term effects still unknown even healthy experience mild cases. honestly hope I'm overreacting- would best case scenario. thats . . . . thats exactly said. Well Desantis super positive great Florida doing. help? Trump months positive disappearing? helpful. 

I'm sorry, positivity seriously plan? That's got fucking mess! 

Just please tell positivity fixes anything? People dying. How? Happy cake day Florida. COVID previously doesn’t make immune. chance I’m willing take life especially long term effects. 

If covid infection confer least two weeks immunity we'd see millions cases reinfection. catching footballs catching corona ""loophole"". mean private sale compromise?

Further, Dems chance pass bill would open NICS background checks private sales (closing said 'loophole'), shot include national registry. Assholes using private sale background checks political bargaining chip. Ok keep breaking mental health “safe”. holding mail bag 3 days isn’t OCD don’t know is. Notice said, feel necessary families safety. gave story experiences far. everyone gets get paid sitting home smug people keep working. 

I’ve worked public since day 1 people won’t wear mask one R word states. I’ve touched many peoples phones, one dirtiest germ infested devices known man moment, many employees co workers. Zero us gotten sick, 3 tested negative. Real world experience real world data, like every front line worker. Thanks input though. 

Mind take precautions serious, sneeze guard, masks, sanitizer, air purifier, wash hands, UV lights (had cell repair already), Lysol, gloves wanted etc. don’t want like anyone else here. In-laws going parties since March. everyone sick. don’t know happened. 

They haven’t wanted talk us since wouldn’t allow over. 

Now want support. 

Nope. woman moron. 

Learn read. Yes, yes, yes. thousand times yes.

The fact spent entire adult life one bad emergency away poverty start Covid. fact repeatedly turned medical care afford start virus. Racism homophobia start here, end either.

Unnecessary deaths due government failure? Even that's new.

All hope people continue pay attention. Risk losing everything far outweighs risk getting someone else sick.  impossible one side unreasonable benefit. It’s cause one left get is. 😂😉 thing? Links? I’ve never even heard reported likely covid deaths. Many states don’t haven’t. excess death toll tell true tale. 5 million lot people? course doesn't, that's health care tied employment retarded. say life isn’t money proceed say people without jobs need $2,000 month government survive on. see flaw logic? read mind!

Please PM us need anything ♥ would take risk myself, considering child’s odds survival higher flu First outbreaks uncontrolled concentrated certain areas. areas isolated first strict lockdown happened, hospitals overflowing patients transferred hospitals regions countries. enough known virus, tests starting mass produced hospitals involved packed like trenches war. stark difference death rate. could acted preemptively avoided this. experience use it. That's what's infuriating. hope come dick truly hope guys get together. really thought stat cash. reality, people barely afford $500 emergency actually consumer (and auto, maybe house) debt, worth less zero. Thanks.

She speciality that’s uniquely suited illness, Docs region skill set distant.

It sucks region carrying like nothing happening even wife’s hospital pleads community act slow spread.

My kids haven’t store restaurant since February, wife hasn’t building wasn’t hospital house since March, grocery stores short trips days off, rare I’m highly dependent Instacart Grocery Pick up.

Quick trips nature lots back yard time home school set hospital wouldn’t well got sick missed work. Europe population 741 million people 19 million coronavirus cases, 731.000 deaths. USA population 350 million 5 million cases 162.000 deaths. 

Europe twice population 4 times cases 6 times deaths. 

🤷🤷🤷 yeah USA ones bad. know makes worse? everyone else taken seriously like beginning, virus would gone now.

And would free join pleasantries without worry! RemindMe! 4 months SARS burnt out, eradicate it. majority population still vulnerable nothing compare think you’re correct. guess, what’s average percentage assholes places you’re familiar with? Labs running full capacity it’s nearly impossible buy testing machines. Annoy roche running full capacity make machines, it’s enough. isn’t problem money solve problem spans entire production pipeline raw materials finished tests. way faster one accept infected americans countries Higher income average, strictly mean every single person income x$ annually China less x$ annually Vietnam. oppotunities different, jobs also follow supply demand, mate. Communism paper like, China Vietnam. breonna taylor murdered police broke home shot multiple times asleep bed. that's civil disobedience dumb fuck. Covid going away 2 years. I'm American can't speak American reality feel like people 6-12 months left following guidelines. vaccine means ease restrictions go lives still careful. realistic think people accept continuing like available vaccine, lot already care. weren’t Abel see through, huh? SARS-CoV-1 example guess. would upset Canadians Covid?

I'm upset Canadian's self-righteous attitude lack sympathy. Trump nothing it. Blame blame makes difference assholes live Canada pretend virtuous. Give time things subside, please go. Unless full shit. That's funny 1675 also year America's healthcare system stuck surprised, deaths US follow curve everyone else's. seen correlation social distancing/lock reducing deaths. sad. Death curve Sweden (little social distancing, lock down) France Spain (full lock 4-6 weeks). Ireland hole Europe fears American vacation Why?! let kids get infected?! one two kids die first month school? fuck wrong people?! online learning running immediately two days diagnoses, certainly implemented least semester.  Damn America. like Sweden. giving shit certain part population. Idk..I've known people sick..I've known people died..before time .. absolutely true, truth gets downvoted sub. told still told hospitals brink overwhelmed. Yet...it happened yet field hospitals built absolutely nothing. Unless I'm misunderstanding mean, think that's exactly excess deaths measures. totally feel it, work BSL3 research lab hospital nothern Italy, middle crisis allowed help diagnostics technicians reasons. really sucked, go work anyway reasons would liked help.  orchestrating push masks literally popped nowhere weeks ago? went basically full year Afghanistan, combat zone, without able hold see family person. returned, still limited phone Skype calls eventually left active duty. Sure get visit occasionally garrison, way filling ridiculously long pass packet, much love family, learn operate without life every second.

So quit bitching get yourself. family fine without face-to-face time little while. reason speak ill either neighbors, north south, right part problem crap talking. Lol nobody wants Americans bro. Go back country. government listening loud minority population, called “silent majority” Tbh feel like lots areas boroughs close herd immunity give reason, think making statement (2) upholding integrity (3).

So guess either supposed take blame everyone else's mistakes... opposite, washing hands whole thing take responsibility mistakes.

Yes, idea what's happening there. ""Let's shut whole country save old people die anyways simultaneously go bankrupt able afford basic medical necessities"" Shit hitting fan California hot minute now. Things got exacerbated data issues occurred...issues officials apparently early knowledge of. irresponsible least state imply case numbers better that. Bay Area better people actually follow rules, 1k deaths 8 millions says all. Texas Florida reaches 20k+ deaths, they're also going reach herd immunity like NY, earlier. Let's honest, getting teenagers anything want basically impossible. That's reason school openings terrible idea!

Let's say, school enstates strict mask policy. Yay, 2 days later. ""cool kids"" ""cool kids"" wear masks chin warmers talk ""taking man"" $200 jeans $200 overpriced much bass Beats Dre headphones chins plugged anything (seriously teenagers, hell about)and Strokes would like totally blow mind. get detentions/suspensions. come heroes. week 2. Everybody school wearing masks chin warmers. detention/suspend entire school? ""cool kids"" take one step further. (gasp) stop wearing masks all. Sticking *man*, cycle repeats. Well that's fucking ominous. true, guess point need little social interaction internet alone satisfies needs. need social interaction still lean internet least partially satisfy needs. filter trolls, even internet friends still friends. still socializing we? Yikes I'll grant draconian remark. 

But fully doubt China's numbers anything close reported. Nothing reported official sources considered truth. one country superb covering up; people's republic. think reconsider stance China.

But that's topic here. 1:2000

So still less common full blown schizophrenia article sourced study read, neurological issues also include mild headaches, took decent chunk 55%

Not negligible, remind read articles look sources bring info. USA #1 :) Like, literally entirely American president's fault. upset Canadians this, want protect loved ones, entitled dimwitted thing witnessed week, that's really saying something. refusing wear masks! Also parties, BBQs, going vacation/traveling 🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️ live DC people living like COVID over. pretty consistently 30-50 never cases day (still lot city almost 700k) yesterday jumped 100 cases 😳. walk around see packed bars, apartment building I'm seeing people get elevators groups 5 drunk/with alcohol hang inside every time go outside, partner's work trying make go back office September... Meanwhile 2 co-workers COVID right another went vacation Florida last week 🙄. Damn, roommates pinnacle dork... TL;DR: Trump No. things suckers. Enjoy! countries want germs. Bad time travel. Dear Europe; yes, us care. Unfortunately become country focused individual freedoms way many people think anything proven stop spread controlling. People would rather threaten sue minimum wage workers telling wear mask take necessary steps protect others. People would rather continue risk public health going festivals, restaurants, water parks, etc. help slow spread simple act staying home. depressing people care, watching country continues struggle worse outbreak country time watching people claim hoax deciding virus inconveniences them. 
 
So yes, care. unfortunately many us care affecting individual every day lives stead caring protect others difficult time. pandemic ""great"" right wing party. get act tough become popular. country center right party enacted strict measures elections June landslide.


But right crazy anti right nothing makes sense. little, means little kids. NYC learned hard way stop iatrogenic death via assertive conservative management protocols like posturing, low flow O2, etc (Established Chiropractic Management). US much better chiropractic manages healthcare. ""we're gonna die anyway really cares"" call natives authority? Apaches. heard while!! lol America baned world first. 

There reason border Canada USA closed since COMMERCIAL traffic still allowed. course, tell I'm ignorant American. 7,780,000,000 go.... Lots schools partnering Broad institute testing. sure Cornell one them. type N95 masks used construction effective novel coronavirus valves. change things like schools reopening motorcycle superspreader event? COVID death lagging indicator, 5.35 based n 1. Another death blows 5.9 water. You’re also comparing annual mortality 5.9 versus COVID rate what, 3 months? Thanks, test mid July taken 9.30am results back text 6am. Good going. negative thank f.

And isolated waiting result unlike idiot went three pubs mates. lol. Pretty sure America fair share. sympathies. u I’m sorry care explain correlation COVID “systemic racism”? What? literally crowned emperor. ""saving democracy""?  frequently spend time away partner visa reasons. places friends like see regularly. single/alone people introverts, that's problems I'm trying highlight are. people died two morbidities more, hard imagine average would lived much longer. Besides hospitals inflating covid deaths make money. fact fellow American citizens make COVID, deadly virus, political opinion, religious belief dumb shit faith trust country. Found Ohio State fan. Yet conservatives know crowing know anyone died thus big deal. I'm China's numbers Malaysia state like 30 cases day exporting cases countries means thousands assume Disney World, Disneyland one probably one reliable rides. Outside renovations, rarely seen past 15 years. world literally experiencing pandemic built border around third world country. can't see family. failed. Womp womp. Yep, coming generation make good. Like generation fought last war good. problem sons, good ruin like boomers did. Rinse repeat. dumb, boring reason die. Surrounded crazy people, listening boring speeches dumb things.

If gonna risk it, least get checks bucket list. thrill kill, orgy, something. I'm American told new friend read New Zealand Covid free acted weird giving sorta goofy looks said ""I dunno that"" skeptical an' shit. really believe first mention fact. I'm starting think believing would make embarrassed country he'd rather go denial route. weird. Agree disagree. mean....using average death rates, roughly 1 150 Americans died something since start year. really proof this? 

I'm aware widespread population testing flu would prove asymptomatic spread low. I'd love see though it. No, modi announced lockdown 4 hours enforcement without safety net, made huge amount people inside city already deep trouble Covid go home east india north individual job money. lockdown ironically created national spread. 

Slum satiation already turned around countryside cities Delhi Mumbai, received huge amount workers two cities going hill.

At moment, Indian government acknowledge community Plus closer 5%. 3.66% factors people still virus. people longer virus, ""closed cases"" 95% ""recovered"" 5% died.

But know, recovered mean perfectly fine now. hate people use like that. Sorry, still best. sit argue day who's personal experience accurate reality USA spends healthcare R&amp;D anywhere else world.

It “Shut two days”. weekend? Asking much America can't believe employee told get back sunken log standing side ride safety hazard. go every two weeks family shopping. 

This last trip, went six stores. One sign saying customers *should* mask on, five signs saying masks mandatory.

Saw tons no-mask customers locations. Saw nobody enforcing anything.

Makes wonder doesn’t make problem worse deniers leave thinking, “See? can’t legit they’re taking rules seriously. It’s mollify sheep.”

Never mind, that’s crazy talk. idiots think 150k dead liberal hoax would never million years use word “mollify.” fast - he's done great job far, decision regarding schools disaster waiting happen. Everywhere else opened shut promptly. There's plan associated reopening, crowded areas downstate delays testing means time close schools back down, spread picked pace us shutting everything again.

Hopefully he'll come senses within month that's left places. local grocery store security guard door spraying rubbing alcohol people's hands monitoring things since March much trouble turning maskless people away became mandatory.


 Bus drivers enforcing blame them. city issues bus drivers getting attacked years, ironically caused install barriers next leading pandemic least going started. mask mandate state. one wearing mask store besides workers. Laat heard October. Look nyt vaccine race article, it’s updated daily game Sweden. That’s end score. You’re going compare who? Nobody. country went route. Herd immunity reached. They’re done. Call countries done. shut fuck then.

Where Canada? 2nd 3rd inning? US? 5th 6th? Well, tbf, given time period, lot criminals people guilty crimes like stealing loaf bread hungry unfortunate enough turn sex work survive. Funny many temporarily embarrassed millionaire/blue collar voters spent last 40 years electing politicians pushed unfettered capitalism, also people forced work shitty conditions risks less less reward.

Let's go fishing, me. *Said fisherman worm.* Wooooooooah. little far buddy give anything. They're drug user totally wrapped conspiracies. family may dumb, reason they've stopped talking person.

But go ahead send kids school re-start economy that's really think important. lucky maybe die rich. I’ve seen plenty non-medical grade disposable masks, surgical mask. hospital work still difficulty obtaining large enough supply surgical masks sent non-medical grade n one occasion. can’t used hospital environment aren’t better homemade masks. Karl Lagerfeld *shofar* Deep State clone? know someone similar environment whose organization already shut classroom someone sent covid positive kid school. Amen. Would you? take medical grounds, require channels broadcast medical facts, cant US dies, President media arm, telling fear killer virus. It’s theorized place hits 20% seroprevalence cases start decline obtainable least country, much expensive used be. afford buying understand people prefer cheaper reusable ones. That's predict happen unfortunately. Especially schools going opening up. topic, since said work fast food: always put mask pull window. really think real help since I'm lower window couple feet away, respect minimal effort. lot people also this? appreciated? 41% approve. Jesus.

With stupidity ignorance headlines, it’s easy get discouraged. keep head up. loads intelligent people working problem. Vaccines way beat this. Hell, vaccines may ultimately even best way beat this. many new treatments coming significantly decrease severity Covid-19. Im sure next months, discover even more. 

We waging multi-pronged war virus. discover mission win could ultimately change whole understanding done treat future illnesses. would wear them?

Don't get wrong, I'm criticizing donation. little point state governors refuse mandate mask usage schools. Yeah, that's Utah. passport useless

Order much online avoid people like plague. plague. It’s beyond pandemic. need stop calling pandemic. Sadly, think historians look back say that, August 2020, game already over. Maybe November 2016, Trump elected. Maybe long - social media revolution 2000's, 1980's advent cable news, Reagan revolution, etc. maybe built DNA America beginning - great nation whose ideals equality, liberty, opportunity contained within fatal flaws contradictions racism, individualism, ignorance bred perpetual optimism inevitably tear apart.

We good run, worry 2020 nothing compared next decade bring terms complete societal collapse, wheels already started motion. Nothing individual person prevent it. make confirmed cases junk logic? CDC, well independent studies, etc. found evidence infection higher confirmed-then mere conjecture hand wave? taking incredibly unreasonably rigid approach science point demanding accept debunked conclusions. say death rate 5.5%-which empirically not-no matter much kick scream. fiancé teacher upstate here... really really hoping spikes bad experiences states sway decision direction....  Lol drugs coming you. Heathens? Communists? brainwashing really gotten it. freedoms giving up? freedom kill grandma? Stop praying corona go away useless dumb shit like wear mask. hard inconsiderate [This study I'm Lots good info there, find IFR quick skim. possible remember number elsewhere, I'm fairly certain study, extrapolation results.

To answer question, yes serology tests used, alongside swabs active infections. hard truth imperfect tools, work we've got. think error bars 0.68% something like +/- 0.20%, pretty wide range, relatively. Still, confidence number, much preferable early reports CFR 4 5 percent. Lmao take notch. making joke. 

You totally healthy big proponent modern medicine because, unfortunately, totally healthy still suffer terrible effects brand new virus still learning about. I’m going keep exercising, eating clean, taking vitamin supplements, adhering recommended precautions I’m moron. Right, even then, it’s iffy. Aeschylus wasn’t joking said “first harm” - patients always want know “everything possible” done loved ones, right thing do, very, often, nothing, least little possible. Ya think! things sound like something guy can't clean 350 would say.  Smash mouth concert huh? People really starved entertainment lol Crisis lol 

A sport priority pandemic. Im tired bullshit. “We give deepest condolences family *Insert Teacher/student/parent here*. way could avoided tragedy” Bob Ross space. IIRC that's term originated, colloquially used provide rough rating country at, development-wise. ramping testing capacity quickly enough, FDA actively preventing research private labs conducting tests early pandemic. Even now, average delays test results make testing useless. impossible gain control transmission dynamics spread without timely test results. 

No push federal support Covid19 positive individuals. incentive positive people minor symptoms get tested quarantine. Financial incentive many people continue working spreading disease.

Continually making statements aligned directly refute scientific evidence expert input. Inconsistent messaging severity prevention lead confusion, distrust reliability expert guidance. 

Not implementing national response plan drive consistent approach, acquire supply PPE testing supplies need, forcing states compete other. recent allegations purposeful political decision one appalling things I've heard. 1980, small businesses employed 50.3 percent retail workers, 34.8 percent employed large large companies. However, decades later giants employ biggest share workers 47.2, versus 35.6 employed small retailers supporting somehow either working shopping stores.

Work life balance thing. What's point going college get degree something can't make money of? also considered history professor, want teach, want write book, want get PhD.

It certainly oversimplification. Later worked hypersonic missiles. said directly worse, chosen profession questionable bits, direct positive effects lives well (safer flights, reduced fuel consumption).

I support much higher taxes 1% yeah, I'm part inherited wealth. serious problem. 

That mean someone wants corporate lawyer values work-life balance making wrong choice. dad's company sued patent infringement early 80s. lawyer opposing side found lawsuit fake told judge. still forced dad sell company lawyers expensive. everyone crook. feel like look weaker ventilator throat maybe I'm tripping November vaccine election promise, normal people call bare faced lie (as opposed bear faced lie, Putin) hey. utilization synergy adding value Norway estimate around 60% cases last week due travelling.

Also remember healthcare US likely make people weary going hospital due way system run beds good get used.

While overall population density low US cases high population areas makes sense. Literal textbook narcissism. Ad hominem work me, narcissist. never happen long *capital* controls everything. [Capital would never allow education teach people critical thinking, might question capital don’t look infection rates per day report back first level infection rates US, almost every European nation has, start counting bodies.

Heck, US 5 million+ cases reported common knowledge many cases exist reported due lack testing kits.

You already dead friends, coworkers, brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, grandparents family dead dying lost men entire duration Vietnam war. they’ve died matter months, years. 

Claiming US well grim reaper still collecting souls like free nachos party one morbid callous comments I’ve seen subreddit while.

Again, report back numbers dead first manage control spread infection rates. depends group together. include excess flu pneumonia deaths 240k now. 


 It’s funny see differently sub reacts liberal gets COVID vs conservative gets it. think completely missed sarcasm. outcome Republican cost-cutting, corruption, greed, incompetence.

So deterioration existing infrastructure, caused negligence. worked retail/food service god could immediately tell Americans apart normal people. normal mean literally anyone else...

Just way speak you, expect, hell even stand line, impatiently waiting staring you. degree rocks. Remember back March kept saying we’re gonna “ramp testing next week”? Well that’s great leave testing sites labs underfunded doesn’t fucking matter takes 2 weeks get test.  Carl Sagan one best.  science America? Lol. Nah, go worst case assumptions beginning shout anybody questions it. research? Hell no, can't risk it. spread easy school? dont know, schools shut since March; assume does. Set experiment? fucking crazy? going assume spreads like wild fire kills everybody. schools open find articles prove point post r/coronavirus. somebody believe us call science deniers, ""Science!"" that's why. America damnit. would also like find work Europe. I’m engineering manager fairly solid resume. reputable websites you’d recommend? European (Netherlands), never see US fragile, whole looking-after-eachother community type way seems faded imo. Something typically lack I’ve always admired US for. know US citizens united want, think polarized society stands way. can't imagine local small businesses come side this

So corporations survive swoop purchase sweet foreclosed capital

Then lobby government give taxes, net paychecks enough, need whole gross even care think myself. cannot believe actually real person really ~~get elected~~ engage widespread voter suppression Secretary State steal election.

FTFY! :) they're going afraid, afraid looking dead. Hahaha touché buddy!! 😝 sides spread misinformation hate experience dude, read comment replied tell straight face ""bold"" make assumption. Edgy told thousands gathered Smash Mouth concert outside pandemic I'd amazed, dumbfounded 1: Huffington Post article made April Fools Day taken seriously, believe disclaimer well saying article.

2: information Daily Kos uses News Corpse source article, based information News Corpse contain quotes taken context everything else seems conspiracy.

While I'd kill case, really think Fox News legally entertainment source consider one.

That said, consider Fox News reliable news source regardless. legally Fox News actual ""news"" source, lot distorted news broadcast protected first amendment ability dodge lawsuits. Hell, recently got taken court lawsuit calling coronavirus hoax [the lawsuit thrown first still propaganda machine protected ""freedom press."" Okay? There’s much political pressure every side US actually attack European country. So.... doesn’t matter. one going start war world calling y’all stupid. Imagine learning something history repeated. Yeah, time. I'm really fence whole thing point, crossed mind several times pull completely e-learning, virtual school say 6 months. kind see heads. far signed Virtual School kind time. Crossing Fingers. Hope stay safe well. Doggy-dog world right now. suggesting source except 1 million estimate. 

Further, despite going globally, current pandemic killed people people per capita 1968 pandemic. 

I see median death comparison relevant know source median age death either 1957 1968 pandemic. I’m tough rap, don’t give fuck mask want get quickly accomplishment, par 3rd world countries resources fight Covid. Congrats! share mask! might good idea. Maybe wait pandemic shrooms. book amazing, make sad realize doomed are. Especially since it’s air matters, surfaces. People write, “I people adults know risk choose continue lives rest stay inside scared. scared get sick shouldn’t outside.” don’t get it. perfectly autonomous? don’t rely anyone else? grocery worker, bus driver, medical assistant, AAA person flat tire? assume people would rather home thus since blamed get sick?  Snottling good point. lived Germany years...Now back states miss Germany....When daughter graduates high school states, going send live friends Germany learn languages cultural differences. Ok Hitler Nazi logic killed Hitler.

Also point stands: people photo travelled forward time modern era would political views would almost certainly define fascist. Try living Georgia every commercial. Maybe missed hospitals ICU's throughout Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Arizona Texas running beds, doctors nurses dying left right suffering terrible organ damage COVID-19 

 hospitals states bringing refrigerator trucks there's longer room morgues? sure wish live fantasy world easily seem able to. low pop density great high pop density?

When happens area grows turns shithole, good people move new area start again. people start invading area great cycle goes on. happens businesses. think cities form? thin air?

Also fact billions people living low population density areas, spread out. ...so even going acknowledge assertion US way worse Sweden incorrect?

...and yes pretty much ignoring scientific advice letting people think right pretty fucking suicidal... deaths per capita Sweden 5th 6th 195 countries. arguably pandemic “Many Americans surprised information, studies show.” Education least governmental school system heavily regulated law. chance whatsoever someone foreign degree work there. Adult education quite possibly doable though. Today's positivity rate 22%. Hardly trend. plenty reason invade Iraq destroy chemical weapons gave use Iran.  Jesus christ... long unions oppose won’t happen ""Elected"" skin teeth, election SoS overseeing results, led massive voter suppression effort constituents. He’s either troll hugely misinformed, either way feel sorry him. Considering stance sex workers I'd say obvious. Years ago, taken little kids museum sorts. part presentation video guy math. naturally, sped played Yakkity Sax something, host wore one ""look nerdly smart guy there..."". Clearly, mathematician/scientist treated respect.

I hated it. wrote letter place, back since.

The place? fucking NASA visitors center.  made fun scientists. America frightened becoming 1930s often leave towel pool chair holiday, even don’t plan come back soon, come too? point countries provinces? fair ask us look US whole, rather differently acting states, proceed look countries' provinces individually?

It's double standard. Either compare whole nations whole nations look regions within nations. can't one one another others Candidate Trump banged nationalist drum lot, done nothing protect traditional Americans jobs, ended foreign wars brought troops home, made tangible steps lower immigration significantly all. 

And no, trump capitalist corporatist, difference unless Lenin. Capitalism individualistic, corporatism still using wages businesses bit limits government sets, commonly protect national identity. study listed done kids age 5. yet school age.

Also, Covid death rate 10x flu. whole different beast... point school teach lessons right? Well trying responsibly mitigating epidemic pretty good lesson year. Us normal folk, yeah course do. I'd put money given person care quite bit probably low-key terrified.

The ones money power, blindly zealously support them, hand.... don’t live Sweden

Uh, yeah do. live rules nothing! It’s business usual. Restaurant school everything open. people even wearing masks. surge back April sudden minimum case fuck policy succeeded. US takes bit time higher population here. surely it’s gonna go away without strict lockdown anything point.

Yeah, nobody really wears masks. That's true Nordic countries. They've pushing social distancing masks, afraid people wear masks they'll stop distancing.

Restaurants spaced seating ordering food bar banned. Lots restaurants serious trouble, actually, since tons people obeying recommendations going nearly much.

You see difference public transportation - people going non-essential trips, stay way hell away grocery store places.

I've working home since March 15th, plans us go back office anytime soon. Yes Speaking stepping up, Americans step start designing implementing new America?

Or people happy current ""winner takes all"" America one *actually* wants refresh country? Letting days go *might* surprisingly effective. Even though offer filtration, deflect exhaled droplets back user around edges shield. Even without filtering, droplets travelling much less velocity, travel far.

Still, study excellent scope design, looks one thing, filtration efficiency common masks. look distance (velocity reduction) anything else. expert stretch imagination, study one piece information amongst many public health officials offering public advice.

There 200,000 deaths America since March expected. 200,000 people get shot? 200,000 get mysterious deadly pneumonia somehow isn’t Covid? 200,000 people decide die?

Stop believing bullshit use head. spanish flu Corona h1n1 viruses.

The population 1919 1.8 billion. low estimate death toll 17 million. count high 50 million.

Now extrapolate based current population size.

Some comparisons sources major flu epidemics : Club keno half frequent, far winners every draw. I'm 100% masks, giving people excuses. see people congregate masks on, half time barely covering mouth nose sticking out. People zero clue reduce odds transmission. Masks help, honestly much.

""...because would second wave September."" now, result denial inaction, second wave inevitable. 

Literally nothing matters Republicans money. They're horrible people. Spending time disinfecting like parents whose kid gets lice focus hours cleaning house extensively getting nits kid’s hair.

this kind testing means open. 

***everything.***

test every day go work/school..

easier peeing stick.

&amp;#x200B;

low sensitivity tests work fine get sick.. they're good catching comes on.. presumably spread far... level virus peaks body. 

&amp;#x200B;

false positives OK want keep places like schools office buildings.

&amp;#x200B;

PCR tests better sick days already.

&amp;#x200B;

IIRC one company FDA approval that, Mina says, *everyone* must tested, every couple days, $1, paper-based, at-home tests easy distribute use pregnancy test: wake morning, add saliva nasal mucous tube chemicals, wait 15 minutes, dip paper strip tube, read results. tests feasible—a tiny company called E25Bio, another called Sherlock Biosciences (a start-up spun Harvard’s [Wyss Institute Biologically Inspired Broad Institute 2019) deliver tests—but made marketplace sensitivity compared PCR tests. prayers go guys. :) scary part many Americans still don’t think Covid real dangerous 

I wonder would change view? Like someone close like family member die it? Orange one care.... Singapore currently absolute fatality rate 0.00047%.

The USA stands 0.05%.

This factor 100. factor would two three, ok, factor 100.

Knowing Singapore 50 000 cases within concentrated foreign workforce single one died, wonder going wrong USA. Put house arrest.  need stop wasting precious time people.  get control flu season starts people going start dropping like flies.  combination two viruses potential deadly. complacent rather using knowledge tell public danger COVID decided play politics saying nothing. Fuck her. useless health director California many meaningless deaths head. May karma find soon quick. Goddamn that's infuriatingly accurate oh ffs

at least actually implemented. right?? RIGHT??? Defying reality. correct text. Thanks! thought obvious context, missed also mistranslation.  almost brand new virus know.  article misleading. Deaths obviously underreported countries well. telling Brazil adjust it? trust Russia also, adjustments required india adjusted 500%. smell BS. US also time prepare, experience European countries learn from. think Fauci, though surprised everyone dog getting point. Nah. can. It'll certainly make *my* life harder educated reasonable people leave. Even passport useless moment, there's foreign company would hire me.

^(Just fucking leave woods die like ancient Aleutian grandma famine god damn all) lot Americans care obviously, there's still parties anti maskers denying science. seriously pissing pixel award, thread covid deaths, wow sad scary . people usa around world. think numbers inflated really 50% current death count. think it’s likely you’d never Maybe. Maybe not

I see coming from, talk terms probability / maybe scientist agree way talking.

However go far use words ""we know"" quite lot. bad thing USA became specialist conspiracy theories / ""alternative"" facts especially protect Trump.

For extend purposes, know, much know earth round, least 150K americans died covid, probably way more. Saying ""maybe no"" right almost credible saying ""maybe earth flat"" - sure, maybe, probability low doesnt count. Jesus. know he'd stroke? US News reports like sports scores. Americans... everything perfect.  50/100,000 standard way stating. words, Covid-19 3rd leading cause death America. Flu around 8th Nature preserve...lol. risky still give rat's ass brush em doh? think society collectively depressed morally bankrupt people dont care dont know consequences, reason live. future looks fucking bleak everyone, take little enjoyment can, can. Where? insanely high. still talk it? get fooled idea small number 0.05%. felt like well. twitter karens orange guy fucked shit hell. are. another one last one Ah, North Korea done even better? /s behalf Europeans: neither title incorrect. heard Cepheid, apparently. dead baby trigger people

😂😂😂 Study hasn’t published yet. Williamson referred ""latest research, expected published later year - one largest studies coronavirus schools world"", saying ""makes clear little evidence virus transmitted believed referring forthcoming report released Public Health England. things planned Sturgis.......?

My God America, I'm speechless. mean resources open school safely, throw lies mass hoping they'll buy it. Jesus Christ dumb. would generous. Call 50/50. know lot educated, 'smart' people behaving quite poorly still pretending contact surfaces primary vector transmission?  enforce use masks.  fucking simple. Everyone denouncing masks precautions get scarlet letter...ink pinkies, like middle east election. get health care... problem tests datasheets available manufacturers go necessary tests get approval. So, high failure rate expected.

Citation needed. think moved past misunderstanding making things up. article linked talks approval tests. nice people number is.....incredibly low NY 30k. NJ 15. mean tell that’s disproportionate representation? Cmon man! universe man give authority 😂😂😂😂 Good catch lol. Granted, babies hesitate puke face. See? information get doesnt make sense either last heard, premies newborns contracting in-utero. essentially opposite. Children carriers say extremely rare safe go back school now..... many headaches. 🤯 US fine? like 9 countries worse? Last checked US 10th worst country deaths per capita. cant possibly think ""doing fine"".

Most Europe alot better US close disney land. people moving country bring somewhere take somewhere. people stupid🤦🏻‍♂️ MURICA NUMBER ONE Would died anyway? Look average age death US, look average age someone dies covid. live longer, average, die covid... 1. Stop politicizing virus. 
2. Stop scum journalists create click bait untrue articles. Expose scum journalists fire them. never welcomed huddled masses. discriminated demographic majority immigrant population every time. Italians, Irish, Chinese, Hispanic; you’re new America need whatever pro-social behaviors beat discrimination oppressive government work structure, way children become big enough assholes American.

To day, one shocking detractors immigration reforms US immigrants know family.

They’re one good ones. Everyone else wants come anchor babies (which hollow criticism, dare someone move another country kid living there?).

We higher approval rating Syrian refugees today Jewish refugees Third Reich. Well, 0.05% one 2000 people 
5% one 20 people

So I'm pretty sure meant 0.05% Nah man idiots true Americans too, much want be, are. I’m pessimistic say this. covid flu running rampant side side would terrible. I’d assume catching both, even healthy person. imagine. friskola = private school, contrast municipally organised schools Ah, yes. evidence supports opening schools yet ready published, available sometime later year.

This government gave ""We publish dossier referendum interference right election."" hold breath importantly, trust anyone without inspectable data. afraid! afraid! afraid are, willing submit tyrannical government lockdown. death toll heavy many places. also, several fairing fairly well moment - 7 day average Italy 7 deaths / day. lot. Yes seen individually,collectively without context, number. don’t want attend school, teacher need income family fucked. guys get here? politicians, stupid man child presidents, COVID deniers plain stupidity. idea happened, I'd really like know, amuses me. Yeah, I've yet see single person without mask indoor shop I've Bavaria last couple months. 

In instances noses people stupid, restaurants people wear go toilet, that's it. really surprising newly founded state actively conquering buying land sub continental level fast growth? tell us much today IMHO.

Anyway, GDP alone write history. US became global power thanks WWII dicothomy soviet union. 
However, younger european generations things back time nobody really cares anymore. Many people sees society behind basic rights, paired unreasonable superiority attitude makes feel weird borderline indocrinated TBH. people know feels towards americans, generally speaking nice folks hang anyway, moments makes feel like still live 30s pre-war nationalistic surge. Maybe harder hitting 1 every 2000 means 50 people picture died Covid (ignoring age bias etc.). School craziest, commit children's lives line... fucking line America?

What take get majority Americans upset protest something?

This literally trump pubs testing right now. greatest american test since civil war. Funny thing. puts number casualties Lebanon explosion comparison Bs. Everyone knows children germ factories colds, flu, every contagious illness planet. virus different makes absolutely sense. What's funny think speak everyone. many Americans taking seriously locked months... Screw them, right? Get outta pandering generalizations. spouse aligned? least refund passholder passes.  Keep mind lot millennial generation go college. People entered trades, electricians, plumbers, carpenters, welders ect... making upward 70k year, student debt largely unaffected Covid shutdowns. 

I think Reddit specific community, heavy college educated millennials, reddit good sample millennial population whole.

Personally went military route debt since 19. Got out, used G.I. Bill, bought house, sold nice profit looking start business. enjoy typical ""we millenials poor broke shitty job market"". Idk, think negative identity define with. 

Most millennial military friends financial situation high school trade friends (at least ones kids really young) better me.

Also, RV companies making killing COVID people vacationing overseas. road trips weekend camping RVs, ATVs UTVs. Look Thore, Polaris Winnebago stock need proof. Wish would bought March. think it’s likely you’d never know. instances known happen news wide spread? Maybe. Maybe not. doubt everywhere corruption free

That doesn’t mean cases covid seem trying tell saying 200 000 people died 2020 2019. Yeah probably like covid it. cynical, also true. People dont wear seatbelts drive drunl high speeds road everyday dont get sympathy hit tree. Instead, glad killed themselves. That's equivalent COVID spreaders. million tragedies. allowed sub. reporting you. Except political America one side believe human rights really simple shit going ice great example numbers increased 200k number deaths had?  Explain that.  Explain 200k people died covid19.  Also attempt whitewash numbers many covid19 deaths listed pneumonia numbers pneumonia deaths alone far well.  zero proof claiming nothing data supports claim whatsoever. point, got say ""who cares, let kill themselves"" .. bad there'll collateral damage. true Trump give fuck lifes interesded money Yeah never go stadium fine

You see this? covid deniers sound Laughs maniacally modern kakistocracy. state ever shut way Europe besides tai-state area NY/NJ. rest pretended going starbucks less ""lockdown""  thing bothers ""these people"" brainwashed exact same! Socialism BAD holds people back success.... meanwhile reaping benefits certain socialist concepts like SOCIAL SECURITY Medicare/Medicaid. entire generation get brainwashed selfish hang party literally killing can't look bigger picture. number, big number turns “many”. 2000 understandable number. “One small number” significant “many”. Assuming operating country even 5 years like holy shit America.

Y'all basically meters flying cliff truck 100kmh 5 000 $ would wear masks year? That's real mystery pandemic: many Wolverines fans die? look what's happened simple it? Come bud - try think little deeper tired rhetoric. Big corporations control food industry also massive say (money) media. 
Totally design talking eating healthy. Fast food thing never shut down. probably worst thing put body this. one first people one ones brought covid everyones attention.

Donnie you? heard nurses doctors meet weirdest people.

think weirdest patient ever met, brighten days up. Blatant gaslighting UK govern media  That's America you. rich get richer rest us running around trying stay alive. divided 99% are, better works ones dont give fuck they've got private islands anyway That's carefully worded sentence, schools closed covid19. There's lots evidence flu, transmits similar way covid19. Bro i'm orange county.. PLENTY idiot anti-maskers here, mean few. mean LOT. People wearing masks chin, covering nose, screaming FAKE NEWS. majority people area wear masks anymore... affluent area people successful, recently, assumed intelligent. city 21 million people, good comparison point lol Netherlands here:

Nobody wears mask unless area could fined wearing mask, like public transport red light district Amsterdam. even cops/fake cops often lack backbone enforce rule. 

If fact office culture usually includes one two ""work home"" days/week, resulting less people leave house, we'd probably US levels. Wonder non symptomatics still experience effects? ’Tis - Trumpearen [Americans Heartbreaking 😓 Meanwhile Trump administration ""america best country"" know say, ""the bigger mask...""

Oh, wearing one. Well, maskless dickless. use trailers. God forbid actually ride motorcycle faster 10mph lower 120db. fun anymore shit US - fucking horror show.

Yeah, joking lot this, ceased funny. think report nurses in... wanna say Texas? patients abandoned oxygen die covered ants.

That's point where, least me, became shitty, can't go ""lol, Americans"" anymore. popped notifications, brought tears. made think I’m living overseas, worry much little sister, RN, young family, two parents, recently turned 60. lot anxiety it. childhood piano teacher 8 years died it, someone meant lot me. hate virus, pissed people don’t take seriously. 

My heart hurts much right now. Stay safe everyone. will. die, less enter lottery, likely win. Thats really much, it? 👍🏻 Whatever Russian troll hope aware comment complete fantasy. realize vagrants world since beginning time right? pretty much invalidates every excuse given here. awesome!!

2. Sweden never locked down. teachers risk everyone ***in Sweden.***  Whoever wrote probably frothing mouth waiting opportunity write this. don’t mean sound condescending foreigner I’ll find difficult look America way ever again.


Every country problems, it’s stupid people it’s mistakes response supposedly world’s richest powerful country beyond depressing.


Seems outsider sheer amount ignorance, anti-intellectualism, stubbornness outright denial triumphed country even basic instincts common sense self preservation. country given much science throughout history seems almost blind it. think less fat everyone is. ? course wearing masks.

I think could least empathy someone protesting masks, wearing one legal/moral thing situation. lawful evil chaotic good, depending side take. fucken retarded mate. meme virus isnt real. US trajectory also still going least still extremely high europe control (for now). friend friend mine told us rave going Fresno idiot considering going. instantly called fucking idiot. can’t believe people living fantasy bubble. point ceases Trump's fault becomes fault American people.

The information COVID freely available. Daddy said ""Slow testing,"" can't slow testing start letting people *more* tests! Ahh good. afraid might want start educating over-10s. Funny Tories suddenly concerned 'education' years they've done nothing strip funding. Iceland. 

We cases entire island. actually beat COVID. really nice, life slowly started resume. 

Until stupidly decided would lift mandatory 2 week quarantine upon arrival everybody hope tourists could come back large tourism companies run 1% wouldnt risk losing value. mean low paid foreigners mostly work front line jobs cares /s?

Well COVID again. currently 100 cases almost 1000 people quarantine. 

I super angry. exactly propose that? Less month ago 15 cases total. shitstains decided 200+ person wedding, we're like 160, many directly wedding. math, something OP's numbers wrong...It's high. Yes amount children’s sport injuries down. Things like football related traumatic brain injuries. ironic country highly regarded superpower plus number one military expenses ""defend"" reacting poorly pandemic. Wtf, schools open begin with??

We 80 cases nations schools still closed. guys millions case pandemic taught state rapidly vying Florida Man's trophy. 

Watch Florida Man... Californian Man's time :( consider NL hit way earlier less knowledge treatment options. People dont die much beginning pandemic. know of. later learn actual total death toll is, going much higher Erin go bragh!


I'm willing pay little Guinness saves Ireland! bang, wimper dressing indian.

Or cop. 187th world fine? title hits hard. cloisters men *edited* collection Aramaic Hebrew stories Greek, Latin Germanic bible today certainly knew doing. History clearly shown bible edited, passages texts selected overtime help current ruling dynastic class time. 100% agree there, that's long priests could preach bible Latin, common English/Italian/Spanish speaking folks get full picture, clergy spoon-fed them. 

However, men actually *wrote* texts fervent , crazy, dirty back-ass sheep herders tell left right. stories second hand, passed retellings twisted ancient Egyptian Mesopotamia gods, told one backwards pre-industrial man next. actual content text intentionally designed anyway, manifested time older stories deluded minds ancestors know almost world functioned. God really makes 10 million sound like chump change yes, amount money could really improve life. could buy art supplies start little online shop, take night classes, maybe get better car. That’s person’s opinion, facts. choosing view way, simply portraying known statistics way that’s easy understand. would problem that? remember news articles big deal?

They either told downplay reason, dumb af, believed China China said totes cool, biggie... even stupid simply dumb af. developed? Lol disproves point immunity. immunity happened, queens, highest infection rates would low rates now. still
Have high rates compared boroughs. Manhattan lowest still low without immunity.


In summary, said bay area great job enforced rules prevented deaths. would say florida, texas arizona failing letting population die could’ve gone bay area route saved thousands American lives, correct? Go die. I've worn masks day work many,many times years. need help. twitter Karen Jared’s new nickname? tend agree. ""Flatten curve"" ultimate low hanging fruit beginning; admission failure inability start.

Worse that. damn father gone full GOP'tard. someone never racist (mixed marriage children) latched onto Trump 'Murica like fucking lamprey. 

By Birx saying something along lines (paraphrasing) 100% stop measures meant lessen impact? people went fucking RABID. Forget 2 kids work medical. Forget someone work fucking DIED it. Forget everything. him, now, fake. Europe hit america people died faster due lacking knowledge treatment. 

It would smarter compare deaths last 2 months it? least (un)expected winnings pot grows. “Trump good money!”

Lol what? Ah see thought referring mortality rate.. possible get unemployment resign due unsafe working conditions job, expect several months long fight appeals hearing present case evidence job negligent safety choice quit. Although probably dead homeless see nickle True, especially seeing China history covering news like. thing numbers human deaths public hospitals around country. I'm sure numbers individual hospitals provinces found fact checked doctors nurses working them. 

Maybe individual places corrupt afraid backlash fudged numbers (Wuhan, possibly), whole country. Thanks China  peoples fault even problem, years decades abused trust. years rightfully outraged unregulated US pharma for-profit healthcare industry people meant nowhere trust them? Sure, arent listening stats common sense even lied much feeling like finally way resisting them. unfortunate happening way, putting heaps people risk, even killing yet tackling root problem originally lied about... thing is, 60% Americans government employees 65+ . keeping “leaders” safe. Yes. also, number covid related deaths reduced (car accidents, sports accidents etc) us care, apparently many people disregard pandemic shut us little transmission schools. Well course, majority kids since March FFS Wait since couple hundred million people fully quarantined months end ""20k"" odd cases.

Not mention building hospitals number days. . . Anyone thinks China telling truth full shit. fair, many us feel like we're held hostage. know wrong, nowhere seek refuge, way stop power, enough people act time commitment send message tyrannical minority hijacked government. view media fear mongering therefore everyone does? people know watch news take information grain salt. It’s media’s job inform us death matter cause, that’s new thing press. actually goes back beginning history press? fact still making uneducated,ignorant analogies flu means haven’t lost single person virus hope do. need dose reality. news reporters aren’t reporting “go inside everyone’s gonna die” they’re reporting facts figures you’re paranoid ass convinced media tricking reality it’s head. Good day freak. ""Absence evidence is not evidence of absence"" 

I'm sick misleading arcticle study titles fanning flames nihilism. Reddit user sent enough money reactivate phone number. OMG, today (since haven’t slept yet) miracle far! Forcing south back union mistake. enough people die, might better odds! can't teach them. Young males stupid. know, used one. yeah sounds bad, population clock still says birth rate US much higher rate deaths, plenty americans added lowest paid workforce. wealth power care. Eh even people enjoy working 80+ hr weeks, higher paying jobs credit checks background checks already getting screwed life, hiring nonviolent felons bad credit applicants. many roadblocks people poverty actually rise it. would gtfo thought another country would want american ass Lol, Taiwan adopts strategy US. tests cases.

We never ment quarantine forever, ment quarantine hospitals could handle caseloads.

The reasons made 5 million infected America Americans.

And Americans ones highest infected number moment.

It depends really. people religious nuts country. Others deny science. People needs see infected fucking lobby order witness fucking disease. Ones believe crap hospitals fundings. Conspiracy theorists, idiots, anti-vaxxers, etc. 

The age information used tool misinformation. this? sure really. Hero complexes, distrust government authority (although get one due current political leadership moment, strict religious upbringings, lack scientific understandings, obscure notions constitution, etc.

People want right world full wrong. humility life reflect themselves, ""Am that's wrong here?""

Do make shit scared something understand Disinfecting easy ineffective. Distancing masks difficult effective. chose easy ineffective option. Makes look like they're something, really. think he's ever literally stood said ""don't wear masks"" exact words, never to. Like u/hexydes said, lot ""winks nods"" add thing. slight exaggeration, make false one first times said it, said wearing mask basically saying thing he's going it, time there's also implicit disagreement science (""I'm feeling good"" implies wear mask feel sick, already knew asymptomatic spread huge reason virus hard contain), well implicit criticism image put masking up, whole world leaders oval office times refused wear mask visiting places appropriate wearing time said wearing mask would hurt reelection tweet mocking Joe Biden wearing mask, Trump retweeted.

Not mention countless times Trump downplayed masks, called efficacy question even suggested might harm good, constantly banged CDC's early long-since-reversed stance people going getting masks, generally leading wrong direction example, never wearing one. nearly 6 months pandemic he's seen public [EXACTLY ONE wearing mask, ever.

Even money expecting people stay home unrealistic. Lots friends unemployment still partying socializing. myth people would stay home paid so. keep vaccine dude... going solve problem get it. There's way support longer, right babies!?! wtf!? thank think mean, “Ain’t way thirsty, bored, lonely, highly social people going stay inside.” introverts still counting blessings. 😃 bring fatality rates look like remove proper hospital care equation, like happens whenever hospitals can't take patients. Fatality rates look lot like scary diseases yesteryear take account.

Emphasis needs still put allowing hospitals overburdened severe cases. ""The biggest argument democracy five minute conversation average voter."" -Winston Churchill Maybe dead baby trigger people re-evaluate.

Seriously, time deal troll ass, look population densities places, also consider one legendary scumbags history mankind running countries, 50% residents actively acting common sense expert medical advice. Florida simply going get better everyone take masks pretend they're fucking Sweden. us already given waiting you, understand purpose quarantine refuse die anti-intellect morons. It’s always it, every pandemic. Double dose better nothing, right? trying, it’s extremely hard without phone car.

So true. bullshit It’s incredible stupid (who kidding? know they’re doing. It’s greed) people power country. It’s truly incredible. Dang, even mom self isolate see baby NICU :(

The mom probably safer many nurses, read accounts nurses giving one like COVID living life normal. Bro still hope? Ha Quick! tax cuts! stop virus! breathe, though!? months then. I'm teacher Autistic support classroom, similar situation. boss told day made sure get one face shield classroom. least four six adults room need one.

I think would many cases Covid news much that. course, possible get asymptomatic. also completely paranoid wearing masks going anywhere seeing another soul people need makes feel safe. Pretty soon, -10% somehow (and yes, /s case obvious). keeps trending down, quickly. middle school science teacher, appalling many students already told parents vaccinating them, 5G towers trouble, bad-mouthing Bill Gates Dr. Fauci, saying masks mind-control devices. kidding. kids almost definitely repeating things hear crazy parents say, angry even requiring masks social distancing. Oh, school already closed due COVID, although football practice skip single beat. socialism. Fuck that. Social democracy much better. source? NEVER let coronavirus get way freedumz.

The thing get inbetween us freedumz Conservative politicians, let way us like good submissive pets. it!!

They likley 10-11k deaths end year still 1/3 New York. live California, 40 million residents we're half population Germany, four times large Switzerland, seven times larger Norway, 60% population France. We're like European country ourselves.

What describe basically lives are/were like. Although know police stopping people street, supposed go families, everything shut tight. ALTHOUGH mention stores ""sections"" shut - store open open everything, could still get flowers, balloons, birthday cakes large food stores liquor stores open

We buy hard liquor food stores (in California), justified locally alcoholics would trouble big deal leave liquor stores open. People still wear masks inside.

Gun stores California closed first, know opened back up. reading many reports businesses US able stay open

I think states like Florida (which 2,700 miles California - Spain Germany) ran experiments things differently, California area locked masks required every business public transportation. instance, supermarket yesterday 100% people wore mask (although see couple dick noses).

Same experience morning buying food supplies, 1 dick nose noticed. :-)

By way, lived worked Darmstadt, Germany months college (1991). changed whole life. work originally, learned much made good friends, ended coming back motorcycle trips summers German friends. I'm still fond beer (Pfungstädter Pils) first there, always smuggle little back USA visit. Unfortunately bread travel. :-) needs find Trump GOPs source funding put stop it. Thats way fix this. first two weeks stinky dick balls tho ;) read story couple days ago stating lot fewer premature births since beginning COVID-19 pandemic. insult someone reason still think civilized person.

I want argue, pointing little hypocrisy. Jokes aside, know bar outside seating packed elbow elbow every day. sad disgusting. Yeahh sure survived it. America gets lucky time time. Maybe corona blow like sars us soon. First off, one actually talking actual socialism US. need socialized healthcare education, like every first world country. fucking country two things. know already socialized roads, public schools, fire fighting, mail, parks, lot things benefit us all.

Absolutely not, better Sweden, Belgium, UK, etc... suspend picture taking student causing this? going get suspended posting this. already antibodies fine.  solution football kids insurance right?! Imagine united country towards testing tracing common goal back February. yet keep winning el3ctions reason. Gee wonder why. Also censoring certain words see Auto-M0d miss them. Excess deaths really going way ever know many died thing. can't test every corpse numbers monkied states. soon started reporting HHS instead CDC numbers flattened out. May have? Journalism needs stop tip toeing calling bunker boy. literally constitution doesnt power assumes EO congress does. :( Ireland needs stop flights bit healthy every size people told 5’4 350lbs completely healthy encouraged? lie? 😤😭 school officials video, one lady suggested making kids change seats every 14 minutes get around 15 minute guideline exposures.. kids need considered exposed post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Florida world I'm housekeeper busy resort, today found completely trashed room metal baking tray, used, microwave.

People care, they're also stupid Maybe life 
—Trump appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* care less*. going cruel, uncaring , selfish monster thinks half million deaths big deal, least learn proper grammar. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Mayor’s mask ordinance said people didn’t wear masks eating drinking. Since guys drinks considered exempt wear mask. Mayor added another ordinance banning open containers downtown people flaunting rules caring drinks avoid wear mask. “admitted” emergency room. don’t get admitted emergency room, go admit hospital needed.
No Players admitted hospital. received IV fluids ER according article. 

Is deceptively written purpose? describing called Mount Stupid, plenty people it.

The first thing happens someone actually knowledge certain field realization even knowledge field. Wow... really sucks... got tested urgent care Harris Co got results back 3 days..(positive) took test july 30th. disputing facts, adding second perspective. also getting calls Harris Co health dept asking questions got it.. (tracking I've been, I've with... thats reassuring, guess) Probably depends much money make though. lost entire day (hourly pay) work told stay home since one Covid symptoms long ass list ask about. filed still made much money bother. can’t file working 4 5 days, many take pay cuts won’t able recoup losses. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* anyways , USA needs new leaders ever! Especially good goal like that! couple thousand deaths 6 months, yeah. Absolutely, branding make so. Perpetuating idea basic human rights like healthcare, education, equality, political ideas comments like makes issue worse. common Americans notion healthcare grass indeed greener side fence.  Generation A: Grow environment suffer immensely - resulting burning motivation strive peace make world better place. 

Gen A: Achieve semblance progress peace Gen B kids

Gen B grows soft weak advantages brought progress peace. 

Gen B's kids Gen C, suffers similar plight Gen A.

Gen C: Hello darkness old friend one acting insufferable. He's right want border countryfolk get shit together. mean he's sympathetic responsible. particular reason morons perm banned sub? really excited comment looked [unfortunately sick = covid?

I also sick 3 weeks ago 2 weeks covid. get cold almost every year summer. met swedish epidemiologist would full round house slap face time time again....

And slap would say...

YOU HORRIBLE SELF ABSORBED FOOL!!

SLAP! Absolutely. want expert advice effectiveness vaccines, I'm unlikely go associate professor nutrition UNC. I'm sure find enough obese people take part clinical trial (and can't, obese vaccinated due risks, that's news yourself). 

I'd genuinely interested hear insight ""expert"" average anti-mask Karen doesn't. anything takeaway is: manageable restrictions ""get control"" high enough immunity Stockholm, New York, Lombardy, etc seem now. 

It's behaving differently way now. ton people already disease there.

I see nothing indicate effect behavior/politics even close effect effect immunity population. 

In Stockholm cases deaths rising sharply march april, trending since (reaching almost zero deaths now). difference handling/behavior: \*nothing\*. lockdowns. I'm gonna shut up. Interesting see US suffer less deaths countries. always looked raw numbers infection rates alone misleading, context shows US bad whole. course we're still thick pandemic, could see US overtaking countries rate going Seems peaked worldwide, judging worldometers.info! Things look better! :) enough Americans care. itll seen one greatest failures. Many die coming year honestly, point, look forward it. deserve shit. didnt fail. dropped fucking bomb. president state local officials, Everyone fucking useless. one listens science. restaurants open. People droves. gross begone troll America believe Freedom all! Whose neighbors talking about? one said anything Mexico although family too. Riots streets South Korea 1 175,000 so.

Yes, South Korea done fantastic job. 305 deaths 51M population 1 ~170,000. DEATH RELEVANT COVID ELIMINATED also dont worry sending kids school, something like that. 60% rally close businesses and/or refuse go work? It’s called free will, smart ones use wait mass deaths dumb ones. could force two birds one stone beginning... can't sincerely speak people think speaking hyperbolically. thin necessarily *want* die much care did. apathy sense ""fuck you, get what's coming."" I'd imagine empathy (the laws) put risk. think getting downvoted choosing defend group people informed consequences face said consequences spiting side. they're burned they're asking support.

 Quite honestly, I'm boat. **extremely irresponsible** put people risk this. playing lives playing other's well. imagine people tried make aware actions (besides know, entire fucking planet) heed warning. *their* empathy? end day wish truly die I'd lying said feel bad chose themselves. 

I enables people mindset keep gambling lives that's also extremely irresponsible. laws chose gamble literal human lives know want people right thing? sincerely wish death upon laws (and hope that's previous commenters mean well) feel bad either. stood front moving train trying pull others track expect treated nicely get hit. germany idiots protesting. public transport, shops etc, day day life people following guidelines. switzerland. least (switzerland) girlfriend (gemany) lives.

I could say crazy think nothing change. Again, saying strict measures stay is. would probably accepted - especially cases go down. well possible, rhat world go 100% back normal. Maybe will. Time tell. feel like case, thered 125 deaths Covid state since began. Especially since governor fire constantly one strict lockdowns country never enough cases really justify it. OMFG!.. Even recover easily spread parents/grandparents/friends/etc.. madness! Um Napoleon imposed dictatorship country, invaded conquered Europe, causing deaths many thousands people, tried start dynasty, drained France manpower fight wars end left Frances utterly defeated. Brilliant military leader, good role model improving one’s country. 200k people died year last year terms total causes death.  Shut fuck bullshit. Wall vs COVID ?! place called traffic light lounge outside gates Ft Benning. Guys would come time birthday boy blindfolded. would drag stage, lay put dollar bill mouth. dancer would come snatch dollar cooter. 

I like , ewwww, dollar filthy. trauma motorcycle accident gets coded covid... '

Get help. #FREEDOM

America believes freedom - *including viruses*. feel like we've gotten lot better, least live, wearing masks. remember going right started recommending wear masks. think many people wearing also nearly making mandatory wherever go, catching on. mandatory part still kind window though many companies making mandatory none enforcing rule. want money employees care get paid enough deal another Karen getting denied service mask on. problem dumbass infectious. spreads.

So I'd guess rate US much higher.  bullshit, utter bullshit virtue signalers, please bother

So believe human rights virtue signaler? Personally like argument many use wrongful conviction implies death penalty still acceptable punishment long person guilty. reason amputations lashings punishment. state hand punishments even say convicted deserves it. reckon half em voted Chump? I’m insurance biz. 1% risk basically uninsurable risk. Insurance companies would go bankrupt 1 100 policies would paid out. 

Auto accident death, one common insured death risks, 10 per 100,000. 

In US, 30,000+ people die auto accidents, yet people terrified auto accidents covid-19 don’t see 1% terrifying figure. 

Fun-fact: travel insurance cover Covid-19 related illness death due high risk. normal, fact repost, since previous one reported edited title. bare minimum information title rest posted before:

This report updated every 10 days recent one available location: excel sheet contain numbers since start also available continuously (current link - )

The report short, Figure 1 shows evolution incidences infection splits confirmed local imported infection. Table 1 lists recent (for 20-30/7) estimations Rt Figure 2 shows fit longer graph. Rest report covers data used, method estimated references scientific sources.

In previous report (which described link longer valid) 13-23/7 Rt dropped 0.66 median values starting show uptick - entire period ranged 0.66-0.84 increase end period.

Puerto Rico problems America leech resist every effort break free. looks like political US. Trump want lose face continues embarrass tv. I'm American one American haters seems much money gets pumped defence basic medical care people need countries priorities skewed. badly need military powerhouse, cost populace become worth it. see president waffling interviews makes cringe people dying droves worried election. get wrong, country far behind (england) seem herd mentality people saying wearing masks infringes rights. really hope lot get mess little damage possible. Good luck yanky friends. American literally can't watch happen anymore, hurts bad, man Belgium different way counting. cannot take seriously here. seriousness, probably realistic number, although real number total death count compared years. America isnt. fucking stupid compare accidents contagious virus. even real death toll 10x officially reported number, China still far better lot countries. Manhattan lowest. Queens highest infection rate till today still top manhattan stays low. Wheres immunity queens? still top

You want make deaths fits argument. Deaths aren’t metric go treatment changed march remember complains governor cuomo killing elderly nursing homes? doesn’t factor anymore? Best metric cases florida 100 thousand ny soo herd immunity Florida
Should coming minute now. ”[Genetic shows virus spread Sweden come Italy Austria.”

That straight untrue.

The reports also says nothing alleged differences Sweden Nordic countries, discussing here.  


”Only symptoms.”

Also true. travellers known risk areas [asked self quarantine two weeks, symptoms 


“. outbreaks event would Aftonbladet Expressen. ""Hundreds sick music festival!"" 


...eh... second half March papers literally full headlines regarding outbreak Sweden. Unfortunately authorities stopped tracing there‘s data people got from. *""Let mouse die. Kill it, to.""* 200 000 excess death 2020 compared 2019 ? ""It is"" kids crazy Karen BLM murderers? jealous can’t get delicious food low prices.  

Canadians cry price cheese. 

:) guess 200 000 excess death 2019 2020 just... lot unlucky strikes ? Lol sounds lot like America. Even toilet paper (though, pretty sure global, too).

But yeah, I'm certain issues. fact, I'm expecting it. difference I'd getting feet wet new culture, people, experiences, cities, etc. I'd ride surface bit. Give time heal. Currently, I'm immersed part US - politically speaking. exhausting, yet, work needs done conversations need had. Local policies changing show blanket classist (and ultimately therefore racist) line thinking. Yet, live one liberal cities US.

I need break all. graduating college years ago, working therapy many years, exiting abusive relationship, coming own, need new place new mindset. also need place heal. I'm immersed US culture.

I expect corruption everywhere. also expect idiots...lol. reasons leave *wholly* experience another country. They're also internal lot thought intention...

But, get saying. think I'll concerned wherever go - God willing Australia pan option me. Rich countries build wall 2021 belive meant ""the *common concenseous is* US short, inbred cousin"". Thats awful... 

Here South Korea 1 175,000 so.  I'm happy well response (And lessons learned abysmal response MERS epidemic 2015... hindisight, come rather cold say but, thank god happened experts learned thing two it) yeah, situation horrible Philippines, 14 18 recently imported cases country people Philippine.  America got wall 50% us wanted. keeping people out. keeping us in. **stop believing bullshit use head**

I would say same, believing they’ve made everyone believe also replied another comment thread facts maybe go check out. two mistaking selection qualification.

Donald Trump selected American people run country, it’s debatable he’s qualified.

Bill Gates selected, hence musings musings, policy. Nation wide undetectable huge population natural death rate. might even fewer deaths nationwide due reduce pollution first quarter lockdown.

Maybe noticable Wuhan doubt figures made public. two mistaking selection qualification.

Hopefully we'll get vaccine treatment soon.  eh survey flaw nly countries masks mandatory public. dont need wear mask general public Germany public transport shops close 100% One issues kids abusive families stuck home without able contact school officials like normal, families rely breakfast dinner clubs feed kids, well obviously free school lunches, struggling get enough food table. 

It's difficult one logic behind it. response that's cause non-compliance. People weighing individual odds, rather odds community. IFR 0.0017 still tens thousands children dead continues.
 
But hey, long kid, huh? Yeah. Last checked, child sex abuse aka ""pedos"" quite illegal country. much dedicate entire Chris Hansens hunting down! implication all. sympathetic toward essential workers putting line us past several months. Thank you!

I see educational setting particularly dangerous, though. 

First, education hours-long exposure 30-to-180 people day day, environment masks even mandatory, (in regions) explicitly frowned upon.

Second, *children* involved schools way comes essential jobs. Add fact evidence mounting kids indeed spread virus quite efficiently, makes opening schools in-person learning especially idiotic.

Also, education done virtually, even less effective; jobs *truly* essential society, though -- things involve getting food water populace, example -- literally done way grocery store.

There's episode TWiV -- episodes, actually -- comment environments schools seem almost custom designed mimic worst-case-scenario science experiment viral spread. daughter special needs refuse send back school. I’m APALLED parents wealthy community insisting disabled children go back options. risk child’s life also risk teachers’, paras’, therapists’ lives. year two home best isn’t end world. Death is. [**I it!!!** winds shit keep blowing shit virus around. I'm Canada though, I'm area locals look funny wear mask. places like here, I'm willing bet social pressure others contributing it. Oh please act like democrats better governing. suck. Average time exposure symptoms 5 days, yeah, there's 2-14 day window. read accurate day testing 8 days exposure, still 80% accurate. theyre stupid. wont know difference. That's dark that's path people choosing read something lot people incorrectly believe suicidal means actively try kill like jumping bridge direct means. Often times means engage reckless behavior hopes shortens life die. Like engaging unprotected sex random strangers hopes getting deadly STD. Life US downswing awhile lot people struggling lot things simultaneously told they're allowed talk anything. 

When state shelter place order noticed one senior citizen walking around without mask standing way close people masks social distancing reccomended assumed know better. I'm sure. wish well. Indoor activities 19 times riskier outdoor activities according Japanese research, ""The odds primary case transmitted COVID-19 closed environment 18.7 times greater compared open-air environment (95% confidence interval [CI]: 6.0, would want find size event use tool enter number people attending wedding, site generate map probablity least one would Covid positive. Take care good luck Need advice. might’ve exposed:

-My girlfriend’s sexual partner sexually intimate someone tested positive COVID (he found today, since got test results back). 

-My gf sex partner. 

-my girlfriend hooked yesterday stayed night. 


-What’s likelihood I’ve infected?

-what, anything, recommend establishment medicine start case I’m infected? (Besides obvious self-quarantining next 2 weeks) articles June, people atleast pretending socially distance. 👏 citizens care. least ones half brain cell do. It’s government doesn’t care it’s fucking scary. roommates idiots Apparently. Last checked (maybe two days ago) 24 inmates died complications related COVID. two dozen confirmed cases. guard died, maybe they'll actually something it. inmates mean people. plenty leadership, lead everyone wrong direction. open bar/nightclub going refuse take people's money, ""pandemic pandemic"" I’m fine. I’ll fine since fortunate situation begin with. I’m pissed fuck we’ve wasted 5 months we’d control people behaved 3 weeks. Keep mind us care supposed facing bankruptcy? work hope win lotto something? objectively pessimistic dude

Fauci high hopes vaccine tho, get mistaken. Also, common cold actually often rhinovirus. live virus long term means going like flu something, exists huge factor life.

You hold reservations vaccine sort idea there's higher chance fails works.

And comorbidities still part social distancing/wearing mask etc Yes, us do. It’s instance “most” don’t matter. 5 million cases huge majority asymptomatic slight cough best Nice

I see pretty high level mask wearing stores well. priced plan let go almost $600 didn’t cover much. case data worldometer messed due provinces reporting weekends. linked website shows much better indication it’s trending, mini bump went back There's interesting Chris Hayes podcast weeks back explores certain people reject facts listen certain conservative commentators. Even intelligent people. Good! Anyone rides Harley definitely attend Sturgis year. good Harley rider dead one. said, feel bad bystanders they're inevitably going kill. Calm son, country, put make euros like you. Distancing definitely difficult school, let’s perpetuate myth mask wearing WAY difficult. Fukushima corona virus wants go Japan going hot take, bear end reading comment

I care. nothing do. social distance. wear mask. limit places go to, eat cook everything home.

Europeans always looking US. Yes majority guys better healthcare, governments, programs, you’ve handled pandemic better, shut fuck up. countries smaller us. US size Europe 48 connected mainland states, 2 others (Hawaii Alaska). state run different governor. governors hands tied power limited state runs money can’t continue making promises fulfilling them.

Because populations smaller ours, less cases. per capita stat works individual state either really good really bad. exponential growth thing. country say, 1/5 size US, cannot multiply case numbers 5 make direct comparison way. You’re accounting exponential growth. something that’s hard actually predict account person varying degress exposure others depending work, else go day.

As usual, Europeans make direct comparison countries don’t account massive US is. many people are. things get handled federal, state, local level. doesn’t apply covid also pretty much anything else Europeans ever wonder differently them. always hookers blow. wonder many people believe science this...I can't come grips people ""believe"" science country founded criminals genocide, yet we'we're taking seriously.
 Sounds methy sincerely hope right! hate country much really not. endless touting hydroxychloroquine without even agreement medical experts fresh lot people's minds. Also Germany shut tried buy exclusive rights vaccine development. absolutely doubt he'd succeeded, he'd touted vaccine far wide best option, matter effective actually was, side effects many vaccines might effective. all. the. time. uses bully pulpit market brand brands support (wtf fucking beans). can't trust anything says. He's pushy salesperson. wonder many millions China reporting think develop standardized mask future use, since virus cannot eradicated.

Keep everyone page, protectionwise America whole care Covid? Nope.

Some us rest simply till someone close dies it. Nothing convince Dems Bill Gates behind non-sense people wearing masks weak, till die.

It's long time coming. Crippled education systems churned ignorant self-important people world ever seen. Cases hospitalizations falling CA good rate (transmission well one) first time since pandemic began. Deaths catch soon, certainly appear dropping moment. 

Worse news although cases falling, seem flattened last days. holds, probably means curve hospitalizations flatten week so, we'll stuck transmission rate around one.

As others said thread, kind slow burn may worst scenario economy. pandemic made lose faith human race. 

Nah. Americans. world losing faith Americans. disease disproportionately kills old, ailing disabled, poor, people color, poor.

So demographic one sees internet media, frankly, no. view reduction populations benefit.
Even though elders die horrible, agonizing deaths. They're fine it. Maybe part Swedish anyone suspected.

The regime loyalists would throw toddlers vat boiling sap Trump said to, sending petri dish either sicken themselves, kill gradmama, both, well, guess is. mean, thing is, old people choice occasionally around younger people that'd carrying though. could keep bubble two months herd immunity acquired, sure, that's really realistic. much protect people protecting themselves. That’s plan! think Western world's perception Pakistan clouded recent history, news Pakistan inevitably security problems, political corruption, terrorism, etc. People genuinely surprised Pakistan succeeding containing Covid, especially India poorly. Prior \~1980, Pakistan outperformed India, roles switched, India performed better past decades. Covid exception Pakistan comprehensively beating India. Pakistan started higher number cases deaths India, Pakistan apparently squashed curve. articles written attributing success conservative society, knows. Meanwhile, Bangladesh seems stabilized numbers, yet fall dramatically Pakistan. Three South Asian countries apparently seeing three different Covid outcomes. Translation: I'm intellectually curious enough work myself, here's three things heard certain news channel pass real opinion. one Georgia, Florida, Minnesota, South Carolina...lots.

You could also read article. says 25 died last month alone. That’s schools shut down.  trump promised going something way BETTER much CHEAPER ACA, remember? I'm sure coming day now, said so, know. curiosity what's metric schools open?

Are going transmission rate cases something else? That’s im talking about. Definitely agree luck thing. 

I couple friends vacationed recently NY huge family groups different homes. Like 6 7 families sharing lake house week. 

I'm sure could avoid covid situation like that. I'm guilty nobody that's it. Pessmism? Dont confuse pessimism reality. easy do, Ill let go.

Fauci said cautiously opitmistic reason- even knows vaccine coronavirus odds. Common cold coronavirus. havent cured one. one? benefit many developments, see it, I’ll believe it. commoner, ass end vaccine......Even said virus isnt going anywhere going live it....

Unless continue develope vaccine tech first batch get close 100% possible? hold reservation. 

Also. comorbidities. may not, do. It’s disabled problem Exactly this. Yeah US hasn’t done great job handling this. half people sub hate boner country. I’d honestly bet Europe paying attention going ever here. It’s likely white people Twitter think offended everyone’s behalf. Reddit thinks virtue signaling rest world “We’re great. Don’t worry guys, don’t like country” somehow gonna impress Europeans. there's one thing last 4 years taught me, depths denial stupid people bottom.

I fear many people _refuse_ recognize truths talking about, matter much evidence piled front eyes. fear even fear abstract one certainty. I’m sorry dude. don’t lose hope Ramen noodle packs cheap, stackable, last forever. numbers fluid uncertainty many infected actually detected testing (impacting IFR dramatically) also availability quality care also advances understanding disease development treatments (impacting CFR IFR dramatically). CFR starts looking like SARS people can't get medical care need, we've already seen places hospitals run capacity midst outbreak. Bizarre ppl afraid long term effects this.. Well options, could curbside someone shop you. temps may normal range anyway.  care, politicians care thier problems actual human lives. Everything people commented plus: COVID19 binary - like cold get sick bit better lingering side effects. get super sick, chances come least one following conditions: hair loss (predominatly female patients); dermitius (purple toe rash); difficulty breathing; heart murmur/arthmia; increased chance embolism stroke; kidney damage (possibly needing dialysis rest life much shorter); increased neurological impairment (thinking concentrating much harder before); infertility (currently male patients). Lots people don’t know anyone who’s it, find hard believe serious doesn’t personally affect anyone know. measures stop adversely affecting everyone know. would point opening?

To reach herd immunity..my god thick Bet black. White people get warning came conclusion many years ago (i'm American)

The problem America lot Americans fucking morons

Its really simple. reason Trump president cause Americans fucking morons. are, complicated. top head, Affordable Care Act (yes, realise Mitt Romney’s original idea), bailing banks without enormous restructure huge increased accountability (again, realise make changes), assassination Osama Bin Ladin (we would attempted keep alive don’t death penalty, although again, realise still may died due circumstances discovery), TransPacificPartnership (that would absolute fucking disaster Australia), use drone strikes combat (practised, preferred, Australia), anything pro gun situation rural sport shooting professional hunting contexts, anything overtly religious (which country strongly associated right-wing melodrama). 

Even DACA might considered little right wing Australia, quite sensible. Bearing mind, Australia strongly centre right almost 25 years (with brief pause). Obama would considered charismatic glorious right-wing leader Australian Aborigine instead African American man. probably would power least three four terms. would immensely popular. far right loons would even used evidence Australians aren’t racist anymore (because voted black man....sigh....that shit happens too....it’s fringe USA). 

By comparison, Republican Party would receive 10% National vote, mostly state QLD, seems produce delusional, stupid, racist completely unhinged populist politicians. would taken seriously one term, people would laugh them. True, become moot we've already lost 160,000 quite possibly double loss end year? majority preventable? need reach *any* already national tragedy criminal level. classic Christians behave way say. see news hear people say small percentage makes rest look bad. like Muslim extremists make Muslims look bad. I'm Christian believe science understand importance. respect think great tool given thrive planet. religious people crazy zealots. Stop generalization already. Realistically, religion Politics refusal work together levels government across country what's corroding Nation within. links google, please post original article link working like everything alright gonna force people crowded areas like public transportation lunch cafeterias. Normally work 10 man crew two supervisor. dangerous thing request go back work. areas see numbers going kids going back school go school, we'll go work whomever dies dies cause needed feed families get education? It’s like movie playing front eyes possibly sequel “idiocracy”, sure lot similarities. family strictly social distancing since mid-March. I'm threshold giving up. Nobody give fuck. go years, end... done what's right made bit difference.

The last straw: friend mine's daughter traveling league softball, contracted COVID. Shocker, right? sick days feels fine. gone five days coach telling come back felt fine ""it's okay"". 

I'm dangling thread. I'm tired living day things get worse everyone around lives life per usual. grand collective epiphany never come we're fucking brainwashed here... What's use?! even fucking bother. Dollar Tree packed time. husband even saw line people waiting unlock doors one morning. guess that's statement shit economy. version playboy since 1960s, usually vacation spot Puerto Rico America nothing done school shootings every weeks. surprise anyone shit show pandemic is. think also one's mindset too. fight new way living tooth nail, totally buy narrative downplays it. accept try make best it, process ""badness"" situation without losing shit. reason sturgis going Bubble breaker... hope sent home driving Ford Fiat Yeah, tested people’s blood 2016.

Americans throwing ground like “yes we’re horrible take pity us”

I care. nothing do. social distance. wear mask. limit places go to, eat cook everything home.

Europeans always looking US. Yes majority guys better healthcare, governments, programs, you’ve handled pandemic better, shut fuck up. countries smaller us. US size Europe 48 connected mainland states, 2 others (Hawaii Alaska). state run different governor. governors hands tied power limited state runs money can’t continue making promises fulfilling them.

Because populations smaller ours, less cases. per capita stat works individual state either really good really bad. exponential growth thing. country say, 1/5 size US, cannot multiply case numbers 5 make direct comparison way. You’re accounting exponential growth. something that’s hard actually predict account person varying degress exposure others depending work, else go day.

As usual, Europeans make direct comparison countries don’t account massive US is. many people are. things get handled federal, state, local level. doesn’t apply covid also pretty much anything else Europeans ever wonder differently them. watched wrestling since 80's / 90's. can't stand wrestling product now. time police dawn riot gear actually don’t carry don’t want protesters get hold gun close proximity.

Thank you, though ❤️ 40-50 cases day entire province ""skyrocketing"", especially almost linked known outbreaks.  Dr. Bonnie even said cases arise things get back normal. 

Calm down.

People part still great job public businesses. see people wearing masks back March, things seem almost back normal right minus large events gatherings. think still great job pandemic Canada, especially BC. science even stick basic scientific method 

And earth flat right? Let's ignore hundreds thousands scientists myriad disciplines, agreeing thing. would add ‘entitled’ list. “We notified Arkansas Department Health, advise currently affirmative steps team members need take,” memo said...”

No steps? quarantine, enhanced contact tracing testing? seems world like people purposefully pretending pandemic isn’t happening. 

This becoming mental illness. People pushed past brink reason misinformation propaganda point manifesting symptoms mass psychosis. “It is” Stupid sexy. 👍 never understand go ""We shut schools!"" ~100,000 cases ~2,000 deaths mid late March ""We open schools!"" 5 million cases 160,000 deaths. low-key racism comment. white-panic dogwhistle. cool. They're sickness.

OOOOOOOH-WAHAHAHA!! cannot eat mask though Hi Aragón, region worst numbers entire Spain.

Experts actually sure explanation differences Spain european countries, especially Spain probably one countries mask laws gotten stupidest (you wear mask even mountains one around).

It probably mix many factors: Spanish culture (very social nature, love hanging close other), unhealthy working conditions workers farmers, nightlife reopened (and starting close again), households shared people average countries. would also interesting compare amount tests countries able normalize data (I think testing Spain going fairly well).

Then again, Italy country shares features, sure numbers different now... knew reporting data HHS would cause disease much less infectious deadly? Europeans? Europe waste continent composed many countries completely different mean morally intellectually better America express judgement US actions.

I'm glad quit. Sorry rough.

One thing consider, fellow linelong Generalized Anxiety Disorder sufferer: 

For people, anxiety last year vs year must feel double. G.A.D. sufferers like me, feels like 5% increase. every day felt like this... last year. years before. 

So now, family turning I'm one *looks* calm crisis. facade. lots practice coping constant adrenaline, fear, that. 

All suggest get much sleep kids let you. Sleep foundation emotions built on. literally slept *all day* yesterday (I'm yet fortunate enough children). I'm better. helped. small-minded mentality costing US. got much prosperity global trade, losing trust rest world. yes, worried country.

As someone works one many industries benefits greatly America near monopoly world stage, worry might leave country idiots like ruined economy.

But maybe bad thing. currently feel like choice stay US work. perhaps countries start pick slack, I'll options live work. One biggest Trump fans I've ever met Canadian lol. Yep, nothing add that. wanted Canadian Trump.

And without public healthcare social safety net, looks like sort historic tragedy fear likely afflict America."" one who's seeing coming since 20 year ago? look cool... strong weakest friend basically could title article.

I mean, take article, starts gross generalization like ""American men failing pandemic."" seriously?

Wouldn't majority people downvoted me, started complaining sexism sentence would said women?

The whole article presents 0 proof correlation male pride wearing mask. I'm pretty sure lot varying reasons men wear less masks women. no, people read title shitty article online basically immediately assume truth.

And get wrong, wear mask. definitely. I'm excusing men wearing one. personally, think mask mandatory soon public, everywhere. stores like, everywhere. issue article. Revealed? think filters rating n/kn95. Kn95 Chinese version n95's. long mask right fit, essentially wearing n/kn95. care Europeans think? would find odd, though, seeing seen past X days lived here? There'll couple games evidence side season played time. literally dropped ball starting last year pay price, love, things love look forward to. 
Maybe given warning time went never realize effects us personally... that's we're right now. actually five TBH reminds bit Y2K. valid concerns fact ticking year 2000 systems constructed would cause sorts problems. effort government business address time immense. result, major hiccups year 2000 arrived. stupid people pointed whole thing ""overreaction"". Well, duh, yes, nothing happened *because* taken seriously enough colossal effort made avert disaster.

tl;dr: unimaginative people always see successful prevention proof nothing needed prevented. New Zealand testing (per capita) half much US, joke too?

You test many people sick. CO low positivity rate make bullets small enough shot viruses kids let you, naps help too. Even 20 minute ones. Thanks info! point believe main reason certain people (either stupid lacking human empathy... Specifically referring ""leaders"") want open schools longer give people ""excuse"" collect unemployment... Never mind health economy directly linked health people... don’t know Florida reopening, least California, announced everyone’s pass would extended however long parks would closed. Sure legally didn’t smart business decision anger large part customer base.

But yeah, parks open Florida, stop extending passes tell passholders it’s they’re taking advantage full duration. irresponsible. Cool Generalization someone obviously doesn’t know shit!
First off, love south park episode, it’s fantastic lot truth it. First tho, poorly built motors? Lol obviously never owned one worked motorcycle life. Second, it’s exhaust makes loud engine, quieter exhaust sacrificing HP’s. Like said before, people like you, obviously don’t understand get motorcycles all, would drive like normal person, stay phone use signal, maybe loud exhaust wouldn’t necessary. Performance vehicles types loud, fuckin deal it.  really took covid reveal that?  Trump rotten core America. administration things would dramatically different. 

But Republicans Fox take cues Trump, position ignore see vital medical aid something dispense favors rather something manage experts. Pretty good evidence anticapitalist.

Most arguments prove capitalism can't deal this. Por que los dos? men shitty women bed exclude women shitty men bed. argue first greater scale would agree, neither exactly rare phenomenon. Write politicians. VOTE out. politicians cause meaningless fear. chosen help lead, meanwhile create havoc putting whatever special interest telling rather protecting masses. power write something power vote it. vileness current administration distorted perceptions good public official is. Shit people waxing nostalgic George W. Bush doesn’t blood million Iraqis hands wasn’t *openly* hateful unapologetically corrupt.  shedoad papers written military universities right disinfo force multiplier biological attack. It’s become apparent actual pathogen doesn’t neither extremely viral uniquely deadly long plenty useful idiots primed spread it. country live in? Yeah fetishization 'freedom' strange.

By logic, take person drop middle ocean, great completely 'free': rules, responsibilities, accountable anyone/anything, say/act/believe whatever want, nobody ever go tell live.

Of course...they eventually drown. empty freedom. nothing else.

Freedom without regard values, responsibilities, obligations hollow meaningless. big pharma working vaccine. big pharma one going able produce vaccine numbers work? College can’t they’re “students” well. try bubble would admit different students pay them. biggest name college football like Trevor Lawrence Justin Fields trying desperately unionize get season going, NCAA either cancel admit student part student-athlete farce. Let's say store wanted hand-out masks patrons one.

It would kind avoid unnecessary hassles. Imagine Rocky remade today.

Rocky: “Yo Kareeeennnnnn... it!  complained manager!” Thanks bro, 😘 sure angry Andy. 

The point lot value learning Mandarin school. language matter. Using negative consequence America's decline type racist dog whistle towards Chinese littered across Reddit. way, I'm anti CCP. Ironic chose display textbook American narcissism here. point litmus test find sort reactions occur without actually using it. like dumping brick potassium hoping explode. paying attention? states started reopening months ago. state schools slated reopen fall, entirely in-person learning. 

Although one millions Americans lost job permanently, truly feel you. imagine must pretty pissed guy who's slashing unemployment benefits. There's nothing that. hope people responsible spreading get hit worst. would need to? tell people something disproved many times - like, say, vaccines cause autism - idiots infect everyone around free. Yeah, Dativ German. correct spelling. actually, would locative, German language one (like ablativus locativus latin example). ""Der Fisch stinkt (von woher?, notice ""von wem?,"", would correct question determine Dativ really fit well...) vom Kopf her."" actually substantial part heritage, suppose makes loathe so, quick recognize everywhere. too, telling think history?  course pejorative, largely well deserved. Hillbillies limited Appalachians. appreciate European health officials condemning Trump Congress failure handle pandemic, hope use this, like 9/11, another excuse crack civil liberties, move far direction government control often see Western countries. notes state's main covid reporting page People PROUD ignorance. Right. “A hard lockdown”

Compared Sweden, yes. 

Compared UK, Spain, Italy, Belgium, even Germany countries Western Europe, no. hard all. 

As I’ve spend summer Denmark Sweden guarantee notable difference attitude amongst populations large. 

At time clear Danish authorities politicians appear take much seriously Swedish colleagues continue downplay risks. know anybody career physical sports would want play virus going around cause **permanent respiratory damage**. 

And even mind blowing, people running organizations perfectly fine letting players play. 

I'm probably incredibly cynical, actual fuck living in? county canceled fair year instead decided hold fair foods festival people could still get corn dogs, cotton candy, lemon shakeups.

That wrong us. Safer alive weaker sick dead?

Priorities messed up. nice cock confirm. let boomers next gen become extremely entitled infatuated “personal freedoms” forgot considerate others. COULD, Huh. thought insecurities made look week. /r/Covid19 good information. sub circlejerk.  non maskers identified, treatment hospital back line come severe case virus. mean act confident getting sick. soon they're hurting, go running back medical community decrying earlier. Yeah myth ""personal responsibility"". deserve everything got kiddo. rich ? That's luck, that's born rich family, mean worked hard God loves you. poor, well God probably hates deserve everything. Netherlands 40 hour workweek pretty much standard, gets 20 vacation days. think correct. show research long term damage affecting huge numbers. death. may scarred life life may significantly shorter it. Another study tell us we've known 100 yrs.

Hopefully point sinks people listen science instead believing ""Covid racist"" start testing/supplementing people deficiencies especially darker skin produce much naturally.

A simple inexpensive way save lives gets ignored fit narrative. case me, currently get 25 vacation days (20 mandated law + 5 seniority company + 5 days performance qualify for). I'll moving France now, put 30+ vacation days year. even know use 20 days already! lol  going time people start giving serious thought purposely getting infected, isolating themselves, getting with?

That first paragraph. get sense thinking asking employees infect themselves?

I'm literally asking myself.  Shit, already knew that. They’re called Republicans. KN95 buy nowadays legit. initial flood sub-par quality KN95 made new factories trying make buck due mask shortages, seems like Chinese gov shut now. KN95s definitely much better cloth masks, common design medical use (the ear looped ones, tight seal). People Asia used wear ear loop designed reaspirators protect air pollution (the common Korean KF94 design also ear loop).

If willing spend bit more, actually buy N99 N100 masks industrial distributors like Grainger MSC Industrial. realize whole ""poor blaming slightly less poor"" thing makes billionaires giggle? Totally. snowflakes today internet. day affordable housing, minimum wage jobs could support family abundance factory jobs. None new fangled avocado toast inner-net thingamagiggy. Ah yes. Like voting Hillary, yes? changed everything right? 

The system broken. participate, sheer unwillingness vote. EC, primaries first past post makes lot easier. lead 2 party systems dividing effect society outside US except maybe UK 2 dominant parties. Please go look Ibiza right now. literally acting like it’s still 2018 don’t think mishandling pandemic 90% fault GOP it’s totally fucked leadership, you’re wrong.

New York State issued travel ban 19 states- FIFTEEN republican controlled.

The GOP, led Donald Trump idiot cronies, led us path. Dems **not** “just irresponsible inconsiderate”- honestly saying something like isn’t helpful.

This whole nation needs move left. Oh, never mind wrong. Sorry that, thank correction! lol. friendly ribbing. Based posts here, feel like we're side - feel like probably going come realization soon enough. Cheers! ""Revealed?""

I thought well known. Americans toddlers. America land propaganda tho, confusion understandable.

This. somebody lived briefly US (grades 1-7), understanding reality distortion field moved back Canada.

The Cult America scary af. Because, like cults, reality controlled ways members even aware. Exactly. Murican stereotype manly man high strength, absolutely appalling constitution, intelligence, wisdom.

Strength means nothing virus. need good constitution (high immune system, eat healthy, exercise, sunshine), high IQ, high wisdom (self discipline, humility, concern others) sounds like something someone can't bicep curl 350 would say It’s best really.

If intergalactic olympics would win gold human killing event every time saw study said 78% patients myocarditis three weeks months later. sure time interval lazy Google. basically heart swelling. yet stop US Army waging war back then. fair Europe often aggregated one single block comparing kinds things, populations economic power. actually lived Geneva 7 years kid although friends seem give shit anymore. seems like Swiss government still reluctant impose face mask restrictions indoors many people wear public transport, least according friends. case, Switzerland one healthiest countries world population 8 million. densely populated either, I'm surprised. friend told hospitals never got crowded even though expecting worst. sorry aggregated everything one. mainly talking France, Spain, Italy UK. Although 4 countries seems like Italy best. 

it's bit shit show UK. government months said 'there evidence show face masks work' finally admitted effectiveness 2 months ago. long list shambles, started quarantining countries June, 3 months after. 

however, apart governments, talk general psyche people, loads people flocking beaches hot, bars reopened (somehow schools?) absolute shit show: think Western society general lacking togetherness makes people stop thinking want individuals 'greater good'. Asia total opposite, also comes problems (too much pressure confirm individuality). context fighting public health crisis though seems like Asia wins even though Japan acting un-Japan like. first knew Almodovar's muse Spanish films (Tie up, tie first movie saw him). also Evita, Philadelphia, Interview Vampire... lots films. I've never seen Spy Kids shit lol. anything lead food colorings? mean youre trying control nation actively make dumber. think America failed experiment point. one B list celebrities constantly tell prime. Revealed? took?

America perfect example 50/50 nice smart people, fucking psychotic idiots. no, venn diagram Dem/GOP. Ya'll fucking stupid nice intelligent 

Too many people, much access outside. think Biden presidency improvement even laughed reporter day asked tested. mean within 8 months right? Vaccine ready distributed according reports read countries pandemic response units?

Damn imagine ignorant think countries those. going many quarantines NFL happen may look indistinguishable scab season. I've slowed enough parachute unnecessary Covid like hang crowds, I’m sure one brought along though! Here's latest case/death charts San started rising last month deaths following suit. Maybe restaurant rules revised. Ok kinda agree. lockdown clears infections rate regardless many start with. vaccine. gotta get population go along.... America arrogant douche bag high school needs ass whopping dose reality. Except never ever get rich protected. Except every often something comes along give shit money anything else gives ass whooping. exposed arrogant, selfish, assholes ignored back yard long time. Yea know come back. everything power keep bay long possible.  disagree you. also complicated US states larger populations EU countries, vice versa. state much smaller Germany. California much bigger Finland. Similarly, US much bigger Germany. mater try compare issues. Adjusting population helps different policies different results depending population size, well different standards measuring kinds statistical things. Right, would assume blame patrons. times NYC, I've simply forgotten times put mask speaking waiter habit. bet whose jobs depend event definitely want happen  Manhattan republican? massive statistically evident differences two groups though, sides stuff ridiculous ever seems need said defense Republicans, Democrats rarely ever something wrong, usually different magnitude wrongness. perfect description neighbors head. 9-5 become phrase people use ""full time"" work. usually much, much that. We’ve got industrial scale misinformation campaigns waged progressively less educated electorate handful duchebags gold toilets second favorite private jets...

Jerk offs thread don’t mind swindled allays fear. 

There’s fuckin way shithole Florida handling good clearly bullshit numbers say. 

Sure. Florida effective. can’t roll eyes enough. 

PhD virology/biochemistry. you, 40% Americans afford $400 emergency prepandemic. Fuck you, bot. nothing political post. Antibody tests NYC show 20% population thats herd immunity? joke.  Don’t try fathom priorities government. many Americans died cause total? number last year? hit mostly killed supporters wasnt best move nothing virus. videos I've seen US recently show large amounts people wearing masks. Certainly less Ireland yet apart outbreaks meat processing plants recently things largely control since May Well chances altered based factors like age, medical history immune system too, considering theres pool 1 100 people going die causes anyway year, dying corona instead, average person's chances surviving got actually much better that.

But course point we're trying cautious sake vulnerable people otherwise *wouldn't* died year (no way telling who) easy precautions certainly order. Masks, large gatherings, self quarantine inform others experience symptoms (since symptoms associated virulent spread apparently), extra caution around elderly immunocompromised, example. dare say that? Everyone knows good news fact pandemic lie.

We going die china probably 5 billion deaths already. think understand excess deaths work. 213,000 people died year (from cause) previous years. matter coroner wrote death certificate. Count number dead bodies year compare previous years. There's 213,000 dead bodies. Try getting information outside bubble. know get information from. act like civil obedience produce results. History disagrees you. FAR think instead making light dire situation, really try better. go you, lot seriousness detracted humour nothing funny many people dying could prevented people part. That's 0.5% Americans dead.

compared 3.7% cases resulted death rise unresolved cases result death

Or 0.3% death rate ignorant Americans claim disease has... lower total population death counting people alive never contracted disease happen quite quickly.
One thousand would mean double total cases, need infect another 2% population that, room x50 (less, considering infected greater tests) Hate see process choosing sacrificial adult. anyone reporting studying notable drop reported cases HHS assumed control data reporting CDC? 

We shocked White House took control data reporting concerned misreporting underreporting would happening nationwide. then, nothing since then, even though expected, soon HHS control data, cases flattened started decreasing. worship leaders need daycare agree easily. Lol true envisage average rate deaths per year period coronavirus gone? corona virus caused premature death people already short life expectancy?  Sitting outside city hall DDoSing IP addresses employee Wi-Fi using IP stresser also works Checks date article expecting around April 2, 2020...nope wife's family I'm pretty sure would emigrated US now. There's really good justifiable reason live versus somewhere like Europe Fuck stupid ass joke. We're talking people dying. Sweden people normal circumstances travel bus time, also high earners. Less now, course. state epidemiologist Swedens travelled four hours train day whole crisis, since lives quite far Stockholm.  Even people iq average trump voter would shut homes virus became deadly though. Okay many people would died anyway? need contextualize Penn State’s rival always Pitt last years produced fun mini rivalry OSU. Well zoom Chyna? need MS Teams safe. skydive year, chance dying 1 100,000.

Plenty people would afraid take risk, still concerned this.  difference is, America morons president. Also American healthcare, faults, really good excess capacity. Italy got overwhelmed really quickly, America never got bad. Filthy seppos People scared many lost perspective. people joke, many 2000 Americans diabetes morbidly obese Gen X entered chat Half people don’t think it’s much threat don’t take necessary precautions, another large portion thinks it’s outright fake August yet still shit together?!? replied wrong person. It’s early.  severe say. major cities pretty much got locked 2 weeks around Chinese New Year, Wuhan Hubei province locked month half thereabouts. Interprovincial travel heavily restricted areas new positive cases. grandparents neighbor buy everyone building's groceries 2 weeks.

And yeah literally pictures makeshift hospitals built Wuhan. sent 10% countries doctors Wuhan/Hubei province. Everyone wore masks government advising at-risk groups double triple masks could find them. knew shit February. Republicans Absolutely incredible blaming Trump gets upvotes blaming China gets downvoted. incredible. shit hole place is. “Now land Pakistan — international flights resumed — would know world still midst pandemic killed hundreds thousands, caused trillions dollars trade commerce losses, ruptured supply chains, rendered centres world economy paralysed fears economic depression akin Great Depression.

The government announced full restoration economic, logistical, business activity led prime minister Imran Khan lately inaugurated country’s biggest construction projects desperate attempt bring green shoots employment commercial activity.” love well documented proven accusations.

You people want worse already (and really bad). anyone bothered check expected annual death toll exceeded it? I'd think someone would find interesting. Would consider vietnam vets drafted go war commit atrocities need live rest lives, come back home hated majority population given true benefits love normal life afterwards years life lost? 

And news flash: younger people forced gather schools, positivity rate skyrocketing age group teens especially people 20’s 30’s, would turn out, people 20’s 30’s requiring hospitalization skyrocketing rates too. young child/teenager dying news headline now, don’t see headlines 20-29 year olds anymore, they’re statistics

If make choice pulling plug mother who’s ventillator order 20 something year old stranger get it, you’d thing “well course, life years, sorry mom it’s real, it’s good, it’s real good.”? kind does, lot less Americans Fear-mongering work intelligent. photo implies smaller class size. One teacher said class sizes may adjusted always large. way socially distance desks. Plus think hallway photo student got trouble for. Wot. That's... exactly math works. think purpose converting nominal deaths per million deaths is? Great comparison. Bro 20% hospitalization rate that's absolutely hilarious. Provide sources. @kimjongun nuke us plzzz China's lock downs easily draconian world, track trace brought quickly country, government afraid act like authoritarian totalitarian dictator, people complain en masse locked high rises. pog? think saying thing person you’re replying to. maybe try throw around terms like “asinine”. Someone knows use calculator China made viruses don’t enough PPE medical field, earth schools going supply PPE staff students? young person (under 30) nothing seething rage hate inside me. Even things change, 'revolutionary' politicians 80 years old business driving let alone running country...I wish nothing death 9/10 brain-washed family members. hate start overnight, years knowing realizing live Canadian dream Amen that. learn lesson yet? Belgium counted hard. suspicion counted. Plus late response.

In US hand hospitals actively surpressing counts. Five times many pneumonia deaths years, ass. ... spread occurs inside classrooms outside playground. Yikes. Thanks detailed reply. Hope continues recover! much care either could decide mandate masks.

That one act alone would probably reduce community transmission order magnitude. This. one exposed colds primary teachers. seriously get it, perfectly honest. could people cold ignore pandemic sake politics? sincerely hope guys better leadership next term. There's nothing worth reclaiming. always fake. No, don't. blood line god. coffin dance ireland. local town 6200 people it. Conceptualize many times town know would removed existence. President stable genius would never lie us! ""Societal reaction"" ambiguous phrase. would say shutdowns restrictions extreme others would say preventive measures inadequate. I'm second camp. Countries low coronavirus numbers also low excess mortality. US effectively handled virus beginning, people would still alive complain wear masks free work party like usual. Belgium counted hard. suspicion counted. Plus late response.

In US hand hospitals actively surpressing counts.
 Five times many pneumonia deaths years, ass. could fill stadium 2,206 times. (331MM / 150k) 5 millions already?

Hitting 3 million mark seems like yesterday :( protests Germany actually following rules relatively good. one protest Berlin shit show, though, everyone confused police dissolve earlier. ccp demoralization work lmao I'm Canadian  Yes, we're midst second wave Antwerp. :( Honestly can't imagine ever living US fear. “Absurd”?

More absurd claiming increased risk teachers fact 10 percentage points average 40 percentage points comparable professions? made assumption based nothing top spreading misinformation disproven otherwise. downvoted assumptions made also posted bad info. Like whom? maybe compare South Korea Vietnam significantly higher population density huge populations? keeps night- what’s going happen regular flu season? Terrifying. chance four months shut starting March. We're starting like day 1 another four months. say ""hundreds"" thousands people? ""Hundreds""? 158,000 ""hundreds"" thousands. Stop exaggerating death toll Chinese flu. also add whole “precedent” fiasco government?

It’s long overdue country something corruption problem. stands, wait pieces shit fleece us absolutely fucking blind *then* decide anything it.

We need realistic protections consumers citizens again. country shell corporation wealthy right now.

People like Donald Trump shouldn’t ever able even dream becoming President. Even now, we’ve seen tax returns/financial disclosures.. even remotely reasonable? Fucking course not. Bold assume school knows ""incubation period"" ""community transmission"" are. knowing cruel people power world, widely accepted covid-19 manmade spread deliberately? too. wonder we’ll even know December, I’m worried accurately tracked new reporting system. comment made yesterday hammered home me. Somebody urging people vote November, pointed many voters dead then. Never mind amount time November take changes happen. Man, could claim going war coronavirus congress approve draft. make drafting requirements individuals refuse wear masks. force work ground-zero saving lives people coronavirus. maybe grasp intensity whole issue. kind getting tired stubborn people refusing freaking wear masks practice safe hygiene. Like much inconvenience really wear mask maybe 1-3 months clears up? everyone right thing could joining countries completely reopened. What's funny bet third world countries better containment are. lot us don’t . lot smart people country, even dumber people country make worse. 10 died causes.

Don't forget plenty reasons stay healthy, take care body, safe, live life extent can. short, pandemic risks making shorter.

(Anyone reads post good faith understand minimizing pandemic. pointing importance life, importance avoiding dangers life too. Reddit, add disclaimer). Anecdotal, asymptomatic man developed blood clots lungs seemingly nowhere.

Catching virus like entering lottery random negative health effects random severity levels ranging totally fine dead regardless age, lifestyle, genetic predisposition, comorbidities. mild fear, even effective vaccine produced deployed COVID becomes 'history', I'll left permanent agoraphobia :s Straw man. long Stars Stripes soldier. victoria, australia started seeing 200 cases STATEWIDE population 8 million, went full lockdown (no schools, compulsory masks fine, outdoor activity unless absolutely essential, work home, 1 hour exercise max) hundreds would die - hundreds died. attitude US mind boggling. Start researching typical death rates, lot people die time. We're probably already past point reducing co2 emissions anything. We're point need radically advanced recapture technology climate change cascades.  makes sense dude, already tell interest making sense. super bowl pandemic True that, humans (on average) extremely resilient adaptable: like say, much life incredibly difficult - speaking average person developed country.

It's life way easy ;). Except schools opened last week already closing putting people quarantine Strep pneumonia common superinfection top viral pneumonia like Covid-19. common finding autopsy Spanish influenza 1918-1920. numerous deaths ‘pneumonia’ strep cases obscured strep specifically sought. folks without insurance may well go hospital, ones insurance taking gamble insurance provider change mind 4 months injury deny claim. Britain similar hard aggressive course correction extent pandemic spread apparent. 

Hah, no. unwillingness act they're one world's worse cases. still airport health checks day. Hahahahahaha 90% states. school open open yet. someone suggesting result ""upcoming study"".

Does UK science backward? does. number people buying tickets going down. Americans comparing everything terrorists football fields lmao Yes *DID* read whole article. ""analysis"" section based study *hasn't published yet*. Meaning analysis garbage. fuck write article based study yet? U.S. schools reopen, study finds least 97,000 children recently infected

Trust me, I'm Tory minister. yet many young people area still say “this still like flu”. Makes sick. chilling. appears effect testosterone know, didn’t grill friend details it. told happened, reason lie it. seem made whole lot assumptions though. mom actually end paying bill insurance paid?   made especially frustrating. evangelical church, one teaching faith vs science. learnt Catholic settle debate thousand year ago, cannon teaching, conflict faith science. looked deep found wasted evangelical rubbish idea years. read somewhere, Houston think, even using kids cancer hospital extra covid beds. damn sure get serious get point. actually don’t care opinion. “Good enough” isn’t good enough. 1 every 100 Americans die every year upper class really pulled gotcha us convinced working class ends firm belief could elevated level one day. works fucking Disney store Greenpeace know, right? hate it, play Head Games like that? Exactly never said anything else. S. Koreas response one best world obviously way better UKs, almost everybodys response better US however. trying judge numbers isolated instead looking overall situation. US numbers cant similar European numbers without something fishy comparison. timing alone isnt factor timing action is. Including both, US failed massively. love dystopian fiction.

It normally make sad apprehensive.

This made sad apprehensive. compare pro sports? Masks everything men enjoy
You wear ya boys eyes country Georgia Florida, Texas coming behind.

Which states, ladies gentlemen, first reach following milestones COVID Olympics?

* 100 new cases per 100k per day 
* 50 deaths per 100k

It really anyone's game here. Twat's seems pretty accurate. I'm liberal, Republican american. impartial observer talked conservatives reddit. caught recovered fine go out. frankly amazing truly brainwashed population is. Thinking ok fuck socialism. Underrated comment no, call shirley. got wrecked virus worse state. estimated 25 percent NYC it. 

You control spike over. Wow. Thank you. believe ended mine long time ago too, ban foreigners kept Thailand Malaysia. Strongly endorsing vaccine, especially one happens made american, woule help appear strong competent. whole constituency based appearing strong resolute. far fetched he'd advocate vaccine way chloroquinine. Right?! could downloading app tracing activity, didn’t go out=get stimulus payment I'm sorry hear this, bro. know feel.

Like guy pool, piss himself. explained page, summer keep updating excel file data, weekly press release. 

Note - file contains data 2020-08-07 last 4, potentially 5 days incomplete yet. 

First look notes: compared baseline deaths (all causes deaths country) 2015-2019, 2020's period 1/3 2/8 **4834 excess deaths** recorded. Since start July deaths per day average baseline. 

Context: Based last week's report , COVID-19 reported deaths period **5757**. period 1/3 30/7 reported **5587** deaths COVID-19 based death certificates received 3/8. sooner realize Thanos right, better we’ll numbers go way up! “One death tragedy, one million deaths statistic.” - Joseph Stalin US ""better world"" according Trump 0.65% mean. 0.4% last update. new one soon China created released pandemic, intentionally covered up. kids terrible education ask teachers teach three different ways extra financial incentive? 

Oh yeah. hosed buddy. Exactly....it amazes get downvoted putting context 1 2000 number. Yet 600,000 + people die cancer every year another 600,000 + die heart disease USA. That's 1.2 million people. virus 0.2.

Any way, pointless discuss effectiveness masks USA published fatality rate. 100 times fatality rate Singapore. Singapore even zero fatalities within 50 000 infected workers.

As long world discusses masks bother figure people one country hardly die infected country die like flies, world deserve better. would 100% take bill gates advice manage limited resources get smooth running system. That's operating systems do. 1. $

2. $ Spain hit hard early elderly population. agree reason death rate high. point hit “we didn’t know” phase feb-mar much damage already done. lockdown aggressive, long lockdown. US situation Spain in, arguably New York maybe. 

Trump missed lot opportunities feb-mar get head pandemic halt spread US. I’m saying US could responded well Australia New Zealand, reaction time squandered it. 

There countries maintained growth cases deaths US company keeping saying lot. 

Again I’ll reiterate patterns. Italy Spain definitely slow initial responses “she’ll right attitude” change death toll climbed. Neighbors like Germany responded much thoroughly better health systems. 

At that’s really point, US hasn’t unlucky, there’s explanation every country higher death rate explanation every country low death rate. literally “score” badly government, health system society responded pandemic. Actually, population play big part progretion vírus. Population density much important due huge area US bad countries. It's... inside computer? expected annual death toll every year. Covid related. believe track regular death toll estimated even Covid. either people supposed die natural causes accidents die Covid count manipulated. literally thought day before. soon going hit 1 1000. keep getting worse. fuck people getting bullshit number.

Even optimistic estimates 1% leathality rate. read weird? mother told fathers brother... could said uncle. 

Probably bot, like half Reddit. believe you. Full stop. US government managed full50 state plan, adequate funding, staffing, coordination, proper guidelines (i.e. mask mandate), would problem.

They step pay force labs convert. rocket science. You’re wrong think going away. Even beat COVID global community, there’s super-viruses around corner. 

Increasingly dense overpopulated humanity combined increasingly devastated environment ever-marching progress scientific development means plagues fast-travelling viruses common, less. 

This new normal. Or, we're using stadiums illustrate point, imagine go sell-out basketball game Madison Square Garden, starters teams drop dead. That's slightly less we're talking proportionately. Operation human shield: get teachers children!  Let’s see, begin. chance? Huh? talking that? never nationwide shut control this. Then, patchy shut downs 90% opened have, didn’t follow reopening guidelines. lastly, wait til end year. many multiple hundreds thousands deaths. patients care whose entire family icu. It’s exaggerating anything all. don’t direct experience yet, doesn’t mean won’t. education system failed miserably finally get control get things working order mess, education one first reforms need. ever read book? much know viruses transmission? know many worldwide pandemics happened throughout history short long term effects were? long term effects costs millions new heart lung problems? many things consider, *if* care health nation. don’t give flying f*ck it’s cHiNeSe ViRuS nonsense. Don’t worry, limit somewhere around 3 100, hospitals manage. /s Bar exceptions whole Southern Europe hot hottest parts US. Even UK 30's week. Cdc takes total flu tests hospital visits flu like symptoms, math, comes guess many times number actual tests source say people miscounted cornavirus deaths. states likely people dying due issues occurred pandemic. Also talking March April. See took facts twisted convince people virus dangerous. even understand article saying lack education shows. filming new shows pandemic?

I assumed everything screen ""the times"", it'll nothing reruns til over.

The one time got spooked end Steve Wilkos Show episode made 2020. filmed sometime January March, must one last live tv audiences filmed. initial response Covid back February March ""Don't wear mask gloves disinfect anything front customers it'll scare away"". Every change they've made since purely paper show. 

 one point PR statement website saying employees test positive would get 2 weeks paid sick leave, never informed us it, reversed it, accused starting rumors asked it.

They also told us payroll would go reflect much extra time we'd spend cleaning, social distancing, etc. Never happened, therefore impossible keep pace expect working freight also maintaining cleaning protocols heaped top it.

 asked DTS standards would relaxed reflect often telling us clean high traffic areas wash hands, said ""if working register, fine"". Even though ever maximum 2 people store, we're *always* working register *and* stop cover register main cashier wash *their* hands. we're *lot* likely get shit meeting DTS standards Lysoling carts every hour, figure priorities there.

Our store manager told treat new employees disposable many people unemployed, we'd plenty new hires choose from. Disgusting.

For months emphasizing every conference call (employees) *required* wear masks. could wanted to, ""encouraged"" to, provided us. last month they've required supplied. 

Even they're ""requiring"" masks, employees allowed tell customers leave refuse. **They give fuuuuuuck.** little evidence Gavin Williamson qualified make statement. probably better health meassures took..?

Nah, think covering god knows many deaths cases without proof reallistic probability. government fucked response, atleast 2 weeks slow locking down. watching Italy get overwhelmed time going basically normal, instruction stay home symptoms household member symptoms include school shootings also? better comparison would cancer diseases think. estimated 606k people die cancer year USA. current rate corona probably beat that. terrifying think. I'm social worker hospital trauma floor.

of course still trauma patients, mainly people come falls motor vehicle accidents, they've even started using us covid floor bc there's need beds patients stroke scale, 10/10, worst possible, many people never recover that, discharged home, 1/10, he’s *amazing*, thank you, it’s truly blessing he’s well. 

...and again, see anyone stroke symptoms, *call 911 local emergency number*. Deaths definitely underestimated, guess, factor 1.5-2x, compared factor 5-10x Several countries exceeded ""stat"" What? No! Nobody's dumb! would mean could sin much want god know wore mask...what kid knowing entity fooled tiny piece cloth lol Come on, go ER think COVID severe symptoms. NY hospitals ran beds sent people nursing homes reaped havoc elderly

As turns out, covid got nursing homes via infected staff, residents, cases. issue nursing homes early days largely lack testing lack PPE. monitoring

DO. NOT. GIVE. 2020. IDEAS. really option places US now. imagine counties low counts might benefit, according George Tech's interactive model, covid-19 prevalent vast swaths US, pool 100 people, there's greater 99% chance someone crazy might find learn ask right questions...I could typed whole life story past 3 years give little background I'm pissed off, especially lately figured I'd spare reading pleasure...not mention, know enough trust I've deal anyway.

Long story short...
Lost father (piece shit got remarried middle school girlfriend divorce finalized moved Tennessee)
Lost sister (alcoholism destroyed liver kidneys 26 years old leaving behind two beautiful baby girls (my nieces I'm allowed see anymore father thinks I'm crazy))

but... he's trump going full ride die. Anyone else noticing sudden increase articles subreddit saying schools safe?

I'm half expecting ""school safe"" ""hydroxychloroquine great"" consolidated single message. what? Jesus christ people threatening child taking picture stupid people.

Its getting real fucking hard reading kind news days headlines like U.S. really call it. American Corp. “I don’t take responsibility all. again, we’re last, means we’re first. We’ve done great job”. confused creature. vegan strip club kicks ass! I’m welcome there

Hmm happen link people t-cells even prevalent people testing positive antibodies? I’d love read idea talking about, extent wonder ever left Bumfuck, Indiana.

The European Union considerably larger population United States even though US least twice large. EU population 510 million people United States population 325 million people. United States largely deserted wilderness compared Europe.



Europe less half amount cases confirmed, testing, next warning.

Read fucking article once. Principle superintendent need removed sued. 
**Fox News hosts Jeanine Pirro Brian Kilmeade received priority treatment PPE requests Kushner's coronavirus team, according new God damn put words perfectly.

I've felt crazy lately knowing days I'm going expected teach university physics lab situation far, far worse March shut campuses...

My fiancee spent maddening amount time home summer living rural area dual nature pandemic really comes literally everyone around us seems living normal (albeit ignorant) lives acting like we're fucking weird ones!! I'm imagining teeny tiny shockwaves viruses break sound barrier. People say this, immediately pull mask fucking cough. Projecting much? 

1. around 150,000[1]. Already exaggerating 50,000 try make point. great start
2. know 150,000 excess deaths, 30,000 unrelated COVID. 
3. idea effect mortality rest year. number might start balance later year less death viruses susceptible (primarily 70) already passed. Lots people taking account. 

There's countless repercussions lockdown had. Millions Americans lost health insurance risk losing homes. We've spent trillions dollars trying maintain economy. much money could canceled student loan debt implemented Bernie Sander's tuition-free education plan decades[2]. lockdown many consequences without tangible benefits. fact Sweden reached herd immunity without lockdown many deaths proves that. lower overall mortality Finland, impose lockdown. 

The sooner people realize virus going burn population vaccine becomes available better. Anywhere 10k - 45k people die over. making sure people access medical care treatment, there's much do. glorify lockdowns masks, they're miracles. Viruses spread sufficient amount population immunity. That's vaccines work first place. 

What bothers that, infinite wisdom, decide settled matter room debate. anyone disagrees receive criminal punishment? That's ridiculous. 

[1] fair, federal government hasn’t exactly fountainhead inspiration lately. ""It unfortunate targeted scapegoat origin virus,"" said. ""Any person would inevitably feel angry misunderstood subject unwarranted malicious accusations carrying research related work fight virus.""

Getting angry accusations like that, suspicious. deadly virus appeared far research lab study viruses... NORMAL ASK QUESTION ORIGINATED HERE! good way respond lab say understand suspicion given situation give full co-operation clear. Instead give much data get mad. suspicious. report gives median ages one COVID profession. 49 Kindergarten, 49 primary school. 

I know ages people working profession, would say age relatively evenly spread, extremely high median age. Probably common Sweden choose kindergarten work life-long career, quite many young caretakers. exact opposite everything mentioned.I 

Thats point. said means nothing.  Even crazier 25+% June, even counting infections course rate down.  school superintendent needs go. He’s lurching one bad decision another, wanting reopen school begin with, suspending student whistleblower, trying explain away bad decisions virus gives shit technicalities. 

This bad leadership looks like, know inspired it. president. giant dude equal healthy least, sorry Tell dead Waiting vaccine smart strategic move. Gaining natural herd immunity guarantee, let alone maintaining it. cripple nation every time resistance needs boost. Gaining incredibly damaging dangerous everyone involved, even going giant gamble responsible leader would take. vaccine gives demand safe manner. also many vaccines development moment, sufficiently well working vaccine almost guaranteed available even fail live expectations.

Most world also suppressed virus fairly effectively places zero new cases months. way they'll reach natural herd immunity even multiple decades (centuries case) infection rates. way vaccine, start initial roll year(at least Russian one), better tested ones starting come next year, new ones coming steady pace them. Sorry, understand means. 

From tell orange thing still crazy high rate whatever reason: side marginal understanding ""democracy"" U.S. supposed work. going join country not? I'm voting Kanye  players retested travelling match, watching MLB know story going. mean guys voted well known grifter presidency. 
so course he's going feed shit course he's going tell caviar. 
par course. live near Cleveland opposed Columbus, metro areas much compliant rural ones. work metro area live rural difference would hilarious pandemic wasn't, know, problem. Remember several governments said masks work obviously did? definitely trust vaccine made 8 months know long term effects including weather still prevent catching COVID 6 months. Oh. yet?

I've gotten every vaccine I'm supposed too, I'm guy. goal wait 18 months release. 100% trust vaccines. 100% trust officials ulterior motives. They're sending children school without masks ffs. care I. They're supposed clearly don't. someone worked custodial staff two years, assure outstanding pay absolutely happening circumstance. Yeah true media might stop reporting it, people think never issue that’s news (like caravan) hates algebra? trying kill it?! mean 25% metro infected *by June*. course rate infection go Glad seems little bit, hope continues. misleading title... Dutch-American-Friendship-Treaty make easy move here. Set aside around €10k immigration. think majority people care rather take chances contracting COVID Chance symptoms would loosing job, home means provide myself. That’s problem Americans face people unfazed ones don’t worry loosing entire livelihood. It’s broken system COVID proven that. Let mouse die. long taking get testing results there? Source? Everything I've read said opposite Agreed Hmmm, also heard 8 percent 10 percent. right? workers die, there's need pay pensions! -taps forehead-  time barely covering mouth nose sticking out.

SERIOUSLY. hospital waiting room day saw people masks covering noses.

WTF even doing?!? Probably reporting lack testing people able afford test.

How many people India still shit open? don’t good infrastructure there. would definitely prefer online courses, luckily classes except one online. Luckily Iowa State University taking lot precautions despite forced open campus Iowa Government. classes online, mask requirement campus actually enforced students wear reported dean. multiple reports student wearing mask, they're removed person classes briefings summer except Tuesday Thursdays overview recent news released data last week:

* Friday weird (-3) daily ""increment"" total deaths. due region Dalarna correcting 3 reported deaths previous day deaths reported time. ~~No zombies yet.~~
* Today Statistics Sweden released new update preliminary causes death statistics. find link data [in Reddit 34 patients ICU COVID-19 right now. less end last week seems break 40s plateau happened last week. However, last week also new admissions compared week before. 
* week 31 positivity ratio remained 3 % (more information [this Reddit ). numbers last week expected next days. Disturbing trend break increased infections 20-29 age group. 

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

We've put screens handsanitizers stores stores, people mostly keeping distance people get sic worry losing job still receive 75% pay. People work home so. 

Most hit person elderly homes somali population. *For unknown cause...* you’re wrong Equally, Asians looking Europe thinking ""Don't care?""

European countries seem happy hundreds thousands new infections every day, thousands dying every quarter (sometimes every month!)

Rushing back enjoy nice unnecessary things like dining restaurants, group events friends, big resistance masks (and even wearing whip soon leaving supermarket), rushing kids back school. quaranting centers forcing people stay home illness can't breathe (instead getting hospital giving drugs immediately).

Asians asking Europeans, ""don't care?"".

America next level Europe. relative. I'm bored went verified stupidity statement.

1 2000 people died COVID year. That's 0.05% chance dying span six months. (0.1% spread 12 months)

5000 pedestrians die car every year. 330 000 000 people america. That's 5000*100/33000000. 

0.0015%. That's probability getting hit car dying next 12 months.

They definitely paying protection meaningful degree. care lives. care profits, kids school means parents can't work. Noooorwaaaaaay matters think people fear mongering doesn’t mean that’s reality. people brain take news w grain salt. Stop speaking others painting everything negative brush. People dying anytime open mouth say, “BUT anything,” highly disrespectful people lost lives. Healthy healthy. Fucking listen yourself. probably getting serious death threats. probably everyone medical position authority right now. fucking died young man, quit bullshit, maybe matter probability think always 99% fine.

Then he's EXTREME anomaly. 20 health issues, that's 99%. That's like 99.99%. 

Yes happen. I'm going fret it, least things can't control. here, country outright retarded dealing it... I'm going okay get know it. 

I'm done fear mongering. I'm going take precautions best move life, pay bills, see thing turns out. choice. can't fret things can't control, choose to. 

A think US already surpassed Sweden terms deaths per US excess death 190k(from march 15 july 18).
Adjusted covid deaths per capita would 579 deaths/mil. US reports 75% excess deaths covid covid deaths per capita currently 564 deaths/mil. Sweden records 101% excess deaths covid source: [Tracking Real Coronavirus Death Toll United news today source: [35% excess deaths pandemic caused article: *According Prof. Woolf: “There several potential reasons under-count. may reflect under-reporting; takes data come in. cases might involve patients COVID-19 died related complications, heart disease, complications may listed cause death rather COVID-19.”* Stockholm, Sweden.

Sweden enacted enforced “maximum 50 people gathering” rule. “seating only” cafes/restaurants, rules around distancing. Sweden made massive campaign hand washing sanitisation. Sweden encouraged people stay home could, provided financial support people businesses so, meaning loads loads loads people did. Sweden also encouraged social distancing every aspect society. Stockholm, Sweden, cafes businesses reported 80-90% drop patronage, economy suffered immensely. Schools closed Sweden. Access nursing homes etc reduced.

Maybe Stockholm/Sweden didn’t “lockdown”, certainly almost thing; trusted citizens take right actions, largely did.

I don’t understand people trying paint Sweden “business normal”, simply isn’t true.  Spending students transparency immediately fireable offense. kind example set? ""Get line shut even we're putting life risk. make us look bad."" Facebook says
 
Covid 99.98% chance survival.
  
That's correct. that's 1 2,000 people die Covid.
  
that's 1 person full Nascar stadium.
 
that's 3 people Trump's Tulsa Rally insurance allowed deny coverage following directive... people'd seriously fucked Everyone works parks hates guy passion I'd say perfectly reasonable response shit that's written them. normal ask question far that. They've judged found guilty many. sounds like need someone care ever. Show humanity. Okay, thanks. also noticed numbers increasing again, testing back online, shutting bit, due hurricane. I'm sure virus spreads quite easily classrooms. think point meant make evidence children average less likely transmit virus others.  

You therefore might send younger children school childcare help people work.  

However, outbreak area Australia instead led sending back students finishing high school. Unfortunately, someone said school children, politicians made distinction 5 year old 18 year old. Oh yes xD issue many people care. us frightened live California, adult took place followed news pretty closely, cuz looked like might skate. bodies surfaced, evidence tells one story. mean c'mon, unspecified bad guys kidnapped took 70 miles spot Scott fishing? nm, he's blond driving around cash... *if it’s time, it’s time don’t give shit many people car me* world would fine, America blip time. must've terrifying, I'm glad wife made covid, hope doctors able find medicine soon! Stay strong. NOPE, think bud! I'm sharing story sympathize someone else said. I've asked help social media platforms told crazy need professional help without receiving actual help.

HMMMMMM 0.2% ifr going likely end being.  death rate calculated true number infections rather confirmed cases. Wait second. Europe supposed shining example everything done right!! 

This get downvoted removed, goes USA Bad Europe Good narrative. “Kamala Harris” name literally coincidence connection? Congressmen serve two year terms. Presidents four.

So halfway presidents term, congressional elections held.

These known mid-term elections.  generally reflection country's sentiment towards job president doing. 

In 2018 House Representatives flipped *away* President. created strict limits could since congress holding back.

There's limits even power, though, we'll see November turns out. european protected country's healthcare say i'm horrified idea refuse get good treatment expansive. 
It really looks futuristic world corporations greed won. 


That said, problem stacked time government cut funds healthcare vital public services. starting see cracks behind it. 


Our shity lobby-directed governements dreams making health services transport services private. Keep mom negative. That’s stupid. Compared likes Spain U.S (probably many authoritarian countries like Irand, China Vietnam never know weird seeing many redditors eating shady goverments numbers withouth questioning 5,334 registered covid deaths 23/06 5,322 excess US 114,038 registered covid deaths 130,546 excess deaths reference, 26/06 Spain 28,180 registered covid deaths 43,900 excess deaths meaning might missed registering 40% covid Moscow registered covid deaths: 3,796, excess deaths registered covid deaths: 9,647, excess deaths City registered covid deaths: 6,341, excess deaths saying purpose btw, stating fact things since people understand count per capita own, excess deaths: population: deaths per capita reality Moscow: 916 excess deaths: population: deaths per capita reality Spain: 956 excess deaths: population: deaths per capita reality 1161 deaths/mil Harshly put TRUE. Ruin lives economy millions save thousands people life expectancy co-morbidities.....makes sense. count nonsense Florida does.

The number comparable everyone else reports - % new individuals testing positive - high teens. There’s nationwide shortage reagents needed testing. It’s going 3 weeks. That’s part total testing numbers down. Also, Texas counting positive antibody tests totals. It’s drop bucket considering disgusting unhealthy bodies US are. Covid merely straw broke camels back large majority deaths. Even nowhere near cancer deaths, heart disease. post redditors circle jerk. Majority poor losers guess it’s something that’s free many kids’ mental health suffered significantly pandemic, they’d rather roll dice physical health risk continue known mental health risks? Keep mom negative. That’s stupid. Stockholm, Sweden.

Sweden enacted enforced “maximum 50 people gathering” rule. “seating only” cafes/restaurants, rules around distancing. Sweden made massive campaign hand washing sanitisation. Sweden encouraged people stay home could, provided financial support people businesses so, meaning loads loads loads people did. Sweden also encouraged social distancing every aspect society. Stockholm, Sweden, cafes businesses reported 80-90% drop patronage, economy suffered immensely.

Maybe Stockholm/Sweden didn’t “lockdown”, certainly almost thing; trusted citizens take right actions, largely did.

I don’t understand people trying paint Sweden “business normal”, simply isn’t true. revealed politicians rape kids fun. one craziest one one seems wanna talk lol Stockholm, Sweden.

Oh gosh here!! keep getting disheartened frustrated taking seriously! teens threatening her, pissed adults? maybe even troll farms? knew lot long-term effects emerging, figure fucking horrifying :| need pay police riot gear /s downplay seriousness covid (obviously many US have) see people saying probably lot 5 million cases, that's case mean less lethal thought was? Kids hit transmitting Covid pulled school kept home. appreciate that. Thankfully live splits time Mom, encouraging like worried mask wearing disinfecting would kill immune system, Dad, several big risk factors (just finished cancer treatment, former lifelong smoker, heart issues, 65, etc...). That's worried most, giving Dad.

even though every country pretty much numbers now, seeing first time small geographic location really put fear god probably new yorkers. guess, i'd say they're probably good job following rules real people states boiled frog experience first wave. Feel like US point push testing Trump something say number 1 about. Regardless useful is. workload literally breaking makes test results useless. wearing camo would usually put risk.

Refusing black windows air raid better comparison putting *and others* risk. still go far enough even get others killed air raid acting irresponsibly deaths stop there. Covid-19 disease thus deaths keeps spreading. /s (Dropped something.)

For anyone unaware, Texas expanded Medicaid. charities help cover costs without insurance. However, close 20% Texans uninsured prior pandemic. It’s probably quite bit higher now. Imagine blaming problems people. Jesus Christ. It’s always someone else’s fault. cant test faster pace spread due complete avoidance following basic rules. Americans brought society completely utterly *obsessed* ""their rights"" even actual benefit rights, simply symbol rights.

Living foreign country something everyone point, opinion. really opens eyes different ways things done makes differences less theoretical. even wear pants go outside? flop dong go morning walk. laws control you.

Silly me. automatically assume everything's covid, evidence damned. aware uncommon elite athletes seem otherwise healthy die undiagnosed heart problems? See Hang Gathers, Reggie Lewis, Jason Collier, Conrad McRae, Robert Traylor, Zeke Upshaw etc basketball related examples. yeah I've ever said virus can't dangerous. view overwhelming majority people, dangerous ""look 27 year old died thing killing everybody"" approach way harm good. think something lot Europeans can't understand leads headlines like HUGE US is. means there's lot diversity US, there's least 4\~5 separate regions make US whole (and potentially more). years, lifestyle diversity celebrated good thing. actually need unity... well, diversity turned good thing bad thing.

Or put another way Europeans: imagine Poland way probably Spain Portugal well SINGLE country, subjected single leader. Hell, let's go step hypothetical situation say Boris Johnson leader ENTIRE area. Brexit nonwithstanding, that's sort situation US like. Add plenty political fuckery past several decades strong leadership (and probably lack social media) keeping everything together.

I've moved abroad suspect United States passport going become relic non-existent country sometime lifetime- home country knew probably knew (at least, terms geopolitical borders) probably exist couple decades, that's actually one depressing thoughts have.  Captain obvious Chinese virus says otherwise. Way topic generally group, far, far left. things vote president.

...You said quiet part loud. fortunately Asia also includes South Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Singapore etc! wish amount testing same, would know sure decline real. region see control East Asia. world needs take note, Eropeans included. Awww. Europeans kind... Except badly hit countries managed get somewhat control eventually cases deaths way down. US though things never really improved significantly. Cases falling around 20,000 day shot right back like 60,000+. Admittedly Europe starting see possible second wave point still stands. US never even got first wave. never managed bring covid control kind kept going Glitch/ underreporting/ fudging numbers bad actors. Things getting worse day continue get worse. have. I’m starting see parallels. Especially Alaska. areas STILL don’t running water.  Alright. AIDS killed nearly 1 million last year. Covid killed 735 000 LAST SIX MONTHS. 


Are actually trolling what? really makes sense, like thinks people NZ still lockdown? I'm seeing people rural Missouri wear masks entire pandemic right now. reasonable way fix it

Wear mask 

And since can’t seem unified way, clearly haven’t “done everything Europe did.”

We deserved shamed, president deserves impeached removed office, happened here. It’s framing male problem, it’s saying men aren’t *Some Americans

Fuck. I'm tired grouped Fucktards happen live here. don’t know anyone works 9-5 US. 8-5 core work hours 1 hour unpaid lunch. Also, minimum vacation, 10 days year pretty common decent full time job. Sick time sometimes part 10 days too. Let's also consider BMI scale created mathmetician early 20th century, take account different body types, updated years. straight BMI scale anyone signifigant muscle obese. see people getting taped every drill Guard reason, guys little fat them. That's saying lot people heavier think, country issue obesity calling out, let's use BMI scale end-all-be-all. may viewing past rose-colored glasses, distinctly (or seem distinctly) remember things mind-numbingly polarized. could talk people disagree many issues, end day feel like two people disagreeing politics, rather mortal enemies (I exaggerate bit).

Let rona them. seems crazy we've shut world tiny death percentage. I'm part group continued living happy. die is. Hearing want hear Reading makes feel nervous.... believe stereotype cold calculating, accurate person. emotions involved.

If visit Germany, learn indeed stereotype. People friendly cold all. Wow, that's scary! I've heard happening; people taking precautions still getting it. point, that's basically we're doing, visits in-laws backyard patio, keep 6 ft distance us times plus we're outside. laws page us easier trust it'll like getting together. trust hardly anyone else know stick rules anymore. Hope guys feeling better now. I'd super interested seeing Asian societies see US COVID issues we've (I live here, I'm biased). Everyone already hated us, years always clung onto belief hate *US* (American people), hate *Government* instead.

These days struggle believe even that. I've gotten chance travel around bit I'm older. I'm beginning understand everyone else truly hates us, even people. first understand why, clear.

America """"""free"""""" country ran corrupt people populated cold, uncaring, naive idiots blame everything. Democrats hate Republicans, Republicans hate Democrats - equally flawed share bad qualities either would dare believe. Worse all, pose leaders world. pour money military give power boast. clearly can't lead shit ""small"" issue (in grand scheme things) like COVID repeatedly knock us asses rest world seemingly control.

There's entire world learn live - people caught lives they've stopped giving shit everyone else. wonder everyone hates us, I'm sure handling COVID crisis done nothing strengthen hatred.

Serves us right. make sense gather much American say really didn’t need COVID 19 come conclusion. absolutely OP trying say ""freaking out"" covid virus transmitted completely different way treatment deaths...so far. Basically worry prevention contact tracing anything covid related AIDS. 

Imagine dense still allowed drive car. think walk chew gum time. say ""go vote"" want need understand easy everyone access voting. Oh shit! go Ireland?? people feel sorry last ones bubble bursts. Deaths hospitalizations lag. let collapse Europeans mad US quick path vaccine already scaling deliver en masse right approved leftie trolls really obsessed word fragile. 

Keep blowing whistle. must dozens you. proved Bernie right...just dropped race :( wtf, seriously? idea. sub ridiculous. Took photo swedish beach 2 days ago. look like local beach? 
[Sweden Corona crisis](http://imgur.com/gallery/kUDX2Ps) No. literally set fucking record last week hospitalizations state. Saying ""it's going down."" last 7 set record got stupidest thing ever.

The thing claiming, ""The trend going down."" looking number cases reported ignoring testing dropped massively. 

When look pretty chart daily cases going 7 day trend, look low numbers started. Oh wait, right whenever Rick Desantis closed state testing due tropical storm approaching. weird right?

Now overlay graph one. nice little dip new cases directly related going processing 60k+ tests sometimes 30k tests? weird strange coincidence testing means report coronavirus cases spreading like wildfire.

Whenever reports 7+ day backlog tests process 30k tests. Yeah, that's massive problem.

Florida **not** getting better.  nitpicky, think love word ""plutocracy"" use antibody testing study? I've heard antibody testing unreliable. Yes, yes. USA bad. USA bad, Yes. massive campaigns educate people HIV spread curtail risky behaviors.

For virus, category “risky” unfortunately covers much broader set activities it’s hilarious also scary good people impersonating fact needed kidnap people half world away enslave revealed weak were. Americans NEVER strong, they've guns. Americans biggest pussies planet.  German always wondered 9-5 8-4 US. anecdotal, everyone know works 8-4 here. Origami saves lives! feel brother. deciding health job. Americans Europeans: k. also sensitive thoughtful are, less likely seek confrontations. really learn us sensitive thoughtful types give fuck stop playing nice dumb malicious types Unless favour isolationism, rest world thinks kind become problem certain point. Political leaders already showing short patience United Shenanigans looking alliances without them. wish jist it. fact people going *come home.*

And living Fargo/Moorhead metro I'm sure many residents corner world week. ""bump"" store farmers' market next week. Got Covid? Walk off!  vaccine never comes, highly unlikely, hail countries like US Sweden for... hundreds thousands deaths fucked economy? Ok then.  that, people encouraged us go college say we're brainwashed education fault we're much debt. 

This normal. lot clickbait devoted mostly one expert claims (without studies cited back specific opinion) tying bunch links also specifically say that. 

They point poll says men less likely wear masks separate study says men likely experience anxiety gender status expert chime in. there's actual study says ""Hey, one thing causes other"" except expert's personal belief, support given. Smash Mouth opens Covid-19 sounds 90's. need American that, Europeans hate much Americans care Germany. that's every rule seems mostly show. US like old senile baby boomer throws fit can't get way, decides invade nations response, sling around nuclear threats intimidation. honestly never seen French overly social can't comment

Always remember French=/= Parisian, much Parisians would like think otherwise. It'd like thinking Americans New Yorkers. different attitudes to... lot things love it, cancel sport people university pays (tuition room/board) classes students pay for. reddit post? even  hope compassion majority country didn’t want aren’t supporting it.

Thing is, think kind democracy, ""our"" POV majority country supporting shitshow. 7500-7800 per day. March 1st today total 1.230.000 also higher death rates non-related illnesses/injuries hospitals reach max capacity, I'm sure clear. 

That said, drastic change deaths still attributed covid related impacts, still relevant That's I'm saying. Italy shut hotspots Lombardy fast hard. started small, unfortunately, response much thoughtful ridiculous US show. 

I’m less familiar Spain. mean refused tell anyone virus knowingly spreading 3 months paid downplay severity.   *America reaches 300,000 dead shortly predicted model*


“Hah! Stupid egg-heads! Can’t get anything right 😎 “ demographic talking about? Tell speak Swedish too, old frail people die every year. Many year COVID19 serious need take action. 

But, almost 1 % people die every year. Mostly old frail people. ""absolutely terrifying""?  haha read way too. use glasses :s  Anyone else noticing sudden increase articles subreddit saying schools safe?  Without expensive unpopular autopsies extensive testing true causes deaths become speculative.  They're letting Americans in, thanks badly bungled things -_- One best analogies I’ve read put perspective. NJ we're least well NY.

My kids' school system taken following commonsense precautions.

* kids wear face masks.
* Social distancing enforced hallways
* Student body split two cohorts group attending Tuesday/Thursday, group B attending Wednesday/Friday, everyone at-home learning Mondays.
* Students stay classrooms classes day. teachers move room room, rather students.  cdc.... go read excess deaths reports. idiot supporters. specific respirator? Anyone else noticing sudden increase articles subreddit saying schools safe? Why? Yes! It’s important think way reddit freaking covid remember infantescimally *small* odds affecting are. “1 2000” that’s taking account youth health. you’re young healthy, better odds struck lightning killed covid know exactly USA, Europe seeing surge positive cases hospitalizations/severe cases much much lower march/april.

Of course nobody knows virus getting deadly, herd immunity matter time. numbers there, sorry feeling optimistic country less people dying. area means 4 stuffed trailers full bodies getting smell burning. COVID-19 caught causes death yet. Currently, causes death account death rate 1.5 2000. also don’t n ow accurate COVID-19 data is, could take year two work over. Yep, press release website, excel file link gets updated weekly. give fuck numbers. sides agendas. 

We'll never know true totality pandemic. Like masks holding candy parties people supposed are. 

Eat candy MASK UP!! like years though. excess deaths risen means amount people died increased year, like years Anyone else noticing sudden increase articles subreddit saying schools safe? Holy shit would selfish would never happened. Selfish implies care themselves, obviously not. I've worked full respirator gear like 10 hours 120° heat. fine. Anybody whining otherwise hasnt actually tried. Anyone else noticing sudden increase articles subreddit saying schools safe? Another quote: “But don’t know one person six-state radius Covid. think political.” reddit browser add-on says posted 918 times certain umm orange-colored subreddit (my last comment removed mods mentioning it). probably sarcastic. That’s optimistic. COVID19 really harshly revealed fucking selfish undereducated country is. People genuinely cannot conceptualize actions affect people, moreover don’t give fuck magical thinking world needs. No, do. covid preventable death. life worth preserving chance?

You ignore pandemic disease find something deadly gf visiting family northern italy, said never saw countrymen disciplined, constant temperature checks nice giftbag 2 good masks hand sanitizer every train passenger next 2 weeks  Anyone retirement age moving Greece pay taxes. mean, that's actually thing noticed reddit.

On r/de, whenever someone's like ""my aunt covid"" top posts go like ""what like, what's process, treated, see her, she"" etc. Curiosity.

On usual US-dominated reddit space, top posts ""yeah uncle too"" ""my boss it"" ""my grandma died it"".

Most people Germany know anyone it, much less someone died it. America lucky. *Blinks*.

Still male, buff, multiethnic, overtly gay gyrating. could take advice seriously not? never thought that. damn geniuss😂 vaccine that? Im sure took one school everyone else Super low numbers pandemic. We’re fortunate. Imagine fuck badly something serious. ""Fine"" permanent lung damage lel. always selfish people lucky enough affected posting shit *exactly* Trump talking interview Chris Wallace. Trump voting per capita numbers, saying “look we’re bad”, pulled data prove it, Wallace/Fox put data, current daily deaths, US looks worse, purposely misleading. crap Trump means fake news. Intentionally twisting facts story, data mislead people false negative view Trump. Obviously, there’s times deserves it, there’s also LOT times doesn’t intentionally misled media. 

All said (cough) *politics aside*, it’s really hard compare US many countries, lot unique challenges faced countries. 

First off, HUGE country. going much challenging control spread virus country size US place size of, say, Spain, size largeish US state. UK, freaking island, it’s easier prevent spread islands, anyone who’s played pandemic game app knows. 

Second, population large, also *very* diverse. factors differ countries near size. Canada roughly situation terms landmass spread horizontally across whole continent, population resides specific areas. US even distributed across country (though obviously still pockets low population). comparison, large countries, like Russia China, land masses comparable larger own, populations a) much homogenous (just like Biden’s opinion African-American population haha, oh oops, politics aside, right, sorry, couldn’t reeeesist), b) controlled *actual* authoritarian government things like weld citizens inside houses. 

Of course, also problems health care education systems put us disadvantage. problems ‘Murica-style personal liberty personality issues make people **always** buck government tells do, general mistrust dislike government. There’s many conservatives (unbeknownst them) biggest anarchists around. mental health problems abound, though much everywhere. 

All put together, there’s country compare us accurately. Australia? Nope. Island, population concentrated small specific areas, though perhaps like us ideologically ways. European countries? Nope, small homogenous, UK small island ffs. Russia? Nope. China? Nope. Authoritarian homogenous people (generally) ingrained listen government. 

The closest comparison come would EU combined, even that’s good statistic, it’s still limping together small, homogenous country, mostly charge themselves, one data pool. anything, EU statistic might closer idealized US conservative dreamland, states **on own** small federal government hands state business (which honestly Trump handled whole thing, think wrong on, y’all woulda reeeee’d even hardcore he’d authoritarian. Instead orange “dictator” handed power states, real dictator move lol). 

TLDR: US unique it’s hard compare us countries vast variety reasons.  Damn :( RIP events like time...I miss tangible energy large group. What's interesting CDC website excess deaths shows spikes deaths caused ""Alzheimer's"" ""dementia"" wherever spikes COVID-19 cases.

We know COVID-19 cause mental disorders dementia-like symptoms. makes wonder many deaths falsely attributed dementia actually COVID-19.  Lol football happening Man, windows keeps closing never gets there. Xenon Paradox win. I'm sorry! know sarcastic. Better get info horses mouth: important remember 5 5000 compounds make pre-clinical trials. one 5 make Phase make Phase IV.

Pre-Clinical trials usually take six seven years. Phases III usually take another six seven. Trying get vaccine market less year skipping 12-14 years research would otherwise happened. understandable people apprehensive. That’s way explained me, surgical notes post history want read those. lot information traumatic time, since wasn’t able consent himself, consent treatments legal wife &amp; medical proxy. I’m sure you’re right, that’s way said me. right concept open saw pittoresken hear children waer masks classes. makes sence. make smaller classes, 3 hours day everything classroom wonder post shooting statistics food health wellness forum?

There's actual law prevents CDC spend shooting crazy smart trusting survival instincts. Dont concerned people thinking overreacting, life altering/ending virus world dealing with. 
We took seriously NZ completely stopped community transmission.
Isolation works easy...but government dont support people really. two reasons.

1st. America drasticly underestimating. Go look cdc reports excess deaths. america passed ""100k"" acturly much closer 150k.

2nd. commiting fallacy comparing current totals deaths. Europe hit much earlier. means longer duration less information make policies with. would cause naturally larger number. end day, really difference? person without insurance would still pay emotion news reporters got most.

Are non biased news sources USA? cause permanent lung damage age. u dum like Death Valley amirite Africa seems quite well, exception SA, median age countries insanely low. Edit title: America's window opportunity beat back stupidity general tom fuckery long since passed. CDC article nothing **actual test results** South Carolina. trying accomplish here? Remember Italian newspaper 3 pages obituaries worst? Mate! *you* lied to! Please consider this! Ive working 45 hours week sometimes since whole thing started. retail. Sales 30% last year. People work shopping like crazy making “essential” workers much higher risk. missed one day work since rona showed up. that’s fish biting like crazy. American pandemic American pandemic?  Here's thing. number confirmed infections less 2 percent population. Meaning lot spreading virus occur.

People think defeated virus, ineffective policies actually worked. Sorry 1.5 / 10 isn’t 1.5%

If 1.5% entire U. S. population gets Covid, would 1.5 cases per 100 people. Switzerland, corona visible summer typical crowds. can't compare two different countries report sample size infections around 1000 call conclusive.

So make next move reconcile reality, you. Again, healthcare system focused treatments, prevention. Actually, American population focused way, still asking idiots wear masks. Cuz know, mask part preventing spread covid. Also life already cheap there. lot deaths go unreported even without COVID. lot deaths weed people otherwise would dying COVID. require references now?

Check many they’ve tested report back. country works. Besides World War II American Civil War, combine deaths combat every war American history still Covid-19 death toll America. tragedy nothing. learn, unable care. lot different media reporting tracking correspondence excess deaths reported covid-19 deaths different countries. [This example \- due differences way COVID-19 deaths counted different countries end quite different coverage real death toll pandemic. Excess mortality includes deaths causes excess previous defined baseline (Statistics Sweden uses 2015-2019, article Economist uses 2015-2019 looks excess first 50 COVID-19 deaths reported). see first table across countries comparing excess deaths reported COVID-19 deaths, reported less excess deaths COVID-19 deaths : Sweden, Belgium, France among harder hit countries, Switzerland, Norway Denmark among lightly affected. one else capable standing 21st century China currently

The propaganda China making harm good country leadership like think.

The divided struggle, together prosper. stop using Belgium compare with? registering suspected cases also excess mortality COVID-19 deaths. Dutch doctor living close Belgium tell using stats bit misleading situation Western Europe. can't compare two different countries report sample size infections around 1000 call conclusive. Take look chart report page 10. huge upward curve cases Sweden leading 24 week mark. importantly, four weeks data following reopening week (week 20) Finland. kill Americans fast covid, would need 325lb 308 Winchester ammunition day. assuming one shot kills. Guess fire guy. Well thank link. already KNOW statistics accurate around world, least measured different ways. 

And yet forum using statistics making judgments success failures. Statistics comparable.  saw article week ago say asymptomatic people also experiencing heart damage.

Obviously data going trickier since probably get tested. know least 4 people asymptomatic tested positive. around family household sick got tested sure. mention terrifying reality he'll face less one half one half one percent chance die. That's enough risk make bat shut insane person say, ""Don't worry, I'm young flu bro"".  someone tell sentence means?

It’s pretty early Second truly ridiculously incompetent “study” touted John Birch Society-like group masquerading medical professional society, Association American Physicians Surgeons (AAPS) claimed find countries adopted use hydroxychloroquine treat COVID-19. never national shut US. Never. Maybe you’re different country? I’m sure would know finances affected this, pretty grand assumption actually been. don’t tend broadcast financials public though it’s one’s business own. would back business done proper shut down. Simple that. I’m gonna get Monday argue facts people clearly basis reality. great time that. believe this.

However post focused people ""super cautious"" covid19 deniers.

I understand men thinking mask makes look weak afraid. group likely resists going doctors ""I feel fine"" attitude. friend, turned 60, doctor resister, died home last week heart attack. Wife came home found dead cold. others get vaccine demonstrated safe effective I'll get (probably yearly flu shot since might long duration) never national shut US. Never. Maybe you’re different country? I’m sure would know finances affected this, pretty grand assumption actually been. don’t tend broadcast financials public though it’s one’s business own. would back business done proper shut down. Simple that. I’m gonna get Monday argue facts people clearly basis reality. great time that. close World War 2 death toll United States. 144,000 quite smaller ~430,000 (World War 2 deaths). Reddit needs recalibrate reality IMO. really negative outcomes simply death. Get fucked, nasty thing say. Lol multiplier use get reported cases actual cases. 10x? 8x? live Alabama, looking individual counties already 25 30 percent multiply 10. Percent positive usually 15 20. straight untrue.

I meant spreading. Initially Italian Austrian variants eventually suppressed. reports also says nothing alleged differences Sweden Nordic countries, discussing here.

I able find similar reports Norway Denmark, thought might interesting come across them. data also reported common international database don’t know publicly available. symptoms

In Sweden. meant Sweden. second half March papers literally full headlines regarding outbreak Sweden. Unfortunately authorities stopped tracing there‘s data people got from.

Yeah, it’s much argument lot kind reporting beginning. Ischgl Austria. Sweden. after-ski parties couple hundred participants. Also, 30000 people Stockholm. regions continued contact tracing long Stockholm stopped never stopped. think would know it. read [asked people risk areas stay home. maybe seems worked out. Oh, sour puss gotcha BS didnt work? comparison every cause death combined entire year, disease pretty nasty. lousy article even say vaccine tested. search myself.

This CanSino. lol, funny name indeed. Seems guys handled bad PTSD Difficult process way point 0.005% US citizens died within last 6 months, leaving possible interpretation situation develop near far future.

As death rate fallen small numbers, trend continue. 

At best, post remembrance tragedy early pandemic, worst attempted manipulation creating panic apply current facts statistics. 

In short, huge part people susceptible covid death already dead. Nothing bring back. 

And depressing fact is, remaining population susceptible dying covid *will* die Covid matter within next year, unless succumb earlier pre-existing conditions. 

The disease progressing population whether like not, masks without, long vaccine ready. heart warming Hey man, bus leaving. thought chased /r/collapse creepers logic facts. 

But you’re back getting upvotes.

Shows true decline sub.

Admins, quarantine already. mods unable unwilling get control. team did. Dementia like symptoms called delirium onset rapid, would infection. Dementia properly diagnosed symptoms slow term onset progression. Unfortunately theses two terms easily misunderstood misinterpreted. mean, thats true. is. source weasel words?  bullshit owner Californian Lotteries (a massive scam poor uneducated) said 'the ticket allows dream'. Wow that's grim. worry, laws 0.05% dying. probably bed :) It’s largely US humanity. come back France. Masks ubiquitous. saw one without shops. I'm still waiting Fox lambast Trump tanking 30% economy... know, since give credit every job added, jobs lost. Reddit marketing platform. Marketing platforms also make great propaganda platforms. think nailed it. Ohh okay misunderstood woops Stop coughing world likely going recession depressions, also causes increased death rates especially country like US good healthcare privilege wealthy. That’s 0.05% chance dying then. Remember virus needs mobile carriers spread. fewer carriers, safer localities.   

The opposite US even lockdown asshats move like entitled. honestly can't tell replying correct ""truth"" ....  fact-checking article. implying wrong? dumb wildly incorrect. Literally nobody said disease Wuhan. every single Chinese province, outbreaks cities outside Hubei, reported quickly contained. foreigners confirming basic information. right Cuomo NE governors could done more, also true say pandemic response kind purview federal government.

They lost precious weeks waiting guidance White House.

Guidance yet come, six months later. car accidents preventable? sugar? sugar preventable? certainly kills way people virus. like went really left second back tracked... Lol. pointing numbers. died underlying conditions. Many 65. Many many many survived. talk that..... ""good news"". Look this, Corona top death cause world wide, even strokes.

 answer sure isn’t business usual. needs cardiologist. also needs back heavy exercise. K. wasn’t trying rude it’s propagandists anti-maskers here,

But ok Pretty sure they're planning play closed stadiums? would argue disrupting education daycare, ripple effect entire society, teachers 10% less chance catching COVID worth it. put 10 cent surgical mask valved n95 literally medical grade mask protects everyone many times better anything market, people advised simply wear them. pandemic gets stupider day. There's enough supplies really matter US health system ( wealthy famous).

Not enough ppe masses problem. Yes, absolutely national shut stop spread back March. personally financially affected extended shut makes sense favor new indefinite shut down. Interesting mention patients going ICU dying. almost like covid super low mortality rate outside nursing homes long term care facilities, huh? Lock old people, rest us need work, go school, make stuff, buy stuff, generally get back lives. Stop making numbers real fear mongering long term effects brand new virus. may lingering effects calling permanent premature know that. Vote third party get friends too. Implementing democracy likely best U.S. could right now. Thanks TLDR, led read article. 

At first thought 32 cases seemed strangely small sample size (I epidemiologist don’t know not) intrigued identified pattern immune system response held true blind tests. Seems like good news able differentiate immune responses way.

Also wonder immune response (N) protein instead (S) protein -which study finds effective way combat virus- leads cytokine storm.

Seems likely body would produce (N) protein response, see work, say ok ramp up? see fail body needed attack (S) protein first place. 

TLDR: 
(S) protein = Spike protein
(N) protein = Not-spike protein argument made most, half old would die anyways. Yes, would, next maybe ten years. that's like justifying Hitler killed disabled people contribute society. Imagine old people dying, without comfort, pain, isolated even basic human interaction. families allowed say goodbye, able see one last time, hold hands. fall coma. isolated point lucky, could say goodbye glass window. can't imagine many hospitals capacity let families severely sick patients willing take risks. moment least. Oh gosh cant remember. 4 years ago now. think 3m though. Full face shield tyvek suit go supposed go lol. live northern Midwest, winter miserable Gee state highest number cases, infection rate hovering 1%...

Hmmm... Gates uses actual experts pretty selfless individual. Trump uses ""experts"" might actually selfish person planet ever seen. important difference. No, don't. really really don't. government care less. Sure. would like know about? masks optional

These people acting stupid purpose. kicks. even worse live family members house. take much precautions possibly goes ends amounting nothing parents go church. 

Now reason take precautions infect others, know could infected. live florida, know don’t really give rat’s ass virus here. sure doctors ain't complaining before. buddy works meat market, wearing mask 10-12h day, 6 days week. complaining all. wear.mine 6-8h day, works perfectly.

if complain masks wear wear mask hospital, gives air ventilator deserve it! bet probably least 700 calls airbnb something finally clicked serious police whomever finally give shit something , even

Dear Leader climate change denier obviously seen he's said covid. scary man realize cellphone already there's really need? Oh right forgot smoothbrains capable critical thinking. Mask supporter here, wearing masks time since January. think bit biased deny uncomfort writer wearing mask day. Also, ideal wearing time one medical mask hours. people wearing masks receive threats, vice versa. society kinds messed head. perhaps “what happened people”? Otherwise, average nobody like rest them.

That guy sounds way average me. Kids think Trump “owning” media good memes. don’t get smarter kids sudden they’re raised brain-dead morons. dumb enough listen orange idiot, never hope anyways. Trigger words ""death panel"" help people understand really going work northern states SNOW care.

The issue traitors care. dumb ass family decided right perfect time go visit 70yo parents state.

My dumb ass parents decided right perfect time go state fair.

My dumb ass state decided state fairs good idea right now.

I can't tell number times I've thought ""we middle deadly pandemic, WTF wrong you!"". believe numbers nasal swabs capable doing. least provost Kotlikoff's email made seem like so. meetings bosses seem imply 2-3 tests week (nasal again). Anyhow, least that's understanding. government absolutely refused fund virtual learning pandemic.

And Americans opted sacrificial children instead pushing back meaningful scale.

Someone said another thread things got way apathetic voter didn’t leave house “the candidates isn’t perfect”.

People don’t want perfect. People don’t even want “candidate get excited about”. People want one doesn’t completely suck. intentionally stupid accident? Florida downward side curve. I’m getting COVID test morning. nasal swab, nasopharyngeal swab. normally use Flonase morning. wait test? Probally even sooner that, got dibs Tuesday Wendsday. much love College NFL football, fact tackling close contact sport make impossable socially distance, yelling huddle involved, wresle running back ground. advice scrap next year, vaccine.

Europe 212k Europe population 741 million US deaths 162k correct, US population 328 million. 

As deaths per 100k inhabitants, that's 28.6 Europe versus 49.4 US. That's +72.7% higher per capita US Europe.

The number confusion understandable since google ""covid europe deaths"", shows 732k dead large number, although say ""worldwide"" next that. entire point flattening curve? Seems like Southern states much butter tri state area 😬😬😬 Idgaf people work there. Let immigrants go. elaborate? mean, ignoring messy stuffs, want learn something this. rich guy medical training become mildly interested pandemic

Your ignorance showing. ""What Do"" tab see work diseases throughout world past couple decades. telling guys trying take sides.

Between right wrong decisions oh golly know side take. open schools kids get something saying reassuring, efficacy flu vaccine 20-50%. read correctly Covid mutating rate flu significantly virulent. takes years flu - take 6month covid presented country want wear masks.

Still technically democracy, every eligible citizen chance win, lose whole us vs. mentality one really say anything improve chances. total daily testing slightly reduced compared peak testing June, positive test percentage gone lot compared June. doomsday crowd sub next level. add more. pool testing four people test mixing samples together. infection rate low around 5% (I'm making numbers up, think close) chance get postive low. gotten four people tested price one test. infection rate 20% chances one four people postive high. test every single sample individually. four people tested price five test. Exactly.
""Parent"": legally mandated.
Kid: Guess I'll die! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Winning big word, would say slowed loosing ""bigly"" (yes, look you) make sure I'm understanding here, trying equate Bill Gates auto mechanic and/or 5th grade teacher?

Are aware Bill Gates spent large portion time money trying eradicate diseases? probably knows 99.9% people planet.

And regardless disease knowledge, he's using basic common sense everyone have...

*Should*...  Astonished US hits 2.5 Mil recoveries too? 

I bet mentioned deaths whole too, per capita, would put US quite different Euro nations. Proof less testing done March? really curious arguing know wrong? heard, young kids carry even virus adults, kids 10 older spread easily adult, maybe even so. god polaticks bot annoying. ignore misspellings...

i think would surprised little prosecuute someone disappears. blood mop blanket Scott's sudden weird desire buy boat go fishing dates new woman... that's slam dunk.

Must've weird neighbor. help search all?

I realized today San Quentiin side bay. windows, look see fucked up.

This year year neighbors news, live couple miles Geoorge Flooyd killed. Louisiana 1.8. Soon 1 every 1,000. Interesting. Youre never going convince people worry currently unknown permanent damage/effects. I'm dealing staff vocal working remotely unclear get worry appropriate level. Karachi still reporting lot new cases, centers Islamabad pretty empty compared June, I've heard colleagues Lahore. since June, since start month. Cases still rise, ignoring help, perpetuating problem. principal school likely one issued suspension. superintendent one bragged media. need fired. Decadence. American here, lot us care, ones power. voice can't recorded hidden bugs😉 Exactly. leader think way fool bring country down. mean would neutral nothing. 
this like feeding virus. heat kills it! Oh, wait.... Can’t wait!!! only, Brazil too. Shows distorted everything sides. I’ve read stat repurposed multiple time frames. contradictions exhausting lol Proof this?

People NY saw devastating started taking precautions seriously. know would rather wish virus away, logic hold up. Yup heard that’s coming end week see posts time. He/she never leaving lol. Save username check back year they’ll posting funny looking swirl latte something am, confused relevance. makes since reread. i'd figured oversea know mississippi (nor would really call mississippi mid-south, local paper, guess want haha) never made mistake?

They learned quickly made better products. That's want everyone do. Maybe reality we’re fine big imagination Herd Immunity. Try breathing them. surgical mask(through mask), beach towel, coffee filter, piece toilet paper. point many materials easy breathe through. Try yourself. many people favor low protection bandana neck gaitors. reason, people think numbers faked government trying pull big grand plan ends wearing mask using debit. Idk makes fucking sense. mean yes, pick six European countries deaths make comparison, get result.

The UK absolutely massively fucked up, probably harder US honest. UK also part European Union chosen American rather European way navigate crisis late.

If take total European deaths per capita compare US ones, US ones [72.7% include UK, overrepresent like comparison method does.

Honestly, EU citizen want held accountable associated UK fuckup. Long story short, non-UK Europe relatively well, UK US relatively poorly. even middle pandemic middle residential neighborhoods ?
Why taxpayers (who pay taxes help pay police babysitters supposed keep party people bothering responsible people every right able sleep peace quiet homes neighborhoods pay lot property taxes every year) job police police still get paid ?
What messed world right  im paying taxes. tired screwed system seems reward bad guys make good ones keep paying help bad !!
And reddit saying im much plan though - even guidelines. we're referring document:

http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/programs/reopening-schools/nys-p12-school-reopening-guidance.pdf

""Guidance' generous, honest. much favor proponent work Cuomo done regards virus date. immune mistakes, large difficult task ton uncertainty he's done great job IMO. Reopening schools lot NY would disaster, IMO. example, guidance:

* Schools also continue meet exceed
ventilation requirements may wish consult design professionals increase ventilation
and filtration. *

No specific guidance dispensed regarding ventilation, pass. even make mandatory specialist brought in, might consider using one. type guidance repeated time time document, school district could literally skip every single piece 'should' guidance, engage experts, still present plan could approved.

Here NYC we've two surveys date school reopening preferences parents, almost details - month reopening. Nothing assessment buildings modifications might necessary. Nothing hybrid model supported without extra teachers fraction students classroom rest remote least 50% time. Nothing whether PPE made available children (I provide mine, nothing children can't aren't).

The proposal children eat classrooms masks off. phase 4 gyms still closed - although understand risk/reward tradeoff schools, see room full children eating indoors masks safer sparsely populated gym people working masks on.

I think applies NYS - I'm sure less densely populated, rural areas state might able open right precautions taken. I'm unconvinced downstate - open, spread start impact everyone even ones open unencumbered shutting back long. World overall: yes

USA: They're yelling frog staying pot eating stew. think what’s happening good? need graph Daily new cases Daily new tests overlaid other. 

If going up, positivity rate higher, that’s answer would like apologise misunderstanding. fear taking seriously many people behaving way right now, I'm pretty scared it. Hopefully hard feelings glad hear understand gravity situation unlike many others. Stay safe. downvoted answering question lmao. counrtry 2.72 cases per 2000 Nice drawing extremes like microchips. Can't draw extreme? expect narrow point view. think extremes. Politics wide spectrum. point. Facebook become central node society dangerous. misinformation hate groups cuber bullying doxxing even online harassment false claims. society evolving it, better? think imo.  saying states without masks cant nice things, still use 50% states - positivity rate 5-10% lying. think lying double counting multiple negative tests person(florida) saying McCarthyism point started US crazy country? Wow, Chinese using nations' citizens guinea pigs experiment on? Genius knew America would screwed back March. People living la-la land. worst yet come. countless news articles research papers done threat obesity American health care system. Obesity increases risk death basically diseases shortens expected life span good amount. nothing new. It’s covid deniers decide focus problem American obesity? literally millions obese overweight people. Travel safely 💁‍♀️ I'm pretty sure closing borders states would constitutional violation. nothing political even religious post oversensitive circuits I've received threats members subreddit. teach means live country full conservatives.  sub chinese shills point. actually buy masks? Us peasants can't get Europeans don’t even think America. Trust I’d love to. country seems wonderful don’t think We’re allowed right CDC website states flu typically causes death 12,000 - 61,000 deaths annually. USA 162,000 deaths COVID last 6 months. 

Stop trying compare typical fly season, isn't. even was, comfortable writing 162,000 needless deaths? doubt eager family members start dying virus. husband feel like we're crazy we're taking seriously rest family isn't. kids car rides since early March. irritating family declined invite go eat attend party.

It interesting see plays long term. thing somehow became deadlier would still tiny fraction percentage Americans die covid. 

I would guess people locking feel vindicated. Whether right say, guess. Yes. Sad true. True, think rapid testing tracing beginning? terrifies me. got going US yet (UK) 'experts' saying kids low risk even sure spread Covid...ARE BLIND?

Having high risk son expected return school September really puts difficult position. Hopefully R number stays relatively low Wales I'm holding hope 😔 Surgical masks != beach towels, mask misinformation spreader don't, want die anyway. welcome COVID You’ve made perfectly clear already logic doesn’t matter disagree. cuttboff 12 hours. test, done online? neighbors one. tried talk insist everything fine. know will
Be contact weeks get back... Yes, toxic direct facebook Here's one Arizona: site estimates states release data: Ya that’s shame. thinking 10 percent survivors going disabled Huh? That’s crazy, Victoria Australia pretty hard lockdown .82 positive test rate. cant imagine what’s coming future guys. It’s really terrifying. We're gonna die Taiwan never locked lmao. heard muttering, ""Fuck it, I'm out."" think missed earlier follow comment: svt havn't updated graphs. see overall trend infected since friday? 20-29 group still big overall impact? Locals go less hot crowded. enjoy rotating festivals Epcot. Different food drink event. also nice escape daily life. King Frump said USA best though? Holy crap misinformation much? testing more, case save. money. hundrets hospital maybe another lockdown would costs much There's virus ba sing se corps benefit small competitors going bust, resources stay afloat 

Like bailouts taxpayer backed slush funds Yes, definitely think corners world conspiring bring USPS. 

I guess need (/s) all. interesting thing video smoothly effectively host challenges every crazy talking point biker parrots him. questions would sew seeds doubt critically thinking person guy might far gone. know Disney screaming DeSantis since March implement good measures reduce spread. DeSantis' lack leadership Florida giant hotspot right one right mind wants within 100 miles state's borders hurt tourism industry years. Better one people Nuremberg get it; trying convey individual level, risk dying COVID next year (after accounting probability infection) American par risk 25 year old male dying general. super high. trying say ""there's need terrified; probably safe.""

And entire goddamned problem.

Even *you* may safe, going continuing normal life making *group* less safe. taking see 50/100,000 gamble, making likely someone else going die. 

America become individualistic fault, showing here. must suck soo bad kid right Hmmmm, still getting Together commercials area, could missed changes happened. business, way forced people back work, threatening cut benifits disgusting, along state governments gone along it. Kamala name India, Ms Harris background. know cases rising know far far safe. country entire world safe effective vaccine.
My point responding someone saying 'UK acting like big deal.' find statement completely untrue. also mentioned keep reading hoax minority opinion UK doesnt even make news. anti-vax population UK miniscule compared US. tried entering workforce right 2008. worked fast food, worked construction, finally made way trade, got raises, finally making kind money one day leverage everything privilege owning permanent residence. shit happens. 
 
and i'm sure i'm one luckier ones. Look, guys, know difficult silver lining, far fewer Karens, racist bigots, religious nutters dumb shits world end this. natures way removing world. nationwide shortage reagents needed testing.

This another symptom complete failure leadership levels. go vote! ever walked non-tourist streets Mexico, understand why. Unironically yes. young adult male two experiences miss pre covid two reasons I’m trying live normally possible However, counter furlough unusually extensive

This true. Disney furloughed many non-Parks workers working home initial quarantine April. positions fields like HR, Marketing, Finance, technology required lab top internet connection perform. Brazil Russia's conditions nearly precarious India's, anywhere near fact.

I've countries, Brazil favelas, population live, vast majority indians live slums.

Plus population Brazil Russia combined around 350mi India population 1.3bi, OBVIOUSLY adjustment made much larger less qhat did. really think it. like let's see happen definitly wrong That's happens test shy 60 million: remember, part, tests people either already exhibiting symptoms (fever, etc), proximity people *believed* higher risk.

Of five million, many completely asymptomatic, many mild symptoms? may complete nothing burger, much worse typical flu season. get people go like ""oh he's fat? Well care him.""

Like wtf. still human rights. NZ invested huge amount GDP pay everyone UBI stay home spread start decline. Businesses given money shut safely without devastating consequences. Everyone provided masks. Compliance enforced humane manner. one law. 

The government chose social-ism. PM social-ist. People came first decisions made done limit financial ruin. 

This how. simply care much people, spend substantial money keep safe.  tired Newsom fascist policies. surprise there. 164k deaths. 

Question: .0005 percent become risk level worry about, tear country economy apart over, argue incessantly? Continue doing. aren’t crazy. haven’t left home since March except take trash. None neighbors wears masks. keep reminding family safe. home, safe, healthy dying alone hospital. Hang there. vaccine come. sure. I'll surprised anyone makes Halloween USA Thank sharing, amazingly tru article - broke heart too. feel you. work anti masker believes virus go away come November. talking school reopenings, telling keeping preschooler believe risk worth can't trust government make good decisions children. told daughter working mom sending grandchildren school. look realization eyes said 'I guess has.. choice..' really sad. people see what's happening. really really want to. care. worked home done drive pickup necessities since March. 

Unfortunately neighbors, friends employers think virus optional. don’t care close friends neighbors coworkers could die 30.

No longer proud American; looking new home. many us care sad see Trump Flags everywhere flying peoples yards, boats, trucks giant bill boards saying “make America great again!” “keep America great”, and”no bullshit!” Written beneath name. Three different flags. flown beside American flag. local superintendent schools died last week COVID people clamoring send kids teacher back classroom. surreal care nothing except wait until
Election Day patiently wear masks. high school time, help anything all, watched unfold. NY first case March 1st Florida first 7th. Looks like flattening/reducing (which really thing) better NYC, still tops deaths per capita staggering rate. shame.... fucking ridiculous talking point fired administration, consequences lingering. I’m healthcare worker. don’t ever ever ever keep stable patients old sick people tend get sicker prognosis WORSE longer they’re inpatient hospital. EVERYONE sending STABLE Covid patients HOME. NY. hospitals dangerous due hospital acquired infections like MRSA c. diff. It’s also dangerous staff every patients Covid need higher levels care average nursing home patient hospital first place. It’s also extremely expensive Medicare footing bill it. 

HOME nursing home. 

So combat appease outrageous demand outraged Facebook idiots, governor trying kiss Trump ass “be better” NY, keep old, sick, frail, nearly dependent people inpatient hospital beds, dedicated one central facility house Covid patients. Fine worked like 6 weeks governor opened state early everyone’s advice plateau. 

Guess what? facility doesn’t anymore beds. haven’t enough beds weeks. now, stable nursing home patients every hospital recovered symptomatically still testing positive many many people take MONTHS test negative, nursing homes can’t take back without negative test, they’re sitting hospital beds getting minimum psychosocial care deserve, hospital gowns, can’t leave strange room, even restraints, because, are, know, old, frail, sick people cognitive decline dementia, racking bills, absorbing resources, holding beds. spend time ensuring don’t fall bed wander tending physiological needs healing them, CNAs, techs, sitters maxed out, don’t enough maintain regular care. They’re also testing positive quarantine due exposure nurses also strapped mere seconds pt care time charting taking slack techs PCUs baby sitting totally medically stable patients can’t they’re danger others, sit stimulation comfort. 

It’s goddamn nightmare. Instead supplying hiring nursing home staff like LPNs CNAs, provided ADEQUATE PPE. nation sicker broker. hope know **have** read stuff interesting you.  Oh believe know. gonna blow faces. people threatening child taking picture stupid people.

For confronting denial. know level liberal hoax. ""great mystery"" == propaganda cover up.

Iran, China, Russia play numbers. That's true. brother kindergarten teacher still inside. [Doesn’t Spain IU football player, lineman, is/was hospital Covid. 300+ pounds. mouse demands human sacrifice. Add US explain government change response based data? We’re currently interested “How many people currently infect others” comes planning rollbacks continuing reopening.

That’s nothing say considering serological data is, best knowledge, still pretty crap data anyways: Inaccuracies quite high it’s self selecting, can’t look data anything “How many rich people interested COVID past?” doesn’t give clear picture actual number people infected all. still thing restaurant delivers (requiring sign/tip receipt), getting alcohol delivered, package requires signature contactless option. 

I also camera see ring doorbell. cases need meeting person outside.

Majority time regardless contactless not, mask. local issue, handled local health officials local govt. live huge urban area, also rural. Thus far one died county, presumably elder care facilities handled well. 

There sharp spike cases things opened, things trended downward point slightly April/May. spike featured much higher percentage positive tests, gone normal rates. 

Mask wearing increased cases went up, testing. There's still people cry wearing masks all, well people crying people wearing masks low risk situations. However, think minority people trying keep things semi open friends neighbors work put food table. no. literally one cares it’s scary. restaurants full, groups people hanging out, parties weddings. we’re dead. People BLM protest also wearing too, say don’t think that’s works. There’s minimum number days required passes. really think Disney would sell annual pass anything “buy risk” disclaimer?

Well, people like made many predictions would (1) never even get US, (2) big deal got here, (3) never get NYC, (4) disappear summer sun.

#Public Health Agency: Weak data 
 
According Swedish Public Health Agency, scientific basis effective oral protection spread infection, authority refrained recommending public use face masks.
 

 
""A face mask itches goes nose contributes hands often touching mouth, eyes nose, increase risk spreading infection,"" authority writes website. 

 
The authority also writes recommendation contribute people mild symptoms entering society, could increase spread infection. 
 

#""I belong risk group"" 

 
Another protesters wanted spread message wearing mask Timo Lyyra, sociologist. 
 

- ten times dead Norway Finland. total lockdown would wrong initial stage. me, originally comes Finland, completely inconceivable Sweden government deadly disease allowed spread way. listen research. ideology pure guesswork, says. 

 
He continues.

He also thinks school teach small groups instead whole class, children parents risk group allowed receive distance education. 

 
- belong risk group son twelve years old. get sick, would awful. also get sick risk stands without father. 
 

All children right living parents, says. US 161 women 156 men. getting laid incompetence lack social grace gender imbalance. definitely bad lottery going along otherwise healthy people. reopened quickly without waiting re-openings monitor infection spread. also opened stupid things never reopened first place like bars, indoor gyms indoor dining. Viral load perhaps wanted useful response. uninformed speculation nobody. People always inside the, letting flag fly high think actually acceptable public self-centered, utterly lacking common sense, completely empty empathy are. I'm single introvert, last 3 months loneliest depressing months entire life Oomph. Really. never donate gofundme anything, honestly, I'd like see make bank this. Let guess, favorite Brazilian Cristiano Ronaldo? Almost New York got unlucky hit virus early realized real extent threat. 

Yet today, one lowest positive rates nation. shows they've handled well.

Meanwhile, Florida plenty time properly prepare keep virus spreading instead rushed reopen. shows handle well.  Oh that's cool Arizona hospitalization rate. understand bad order hospitalized, definitely great start.

I think site exactly specific info I'm looking for, looks like good resource overall, thanks! right teaching children. They've weaponized child-rearing. Remember right election major racially-charged bullying school administrators stop parents kids sided little monsters? side bonus deliberate spreading disease. Texas winters quite mild, especially areas ravaged virus. hot outside extended period time Texas 10 summer. winter, get North East/Midwest fall light jacket plenty stay warm. Places like Arizona put restrictions back place. It'll go back whenever lifted occurred Ducey gave local governments permission impose mask requirements reversed course closed bars, movie theaters, gyms fitness centers, imposed stricter limits in-house dining restaurants, limited crowds 50, effectively precluding spectators sporting mods like :/ 

How avoid topic vital worthwhile discussion completely avoidable pandemic? Grow he's constantly downplaying virus caused states equipment needed kept recommending hydroxychloroquine causing people lupus medication 

Quit throwing temper tantrums people calling he's europe, remember stuff bad bad here. difference really media coverage. actually running flu herd immunity strategy.

Monkey see monkey do. humans hierarchical species absolutely follow examples set ""betters"". allowing Musk musk around, California basically encouraged thousands small businesses same. 


Money people. Yes. China-esque misinformation. Projection Trump’s strategy. 97k last 2 weeks July schools still closed. sign we're far ready in-person school re-openings.  direct result decades anti-intellectualism forced upon Republican party. take decades clear out. way forward vote every Republican every opportunity. Dem, center-right assholes, get Republicans out. majority Georgia apolitical politically liberal. government insanely corrupt. current governor tampered election gain office, liberal demographics purged voter rolls.

We’re held hostage GOP. Europeans better decoupling United States, becoming independent 

Seriously, sounds like post Russian Sino operative trying instill NATO policy dissent. Also farm subsidies nobody wants trade them. chip'll vaccine, mandatory too. 😂 Nah blew knew suspect time said done parents going one hell legal case school. First suspension, refusing follow rules dealing harassment. almost like want sued. today definitive report NY higher death rate. isn't. say Cuomo idiot doctors known better. people say population density. lack testing. probably dozens contributing factors. get assigning blame cathartic, without information ignorant (by definition) counter productive. Whatever. Good day. No, removed due prejudice vegans. sounds bad example side America really helps want show bad virus get let roam free. want make public today... forced celebrate 60th birthday (in) quarantine tested positive COVID-19 disease, caused coronavirus,

Such bad luck! tested day earlier, would've better risk group. Since children encouraged use personal choice? children, adults. Since children personal choice infectious control measures? let's say, mandatory vaccines attend school?

If allowed child use personal choice guide lives, school would consist video games, ice cream, twitter.

What kind BS brainwash this? Yeah! contagious deaths! Yup. need top testing well reducing transmission. killing *""We prepared print money.""* \- FTFY Yeah. ditched facebook years ago. still account follow family artists enjoy, never post never wander outside bubble.

Yep European living US, would find odd too, usually Europeans move US way. love comment completely ignores fact NY got hit FIRST collected data, organized supply lines, developed therapeutic treatments.

Florida benefit things help mitigate spread, one worst states. 

What’s transmission rate death rate comparison New York vs Florida **today**? yet still never even fraction bad New York we’re supposed believe NY handled “well.” let live taxes. Exactly issue facing. Stolen account. factually wrong. US 165,000 deaths Europe (sum countries including Russia) 206,000. two caveats: first, Europe's outbreak largely ended US still ongoing - approx. 400 Europeans die day Covid 1,000 Americans die. Secondly, population Europe 750 million, versus 330 million US. death rate US passed Europe time ago.

It true countries Europe (Belgium UK, Sweden, Spain Italy) higher death rate US, pandemic affect Europe equally. hardest hit states US (NY, NJ, MA, CT, RI, LA) even higher death rates hardest hit European countries. US already worse Europe. Italy got hit first, US time prepare. Italy also averaging triple-digit cases daily VS QUINTUPLE-digit cases US.

There comparison. states blew one badly. Ugh horrible year hope best him. He's always seemed like classy guy. Hell actor ugh....... That's 2 steps away actual relevance sub though. Screen porch? Well idiot listens people medical background pandemic advice, one could assume. Jesus christ irony statement. Even hundreds people dying day, still trying cling idea Florida fuck reopening.

Its okay admit wrong. accuse people ""doomers"" simply pointing facts. Fascism taking pretty strong. lot trolls also delete past history hide it. governor tested positive rapid coronavirus test. also took two tests take longer results. last two tests negative. everyone saying “See? tests don’t even work! numbers probably super inflated! don’t need take precautions it’s probably even issue more!”. am... happy live people. exactly on-message America. know people keep making excuse. 

By point already significant recognized evidence masks effective. entire reason Fauci etc spread mask lie, protect supplies medical workers (because masks work) Swedes great\* job?

(\*Great defined Scandinavia's highest COVID-19 fatality rate, far. insist sign success.) Oh COVID issue larger cities then?

Source?

Can comparison Canada's larger cities vs Americas?

Two days ago Toronto 1 case. 4th largest city North America

You gonna tell Toronto population density? Wow thought argue wall text lol. Schools going close down, unless state positive test rate 2% so. states opened bunch science denying fucking idiots already seeing leads to. Teachers need strike instead watching YouTube videos spend money build desk partitions. Yep, people definition willing take risks. never see store bar beach. half people staying home (besides going work), see half aren't. Even 20% people wearing masks/distancing, still means 60% population careful. events give life meaning many people. Missing akin missing small part humanity FYI never made predictions. fully believed back February would get big deal did. know virus back appears preventative measures, like wearing masks, working even areas everyone it. live Alabama contrary people Reddit like think, large percentage people wearing masks especially hardest hit regions state. top that, virus nearly deadly feared problem China. treatments virus getting better many people dying beginning this. 

I mean really, propose right now? Another shutdown going happen work anyway would many exceptions people leave homes. thing point continue social distancing wearing masks. blame closure photo next level. myth ""rugged individualism"" root cause American decline, pandemic proof. would fragile inconsiderate thing say. gotcha! Misogyny entrenched within sections country. woman speaks otherwise acts ""unbecoming woman"" instantly gets hatred threats made towards them. tell ""density"" means

You it, believe ""This seems bit time consuming, but, truth, days people bit time hands,“ Dr VanWingen said. “Let’s methodical safe, take chances.""

Kind funny daily increase yesterday today -3 means corrected deaths wrongly assumed COVID admit wrong Sweden perfectly fine present? anymore don’t. Oooh nice, yeah learn appealing sounds, honestly mostly get masters reasonable price compared states.

Did go school Germany yourself? honestly little unsure begin whole process crying loud people still this? 😭 Yeah, Yes, Capitalism. COVID US revealed incompetence admin president California majority voters one party, monopoly. difference CA they’re bunch lockdowns southern states Walt Disney open. someone rode subway NYC shutting rising cases highschools still debating letting kids out, youth doesn’t really care disease. know I’m generalizing, kids eating food hands subway, masks, touching poles food barehanded packing subway groups screaming other, high school city. really see students returning school becoming hazard commute work. remember young feeling invincible see thing today’s youth. gonna great Sweden masks discouraged National Health Agency public transit bus, way worse ventilation subway trains.

Schools open next week, Monday.  think problem wore Zorro mask hearing masks recommended Doubtful. Last week reported highest new hospitalizations 3300 new hospitalizations. seen many people died overdose recent years ? 69'000 2019 compared 15'000 gun deaths year.

Point human life seen everywhere. guy overdose ""deserves it"" public opinion. Imagine quadrupling shooting every US city, people go crazy security. People dying addicted ? "" problem""

Same jail, jail conditions sentences insane. ""deserve it"", justice served. cares die covid19.

I'm vegan feeling decades look back current Way treat animals today barbarian. also look prison system approach addicts way. Hopefully lol what? virus ""burned out""? works.

just admit wrong Florida fucked reopening. okay. Absolutely. Unfortunately seems like it’s long way unless require universal masking lockdown actually enforced. Even March/April lockdowns movement dropped ~50% US according Google cell phone tracking data, whereas Italy able get handle outbreak since lockdowns reduced movement ~90%. seems like fastest way control this, even could get everyone wearing masks would huge step forward. Right trying pretend better man. I’ll even give benefit doubt forgive first jump conclusion second clarified resulted pushing thing you. repeat would listen. trying say want understand. 

If really trying discussion you’d give benefit doubt admit made assumption. Instead want abolish blame look others. Especially you’ve made judgement I’m type looked upon. 

You know I’m right enjoy high horse. Everyone knows football happening fall. knew back April. Cmon folks. would much less divisive. actually about? understand point trying make. China_Flu right w1ng Anti-China conspiracy echo chamber. look top post, one seems care US biggest outbreak world right now. Mod constantly lock/remove threads follow possible, means possible physically faster. Nobody ready this, labs world overloaded hell, USA many cases labs can't keep (take like this, machine 100 samples day send 100 samples get done day, 200 get done 2 days, 2000 fucked, machine can't already does, new machines cost lot importantly take forever build - simple machine - demand every country world. lab machines, lab workers overloaded work stress too, companies right whole world can't keep demand producing chemicals (which means even get people, places open, without chemicals can't move ahead all) tests.
If demand one two countries could pool world USA right everyone needs everywhere. amount money going change it, hit hard tough wall enough resources, already pumping max rate still enough.

That's one reasons Europe parts world decided peak stage large screenings similar cases pool lot samples together, make one test find there's someone sick smaller pools sample sample, speeds things elevates resources. works certain conditions met can't speak would work USA (though chances already implemented).

So yeah, get tests late even outside USA, really depends situation there.

Hang tight guys, moment take proper measures slow gets lot better, large part Europe well east Asia good example - though go shit quickly too. amusement parks extend life pass one year rather give back money. Way large cities.  *Straight Xinjiang detention camp.* Soldiers sign go war, teachers sign put lives danger, stupid argument try learn anything? bar chart year year GDP growth percentage. post hear makes clear looked nothing describing exactly graph shows.  tests halted days several state sites, one believe actual reduction cases testing positive Density total BS excuse, NY dense US isn’t remarkable Europe Asia. Since don’t believe fate punishment angry old testament god, means actions NY blame. post congratulating NY acknowledging worst world. Like congratulating serial killer locked jail last 3 months killing anyone summer. countries also largely stopped transmission, even pariah Sweden 1/3 deaths per capita NY despite little comparatively don’t deaths transmission anymore either. next nothing like Sweden gets 1/3 deaths, NY must actively fucked up

And I’m advocating Swedish method, many countries clearly better Sweden. Merely saying little yet better NY, NY must done worse nothing. Money shit lungs work, heart work, can't focus, dead. America warned pandemic coming *2019*. end 2019, plans procedures national response getting firmed ready roll indicated. Everyone better Americans. Literally everyone. Sorry it’s true. man safe trip lol. yeah bikers gave vibe ppl never grew phase anything waste time? Sensible people know masks dangerous. idiots think never change mind matter much proof lay them. doubt say, I've Vail, Breck, Steamboat never seen anyone smoking let alone chairlift let aloner flicking cigarette butts lift lol. sounds like cold exercise; smokes neck gaiter 18 degree weather lol? Somebody tell global includes taiwan ... Go covid.ca.gov look numbers detail. economic issue. Farm workers work work migratory. living conditions also conducive virus spread. 

It would politically useful progressives highlight real cause higher numbers California. politically better highlight anti-maskers numbers tell different story. I’m excusing anti-maskers. advocated masks face shields back March respect disrespect ever changing public health advice. Well little ditty called [The Running Guys...guys, obvious troll thinks he's funny...downvote, report, move on. China good, rest world racist. like let's keep swing swimming shark trying scare away maybe make Sharks go away way! school needs suspend students talk shit Coronavirus. 0 tolerance bullying rule. I've always impression reason parents pushing hard kids go back school ""child care"" or- wanting school kids themselves. age group, really much excuse ignorance actually going covid- merely fact mass majority population literally fed damn kids ready hell away them? Legitimate question. knew end well. schools reopened first place- everyone pushing hard it, literally why? understand? really see anything ignorance, wanting around damn children. Idk. clearly missing point. point lot people refusing wear masks say can't breathe, would actually fine wore like others breathing mask, rather mask air comes side nose gaps. breathing easily front mask, ""mask"" blocking shit. Hence study done proved popular neck gaitors worse. Guess going see ton gets cold out??? depends types masks, also types work doing. 

If 3-ply medical mask buying groceries, ok.

But mask working construction site, almost certain suffer suffocation die enough oxygen. (Maybe US hot Hong Kong problem serious there)

Even going jogging mask certainly bad breathing necessary air oxygen. students also receive free blankets first day back.  Lmao sub hilarious, every time China gets call responses ""Durmps Drumpsss that"". There's pornhub that. repeatedly read like saw comment.  Countries without travel bans seem done ok well. Korea, far know, never banned flights China, seemed done pretty well. 

Besides, wonder whether travel bans practical early days. flights Wuhan January Americans, Italians, Koreans, Japanese, etc., wanted leave Wuhan return home. pretty cosmopolitan place. Legally speaking, least US, doubt US government ban Americans returning back United States. simply end lots Americans returning China even ban. know you’ve ruined day! purposefully running disinformation keep working class going sacrificing economy. Shameful. make comment millennials, get downvoted oblivion.

Gotta remember fragile little emotions are. someone explain following quarantine protocol makes sense:

Someone confirmed exposed positive case. Exposed person ordered quarantine, along entire household- individuals quarantine may leave residence anyone come residence, exception granted going work?? something magical workplace prevents spread?? trying say kids fault retarded parents? understand. souths terrible though. It’s bad New York it’s 6 months in. south poorly? That's blast past. Honestly, thought reading sadness correctly, less epic bants triggered fragile liberal sensibilities existence pathetic makes us sad. college football, MLB lifesupport next BIG outbreak happens, NFL aint going happen. Thanks, right freaking dumpster fire. Hands who's going take vaccine that's fast-tracked appease stock market corporate America.  Here's Tom weather 😂 actually think there's doctors needed right now? global pandemic? Early millennial, crisis number 3 count dot com bust. Masks make people look intimidating anyway, what’s problem here? Anyone else see kid reach mouth halfway ""chewing"", camera mostly blocked?

I call shenanigans. Lawyers wear expensive suits Yes, certainly do. bright side this, least, attitudes clearly exposed last see, acknowledging problem exists necessary first step fixing it. Gonna post comment again...

A great leader one know everything, one bring people together know everything. said ""Nearly"" unanimous, 99% scientific community acknowledges climate change happening (this much straight obvious point, much even deniers stopped trying pretend unprecedented hurricane seasons, flooding, unpredictable weather systems, acidified oceans etc. becoming new norm). speak moving goalposts thats climate deniers main playbook. used ""climate change happening all"". obviously is, changed ""But can't prove result humans!"" evidence linking climate change anthropogenic era, proving natural climate actually 10,000 year cooling period right shortly industrial period reversed began warming exponential rate, move goalposts ""But EVERY PAPER agrees 100% every aspect!!!! reports *multiple thousands* skewed data!!!!""

its ""controversial"" different groups scientists differing evidence supporting issue. thats literally science works. people always find new information refine understanding. time goes on, certain extrapolations vindicated others made obsolete. one thing absolutely certain human caused climate change going anywhere. 5-10 years consensus might change magnitude, scientific community literally never going say ""psych, kidding, climate change never real"" literally happening observably real time.

Our company's insurance provider waived copays deductibles Covid tests. Hmmm, sound reasonable, remember reading article February March fact COVID 19 became infectious little severe spreaded good outside China. Also seems odd virus like developed cold environment well hot temperatures well. Wonder next season's influence it. edited title allowed. wrote: like summer holiday kept down, going back high level infected. 

New cases, ICU admittance, hospitalization deaths per day, decreasing since April, ""summer holiday"". Well, that’ll make crazy.   ""That likely timeline, based interviews remarks top specialists including Anthony Fauci White House Coronavirus Task Force, means businesses, schoolchildren families continue wait.""

With schools open, one need vaccine longer. already immune dead time gets here. actually dumb? material?

[Here's University Chicago paper 

They give fabric options. Quilting fabric mentioned. Using silk instead stretch chiffon. silk's hell lot expensive. One woman replied one posts seen UoC study silk hand something else planning making, cut Ralph Lauren sheets backed silk make masks family.

I agree sorry got caught, seen nothing resembling [proper public school district. issued press release indicating reversed suspension students posted photos dangerous conditions. wrong suspend first place, sorry, done ensure never happens again, nothing indicating responsible reprimanded. Trash mods trash sub. people dumb can’t take personal responsibility person power forcing too? 

If parent would kid wear mask school problem! It’s lose-lose situation all,but think stakes much higher reopen schools. Little kids don’t particularly seem care either way-my little cousin see excuse able stay home mom day swim. It’s mostly high schoolers rallying hard schools reopen. Mostly seniors. gonna get sources conjecture called testosterone. makes us dudes dumb shit. way estrogen affects females. one perfect. Well, Lopez-Gatell also lost credibility really stupid comments he's made. Again, denounce EA vaccine?
Your entire argument count approval process. I'm asking denounce run-around form normal approval process vaccine.

That change fact that:

- we're living era largest chasm wealth inequality American history. 

- whole, wages increased alignment expenses. 

- college degree longer differentiator, employers hired ""experienced"" entry level applicants...even though entry-level one gains experience.

It would unrealistic assume success stories amongst Millennials. One could argue proof that. But, unlike generations past (in post-ww2 America)...hard work guarantee success.

No. rightfully pissed. MURDER friend?

People like that,.... know what..... Deserve coming them. Fuck them. wanted things be? No. war right wrong comes mindfulness person carry around actions. decided anti mask, literally committing potential murder okay it. Especially flaunt behavior. cannot feel them.... EVER feel others?

When anti maskers feel James? stood 50s fucking cane... (problems walking stroke ago) I’m surprised Michigan opted they’re blue blood Everyone already hated us, years always clung onto belief hate US (American people), hate Government days struggle believe even that. 

That's US relatively free country. leader shit, citizens shit. 
China/Russia authoritarian countries limited elections. There's...really nothing citizens right now. 

However, one point China/Russia emotional fanatic US right now. Otherwise descent authoritarianism even happened. 

But even here, see Americans much lower threshold ""wigging out"" Chinese/Russians. China brutally imperialized European powers Japan. Even Russia suffered lesser degree defeat multiple times throughout 1900s, (as well post-Soviet, leading Putin) though nowhere much China. consequent lowered living standards brought citizenry together elect strong-leader authoritarians (communist party officials). 

In US, none even happened. chimped elected authoritarian hell it. talking entire day? thread restaurant rules. Also allows employers pay others ‘reasons’ get away it. Ok I'll get back 80 years. doesn’t appear capable latent, doesn’t hide dormant cells remerge later like chickenpox/shingles.

If referring terrible politician even whole Congress corrupt ill-suited task, sure. I'm not. deep, systemic problems dozens fronts. list few:

* deep partisan polarization
* Declining education metrics
* Weak trade relations
* Looming massive debt

* Eroding world standing respect
* Increasing isolation (in terms immigration routine transit)

I like vocab. sound smrt. Stay strong pass stronger.  Here's conceptulization that's even colder chilling:

Since 165,000 people died, think - something called ""Monkey Sphere"" -- that's group 150-180 people cognitively, upper limit with, keep tabs sort relationship given time. probably 150-180 people come semi-regular (at least year) contact aware care well-being.

The coronavirus death toll United States functionally equivalent 1,000 people completely bereft social contacts totally forsaken. Think way, theoretically, 1,000 people lost every friend, family member, acquaintance, colleague readily know.

That actually happening, scary thought experiment. country from? That's probably REALLY! good idea I'll beyond livid anti-vaxxers get vocal.

Thats level death. One person went school would've dead. everyone across country.

Population wise, US makes far less 25% population. want say it’s 4% can’t remember hand.  Schools haven’t even opened yet either. majority public schools open late August here.

New cases e.g. worldometer.info, reflect real number cases. number shown highly dependent many tests do. 


Sweden \_increased\_ number tests, 36k 80k tests per week June. increase ""new cases"" e.g. again:  


The real number new cases, ofc dropping since April. ICU admittance, hospitalizations deaths per day tells that, don’t go war refuse wear shrapnel helmet makes look weak, wear go fucking war, discussion. I'm American, rough understanding payroll tax thing simply deferring deductions next time taxes, time pay deduction amount then

I'm using essentially perfect scenario. 

Same idea goes Europe.


If major hiccups would significantly later that.


So weather going change. Transmission going much favorable. Disease severity going increase well.

So at:


We build immunity stave dealing later.


It's really easy claim people advocating naturally acquired herd immunity ""right-wing assholes want kill grandma"" certainly lot people like that. 


People somewhat right wrong reasons.


Places like NYC-NJ, Florida, AZ, Sweden, IL, etc built continue built lot population immunity.


It August. still cases re-infection. 

We say 100% shielding immunity lasts least 6 months.


So places going see virus continue retreat possibility smaller, manageable shorter term wave year.


Places went lock built little immunity (Germany, China, Northern California, etc) stuck basically hoping sort prayer.

Here hope: monoclonal antibodies.

Now possible, hell probable Regeneron's antibody cocktail could strong prophylactic.

Great

But absolutely zero way manufactured anywhere near numbers actually give passive immunity even 1% population year.


I find unlikely HOPE could significantly lower mortality. possible. ""concern"" deaths COVID-19 immune response strong anti-viral would significant effect one may expect time point (ie sick) virus already naturally retreat.


But possible. We'll know month Phase 3.

THAT SAID even monoclonal antibodies significantly lower mortality would able treat sick. Thus back letting virus run course ""naturally"".


So know people really believe solution significantly percentage population infected.


There not.


Anybody claiming otherwise either lying simply living reality.


We can't New Zealand. can't SK.

Note: later point I'm extremely confident SK's suppression strategy fail. Weather changing. able keep much longer. Australia's suppression already failed miserabley Japan looks like cusp failure.

We stuck game plan: FLATTEN CURVE.

That means spread infections number people infected. We've deluded ourselves. card must homemade joke. Read article done elected officials... r people gonna read card? whole card joke someone writes short story ""cliffs notes"" version it.

More seriously, ""novel""is part name - called that, going transition ""non novel"".  actual virus' name SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 syndrome, someone use those, ""novel coronavirus"" means they're talking new virus (new us). slip Dr. nice crisp George Washington? Thank you, appreciate that. worry, article says DOD going take distribute injections... Lining queues organized armed men make everything feel better.

Seriously, kid scared get shot doctors.... really think going cooperate looks like scene zombie Apocalypse movie? possible wear mask, social distance, still put number deaths perspective.

It's bad many people die, Americans could done much better job reducing transmission. sky falling apocalypse people making be. Yep, sad America, even sad nations. light hearted made laugh tough day. /raises hand

I still believe scientific process

81% nursing homes accepted patients hospitals already residents COVID, broadly speaking like decision introduced virus nursing homes. Furthermore, 20% NY COVID deaths nursing homes. Compare national average 45%.

So NY doctor's conspired use ventilators need even though worried ventilator shortages? sound pretty negligent bordering evil me. think Big Ventilator industrial complex bribed them? maybe going best data time? Nah probably conspiracy right?

So NY higher death rate anywhere else world, eager place blame. Could due doctors still learning treat illness time? Could due lack testing? Could factors even know yet? maybe everyone NY idiot course hardest hit? Yeah must feel good. got figured want let everyone else know obvious is. Ignorance bliss.

The man clung branches, wet, damp, shaking, prayed God.

A woman inflatable raft rode by, pulled current. waved called man tree, begging leap craft, waters getting tumultuous.

""*No*."" Said man tree. ""*I believe grace God, alone shall save flood.*"" 

And woman's raft swept away waters could insist further. man looked rising waters, prayed.

""*God, always faithful. church-leader ordained pastor. headed choir taught Sunday school volunteered countless hours charity. pray, please save rapids!""*

The man tree hears raised voices others suddenly. speedboat, solid well built cruises towards tree, loops around trapped man. group survivors calls him, tossing life-saver, telling hurry ring pull safety - *Hurry! -* boat much fuel left.

""*No*."" Said man tree. ""*I believe grace God, alone shall save flood.*"" 

The survivors circle tree desperately, calling man. eventually forced peel away head safer waters. disappeared flooded horizon, man turned face raging heavens prayed.

""*God, always faithful. donated blood kidney. saved young girl burning car. served nation battlefield, raised healthy young family. Oh God! God please, please deliver awful storm!*""

As finished speaking eye hurricane comes him. rain stops skies become perfect blue. hears *THOWMP THOWMP THOWMP* rotor blades helicopter hovers him, making waters flood ripple dance. rescuer harness descends man, holding rescue harness man tree. man tree needs hook belt, rescuer says, get here.

As rescuer goes secure harness, man retreats dense branches. winds start pick up, helicopter pitching rolling dangerously. rescuer calls one last time, hand man tree. 

But hurricane returns, helicopter pull away. rescuer raising air rains return. 

The tail-half hurricane always worse, flood waters rise rapidly. man tree holding long can, till even tree lies buried brackish tide. 

The man tree finds awake, marbled halls Heaven, feet All-mighty himself. Dropping knees first prayer, man halls heaven raises eyes God's indescribable form.

Would happy officials epicenter pandemic come country without two weeks quarantine? active cases caught countries people travel out? don’t even know actual number cases bu testing grounds praise. live NYC epicenter COVID. I’ve going outside taking subway since early April. It’s pretty much normal besides fact people wearing masks. recently states south everyone also wearing masks public indoor place. sure live scary.

When say economy, hope don’t mean Wall Street.

Having good economy access get things need keep healthy. Since live NYC, need ability walk take public transit places get food see doctor. small businesses shut down, don’t anywhere get food affordable price. cheeseburgers, like actual good produce high nutritional value keeps body strong fight infection.
Also people don’t go back work, one commuting public transit means service cuts. effects millions people ability get around. economy isn’t always making someone richer, effects everyone way.

We fucked, pity anyone ever thought good anything. Take care - make sure look little joys. threats escalate make people crazy, means unpredictable stuff prolongs mess. 
do think they're acting crazy they're calm? 
 
i get we'd like see people suffer, goal actually solve problem instead giving revenge boners, need look logically instead emotionally maybe sacrifice satisfying emotions attitudes greater good. People make America less safe every time look phone driving, go craft brewery 1 2 beers drive home buzzed, drive 80-85 mph highway. 

You're kind making point me. reckless activities Americans participate time, causing hundreds thousands people die needlessly. laws banning them. 100%. Surgical masks filters 70% air, effectively multiplying distance people 3x. work shoulder-to-shoulder another person 0m x 3 = 0m.

For comparison, N95 filters 95% air, distance multiplied 20. anyone else getting little tired Europeans looking nose us everything? UK nothing prime minister nearly died. remember video Italian mayors threatening citizens try make take seriously. 
If judge populous leader lowest common denominator we're backwards ignorant yet perfectly fine us. 70/30 don't. I'm making political point. anti-maskers want freedom, something want. 

By way, kid receiving threats now. great country. Trying claim ""some cases bad, millions cases good""? Wow need stop listening us propaganda.  What’s opposite flattening curve?

Sturgis favorite pastime Redditors, Democrat politicians, media take something bad create narrative it’s Trumps’s conservative american’s fault truth reason things often multi factorial difficult pin down. Things like climate, population/population density, genetic diversity, avg age, obesity rates/general health contribute differences cases deaths country. Weird things like less air conditioning systems Europe may play part there’s probably factors people haven’t even considered yet. Sociologists economists still can’t even agree caused things like rapid drop crime occurred starting late 90s. 

Articles like irresponsible journalism best leftist anti US propaganda worst Exactly. Empathy would involve putting place. 
I can't imagine choosing selfish family, friends co-workers. 
If can't imagine it, can't put place. empathy. probably crazy. family might might right. Well parks preserves 100x crowded normal, problem. attempted take kids parks times always overflowing people, like ants anthill. one masks, one distancing. People right top other. one denying virus

For real... exactly figure mutated contagious? 
Mutations random. virus can't decide next mutation be. Survival fittest determines mutated variants thrive. think I’m going put family harm’s way “just see”? doesn’t make sense. I’m willing take risk less full lung capacity rest life kidney failure result surviving COVID. want it, means go it. Bingo. Excellent response.

This too.  Even true, ( ), I'd still prefer country everyone takes masking deadly serious ( ), country shirk wearing masks, testing ( like we're ) Doesn’t mean it’s truth either. Somehow China contained massive country? Give break. probably killed covid positive patients managed it. 10 close schools back lack staff. So... fake id junk food well. Okay. open door anyone right now. can't leave outside, take back you. Hell Cuomo fought De Blasio shutting city down. Even days sooner would saved thousands. fixed eventually way.

None way. Virtual 2 days. schools opened person August 3. Parents week July elect virtual learning. Unfortunately school system gave little information virtual learning would set up, many missed deadline waiting answers.

They act like held accountable fear reaction like mentioned, already without much provocation. like drunk drivers, people need face serious penalties deliberate disregard public safety. doubt it. problem erratic leadership contradictory messaging top state leadership taking cues top.

It's dissertation manage pandemic outbreak.

You can't walk first day say ""This thing big deal opponents using remove me."" second day, ""Well big deal, magically disappear"". Then, ""It's like moderately bad case flu...nothing worry about"".  Then, ""I wash hands this, governors"". ""Why opening?!"". ""Liberate state!"". ""I think masks really work, want wear one.""

And that's highlights got here.  Without monkey see, monkey cult, would likely sporadic outbreaks denialist behavior could contained small measures. 

We would never gotten complete cooperation population, would lot closer competence top start. Here's latest case/death charts South Carolina, running 7-day death cases might going down, judging charts. 

South Carolina currently 39.48 deaths per 100k population. puts #16 among US states.

Here's list states 20% tested people. could 200 positive 1000 tested. Herd immunity takes greater 60%. 18 million. 18,000,000/100days=180,000 people covid per day. Thats conservative percentage needed herd immunity assuming people states don’t come Texas. 

I guessing herd immunity could exist year now. course 3x number deaths things equal. I’m AP Disney Universal, live hour away, haven’t since February. 

First, Florida residents options APs. Mine weekdays only, June July blocked out. cost less three days get go lot more. Since I’m blocked peak times, including weekends, going least busy pleasant times. 

Second, tourists go theme parks, make day it. It’s long, expensive, tiring. go, usually get early afternoon, get rides want, enjoy atmosphere. There’s pressure all. take time it’s always there. 

Third, two APs, access six parks. could definitely argue Epcot nearly two parks Magic Kingdom two-day park. means rarely repeat things unless they’re favorite attraction. 

Lastly, little doses 1-2 times month hours time way enjoyable surrounding parks week year. It’s nice break reality without overwhelming. 

I’m hoping get back next year. miss things. think we’re bit funk now. go back, I’ll probably outdoor things, means I’m going back cools down. There’s vlogger outdoor rides open-air queues won’t eat indoors all. also stays hours time. That’s probably route I’d go, it’s way hot right I’d like see numbers drop 5% positive go back. blaming situation California Trump Fox News? One hard hit areas Los Angles. Hardly, Fox News target market. Right line airvent, get freshest air blow dirty air away you. Maybe economy meantime?

Their GDP better countries right now.


People act like choice massive COVID deaths ruined economy, reality handle former gonna get latter anyway.


The whole world suffering right now, every country took quick strong measures virus recovering much faster didn't. Guarantee White House changes hands, whole group people suddenly care want hold government accountable. Sometimes yes. US proved terrible long covid. IIt frustrating people care people. caring good soul. state,kids starting move week rush join Greek life. I’m sure it’s going go well! I'll take word it. high school came out, looked super cheesy. thinking Antonio Banderas would known Zorro kid's film. school reopening later month. Let's see long lasts... might work, never used myself. I'd prefer use insect decline last decades. Tiki torches might good middle ground, used either. cost karma literally went karma farm get, order get around rules prevent trolling. Specifically pollute /r/chicago subs.

Your account showing 3 years old, never ever commented anything literally yesterday, started trolling hard /r/coronavirus /r/chicago.

Odd.

You try less obvious next Republicans fragile. rest us eagerly part

But California (predominantly Democratic state) things going smoothly right now. leadership Democratic. explain that? Sigh..it high italy testing capacity extreme cases. IFR Italy sero studies finds less .5% IFR even hardest hit regions bergamo. Dividing confirmed cases deaths get IFR. mind boggling me.

It's airborne virus...you except majority teenagers wear masks respect social distancing rules? Lol. programmer says could set batch job run midnight would automatically send text message every person who's sample processed updating database entry ""untested, destroyed"".

Then pair web facing CRUD app people look results tests online case get test. already get standard biometric tests, reason set thing COVID testing. would take dedicated team maybe month set properly, week mind unstable insecure. Poking fun political figure? People time. Take joke fartface. Imagine getting COVID Sturgis winding dead FOZZY last band saw. embarrassing. striking imagine different we'd reopening schools offices anyone could pop CVS Walgreens walk month's supply N95 surgical masks.

But August despite known virus since November, still invoked Defense Production Act force companies produce PPE mass quantities. would thought America 🇺🇸 full ignorance selfishness. 

I feel bad good ones talking seriously. yet want send back schools fall...common sense finest... Don’t forget [CDC required everyone use contaminated first month outbreak US, leaving country virtually blind. order counter claim, refute. Link article showing evidence school actively enforcing zero-tolerance policy every single picture taken every single student prove assertion actual zero-tolerance. That's works Honestly headlines read ""because virus"" instead ""despite virus"". Make mistake; people letting happen they're evil. hope realize America currently anomalous leadership situation.

But pandemic mostly managed state level. recall lot positive news stories great California April amazing Gov. Newsom was. petty bad shape. Colorado still reports figures, bozos higher levels can't really interfere that. Disaster  

### “The future bright filled promise us all. human spirit driven is, insatiable desire know, explore, understand continue forever reach ward outward.”

### –Dr. Robert T. McCall floor would guess, went protests nothing like this. still fluid situation know (which much).

I really know theres one reason it. Opportunism involved, sure. Yeah, know... point? people risk everything rather encourage people lose weight, we'd rather focus lockdowns mask mandates. combo solution. Also, calling Covid denyer? mean give impression. US stopped raining death skies decades now. 

Most military misadventures aided troops Canada, Australia UK. clean hands. remember ny tried ban sodas bigger certain size america flipped tf lmao Sewage water samples found virus Spain early March 2019. actually still certain virus originated China, first observable outbreak occurred there. There's one theory Spanish Flu originated USA. cancel better start paying players like professionals Good article. realistic. Models show basically empty car though. people fill cars, air exchange likely less effective, particles pass people. course acknowledge last paragraph least issue article head sand. cost basic human rights things like search seizure without warrant! Don’t worry, governments almost always definitely give rights back emergencies Yes really root problem, everyone like, happen!!! 

I'm amazed read old papers like, plain view, dumb point time can't say country, need fix things. country doomed are. Send virus ISS loitering hallways! think NYC New York State considerate pandemic hit March. certainly fragile unprepared, medical care containment measure perspective. mess. mistake look US uniform entity. Also, pandemic quite terrible Spain, Italy UK. think UK still highest death rate per capita - higher US. I'm used getting downvoted unpopular opinions. wonder offended time lol news article means nothing, virus mutating, that's life general, coronavirus mutations likely impact anything. far one mutation seems make spread easily that's it. pointed every time thread pops coronavirus mutations, mutate significantly (which rare happen) would likely make less dangerous. article anything worry about. real hard time biting tongue family friend got sick, went party, spread around, got super defensive someone called dangerous stupid behavior husband backed “she’s contagious! live I’m fine!”

A week later he’s hospital, month later she’s widow. 

Luckily none people gave died, killed husband. 

Really hard sympathize stupidity selfishness killing innocent people, don’t give shit it’s tens thousands Americans dying. happens want help prayers -_-

The posts still Facebook actively stop mentioning even ask “how people gave doing?” :C I'm really sorry hear that, hope get better soon family roll ok. Dems passed bill 2 months ago. asking isnt secret, public. GOP isnt yet clear asking for, want. U/Accappatoiviola foreign spam/scam/propaganda account House passed bill months ago. That's transparent. Senate offered filled planes hotel re-fittings. gives idea they're negotiating. one believes bullshit, karen. go look sure. Top 4 states New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut. Must redneck areas states making numbers look bad. half Irish sudden. 2 minimum distance high five Oh snap nation proactive instead reactive, never. Yes tropical island country less half population Sweden 21 active cases. without lockdowns, Japan, South Korea, Belarus Sweden, experienced negative course events many countries. Sweden even praised benefits higher immunity compared lockdown countries. 75% Swedish deaths happened nursing facilities weren’t protected fast enough. Plus die go blissful afterlife. problem religious people bigger issue subway cars often broken lights air. sound like IQ 3. Things bad Georgia. I’ve personally known 5 people died 20+ infected, don’t even know many people. According Washington Post we’re #1 state new cases per day per capita basis, yet schools starting back person classes week. Five hundred plus students teachers Atlanta area already quarantine exposed cases first week school last week. That’s still stopping towns around Atlanta area hosting free concerts craft festivals. It’s ridiculous badly we’ve handled pandemic. many others care, country's leadership not. tests *can* get paid those. 

The problem test backlog right now, *all* tests worthless even they're accurate take long person suspects they're infected get results soon enough modify behavior. Making time sensitive means testing capacity low, tests get back least *useful*. also shifts problem ""tests slow"" ""there enough tests"", *sounds* dire (but actually better, tests *do* get done useful) puts pressure FDA increase test capacity. seems like people actually complaining masks uncomfortable people wear often therefore used them. I'm one I've able work home months wear masks running errands. someone used it, yes, feel hot uncomfortable, feel like bit harder breathe. 

My SO, hand, wearing mask day grocery store job months totally used it. also found uncomfortable first, forgets he's wearing it. fall I'll working school in-person two days week I'll wearing mask day. I'm sure first days tough, I'm confident I'll adapt also cease notice it. I'm actually kind glad I'll chance get used running errands mask feel better. 

So summary, whining uncomfortable masks are, agree. still wear anyways you. Stop whining, suck up, get used it. Yeah, go back June. sick July sick since. Thought starting improve week ago got slammed again. thing wicked.

I wish luck hope fellow workers take seriously. Death doesn’t lie. Rep. planning Weekend Bernies whole thing? Yeah, go back June. sick July sick since. Thought starting improve week ago got slammed again. thing wicked.

I wish luck hope fellow workers take seriously. exact reason failing. enough space, leader decided need space equipment prepare advance. taken seriously soon got (January 15th) maybe America would better off.

But is. I'm assuming enough grass North African city support whopping 600 horses. Meat factory cluster outbreaks, ban non-essential travel USA Brazil expected begin next days. would think case pcp would've contacted neurologist testing also happen soooooo? better medication put on, obviously cure like trump said, treatment none less back work today symptoms again, taste smell returned. Lmao downvotes. Reddit wrong think, it’s always “USA bad, everywhere else good” elaborate bit? suggesting he's essentially powerless voice gotten global stage he's advocating otherwise unpopular view? dare try deprive Covid-19 educational opportunities, yes hes little different children influenza never suggested strict punishment way, Influenza sounds Spanish maybe kind Puerto Rican, maybe ICE get involved? I'm saying everyone thinking! Leslie Jordan old person? He's little young cute! Nope. youre real estate developer, youre making TONS money like 08. 2008 2017 tax bill 2020 corona thr biggest wealth transfers poor/middle class rich. 

Do know cheap property right now? low mortgage rates are? historic. like 2008. 

The rich making like bandits, like always question would be, really feel like blame, feel responsible current situation indirectly benefited slavery position help put things right?

For example, I'm Canadian. love country, also recognize founded genocide first nations people. government population supported absolutely indefensible policies modern times (the last residential school closed fucking 1996!!!).

I personally this. Obviously. But, entire population largely shut opportunities had, parents had, grandparents had, could argued benefited. And, there, could argue moral obligation assist nation's process truth reconciliation.

Now, maybe sounds little like accepting blame. could definitely straw manned sound like that. really think taking responsibility accurate.

How example compare conversations referencing? Oof aged like milk even posted tbh That's video calling though. also see people go outside parks whatever recreation prefer. writing seem indicate so. 

In order herd immunity achieved vast majority populace needs experience infection. 

Even generous estimation infection rates barely puts 45%. 

The official numbers 400k someodd cases, state contains almost 20 _million_ people. 

That even remotely close what's needed herd immunity. 

You liar fabricator. 

Stop. Defffffinitely *Europe* either Lol America bad welcome, glad hear it! long you’re loud, don’t right. Canada EU gloat low drug prices, whine Americans get priority access new drugs vaccines. dont understand American ICUs arent vulnerable overwhelmed, dont understand money funds many ICU beds per capita here. pretty hilarious really. tnx American people aren’t told public health authorities both. Covid-19 takes many, many fewer life-years (I believe John Ioannidis estimated .1-1%). Raw death numbers misleading. idea women it. mind-boggling. So, job lasts two years, move again. 20s isn’t finding forever job. It’s building resume getting experience. quality resume, finding jobs becomes MUCH easier. 

My fiancée spend two years non-ideal nursing job, one prestigious could get good experience. two years undergrad two years experience, got $101k top nyc hospital.

I’ve lived 4 cities 20s early 30s. graduated 2009, worst possible year. make mid-200s now. 

I’m sick people think deserve high paying job without putting even smallest amount effort (e.g., apply jobs jobs). Thank you. unintentional. Changed sentence ""Epidemiologists compare current situation influenza, whereby universal vaccine “must” safely reopen schools, noting asymptomatic transmission represents substantial proportion new infections (Vermund &amp; Pitzer 2020). "" happy consider versions. experience whole life food. It’s amazing people drive work. live Oklahoma. real public transportation EVERYONE drives. 🥴 Think weak chins mask could hide tho. Already proudly sit pee, mask ain't shit. means fuck *in depression*, disposable income runs dry anyone provide essential service fucked. enough essential jobs massive number workers entertainment, hospitality, tourism, travel, restaurant, luxury goods industries. many more. Even ""essential"" industries like car manufacturers lay people people's ability buy cars get loans tanks.

This societal problem. responsible other. keep things way - pretending one else's fault family gets evicted ends homeless - selfishness force country epidemic homelessness, hunger, illness, death, rage violence.

People react well world fucked fault neighbors can't bothered stop selfish long enough save millions abject misery. Bread shortages hunger fueled French Revolution. think people fight options ""fight die"". ????? Texas single state inside much larger country. nearly HALF entire GDP Germany, sovereign country, economically prosperous EU. 

how flattering Texas ? worked govt contractor processing payments. 5 team members assigned regions processed payments region. Easiest job ever had. generally done work week 3pm Monday. tried finding additional work, taking regions, help others, told ""STFU"" fuck everyone else end ton work."" months finished reading internet moved job ""overachieving"" noticed. try make aware propaganda, tell that‘s life is. status quo always exactly immovable. probably call communist democrat tell trying improve aspect society naively utopian. Temporarily embarrassed millionaires around every corner. Land deflection, home individualism. Thats 13th warrior keywords. sentiment. knows speaking politics even uses symbols single letters. One thing I've noticed speak one party even compare them.  pandemic response anything else lately (and trust me, there’s LOT events lately) made realize America terrible country, furthest thing example use democratic country look like. 

Everyday U.S. looks like blonde hair blue eyed charismatic doppelgänger Russia China. pathetic excuse human being. girl worth thousand know mad it. wonder Trump incompetent trying damage country much possible plan? wonder? retired future require one top one feels like India ticking time bomb?

Their daily case death numbers steadily inexorably climbing upwards end sight. month ago reporting ~25,000 new cases ~500 deaths per day. month that, ~10,000 new cases ~250 deaths per day.

Come September 10^th, going see ~100,000+ new cases ~2,000+ deaths per day?

There seems little coverage situation there. work large Indian team even seem pretty dark, least they're talking it. Lol. American physician, Americans far ""the fittest"" actually possible ""lose first-world"" country status allowing vital infrastructure makes crumble fall apart. really good example Flint, Michigan. clean drinking water six, **SIX** gods-damned years. city first-world country rely bottled water rations. larger, obvious one neglect health social care systems. US seen what, 5 million cases now? What? That's even close understandable sentence. Yes government lies rambling prove otherwise. know too, figure someone knocking door even hinted reality obstruction lack empathy life I'm super lucky, found law gig here. Germany experiencing worker shortage lot professional fields. ""they"" context? eating up? get it.

I dunno, feeling people's reactions seem weird me. lost sense social responsibility. USA (501 per 1 million) comparable per-capita deaths France (464), Mexico (405), Brazil (476), Sweden (571), Chile (530), Italy (582), Spain (610), Peru (638), Netherlands (359) UK (685) (Iran numbers fudged like BBC reports). British, Brazilians, Swedes Chileans dumb exactly considering unbelievably hard America fucked up?

Yes, Trump administration grossly mismanaged crisis. Maybe, might constructive regard things like rather post smug X people think Americans dumb upvoting shame random American action. personally don’t appreciate continuous feed asinine messaging. great way divide people. Say “Europeans feel X way Americans” you’re lumping Europeans bunch Americans separate bunch.

What said, “all X race feel way race.” Sub gender, etc. 

I used travel work immediately try remove stereotypes visiting country. mean, small-minded, jerk way handle things... walk country preconceived notion everyone I’m going encounter? 

This really dividing. thought goal unify? Support? Build up? 

That’s going happen everyone views embodiment Trump idiot. Probably higher, tool offers average, kind people choose attend indoor wedding right probably risky average likely taking risks well. people safe staying away, like you. Good luck family. Neither New York's. Italy's.

Doesn't mean fuck bad. you’re store gloves on, technically contaminate groceries grab shelves cart would didn’t gloves on. effective, you’d change quite frequently. Also, I’m sure touch phone/keys/wallet point store gloves Bingo name-o! Big fucking FACTS 💯 Losing hair better losing life! Good. Sports priority right now. Go college: Okay sounds good. \*\*doesn't find 40/hr week job, waits tables 4 years, pays 25k undergrad loans. Go grad school: Okay, bad. Finds job working homeless population making 14.82 hour, works job 2 years supervised obtain licensure. Oh, 90k gave grad school 7% interest, yeah, pay interest supervised extremely low paying job. 121k debt currently make 50k year working mental health. think anti-intellectualism seeing US. years, GOP telling people viewpoints- ""common sense"" beliefs valid expert's opinion matters laypeople knowledge of. opinions held level expert spent life studying subject matter. fostered population believe climate change, evolution, vaccines, wearing masks helps reduce covid infection rates. literally Kruger-Dunning effect, applied whole group follow particular political ideology. 9-5 stopped standard ago US. Americans work hours [OECD productivity (measured GDP per hours worked) also lower [OECD Vacation days also standard across entirety US: employer determines many days allowed.

Essentially, lot people working lot actually much work. Really 10 years? What's logic behind that? could flee ship, I'd gone tomorrow. fucking hate country become. country would take now? I'm another American moron far anyone concerned. 

There chance *maybe* one day, could move Germany work, that's chance have. Otherwise, I'm stuck, surrounded morons feeling helpless. Can't open article, says access denied. Blocked EU? Okay, pandemic then. still screwed up. We’ve lost 163k people, three times many lost Vietnam.

Just admit fucked one Paint types aerosol cans small metal ball inside assist mixing product shake can. That's make rattle noise.

May covid remove (the cops) swiftly said another thread: Ozymandias optimist.  Ah man Banderath, wore zorro costume full year cause legend. Hope pulls OK. know people surprised us's failure handle covid crisis. writing wall. Super unhealthy population 50% presenting comordities, universal Healthcare, federal sick day policy, social security net, leadership believe science. US never chance. stable job pay like ass ever makes people 1%, society's fucked think stable jobs anyways. Unfortunately think it'll targeted towards killing poor, elderly sick. wonder Trumpists love much... killed elderly economic gain according Dr Tallinger. I'm surgeon American man. wear mask also carry. See calls weak think riots number people general public can't read simple signs use basic logic astonishing. 
At least week jobs retail food I'd think new low reached stupidity. we'd reached rock bottom. without fail entitled smooth-brained mouth-breather would come prove wrong. No, we're dumb. point states may well become independent nations give better shot looking better Ummm I'm American still care ._. Um...

I'm working MLB two major outbreaks squads are't full contact sport. Clemson Rutgers roughly third teams catch COVID games played. 

Several college teams multiple person outbreaks Dolphins, Texans, Cowboys multiple person outbreaks season started yet.

I'm working assumption evidence that's accumulated teams tried even NFL teams season. 

It's called *hypothesis* based evidence. one assuming anything you. AMEN! got right! actually super important remember ad hominem attacks pathetic Meh, go world, America nothing remotely close third world. It’s definitely first world country. It’s top first world, firmly first world country. everywhere California climate. 

Warm places option want open year Haha appreciate it, hard build meaningful connections people internet Yea except they're gonna refuse pay themselves. every country systems. mom's virus Puzzle out, chief. feel like reported opposed emphasizing people general arent wearing masks especially men. article says half women report always wearing masks leave home Fragile inconsiderate, that's long descriptor Americans, like brash obnoxious descriptors Americans. there's one thing Europeans angst-ridden American teens agree everything awful US. turns lot Reddit users fit one two groups. I’ve forgetting take vitamin everyday thanks this. took minute ago.  40% country still approves actions archaic ineffectual democratic system put place US, 40% holds disproportionate voting power. There's absolutely reason believe anomaly. systemic issue rotting country. done anything good since then... Maybe, it’s people got exposed people house you’re right, anything preexisting immunity spread still probably slowed American, view working class people vote interests wealthy. Personally, thought 9-11 already that. considerate point out. hope nobody ever gets used acts war terrorism thought US reaction one act vastly overblown, including flaunting laws conventions prior US governments vital introducing first time since Civil War act war happened contiguous territory (I'm wilfully giving Pearl Harbor pass far removed geographically). downhill there. thing people want be? Gross. Look bush winning gore, altho election stolen, America's string anti-intellectual sentiment big factor. wish took safer route could plan best virtual experience possible students families. 

Hell, I'd cool extended year schedule make loses said they'd take time boost testing capacity drive community transmission opening.  One friends involved works front desk hospital, scary think about. I'm jealous seeing things like social media. friends acting way, sides family too. example, one cousins baby shower yesterday cousins even elderly aunt. Thankfully, parents husband's parents smart, that's good least. extended family basically ignoring social distancing well. I'm deeply disappointed all. I'm really looking forward trying make better friends over. Hopefully can. could say dumb. beat around bush? America sending best England government like nations do. indicate congress pass legislature practice lack complete common sense, congress stood financially benefit directly ruling? home exposed one two parents world. sports, camp, school - difference exposure vast - resulting number infections shows  thought left 2016 Trump elected? talk? Fair. anesthesiologist I’ve wearing n95 face shield 8-10 hours per day since March. super fun, doable. Carlin damn prophet. Seriously, boggles mind many people say love turn around behave says would.

""Rights? any... privileges."" 

Think ever see army Karen's demanding wear mask. Poor leadership leads anxiety. Got face shields there, easy tell it’s legitimate plastic, I’d less likely buy disposable masks admit bit bias, China case seemed like *really* wanted patient 0 guy came back vacation US could blame re-infecting China.

But even patient zero, likely either lingering aerosols elevator ""complete quarantine"" quite complete claimed. people always receive threats stupid stuff like this? psychos think that? 8,700 deaths

There's local bar locations Edmonton Calgary. Edmonton location linked outbreak early bars opened, rumours circulated employee visited bar others symptomatic. employee Calgary location tested positive. timing last shift worked day received results highly suggest employee worked least one shift awaiting test results, bar would answer directly asked this. incredibly frustrating. two countries much better established medical systems.

2) Covid twice three times virulent flu
3) Covid asymptomatic spread flu length time spread different
4) Covid long incubation period
5) Covid multiple variations possibly mutations 
6) Covid RNA drift people infects
7) people infected presents chances deadly mutation less deadly mutation (just permanent heart damage)  Williamson pointed yet-to-be-published study said showed little transmission Covid-19 schools.

Right?... would one find info you’re talking about? hurricane counting bodies without positive test? testing thing something read back like, june, I'm pretty sure post history somewhere. I'm tired shit right though I'm gonna go digging it. I’ve seen posts elsewhere find thoughtful informative. one isn’t don’t get it. Lol that's want phrase it.

you guys great job strong gust could take out.

It has. Mama broke pelvis wrist rainstorm last winter. recovery center wife, doctor, knows well sorts places first fail infection hits, got mother last February started get infections Germany. 

Over half people recovery center died, including young otherwise healthy nurses one doctor. concept young healthy people survive simply true, us young.

I'm commercially licensed Ship's Captain, retired. lot Sea Survival First Aid course work do, get level. One things learn early is; talking ""survival fittest"", going many survivors. Damn illustrate pretty well American stupidity. Stupid comparison, use poor metric, deflecting. even close. state Georgia actually currently experiencing new cases per day deaths per day nation Georgia total entire pandemic.

To fair, nation Georgia smaller population still 1/3 US state. Eclipsing totals daily basis absolute failure. context think kinda works. He's got decent voice narration. Yeah I'm dual national French/American travels two I'm seeing much difference people either country. Stupid people everywhere.  Selfish ignorant would two statements. However, really messed part minority screwing country selfishness. Lol nothing paying school. Boomers didn’t pay shit college. part made boomer response acting something certain way way sufficient ok everyone else. 

It’s like saying “when kid walked 4 miles snow uphill get school”. Ok and?Why way paying school matter context discussion? 

Would make much sense said anyone can’t afford college play sport get scholarship that’s lot kids do? 

Why acting student loans aren’t shitty thing someone do? fact anyone take worthy least empathy. certainly shouldn’t used reason doesn’t matter someone longer get athletic scholarship. 

Again, ability even see things someone else’s shoes severely lacking sub. NZ citizens return must quanatine managed isolation 14 days pass 2 tests. One day 3 one day 12. still weakest link remain vigilent working far. federal government helping states? states banding together? kind Third World shit hole place?… Oh wait talking United States… Ha ha

Fundamentally, automation decreases sum necessary, menial labor.

Your reasoning need convoluted capitalist social structure conclude automation bad. Fuck Kemp, Governor Georgia!

Also true: 7+ (at minimum) every 2000 Americans alive start pandemic dead something COVID-19.

1 2000 0.05%.

Approximately 0.85% Americans die every year.

Half year's worth American deaths 0.425% population. shit done, travel good again, l want TSA telling tourists USA wear mask want enter going. See throw tantrum. Sturgis places...

This post discussion Canada, FYI. normally helps get away confidence fake accolades.

I normally make clear walk room people like not. don’t care either way, I’m changing act unless it’s legitimately disruptive you. work hard, git gud.

As accolades, I’ve noticed people don’t feel insecure you’re acknowledging work. Last job campaign (and wasn’t really fake), came late. could tell people getting tired able come 10 A.M. work 8 P.M. equal energy everyday week. I’d always point reason I’m energetic haven’t long them. Another thing helped since I’m workaholic would skip pretty much every break. So, I’d garnered favors boss. always used favors help coworkers. So, never got upset worked hard, make look little lazy, ultimately made work much easier People die CNN. American hurts it’s true.

About 50 european nations better. Plus, Sweden one [who threw stones let's really freak population conspiracy theories.

Why? “Hard times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, weak men create hard times.” Boomers sons daughters Greatest Generation- undeniably strong. 

They grew good times. Unfortunately they’re weak spent entire fragile lives projecting insecurities. general public pays price inability fucking show emotional growth. Pathetic.

If survive another 20 years they're dust wind, things going get better. think numbers sound scary say ""160,000 Americans died."" mileage may vary though.  Yeah definitely Okay, let’s approach another angle. would say end goal is, calling traitor’s incompetence? Yeah, American, can't even mad accurate fuck take.  Well, people ain't sharpest tool shed true. customer service rep two decades. true US country refuses give citizens healthcare EVEN PANDEMIC. People going bankrupt Coronavirus treatments SPEAK. feel bad country, refuse take care anyone several zeros end bank accounts. asses I’d ok killed themselves, innocent people know better choice go public school. think touching one major reasons early days official pandemic (March/April) epidemiologists infectious disease experts going back forth. masks helpful, yes, must situation - 100% effective, situations, provide protection (e.g. packed church congregation sings service)

I agree you. 

There times need people. instacart going help get groceries, sometimes need go get necessities. 

Yes - need mask. 

But - already avoiding situations anyway much possible, least greatly limiting them. mask gives people confidence act recklessly. reluctantly reported back work June gave office, rather sitting cube farm. 

I take meetings desk via Teams. Even 100% attendees building anyway, insist Teams. anyway. 

I meet one conference room - big one sits 50 - spend 30 minutes anyone. 5 people, Teams. longer meeting, Teams. I'm presenting presenters, Teams.

I wish badly Fauci make mistake clear mask policies early on. thing dislike him. Despite ample evidence saying masks good, he, anyone else explain entire ""when wear mask, avoid altogether"" - people cite lack clarity reason trusted. Uh...didn’t Europeans bring Smallpox America almost completely wiped Native Americans? Let’s forget Bubonic Plague took 60% world’s population. filthy asses last speak virus control. barely started bathing correctly centuries ago. Yes. US always begging NATO help military follies. we’re handling it, that’s problem. Yea, that's common knowledge. We're America. Land assholes home selfish. understand saying sports equivalent.

Wrong. saying compare don’t, comparing denying makes post nonsensical

The attitude towards current climate sport way sports played two different things. still getting I'll try use different example.

Imagine someone optimistically claim cases dropping Maryland, someone else make comment ""That's said Florida know turned out.""

Is person made dissenting comment claiming Maryland Florida same? According are, kinds weird. seems like certain people sub upset hot takes baseball turned cold they're looking reason lash out, whatever. ""Culture perception rather productivity"" perfectly describes cashiers american retail jobs forced stand job, even customers work front end do. want employees appear always busy customer thinks business booming quack shit like that.

From understand unique US It’s numbers. They’re societal upheaval bad approach politician’s perspective.

For every COVID-19 death far year, least 7 non-COVID deaths expected.

The number extra deaths COVID present rate small enough people won’t notice difference terms deaths versus recent years. 9-5 US meme. places best 8.5-9 hour day 30-60 minute unpaid lunch maybe 15 minute paid break thrown lucky. I'm assuming tested pulling mouth nose, giving one layer ""protection"". 

What pulled top up, pulled bottom make pocket, placed two three layers paper towel kleenex there? epidemic. Pandemi entire world, isn't. want talk celebration ignorance? top comment nearly every reddit post demonstrating skill talent variation of, “I barely even tie shoes person X!” Apparently common response celebration talent seeking confirmation mediocrity OK. fear acceptance mediocrity turns celebration, turns disdain talent. often hear kids school complain someone “ruining curve?” Hey, don’t forget one dozen people like hot wheels tv show theme Smash Mouth Absolutely.

Being American fucking embarrassing. 

We're profoundly stupid, self-entitled, arrogant country.

Can't wait leave shithole. US country refuses give citizens healthcare EVEN PANDEMIC. People going bankrupt Coronavirus treatments SPEAK. feel bad country, refuse take care anyone several zeros end bank accounts. agree everything said, including hot spots Europe take seriously right away according logic fact first. still remember interviews Italians living Spain UK saying one taking heed. happened Spain shortly realized bad was. see New York densely populated anything I've said though. made comparison all, said New York outbreak happened weeks later Lombardy one. keep living American dream think fact death rate lower US badly hit European countries guys edge God knows way want. accept edge simply knowing things would play advance experience. could done knowledge stock reorganize, could avoided entirely leadership, serious lockdown mask politics bullshit. choice believe. Lol. piece shit guy is. blame falls students showing world insanely dangerous conditions school state put in.

And throws thinly veiled threats prom spring break unless students shut tow line.

Spanish Flu (or H1N1), kill younger people second wave (I know numbers i've heard somewhere 3-5%) fatality rate probably higher Covid-19. That's different Swine Flu.

It's fair say know exactly mortality Covid, unquestionably higher 0.02%. estimates put around 0.5-1%, that's open interpretation. question... pill multiply morality? cause 0*X=Y 🤷‍♂️ hahaahahah lmao Completely agreed!

Ps come snowflake people cannot accept truth. Debate wrong instead downvoting bcoz hurts tiny ego. stating analysis showing herd immunity occurring US South.

A great thread him.

It shows LA (Louisiana Los Angeles) ""second wave"" second wave entirely areas built low immunity.

LA also great control 2 hard hit parishes (ie ones built immunity) essentially zero second wave even though right next 1 mask order nearly 7 weeks made difference.

Masks HELP number 1 reason places slow population immunity.

Using different metrics come states like Florida anywhere 15-30% population infected.

He estimated Southern States probably 15%+ infected already.

Even Trevor Bedford finally come around stating US South clearly seeing effects form partial herd immunity. Hey, 10-4 Little Buddy! checking see whether guys feel different things. I'm here, thoughts metric system?

Every developed world wants look America see tracking. taking time day enjoy gathering others large numbers schools, places worship, cinemas, parks places without fear killed armed dipshits.

This statement right reminds trump flag saw flying outside someone’s house day. Underneath it, said “No Bullshit”.

""If get Volvo, really matter many sit-ups Please enlighten me. promise won’t care say tho. Fragile inconsiderate? world suspected sometime, takes global pandemic put perspective surreal is. 

This article comes right time deal one two them. Yeah, idiots cause lot collateral damage. unlucky some. think future, people need able survive without people. 1/2000 0.05%


4% deathrate Covid cases. quite near 3% deaths/cases US. Yeah, hard conceptualize. Another way think it, 50x number Americans lost lives due covid19 compared 9/11 attack. 9/11 shocked America death destruction. Covid19 level 'destruction', deaths... scary. Get truly world class health care system, kind that'd made swede green envy, nation would still brink collapse.

Your problem lies far deeper health care system. Tell people prevent inhaling 5G. Oh that's actually terrifying.. give shit. Americans garbage. much? California tried shut down... Newsom trying keep people happy, needs put fucking foot tell people act like adults put big boy panties suck up. 

Also, many areas conservative sheriff resides, refuse enforce it. I’ve already voiced anger local sheriff said would enforce anything. Pisses off. thought fact people wont care contract disease either die become permanently debilitated themselves.

I know people family members contract end ventilators still living like 1990s covid. pandemic 5 months old, that's 20%, restrictions change daily. Point is, reliable info hard come think dismissive that. see people know believe. Yeah, know, based data. But, know certain groups immigrants extremely overrepresented regards COVID, happens pizza bakers Sweden basically 100% immigrants (first second generation). know enough bus drivers make comment. 1.5% total population get sick, 0.05% die. 

3% death rate still holds true. 
I think numbers also changed much 20％ serious cases (needs hospitalization) 15% need ICU. 

Numbers still increasing. 

How long hospitals completely overwhelmed, medical staff burnt out, non-covid people start dying due lack medical care?



...


Singapore hit 55,000 cases. That's 1% total population. gonna look like India Africa, 15% ICU cases get ICU, 20% serious cases get medical care. 

India 1.3 billion population. Africa. 

Are gonna see mutations? 

Will virus mutate faster create vaccines? talking about? That’s literally said. No, I've spent time cities seen firsthand plenty aggressive nasty homeless people. plenty well, ones run ins cops. Lol no. project manager biostatistician one vaccine candidates happening town live in, well doctor. said loosely speculating science internet fun too. Social Dominance Theory absolutely devastating, also shows lack intelligence Covid-19 amongst Americans. point people US decide Covid-19 longer life-threatening virus? see real doctor instead chiropractor. comparison, US fucked bad. even compare EU first world country. abıyt covering up, Americans handled situation worst way possible.  putting perspective. Schizophrenia airborne prevalence high 1:150 areas. Well, 4 states US beet 1 1000 mark quite bigger population Beligum. could definitively argue regions hotter.

Ny, New jersey two get article, understood harsh rules set, Italians followed them.

It leader issue, also need population accept new regulations. Driving restaurant get meal drive thru must least problems moment though, right? People need eat. looks like right could assume going one 1000 end year least. even vaccine available soon, many people would actually take it? many people fallen prey misinformation conspiracy theories, going convince Bill Gates isn’t trying microchip us? Thank service. Hopefully, give good news test results. Although, I'll shocked comes back negative. feel people ""negatively affecting"" personal Healthcare. Right now, condition requires see doctor, person, every two weeks. something get away video. office everything can, including outdoor clinic respiratory problems, case. still feel safe going place *for* sick people. Add living anti-masker heavy area, I'm ashamed say scared leave house. 

This situation US bullshit. fed assholes can't bothered think anyone themselves. could months ago little help public, competent federal response! Im guessing percentage skewed solely failed healthcare system! people wouldnt get cost incredible amount covered even doctor copays still cripple people already struggling. even top that, people waiting hours hours line tests even helpful results days later, imagine vaccine wait times. Money convenience aside, truly believe percentage would 90's readily available free like grabbing coffee. think [A Boy  danger see (uk) made masks compulsory backtracked effective measures. longer limiting numbers supermarkets, people generally distancing much. solution worse. want risk kids losing parents becoming orphans. Don’t act like care feminism. You’re trying put financial markets human lives benefits you. Stop acting like actually care happens women children. We’re stupid. Wow 0.0005%

Like 100x less deadly flu! GREAT NEWS! Yup. Right around there. bad news you, Trump 40% vote. learned lessons, great awakening. USA screwed. Fantastic book. Insanely depressing. *Good News! type mask can't buy US works great stop virus comfortable!* 6 weeks parents teachers start dying Michigan did. sources reading? making wild statements? Well lots studies expert opinions agree article worth, millennials bit young kids age old enough decide wear masks... barring teen pregnancy, course, personally expect much many situations. easy... 

Id venture guess streets trying survive worst chances survival..

Though considered taking chances woods. wouldnt last long death either reason im sure. Temporary economic shutdown? mean like bars gyms (and churches) temporarily closed inside service various states?

In case, expect certain industries may never return pre-Covid level success, others take 5 years recover (ex: cruise lines; cinemas).

Individual businesses, like Lord &amp; Taylor millions small businesses, especially bars, restaurants, gyms, shutter good (as many already have).

But replaced new bars, restaurants, gyms. Eventually. get it, GCC want kill majority-old-people congregants have?

Maybe fresh start would good... Yes no. Looking per capita values also misleading. parts Us quite ok, thus lowering per capita value. look statistics state level see way way ahead European countries.   neoliberals never let good catastrophe go waste winning? makes mad much fast internet access costs go surfing free WWW. things never happen first world country. whataboutism change that. It’s bad compared hundred years ago. Also, expecting small amount people die pandemic seems ignorantly optimistic me. 330 MILLION people country. Wouldn’t amount deaths 0.042% population? GTFO 1 every 3 Spanish Flu.

Where hear number?

You aware wrong, whoever told trusted matters more.

The mortality rate Spanish Flu actually fairly comparable Coronavirus. 🎵 Travelban🎵 NZ. Y'all fuck right off. highly counterproductive blatant lie. tell someone virus lethal 9 friends got nothing really happened, knows you´re lying. you´re lying effects, lies telling masks, distancing, etc. shocked were, given evidence coming US right US hospitals butcher shops, can't even imagine look like Mexico. totally understand go. US doctors hospitals tell hell patient US healthcare system unless member congress general Tri-Care Life. fact medieval European Jews much lower chance contracting plague lead lot antisemtisim time, even people drew (faulty) conclusions anecdotal data. course, that's plenty Jewish rituals involve cleansing hygienically preparing food, many thought Jews somehow caused plague we're immune (like shitty idea ""no Jews died 9/11"") person replied to, FAST.

- F - face drooping unmoving one half
- - one arms weak numb
- - speech slurring
- - time call emergency services

There's variant called FAST, B ""balance lost"" E ""eyesight blurry blind"" wants place bets long takes 81 year old John MacArthur die? 

What mean GCC dies? Maybe see right absolutely everything. Nah probably say ""it gods time new things store church"" new sick rich guy takes over. Instead say bunch people die ""They obviously lifestyle sin removed face earth"" I've got unfortunateness family too. 

Bitching constantly schools open, time glad daughter teach remotely. Total dissonance. ""kids need socialize kids"" giving damn kids going feel they, classmates, teacher, parents get sick suffer severe consequences die (and know probably carried in) schools going look like military refugee hospital, normal classroom. 

It stupid. call want argue it... know many times basically say ""Why trying argue us this? voting 'your guy' matter what. first election I'm voting 20 years... want. We're going stop taking precautions. happening. wasting breath make us want deal nonsense again.""

They'll survive months learning internet. might even end better. know would internet existed went school. RemindMe! 4 months california... Know people throwing parties, going las vegas, arizona, bars ect.

One friend even family member ventilator covid diagnosis STILL think kind fake conspiracy theory.

I knew people dumb damn. That's funny 1675 price bandaid hospital fewer people around. alright thank you!  lost job March got new one Friday. keep applying taking care yourself. shall pass. Good luck. worries CNN's Chris Cuomo another circlejerk brother live television  post removed. ""study"" article referencing **HASN'T RELEASED YET**. f\*\*k going write article scientific study published yet?

What load hot garbage article is, Jesus H. Christ **BBC**, used trustworthy news source. Get shite together. til 40% 60% Yeah, better expected virtue many citizens right thing shutting life bit even without government orders. can't point Sweden pretent fine nothing.  Dude hero, dont back that.  I'm italian. lived, together relatives friends, terrible months quarantine initial fear. make many sacrifices, giving ""personal freedoms"" name common welfare fellow citizens.

I live Milan, weeks worst place world, global center pandemic. Then, thanks extreme measures, extreme moment required them, able manage, way, situation.

With heavy heart witnessed country abandoned itself, general indifference: sometimes even looked on, countries Europe overseas. Now, months later, Italy seen example follow managing pandemic, bastion Western civilization, United States America, perhaps darkest moment since beginning pandemic.

But angers hubris sense arrogance transmitted highest offices state, President, rampant indifferent individualism see behavior ordinary people.

We Europeans always looked America virtuous example, country sum individuals final result, willpower allows people achieve result.

It saddens see despite weeks, months passed, chance learn first nations hit pandemic, thousands deaths, useless, point think anything could shake American people.

It great lesson anthropology, ""American exceptionalism"" par excellence. makes sad else, good people, responsible selfless, singled panic instigators, fools.

I hope lift again, experience makes stronger, human, selfless. 
Godspeed Sure cases. people monsters don’t deserve treated humanely. Serial killers torture mutilate people deserve nothing. freedom speech US actually taken seriously like imagine, protestors assaulted en masse police are. Sorry, 'American freedom speech' whole lot bluster, much substance.

FYI, even US's Cato Institute understands US laggard terms real freedom. behind New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Australia, Denmark Luxembourg, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Sweden, Netherlands, Austria, UK Estonia. Here's statistic you.. 

Tuberculosis, leading infectious cause of death worldwide. World Health Organization estimates 1.8 billion people—close one quarter world's population—are infected Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb), bacteria causes TB. Last year, 10 million fell ill TB 1.5 million died. (2019)

No one talks this. 🤷 /r/im14andthisisdeep whole country riots ofcourse begin think way superior. $400 per month wearing mask? I'm Hospitals get extra funding covid case death. think checking ""covid"" often can?

I read words, three times actually, apparently still understand message. must confess try look like scientific

I actually scientist, got master's degree chemistry-related field, worked research engineer chemistry labs years. usually results two things: 
1. Lab raising prices soon, poor people rich enough tested continue spread disease. 
2. Lab rejecting tests since supply reached cap. basically start waiting forever untested continue spread disease. RemindMe! 4 months store *finally* started requiring masks week. number times I've yelled cussed past days... I'm tired. Worse, even though ""required"", can't make anyone leave refuse. basically I'm getting yelled nothing could ignore keep putting everyone around risk. guess I'd rather get yelled tell that. Italian here, boss got March, nothing really scary, even hospitalized.

40% lungs compromised, like forever.  Don’t worry people recovered impact health systems decades well new health issues! Somehow that’s ok then? agree, still higher risk normal weight individual. Yep, way better stat. Also US classifies poor way... person symptoms died heart problem would counted corona death... However Corona linked heart problems maaany times. Indirect deaths also counted like many countries do. I’ve reached point pictures huge crowds give slight anxiety. Go strike coworkers totally get it, company we've told we're mask police. people work daily basis, ask wear masks correct way, they're so. crap scares me. claim didn't? Honestly, people making decisions required pass basic high school biology course.  I'm pretty good spot financially even I'm stressed it. change quickly. ""Keep mouth shut, head down, stay lane.""

Lol long? first two months pandemic canada prefer r/China_flu r/Coronavirus. criticize America, China, without getting downvoted hell. Plus, you’re able post something isn’t news article. Waited way long lock down. Put sick people nursing homes. Overused ventilators Well, taking Glasnost parallel further: Russia name rapidly reverting back old USSR politics way life. Yes Covid entirely different, still hopeful much learned everything gets back normal. rather, much learned, easily forgotten. really need life...oh..wait...wisconsin... explains Texan here. believe 1 5, 1 3. I'm one uninsured. I'm full-time student, job qualify coverage ACA. I'm 29 checkup 3 years. Good thing sheep wear mask! Next bit news: Hundreds worshippers sick dead COVID. 

Spoiler alert: hoax! Counter question European friends: surprised? It’s like stupid doomsday clock, reaches midnight it’s nuclear war end world. It’s either gonna happen someday it’s not. still trust numbers White House changed procedure? American lives always disposable. paying attention entire history?

This administration evil. downright disgusting shit like happening America. people go overseas cheaper healthcare. It’s issue quality. people absolutely come overseas hospitals. live near 2 best hospitals world personally seen Saudi Royals come care. 

2 seconds googling would tell this. best US hospitals best world. 5 times better USA Well South Africa we've heard stories tests public hospitals taking 3 weeks get results. disagree US one long turnaround times. exceptions everywhere. kind general rule. 

I used like kid. Still remember parents taking first WWF event kid there. Pretty sure went McDonald's too. night.

Thank you! sewing machine, graduated past 8th grade home ec level anything much complicated making pillow hemming pants (poorly). guess good time teach follow pattern! EVERY TIME hear anti-maskers get SUPER PISSED. care anti-maskers drop dead. CARE front line people risk lives keep fucking idiots alive. know healthcare workers knew risks profession. blatant disregard everyone's safety, callous attitude burden jerks putting everyone else, especially healthcare workers, risk signed for. removed comment said people deserve empathy? Wtf. fuck even mod dude? I’m talking parents making decisions, schools. I’m privy school board school administrator’s decision-making processes don’t know made decisions (and it’ll probably vary state/city/district). 

But I’ve talked lot parents recently really struggling decision school — want kids anyone else get sick, know much kids struggling isolation.

So many kids struggling emotionally/mentally, places therapy still telehealth appointments... really ideal you’re trying build rapport new client, talk client sensitive topic want see facial expressions/body language discussion, assess whether self-harm serious enough merits medical attention, help client deal feelings isolation “Zoom fatigue” present virtually them, etc.

Impossible, no, hard, I’ve seen many kids struggling. big question deal mental health risks keeping everyone’s physical health safe. link that? heard before. Terrifying There's evidence children spread virus dude. Zero evidence. Like, show scientific, peer reviewed studies data showing kids spread virus. Show evidence bro. evidence. can't show evidence, show peer reviewed papers evidence, leg stand schools open. evidence.



I'm taking piss idiots keep saying ""there's evidence"" comes kids schools btw. tried make obvious.  do. 

Our politicians get regularly tested, paid wazoo, get go back multi million dollar homes average America’s evicted, face real consequences thing don’t care. ""People areas community mindset rarely seen anyone outside family say church gathering.""

Now know probably feels like someone LA NY someone nowhere Iowa says raped robbed within minutes entering either cities.

What said insanely stupid. know US best hospitals world, right? wrong. thing I’m general one spend time trying follow something like up. USA labs profit industries fucking certainly profit... Again, solvable problems right resources.

And politician actively making case invest billions making sure everyone's needs met.

This bootstrap individualism cruel vindictive. Precisely. said since thing started. tall order! Humans awful. I'm calling names. I'm saying, everyone meet life ""crazy"", perhaps actually *you* crazy. birthday Wednesday mom (61) wants come visit.

Almost every nation non-muslim world significant deinking culture. North America, every culture notorious drinking. Tell never heard Irish/Russians/Mexicans/Australians/Koreans. Go Latin America see many old dudes drinking rum shooting shit buddies street corner noon. Go France watch ten-year-olds wine supper. Every culture drinks people fucking drink, American experience another country would think otherwise. fact, experience, teetotalling stigmitising drinking probably stronger states country I've to. See, short bus education paid off. read. Mommy daddy low bar hopes now. We're still waiting see whether Sweden actually suffer worse countries result actions. european nations really place throwing stones yet? agree, fully. really massive protests throughout city (keep mind high mask compliance every protest attended saw), spike. there's question masks + staying outside + general awareness (hand sanitizer, touching things etc) working. shit thing many parts country can't even get board masks. stretch maybe obese people higher probability death?

There's lot institutional knowlege would get lost term limits. whole shitshow happening Amateur hour America right now. living constantly appalled random shit? suspend kid eating pop tart shape gun, helpless require masks? Ah, yes, typical flu season carry 20% Medicare add-on payment identified flu. Unlike past flus, one does: instances NY adding 4k deaths ""probable"" single day: labeled graph.

When take sorts incentives shenanigans account, bad flu season. even was, comfortable writing 162,000 needless deaths? Thats still 162,000 deaths TOP FLU.

No, isn't, numbers quoted ""Covid19, pneumonia, Except it’s vastly clear grump way he’d go full authoritarian Well, yeah.

Is America fucked right now, lack education virus? anything Newtown, amount dead babies change anything. say thing comparing America countries. People want point places saying ""they better"". 

Comparing US Sweeden/New Zealand/South Korea/Japan/ect like comparing orange fish. Edwards going divorce, sister died April. Either event would incur heavy psychological toll own, pandemic made almost unbearable: single mother two, also helps care father, also trying figure approach education kids. Money tight, can’t find full-time work. 

Going well graduate student got fucking hard. dad died April I’m starting PhD next week. couldn’t imagine children also going divorce. Damn, really puts perspective sure 😣 agree, think good (ish?) news seem likely schools stay open long enough produce big effect. least done ""correctly,"" rules state ""At least 2 cases linked together school, different classrooms"" lead whole school closing. can't imagine schools hit mark soon.

Stay strong dear, read comments, quit social media turn devices, fine. pioneer leader so. everyone jealous clear minded success. poorly thought ""retorts"" lack sources, credibility, authenticity, semblance decency dime dozen reddit. simply care enough think comment response.

It literally misinformation hoax conspiracy page related covid-19. irony regarding shitty sources credibility palpable. sorts straws drawing ""prove they're lying"". fatalities
On 27 March 2020, doubts raised accuracy Chinese data relating official death toll 2,535 Wuhan Chinese news outlet Caixin published photos truck unloading 2,500 boxed funeral urns arriving Hankou funeral home 3,500 boxed funeral urns inside Jingya Hall""

You cannot fucking sincere. window opportunity? virus coming contact others disinfection bs show. wish people would understand fooled. add more, tested long virus lives various surfaces lab. Plastic (petri dishes), cardboard, cloth, coppe, etc. virus lived 4 hours think 72 hours. issue used high viral load tests. order replicate read world, believe people would highly infectious cough/sneeze directly petri dish mulitple times.  exactly real world conditions. 

But also take issue formite. experts say see formite trasmission. contact tracers say impossible trace. bit catch-22.  day 3, school back. Tegnell’s approach started internationally spilled Sweden’s national debate June

This line kinda horrifying shows massive issue Swedish culture. wasnt untill international media started critizise Sweden Swedes go somewhat critical.

Swedes tendencies follow goverment, questions asked, direct reason allowed go far. least 86 children died since May, according new report. Last week, 7-year-old boy pre-existing conditions became youngest coronavirus victim Georgia. Florida, two teenagers died earlier month bringing state's death toll minors seven. 

What say parents? everyone fear mongering? Na, keyboard warrior instead empath. Hi everyone, I'm getting tested two days live boyfriend got tested couple days ago negative results, I've worst cycle chills/ fever/ feeling normal/ repeat 2 3 times day (3 days point) pounding headache. smell taste fine, also extreme lack appetite slight nausea. anyone else tested positive symptoms like especially first? Thank much help/ advice idea else ask. Sadly, really unstoppable US. can't even agree wear masks. far past point lockdown though. imagine size protests/riots would happen one mandated would dwarfabything previously seen. hardcore trump supporting relative. shes argued would rather pay 600$/month health insurance pay 300$/month extra taxes doesnt want pay peoples healthcare. Nono looking wrong. year there's surely 1000 people dead (trust me, know) Democrats instead tell dead corona numbers look worse trump get reelected. cousin best friends neighbours dog died toe cancer told corona! Wake up, sheep!

/s case Didn’t someone get shot death one places daring ask customer wear one? people die cardiovascular disease, cancer diabetes yet headlines mention much. kids need socialize! reopen schools!!

/ way also virus though. 

I understand maybe recession incoming, still would happened, seen economic charts have, current economic crisis makes 2008 look like playdate. 

Sure, caveat numbers, think unreasonable pin excess deaths virus.  helps India Africa population younger less obese. Regarding healthcare, probably disadvantage... Another talk herd immunity ignores key things.

1: Immunity binary concept. graduated levels immunity. individuals “herd”

2: misinform number people New York example gotten it. say nowhere close half New Yorkers immunity.That isn’t true. 1 5 showing antibodies months ago. every one shows antibodies tests, two R cell reactivity. sensitivity antibody tests set high avoid false positives, antibodies wane time well, light cases might result enough antibodies made picked test. means almost certainly half New Yorkers immune now. haven’t even considered cross immunity different coronaviruses.

I like NPR’s coronavirus coverage usually, one mess. here. I’m Berlin. many people paying lip service wearing mask – either it’s mouth loose it’s useless – packed beaches lakes. Packed bars. Packed shops. numbers going back really worry we’ll back lock-down soon people work places closed people damn selfish wear mask keep socially distanced... That's works. look evidence high levels child-child child-teacher transmission schools find little evidence it, whilst finding evidence adult-adult adult-child transmission, suggests something different happening regards transmission children. occasionally get kick fact called 'United' States. seen much unity lifetime. Maybe immediately following 9/11. Intellectually dishonest headline much? ""At point"" bro we've heard since March. reopen fully right now. don’t matter? Except cars get safer every year spend millions dollars man hours researching so, reduce preventable deaths. I’d also say choose eat choose eat junk makes sick, fault anyone. Much different people walking around spreading virus. eating trash hurts you. See it’s even valid comparison? think things cause death too, ignore Covid let kill millions people, *when could prevent this*???? matter though? Maybe people COVID, still died it. know average 160 people IRL, need talk maybe 20 find know someone died Covid (assuming people know know intersect, like 12 talk people different social circles. Alternatively, could talk 12 random strangers one might know someone died Covid). act surprised? come? Looking outside here. us collective ""WTF?""

Your called leaders tried murder. addition, taking serious look education system cultural atmosphere led large amounts people still calling hoax far line. People dying reduces CO2 emissions, think pretty much figured sure typo much Freudian slip. Seeing lot people suspiciously close coming saying Coronavirus OK kills older people Vietnam War did. invited good friends wedding I'm horrifed idea telling can't come really want leave house. 55% specific type population. Small sample size. Hard broad strokes everyone tested positive. Definite concerning though. bad now, imagine situation winter comes around dont get shitshow control. lot people reddit tent take raw statistics make unsubstantiated conclusions based them. Like Canadian living Australia, like really astonished secretly surprised dumpster fire United States. witness variety stupidity living next tops list.

Like, international travel Australia shut talking years anything possibly opens sad family cannot come visit.

Apparently Americans fly wherever Frick want infect new country different parts beloved Canada (several outbreaks caused Americans traveling Canada whatever reason) without repercussions.

I know Americans dumbasses friends many God damn. hell country shut shit solved?

Jesus. dead virus. That's factual.

Whether dead virus debatable. could argued they're dead societal reaction virus, something control over. people risk getting virus. people need work can’t afford to. Many can’t afford buy they’re PPE it’s incredibly expensive government failing supply it. Plain simple, government doesn’t care poor people. Thanks! blessing, amount support I'm finally getting. Fuck social media, Reddit truth...I trying reach sooner.

Thanks again! appreciate kind words love! We're tanking, gotta get high draft pick! Yeah I'd much rather take $5k year wear mask. Mo money mo problems man Eagle1, world still turning, people still working, things progressing. I'm happy someone/something target frustrations sake suggest leave cause behind, taking you. Would blindly take *vaccine* rushed trials unprecedented rate? 1 every 3 Spanish Flu.

Absolutely not, estimated one third population got infected, one third died. fatality rate best 1 every estimated one third world's population (or ≈500 million persons) infected clinically apparent illnesses (1,2) 1918–1919 influenza pandemic. disease exceptionally severe. Case-fatality rates compared &lt;0.1% influenza pandemics (3,4). Total deaths estimated ≈50 million (5–7) arguably high 100 million 


Moreover, evolution pandemic linear (virus mutate become deadlier harmless, people wear masks, vaccine found), extrapolating comparing final count make sense. [weekly fatality rate Spanish looks like example.

We could compare Spanish Flu COVID-19 over, otherwise we'd comparing part pandemic complete one, makes sense.

After all, Spanish Flu looked pretty harmless back September 1918.

Sure ancestors went lot, made mistakes know react. suffered learned lot children suffer badly case happens again.

Let's reproduce errors hoping outcome different time. air quality, given enclosed space, far better average classroom. Ventilation high-grade filters. joke. Classroom air quality definitely joke. classrooms unbearable without opening window door. well-designed.

Good air quality prevents spread gather. mask prevents spread gather.

I know getting idea air filtering improvement help prevent spread. disputing claim, source studies? still wear N95 public. Fuck people. Specifically. Ignorant Americans. common flu collective name various virusses yes coronavirusses. dominant one influenza virus, corona virus yet belongs kingdome Orthornavirae. make visible, rainworm humans belong kingdome animalia, yet obvious same.

 believe confusion existance two facts.

In general, common flu used influenza virus. believe covid19 virus anywhere close influenza virus. want mind-bending, current world-wide death toll enough make country Iceland unpopulated landmass approximately twice over. risk people child care quite remarkable 

Understandable moved activities outside since march. French Revolution didn’t help France. Even ignoring deranged thing say (so OK 61 year olds die en masse?), source uses data Italy, China, Spain, Korea make conclusion. 3% death rate still mostly cases underestimated. Real number somewhere around 0.5-1%, still scary fuck. America != Humanity whole  course not, loud obnoxious coping mechanism idiots can't stand thought they're severely average. 
That literally report says even Swedish authorities spin it. 

Schoolteachers literally 10% average. Compared teachers difference even significant:

- School teachers (no distance teaching) +10%
- Gymnasium teachers (distance teaching) -30%
- Kindergarten teachers (no distance) -30%

If kids don’t spread virus grown ups school teachers 40 percentage points Gymnasium teachers?

And also 40 percentage point difference preschool teachers?

A likely conclusion apart youngest, kids seems spread virus comparably adults. I'm pretty confident there's political agenda behind study somewhere. IMO place politics science. obscure truth. 

That said, investigated myself, statement opinion based assumption. It’s tough take things one day time. wake tomorrow, you’ll breath lungs, family friends call, food eat, water drink. know seems crazy, that’s many people earth have. Things turn around. fully aware irony conversation online, stay social media while. There’s lot good also lot negative stuff too. Focus make day better, yourself, someone care about. Hang there! Absolute legend. Plus even like Canada handled particularly well. sensible things failed less hard everybody else. Many clusters traced bars drinks parties. 

In church it’s least feasible people stay 6’ apart masked entire time. Especially cut psalm singing, church low-risk activity ones take place indoors. 

Not low-risk food shopping, say, you’re church longer near people longer. still, far lower risk bars, indoor restaurants, flying (three things Dr Fauci said personally won’t due time being). 200,000 deaths year (so far) previous years.

do source ? wrong.

 *if time, time*.

I'm sad anything else. low-income, low-prestige jobs predominantly staffed immigrants.

These people less money rest population often possibility practice effective due living condition.

Or short : pizza baker arrived Syria 2015 spacious housing cabin woods.

Idk Sweden, f.e. Amsterdam taxi drivers Moroccans Denmark hanging Arabs running literally bakeries. Americans anything avoid using metric system totally disagree people saying ""everything covid"". problem many them.  dont go say ""you can't live fear!"" Theres mom pop store 1/2 hour lost 22 customers covid. think that's lot America breeds assholes Pizza bakers, could working together small area high temperature lot steam subpar ventilation, sweating wiping face lot? Yeah, even 2018 1 every 200 Americans alive beginning 2018 died mid death rate 723.6 per 100,000 
= 1 every 138 every year. 
138 * 12/8 = 200) assure you, nobody life would ever consider going information viruses pandemics, assume nobody internet wants listen either. stupid, truly, forget that. glad local school district distant learning. Even weren’t, wouldn’t send children. They’d send sheriff come arrest even wouldn’t let go. sure, dumb also go around infecting rest us, that’s need herd immunity. look happened anti-vaxxers measles outbreak California. guy like 8 months, compared likely multiple decades alive non mask wearing world... statement also true:

COVID-19 deaths (which loosely defined criteria) account 0.05% American population Tbf, swedes absolutely nothing except tell people keep distance wash hands. sure Americans worse off. 
You normally buy US. suppose mean currently product shortages. Hey get toilet paper market rolled sandpaper whole make uncomfortable masks There's woman town recovered it, assistant radio station fairly lively bubbly person. 

Saw last week, walking aid stick, trembling looking stiff breeze would knock over. Apparently also dialysis rest life gets new kidney... go /r/conservatives sub ..they argue day favor village west virginia voting power new york city..   Florida COVID denier. original. IFR 0.5%, 70% people infected, around 1 285 people die.  
If virus contained, seemingly be, figure inevitable. retarded shit majority detainees criminal record held pending hearings misdemeanor illegal entry. previous administrations processed, assigned hearing date, released recognizance add appeared court dates rate order 90%. Trump Administration shifted resources personnel away apprehension violent criminals gang members toward massive increase misdemeanor arrests. implemented ""metering"" high-traffic ports entry, intentionally reducing slowing entry asylum processing order create bottleneck Mexican side border. Emigrants refugees traveled hundreds miles specifically enter lawfully US ports entry waited weeks, sleeping sidewalks makeshift camps, US border agents slow-walked processing, forcing emigrants asylum seekers choose turning back depleted resources risk crossing illegally. chose cross, quickly arrested waiting agents redeployed specifically detain manufactured surge people crossing illegally. 
Fast-forwarding, 40% current immigration detainees arrested inside US borders. balance arrested CBP border. Roughly 25% detainees asylum seekers determined credible fear persecution. also would released previous administrations, detained year pending hearings ruling.  
This barely scratches surface, course; children still held detention centers parents await hearings, one famous example. Thousands people detention centers result Trump Administration policies specifically designed create completely artificial immigration crisis facing unnecessary incarceration pandemic crowded poorly-managed private facilities. Locals dealing effects community transmission well uncontained infection amounts large coronavirus incubator. Many facilities small towns rural areas conservative regions South Desert Southwest; meaning nontrivial number people bearing double brunt Trump's cruelty lassitude cast votes Trump 2016 precisely *because of* lassitude cruelty. Ironic.


[The Cruelty attitude top 'it is' expect? Countries led example. county live in, Creek County Oklahoma, population around 71k people scattered across 970 square miles land. Imagine walking 2k square miles land meeting one person time. would creepy hell. many excess deaths that? figure? think late U.S.A. 

Population large much division. 

Only way ends tears, hope U.S.A come together common good see happening. course, real number twice that. people need reassurance things going get *back normal*.

Regrettable, things tend exacerbate *months* *no touchy*.

So, Sturgis bike week thing..and boy, article midwestern fuck.

Good luck there! Wear fucking mask. people streets living boxes filth, starving exhausted prefer job? think idea what's going there.   

Typical brainwashed capitalist. feel same.I come sub filter good news let's honest real good news.""Some biologist discovered sth might work future"".It's depressing. Exactly. Currently, government belongs jail mass murder. Every one people shirked responsibilities held accountable deaths. Penn State fans fans cult lol Thank you. many people would died would died infected covid not. 


The average age death much greater covid average age death. think 8 years? imagine Disney wont fun year. going reckless least socially aware crowds people trying stand line rides shit. Oh, shitty kids.

All people would hold door open staying home, consider go disney. think speaking generally considering world overall, I'd say we've finally started taking seriously part. vast majority countries flouting rules more-or-less best can, given situation.

However countries like US Brazil setting us back themselves. good work done countries Taiwan, New Zealand, Malaysia, China (eventually) etc countered situation US Brazil. Fuck grandma, even make trendy desserts put instagram. things related virus. Hard enjoy almost everything life costs money...free time nice guess. Boredom love/hate relationship book. Sometimes love shit also hate anything do. i'm interested conversation someone grant zero leeway opposition grant indefinite number *years* hopes become ""true point"". ridiculous. 1 2000 sounds much worse one twentieth percent could know, actually protect people don’t get infected. wait symptomatic? 40-50% people infectious show symptoms. people end showing symptoms, don’t show days started becoming infectious. Wearing mask doesn’t hurt anything. Doctors, surgeons, nurses emts would dropping dead like flies last century did.

Why invested idea masks harm people? think you’re weenie doesn’t like wearing mask lift drink Mountain Dew eat Oreos. I’ll take compliment ! 10/10 comedic relief. Thing is, virus appears slow mutating. normal virus (flu instance) would’ve seen new strain taking expected value isn’t equivalent two options, given variance outcomes.  feeling America would selfish part hoping pull together beat this. unfortunately America divided beliefs politics one people saying masks way oppressed. hate everyone can't put beliefs side try work together help one another care. America selfish greed. think likely wrong That's said amendment would needed.  explain point well. uncontrolled pandemic global issue. Right Europe strong considerate. Mother fuckers please. Sure flaws, like country, people around world dying covid, America, less logistically active places too. world always dying put us place, especially lately. However, nothing's changed still political, economic military powerhouse, despite biased media (and Reddit) may believe. Well first there’s infinitely different travel baseball. College football travel way. arent checking city nightlife travel away game. It’s locked that’s way even without COVID. 


Secondly, correct able bubble amateurs. That’s real issue here. need pro sports solutions want operate amateur league. either remain amateurs cancel season season conceded money power players. NCAA appears going former backfire severely.  education intelligence, ethical problem, too. Americans, rich poor, taught f you, got mine birth. No, blocked front entrances first row two busses 3-4 months ago. article trash. It’s baiting. ‘Many Europeans asking...’ dude stop. us US sick shit show following protocols months. Don’t analyze low % idiots general representation. don’t like team either! stop. give fuck. lots them. 

Please don’t confuse Orange Guys twitter Karen’s FB post majority us. many(what's percentage)? ""An european?"" sure educated usa?

 


""90% europeans would kill opportunity move america""

Fucking lol numbers including antibody tests, nevertheless going Take bank? That's great point - *got lucky*. 

Other commentators fail realize think they're successful ""it's hard work, work harder lazy millennials!"" I've lucky enough able travel internationally times, even got spend 6 months living France, experiences would love leave country finish PhD. really wish put effort learning another language kid, right really struggle limits options.

Edit: impact flu varies, places substantial burden health people United States year. CDC estimates influenza resulted 9 million – 45 million illnesses, 140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations 12,000 – 61,000 deaths annually since 2010.


We don’t close entire country flu. came say two exact words. 


Unless disinfect humans (and no, injecting bleach count), help all. Hey that’s me! where? money leave? never said did. majority immigrants countries US responsible destabilizing outright overthrowing. I’m side. fuck get here?! can’t afford pick move civilized parts US. Moron continues moronic. show much hates everyone like upcoming election.  many kids, college football last, best chance escape lifetime poverty. Generally, states manage themselves. problem pandemic requires federal logistics intervention. would like difference house fire hurricane. China responded pulling 80,000 doctors around nation respond hot spots. local program handle response needed. apparent early example Jared Kushner made head national testing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Keep mind Jared Kushner mucked national testing program believed probably would restricted democratic regions governors would get blamed. Trump wants pass blame blamed anything does. states also told federal government seizing PPE reselling highest bidders. Massachusetts brought TV crews state police airport prevent PPE seized plane loaded PPE landing one airports. Remember 5 years ago Obama warned America oncoming pandemic 5-10 years time? Fast forward today, Trump says one saw coming. America truly fucked. thing enough spacing indoor environment. Turn fan AC fucked...no matter facility, particularly closest ducts. extended family similar situations worry going regular. tough time everyone, sure stay house months need rice every night. That's waaaay tougher kids. American sgree intentions said, American accounts 60% consumer good sales world. Provides large amount world's food, building supplies more. wouldnt work also American needed keep China bay. American needs fix self pretty doesn't. Reddit formatting sucks series number one line convey information well, upset it

Btw, need either add two spaces press enter twice end line line breaks work *Amazing!

Point gun someone they’re suddenly longer hungry... weird... Agreed - bray think rights are, they're usually wrong. Well, change fact structural changes happening weeks really matter kids think. 

The NCAA saying decades (the players) think matter going change 2 week frame open liability.

The players free organize play games themselves, really say university decides. ZORRO NO!!!! How? Fox News President encouraging people take drug useless. 

I fail see that's ""political"" feelings hurt. Everyone trying take cut. worse ripping someone retail store? worse hospitals do? Insurance? Car companies? Oil &amp; gas? accountant avoid paying taxes?

You seem operating premise career choices ripping someone. I'm completely misunderstanding point. American men fucking pussies. 

-American man fuck comments? Sports done safely absolutely priority. No, save world. us love screaming TV blow stress, important. facing unemployment eviction way millions others are. think mess ends 21 hours day instead 24, I'll take it. mental health 

The famous grit American people, ladies gentlemen. edit college applications MBA programs side job, applicants seem sincerely interested social-impact projects, others clearly focused making much money possible reducing headcounts automating. Biden wins nothing change underlying system less neol*beral (which hard imagine, one), worried 2024 monster run him. Cotton, Hawley, Carlson ready wreck think will. Rutgers practically whole football team get sick isn’t surprise. much else except obviously. catch covid pass elderly mother dies, chalk statistic.

I zero fear coronavirus. However want every minute mother prudent sake. corrupt admin top bottom. good actors play, overwhelmed others. modern American past time complaining bitching super effective politicians keeps us anything blame problem. sad brilliant, keep entire country full opinionated uneducated morons arguing itself, deal directly. sicko percentage population cool that. Venn diagram non-mask wearers Trump supporting scum giant circle Near enough

No need fat shaming though they're making statements based data patient observations talking ass There’s set percentage herd immunity anyone know ever even seen white supremacist, according Reddit every corner causing every problem world blamed directly Trump.  Americans like people getting anything free. Therefore, keep public restrooms dirty humiliating possible.

One way another... *are* going pay. 

Because otherwise, *Communism.* front-runner Heissman, practically guaranteed Pro career, played us anyway could make millions, I'll never see penny. owe meeeeee... So, obviously saying that, hate life don’t care live anymore. Well, getting sick couldn’t infect anyone else is, virus spreads people’s life could putting jeopardy. almost like international media geared towards making us look bad.

Our death count fine. I'm unique position could hermit least year. Groceries delivered, toiletries delivered, home gym, work home, nearby nature.

Everyone speak ""we can't hide forever"" shuts say fact hide long need to. ""people need work""; well, *am* working fact I'm working efficiently now.

I realize apply people can't wfh otherwise less fortunate.

But shatters argument. Sweden one highest COVID-19 fatality rates planet.

It looks pretty lousy anyone virus denier filled nationalist fervor. sad keep reading country denying facts face severe situation created first place. spiraling control point. I'm impression. know right wrong. wrong too. think that's fair valid explanation simply strengthening argument bad They’ll look weak can’t breathe own.  Holy shit, wish parent. Almost situation instead severely punished. Eventually confidence got low send child psychiatrist understand stopped participating entirely school. punished therapy ""the right way"". Wrong. BEST thing economy sacrifice working class cant work/die/are let go.. scoop houses pennies dollar... happens like every 10-12 years insane blind people it. Ive watched WHOLE STREETS get bought up. Hell moved Vegas manage flips guy exclusively type thing. He'd buy whole streets... context.. sold highest value piece land vegas ever.. bought recession. Hes RED multi-multi-multi millionaire. I'd surprised actually multi billionaire better hiding real money.. plan. get kicked houses/ can't afford it.. play catchup lost us never able this. They'll come in, they'll scoop grandmas house cause can't afford work risk dying anymore.. rent us later... 


Please note obvious sarcasm saying ""BEST"" economy.


Also edited add.. we'll feeling way longer years.. going cripple industries. happens contractors small home improvement things cant find work homeowners literally can't afford fix it? We'll always need houses fixed matter noone afford house anymore. that's going get even worse contractors cant fix houses go spend money... going fuck many people anyone realizes. people go Sturgis apparently. Wear them. They're big deal. help, great, help, big loss wearing them.
 
Basically different seatbelt. really worry car crashes, still wear seatbelt not? get point I'd like disagree wording, content.
 
Compared many southern eastern neighbours, Germans seem formal, distant, boring, bland, maybe even cold. IMHO they're bit quiet inhibited take time come level socializing others. they're social well (even party animals), especially there's good role models countries ;)   took COVID-19 reveal that, haven’t paying attention. fragility inconsiderate demeanor obvious long time. Hahahahaha better calm down, that's bulling that's crime there.. Fucking pussies. Anyone care anymore? mental health destroyed pandemic, I've turned two job opportunities barely afford pay bills. marriage suffered greatly this. I've turned seeing many people, even outside. 

A neighbor mine came wearing mask yard work wearing mask. brief conversation standing two feet away me. He's nurse I'm surprised he's relaxed. normally would make freak next week dont care anymore. think may stop reading sub too. Huh, 39-30 year old millennials screwed, opinion? Millennials range 24-39 (1981-1996), discounting experiences majority millennials.

I'm glad experience, fiance's experience positive one. experience, wife's experience, also positive.

However, I'm asshole realize millions millennials lucky, privileges did, successful. work hard, got shit end stick.

Don't ass discount people's struggles ""iT WoRkeD mE"" handful people travel India USA   I'm bit dramatic I'm sure plenty parents like that. Ones half joking needing dump kids school. Ones serious various reasons (kids annoying demanding, parents work childcare options, etc). pissy single people blamed singles still going out.

Over 9 million kids access internet home.

The kids could bring virus home parents grandparents, making huge second wave.

Millions kids rely school food programs eat.

They make kids wear masks...

We really fucked. I'm saying best solution, Europe seems better. Split days kids social distance, force kids wear masks.... solutions sense make work one person comes country. starts again. Revealed? Similarly japan quite well social structure (not much body contact, among others), many southern european countries hit hard social structures (old people live closer families, close body contact social norm).

Okay, I'm first call whataboutism appropriate, context, here, outcomes Republican-lead sections Democratic states. makes sense also discuss Democratic-lead sections Republican states since contrast implied mean massive outbreak Florida Governor interferes local politics lifts restrictions local governments put place?

That's much better way respond. Actually Americans killed military operations 9/11 9/11 missed Mt. Rushmore stories ? Well *that* helped fact opponent one obviously corrupt fake politicians history. Yeah it’s pretty cringe seeing everyone reddit say perfect Democratic Party republicans bad people. know terrible people sides, government messed decades  US government decided experiment children educational staff. 

Our legislatures people seem largely OK sacrificing children, families, school staff lives collectively less important profits.

This according Schumer every goon insists reopen economy. wish could lose hair places. school weird. went high school podunk Appalachia, popular kids top class (except me, 10th grade). Oddly, school, intelligence correlated social skills (hence wasn’t popular 10th grade). also think one reason might’ve attractive girls class also smartest girls class, boys tried harder since values intelligence. dumb kids popular, popular could drink house. time people got upset smart really pedantic, that’s kind always is.

College though, similar you. Multiple professors hated intelligence things actually knew didn’t. never challenged them, way knew knew something didn’t I’d start talking asking questions kinda figured they’d know it. one professor really went way show smarter me. Idk why, asked lot questions, never challenged her. questions always something like, “How connect situation?” went office hours ask questions stimulants. Oh wait, actually went never showed up, set appointment 40 minutes late. knew cocaine didn’t exactly work identically reputake inhibitors, asking knew different hypothesis correct. looked said, “Oh, wow, really haven’t paying attention you? don’t know you’ve gotten far known reuptake inhibitors work. go back reread chapter 3, come back.” looked explained reuptake inhibitors worked, said, “I didn’t ask reuptake inhibitors worked, asked cocaine could different. actually humiliating. I’m sorry I’ve done something offend you. I’m trying challenge learn, I’m gonna leave now, I’ll quiet rest class.” said, “Thank you,” walked out. also think graded tests harder, always went test TA, I’d argue answer right like three questions, he’d always like, “Yeah. mean, isn’t something know level, know you’re right, I’ll count right.” liked me. one professor entire time instead trying get look bad, promoted ask questions (she actually told wanted make underachievers feel bad they’d work harder). However, one however many had. got tired neuro professors wanting prove smarter students (which again, never tried challenge anyone, assumed they’d know would ask questions, part did, it’s they’d always get self conscious upset knew one thing didn’t), ultimately, that’s ended pursuing J.D. instead neuro Ph.D. least law school, want challenge them.  Americans say same. :( opposed what? fragile considerate? 


Ohnoes Europeans going look us yet another thing. Whatever shall do?


Lets generalize large nation peoples. trick. prophetic *already* well course 1995. What's astonishing since 1995 - 25 years! - many people anything trends.

I think ppl born trends remember something better, think reality &amp; we're denial erosion. young people coming age never seen different Reaganomics-minded society handing literally everything value (including labor, time, rights, thoughts) Wealthy Few, quite rightly ask ""WTF?"" reasonably demand alternatives. correct sentence may ever read reddit. music choice early 2000 bubblegum pop. couldn’t remember lyrics read good song love bass. Missing Jason right now... Oh no. That’s truly terrifying. think meant ""treating."" bossest move take bath nap, yo. Calling traitors incompetence exclusively good thing. It’s like opposite hysteria War Worlds caused 1938. Back then, fictitious radio show could send people frenzied panic without even trying. Now, people skeptical seeped agenda actual alien invasion could happen wouldn’t believe anuses personally violated ten inch probe. even then, they’d apt call hoax. going fluctuate that’s new norm it’s control don’t 50k + cases maybe 200 across Canada Go look many 18-22 year olds w/ zero pre-existing conditions died COVID. I’m sorry staying alive COVID health college aged male isn’t difficult.

secondly, “starting talk permanent heart defects” isn’t strong evidence players would worry recovery. provide stronger evidence would open listening extremely vague “people saying” statements aren’t evidence. 

But even take away, doesn’t change comment people extremely important issue life changing implications. you’re incapable least seeing question capacity empathy all. Ars article particular?

A bunch people think hoax(no clue why)

And others think real want inconvenienced wearing mask(i hear people complain breathing them). see lot people walking around nose sticking mask, hanging chin wearing mask all. 

Theres also bunch us socially distancing terrified covid going loved ones people can't bother wear mask public. us Americans well, we're frustrated angry watching burn idiots.

Some us watch hopelessly. I'm high risk COVID &amp; I'm also high risk flu fun combo immune suppression lung disease. thinking high-risk individuals COVID, please continue think us future comes getting seasonal flu shots. personally appreciate every single person gets flu shot. I'm Vancouver Island I'm grateful maybe get 1 2 cases per week. Based folks playing volleyball multiple nights week, sans masks, neighborhood bar, apparently answer yes. whatever call it, broke it. ""elbow fiving"" stop people breathing other. Also BC. Disappointed happening (remember dude Kelowna went packed lake? Cheers, buddy! dude threw houseparty DT Van day?), inevitable, happening everywhere world right now. BC still good; going 20 cases per day 45-50 terrible, but, yeah, feel you. People won’t stop rioting R/americabad fail prevent Trump, delivered us Trump. Americans do, Government doesn't. care citizens die. Im starting okay this. people die cheaper next house going be.

Thank traveling. travel coronavirus guidelines? potential vector disease?  wife immigrants. Europe. got green card already planning leave country. People crazy here. decided reverse public health mandates cases low, inevitably resumed behaviours spread disease back started. Everything politicized people now.

Wearing mask somehow become political. Shaming people become political. People even claim virus politically involved (doesn't spread BLM protests)

The reality virus care human beliefs. spreads airborne particles infect without regard human attitudes opinions. Sweden: guys trying herd immunity experiment too? Alright, high-five!

Texas: What's herd immunity? American exceptionalism, arrogance, ignorance, whatever else. think school districts pass plans state it’s approved. 

I neither kids ever public school I’m nobody’s judge. 

It’s going end poorly everyone imo whole shitshow going upend American economics treated, many people die. God gaslit, sigh, sorry mom it, I'd think that'd enough spout false media stuff, whatever.

CFR rate deaths per actual confirmed cases. people who've diagnosed Covid-19 consequently met maker. 

Now problem Covid-19, know, immediately obvious got it. ton people know. So, course, they're confirmed. 

We guess 30 50 percent cases asymptomatic (not showing symptoms). article shows, know actually pass on. 

So need IFR get closer truth. number tries estimate TOTAL number people ACTUALLY infected. bigger number. Probably much bigger. 

So CFR takes number confirmed infections (say 350,000) number deaths (say 17,500 sake ease) goes ""Fuck, 5% people dying this!""

But actual fact (as IFR shows), number people infected actually 700,000 (because half infected people know it) rate death actually 0.25%. Becayse 17,500 dead added to, since cause death always death certificate test Covid. 

TLDR medical officials missing Covid-related deaths, they're definitely missing cases it. CFR gives concrete number based statistics higher, causing alarm. IFR takes well educated guess much larger number cases shows disease deadly thought.

Dollar stores lucky customers wearing pants (or skirts, etc). Good luck requiring masks! Midwesterner moved back 24 years living south, I’d say that’s valid observation. SMH. MAGA folks going epic meltdown truth lot college football players never lives high-probability multi-million dollar opportunity getting recruited pros.

I think COVID serious risk, doesn’t exist vacuum. Staying poor whole life lifelong disability too.  Agreed. better mental health too. Brits flooding Greece lately. year ~1/80th average American's life. Personally I'm kinda okay understand people want sacrifice that. Also people actually expect year point? mean kids become infertile long-lasting effect COVID? thanks. smoker....hence issues Hey, like said, thank right end equation trying make things better actions. Totally support it. Thanks noticing. :) They're going bring virus home them. I'd imagine good number bikers small communities. community virus now. Yes idiot, cause totally flu like scenario. send them. job require send somewhere? worked insurance company (medical vehicle) I'd writing license plate numbers could raise rates thru fucking roof (or deny coverage together) CLEARLY plague rats huge liability. pretty well documented limited impact mask is. still unknown makes difference countries low fatality rate countries high fatality rate.

So, makes difference?

If would provide answer would qualify Nobel prize. wait two weeks follow story cluster cases. fucking reverend listening Gods orders. fucking kidding me, God talking screaming ear"" service fucking idiot"". would God want needlessly kill people? Whomever downvoted doesn’t reddit enough understand. Pay mind. ffs include tents hundreds It’s funny cause take away parties fun, left “education.” Makes realize education ain’t expensive all, one would continually pay tens thousands education  That's good know then. many unhygienic people their, you’re literally shaking hands shit. I’m looking one: Dont karen, wear mask stay home  truthful statement. Please provide example current candidate vaccines deviated FDA procedures. Even one.

You able to, none have. all. simply untrue.

Or, tell ""100 years reasons"". problem people make statements like pressed specifics, nothing except opinions feelings. cuts ice science. Somehow getting COVID-19 easier some, getting understanding logic you, I’m 63 still rockin. Rather go eaten shark hospital tube throat asshole stranger exposed grocery store. Web cam hence concern know posting download figures? I'd really curious. Honestly, amount information give away every single day online legion. concerned privacy even read they've done protect privacy users app. really seem gone beyond, utilizing Bluetooth beacon technology instead GPS location services.

I think people understood phones constantly pinging phones Bluetooth availability. beacons. pinpoint location all, show GPS coordinates, still alert others within physical proximity given amount time Bluetooth beacons. hope people read little bit, 5 minutes would get job done, privacy concerns. disagree multiple reasons @ last point 20% seroprevalence thing true vaccinate many people begin reach degree spread suppression biggest mistake ever made *other going school* study abroad school. Except missing main point cross contaminating everything change gloves every-time touch new item. 

Also, likely seen pictures, people can't even wear mask properly expect learn take gloves properly?

Quick edit, also shown survive long surfaces chance catching someone else touched box pasta extremely low, gloves useless this. I've seen dozen plans local school districts it's...not good. 

They clearly trying see really keep people safe. almost impossible task lack resources. 

The hope local stop community spread. What's this! Someone understands nuance actually read intellectual conversation see content spite! 
 
I love NouveaNewb. 

And yes, would agree probably ""plutocratic capitalism"", though point we're kakistocracy really. 

However, would argue wealth creation exploitation. create wealth worker pay worker less end product create, literally exploitation; worker means rights production creating, would earn money directly - capitalist owner class usually born wealth concentrate streamlining business efficient possible. 

Pay workers little possible getting best product them; also known exploitation. 

And capitalism designed make profit, unfettered capitalism always inevitably devolve upwards wealth distribution lower working class. 

A CEO worth 400x lowest paid employee, average disparity wealth highest earners lowest earners company US A. fundamentally broken system, raw capitalism fundamentally flawed. murderous society polite society. many got infected BLM protests ? think weak person resents fact men actually testosterone actually don’t try appease people like you. serious? Anybody appears “tough“ automatically hiding something? seem insecure towards macho men. Longest 2 weeks ever. two kids, know costs it, paying $250 week basically, $13k year. I'm curious $13k coming pay childcare? fully support idea, sure ultimately pays this.

The government.

I know that's vague answer. I'm flippant answer, earnest response. genuinely care. Cut military funding. Cut police funding. Tax billionaires existence. Pass transaction tax investment income.

Really goal stop spending money dumb wasteful shit returning money back people whatever services needed.

If spend generations subsidizing corn meat otherwise profitable, really care address material needs people. people want public transit? OK. UBI? OK. Medicare All? OK. Free college student debt jubilee? OK.

Our money collected via taxation given mostly corporations military. goddam money. There's reason cannot spend make lives easier.  Masks useless That's different elsewhere, how? wouldn’t wish cancer anyone. 

Covid joke comparison. piece shit /u/bbheybbmybbnobb banned taken back smashed face times experienced full impact closing schools, realized economically unsustainable without level government support coming. Ahh yes. Voting Trump stick Libs right? Hello, eh. New phone. diz? California fucked hard. weren’t apart US we’d living country like developed powers. tired used Methodist, hospital releasing info it’s real deal. Methodist one leaders medicine world. It’s Presidents go get treated. So, German here. usually start 6:30 end 3:30 pm half hour break (but could clock smoke like too). Company policy is, employees office work 1/2 hour plus Monday Thursday end work two hours earlier Friday.

Most employees would left office around 4 pm everyday Friday, except two employees, start really late due personal reasons. Friday you‘d lucky find someone office 2 pm.

30 days paid vacation regular 6 weeks paid sick leave per law Germany less sick pay public health insurance 6 weeks.

I believe generally looking skilled workers experts shit hit fan. things calmed down, feel free drop by. :-) Omg white people bad!!!!11111111111 Here, dropped /s. 1 student allowed screw finely tuned system capitalism. 

If student persists, parents might keep children home stay home keep making ultra-wealthy richer running businessee buying products. ultra-wealthy get upset &amp; stop donating campaigns, would even change politicians!

Then unemployed people probably want lower taxes even affordable healthcare!

By george simply do. sir, all! /S would need infect 70% herd immunity takes effect.

Heterogenity, differences susceptibility, cross-reactive immunity lower it.

Even Mr. Dommer, anti-herd immunity Lipsitch said said 60-70% admits virus spreading ""naturally"" lowers HIT thinks lowers like social distancing, reduced mass gatherings, mask wearing.

In South almost every single state peaked time. 

Even though massively different population structures measures.

GA peaked almost time TX even though TX mask mandate GA forbidden local governments mandating it.

Most cities CA mask orders 3 months. virus still rising neighbor Arizona.

Japan never universal masking....virus rising there.

Masks simply slow down. Delays despite prevention happening USA still seeing 70,000 confirmed new infections every day.

Why lie? Like make lies says actual point.

US daily average cases never reached 70k. got close never there.


Current average daily new cases 55k. love life too, one given ill make best it. feel hopeless though. know age 30, dont security comforts parents had. likely never things able reach, like building house, yearly nice vacations, financial security mom stay home sister born. Wow. real thinker huh Except sink car hand sanitizer effective. know effective? Taking gloves get passenger compartment worry cross contamination steering wheel, parking brake, shifter seatbelt. saying umad actually make lol? wondering. posts title read Conservative Republican Christian American men still resisting wearing masks. makes cry. Ya, lots examples Flint, Michigan seems like really great example country values money people shocking degree.  guess comes expect citizens. want dumb citizens easily compliant told put pedestal. want smart citizens progress country make better place citizens put smart people pedestal. hospitality industry majorly whack right now. even fallback option. Right? definitely backfires way invisible quite apparent everyone else. difference competitive (while personally agree intelligence competitive field since definition prospects widely variable different people) bully snob. latter proves procuring qualifications necessarily equal intelligence. Flaunting proof cunning merely incredible insecurity. Ah yes, media trying create divide again. can’t even agree national border We’re right path ... NZ completely different league. great idea. needed states mask mandate! part? I’m open wrong, especially since I’m Danish resident, would like understand part think got wrong. 

Based link, It’s obvious recommendation, since fines issued. Thanks pointing out. Editing. 

Or 500 limit mean? read article: “Arrangører, der er omfattet af sektorpartnerskabsretningslinjer, må dog allerede dag fortsat gerne afholde arrangementer med op til 500 mennesker, hvis de primært sidder ned og overholder afstandskravene - som eksempel til en siddende koncert.” wrong spring. That's - hard understand all. gives shit always thought anti social hating majority people. Turns hate justified since majority America apparently actually retarded. fact country I'm living going suffer people greedy stupid fucks, angers end I'm everything help.

My mom thought covid fake proved otherwise. fucking sucks living here. Dexamethasone (FDA recommended need oxygen)

Tocilizumab (this maybe quick google)

Low-Molecular Weight Heparin ('cause clots, sure research status is)

Remdesivir (This new expensive, helps some; FDA recommended)

Convalescent plasma

Gravity! (Gravity used help clear lungs patient positioned right.)

Percussion. (Also help get gunk lungs.)

DO take without prescription doctor. 

That said, physicians hospital probably need told this. person danger dying virus need social distance need take precautions, everybody else. idea 99% country needs suffer, sacrifice jobs, sacrifice recreation, sacrifice things love life elderly sick people ridiculous. isn’t Spanish flu, isn’t Ebola, isn’t polio, it’s virus kills three every 1000 people, vast majority deaths people age 75. 

Get fucked. Almost like 99% Americans never faced real adversity facing adult fucking crumbled. younger similar sentiments. I'm worried retirement, honestly questioning whether bother kids. nice comfortable life right really way think maintain never children. Many *middle class* boomers got get married, buy home raise multiple children husbands income. honestly mind blowing think large portion men 20's current day without making 6 figures inheriting wealth. common then.

Now grumble resent us giving grandchildren earth would we? got shoved signing tens thousands dollars predatory loans even legally adult. kinda expenses deal first. go gym mask run treadmill looking weaklings can't run mask. mean wearing mask least weak thing do. someone want look weak wearing mask gets Covid weak physically life. STILL waiting explain way qualified refute evidence 99% scientific community specialized climate change. Whether wastewater worker wastewater supervisor, waiting come reason evidence believe opinion climate change NEARLY UNANIMOUS CONSENSUS ENTIRE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY.

&amp;#x200B;

I also think silly think glean entire life comment history? mean comment made ""proves"" I'm climate scientist? I've worked ecological monitoring 5 years, specialty past entomology associating insect population dynamics changing climate (mosquito monitoring arbovirus tracking monitoring spread invasive Zika/Dengue vectoring mosquitos *Aedes* genus whose range increasing due climate change) year I've promoted working instrumentation sensors monitor abiotic factors I've mentioned previously. know want proof, unless think goad posting paystub shit. mostly post video games means can't scientist?

You're goddamn fool. Nothing post history proves wastewater worker, must lying HURR DURR tech nailed common behaviors. theories examine health-related male behavior. Calling toxic masculinity simple taken affront some. 

The theory subscribe men fearful strong, healthy, control. That's primarily conditioned learned behavior, underlying inherited basis. Many men want appear control times show weakness. That's cultural learning. leads late diagnosis and/or treatment serious potentially fatal illnesses - sleep apnea, high blood pressure, cardiac pulmonary issues among others. I've cancer. want it. C-19. want it, anyone else. Thanks, forgot, states dealing COVID-19. Nebraska, Texas, put extra gass money guess. notes advice could share DIY'ing good reusable/washable face coverings?

My wife using disposable surgical masks it'd great something less wasteful Yeah none makes sense. It’s like 3.5+ years now. people disgusted pretty much everything says. I’m happy govt. punched back slapped us w tariffs own. 
We much work many areas hope get back sort normalcy January next 5 months (hopefully that’s is) could get even worse scary. clue Trump say next know agree none people going continue die. faith turn around eventually might long time damage that’s done fixed ever. 
Best wishes well. Stay safe. definitely. Fauci frank fact likely achieving herd immunity even vaccine, people want hear it. Definitely. maybe 15 days vacation 5 years working particularly shitty industry US. took 6 sick days 5 years well. pneumonia (which worked bit), 2x flu, even strep throat + stomache bug. Whenever else sick worked. time worked 10 hours day often 6 days week.

If worked 44 hours week 20 days vacation, I'd feel like heaven. Nonsense. Anyone bothering wear gloves take five seconds learn proper way take off. stupid ""logic"" people used masks March. mean, really pot calling kettle black. I'd understand coming East Asia Europe multiple countries handled even worse US. look death per capita numbers see whole lot European nations top evidence transmitted school"", care minister Helen Whately says risk ""very low"".

That remain true, long children school.

As soon put 1000+ children one building, crowded hallways classrooms, percentage children infected, rest infected. selfish pursuit individual ""freedom"" cost simply resulted less actual freedom *everyone* going forward.

The cost economy fractured incomplete response take years undo. Nevermind ongoing health issues social damage polarised antagonistic society. prosperity hit affect quality lives liberties children, idiots could avoid inconvenience staying home wearing mask.

Well done 'Murica, played lost. we’re making words least go “Conspiratwats”? wrong. proved wrong credible sources. admit wrong. know certain% people know really give shit virus?

It's teachers. could never get organized. fish rots head down. competent leader would nice, instead blabbering loudmouth billionaire brat. read book character job bodyguard frustrated neccesarily know effective deterred assassination attempt overkill nothing would happen anyway.  Like America country nation like corporation built around military industrial complex. Restrictions lockdowns much less think. Timing restrictions pure random chance account much think. Ugh agree. funny thing try prove masculinity, less respect them...and actually end viewing less “manly” Asian society, get told view Europe Us, especially China. pretty high horse sitting right now. Wish Sugar still pimping Sun tour... 😢 NY first POSITIVE TEST March 1st. huge difference. can't serious argument. 30k people die 1 person virus March 1st NY. back tracked deaths beginning February. either denial intellectually dishonest. laws murder would murder-free! live. know people kids friends young man. awful. 

This kid varsity football player graduated last year. excellent shape, weight and/or issues. virus taken lightly. 

Some days feels like world taken crazy pills, helps keep semi-sane Washington State seems handling well, compared many places. Well said! mostly world thinks Europe important influential global scale. America would much without Europe, Europe would much less progressed place without America. Thanks! Well good education means decided democratically, we’re right back started. It’s positive feedback loop. Except it’s invisible threat. seriously feel threatened masks precautions make total sense, anyone using brains see naturally follows trying slow virus weren’t prepared for, don’t think would fare well actual dangerous grab power took critical thinking skills get through. 2 Australia opened... 1/10 schools got corona shut again. Good. Jail time. Even smaller scale, primarily meat packing towns across midwest also similar spikes, evolving trickle cases.

And nothing substantial health measures done live. think there's truth this, silver bullet, there's still trickle cases, zero cases. Yes. There's word - ""cancel culture"". libtards assault thinking people. expect everything politicized corporate media virus’s spread slow enough impact people immediately yet. bob Ross Carl Sagan communicating love creating art, instead communicating science? I'm Spanish-American dual citizen get see perspectives. agree premise article, pretty much good US built Obama administration destroyed, we're less liked Iraq War days.

That said, I've also found average European handle nuances what's going here. Nobody I've talked understood Trump lost popular vote, 3 million people voted Hillary, mainly can't conceive legitimate election that's even possible. hear lot ""Americans getting deserve"" attitude, that's take exception to. us choose this, institutions fighting Trump tooth nail, Republican Senate completely abandoning duty country Constitution, there's much else do. founders never imagined major political party would actively working directly nations' best interest, there's mechanism place stop this. Except another election, around corner. 

tl;dr- Give us chance, world. us OK what's going here. mean people want left alone work lives free want... want instead someone trying tell living wrong? agree, unfortunately. I'm terrified see though. literally can't see future past Nov. 3rd right now. Americans generally known rowdy, nationalistic, rude.

""A bad apples ..."" Something something.

I'd saddens Canadian I've noticed spill behaviours years. robotics skills make employable non-robotics related college degree. We're already starting see programming, people college degree get jobs programming skill many college degree holders can't.

Even people get non-robotics degrees future need familiarity robotics programming get jobs.. English majors training speech recognition algorithms, theatre majors optimizing Google's ad algorithms better market new Broadway plays, etc. ever imply talking tota deathsl? common sense man. Obviously Florida right now, overall nowhere near New York lost far. doubt Florida ever catch NY. many morons think ""I'll able tell I'm sick, need check feel morning."" Heh, possibly vice versa. 🔫 really think deaths going increase much first wave over? America would done better Britain Belgium Cool, white men men too, still proves point want put perspective.

In Europe, means general population standing one behind government corona measures. economic impact various lockdowns becomes clearer, also increasing number people condemning government actions.

There clear indication Europe second wave imminent (as predicted literally every infectious disease specialist). kind lockdowns Spring simply happen again. voices economic stability strong. somewhat ironic turn events thorough response original outbreak caused lot people think actually bad medical professionals make be.

And believe me, substantial supply idiots well. Churches refuse cancel services. People rant refuse wear masks. Literally every summer hotspot corona hotspot well.

The difference healthcare systems allowed modicum influence always headed. governments people. mostly intact healthcare system copes relatively well consequences.

Don't second believe European governments abusing situation political gain. carefully reviewing every measure - effectiveness much hurt long term.

 second wave hits Europe, governments come Lord Farquaads side: ""Some die, risk willing take."" ppl fragile. Scared firing something less 1% chance kill ya You’ve got trolling. completely uninformed. read anything coronavirus? large groups people get together, lots end getting sick, 1 2. Bullshit... exhausted time reached Moscow, winter... simply underestimated Soviet fighting capabilities got vote? Landowners.

The senate created literally give landowners political power non-land owners. Revealed *Republicans* fragile inconsiderate. Minor typo headline. never know 19 year olds. One best movies lie. I'd add math, statistics, physics get tech job, too. hard find job *as physicist*, easily get job analyst.

There lots jobs data science days, too. experience, *worst* data scientists went specialized data science programs, former computer science majors second worst. Please give 2 meters space. cell 2 meters? understand meant specific rare cases people can't ware disabilities (though exposing public first place since higher risk getting sick everyone else), everyone uses like international immunity day! probably get mask chin thing Pelosi. yet see picture wearing mask correctly. always chin. UN literally report many Americans lack basic utilities like running water. That’s literally third world shit. don’t think US will, characteristically-American fashion, withhold vaccine rest world. Knowing US drug policy, demonstrates level cynicism supported fact.

Seeing US sanctions Iran [exempt don’t think US withhold vaccine Iran. 

I agree world decide things create independence superpower spheres influence general, seems narrative Americans big bad wolves reddit prompts people make unsubstantiated accusations. couldn’t agree more. truly must feel like they’re untouchable. I’m scared enough school district forced reopen soon is. Parents already screaming board meetings make us go back person right away. coworker’s actions definitely make easier people say teachers complaining. number actually well 1,000,000. severely underestimating. Also, that's number current students. alumni network much larger—each large R1 university probably hundreds thousands living alumni. remained US, decent proportion population gone institutions. get nice pre-existing condition make healthcare 10 times expensive rest life. Lol what’s death rate tho? gives fuck point. one dying unless severely compromised immune systems.

This fear mongering dangerous virus.

Edit : “muh grandparents!!!!”

If grandma dies corona likely
was going die something else anyway

STOP fear mongering. Healthy people risk.

No, don't. used work wife's medical office. know exactly change gloves, that. Fortunately get quite cheap. friend worked place unlimited vacation days, result people tended take less time 4 weeks/year. Please stop overly sensitive sociology class analysis.

US ACTUALLY TRYING. client asking question via email, boss asking question Slack (which shows logged out), co-worker wanting something. could probably leave early occasion issues, regular basis. Due privacy concerns put work-related communications besides generic 2-factor apps phone, either.

We couple co-workers years tested limits acceptable work hours, like one would leave early, around 4:00pm, another would show late, 10:00am so. Neither lasted year. actual answer that: 
to sustain standard living. 2020 like free pass cosplay ninja public dopes like “Nah, I’m good.” WTF Good points.  Versus Europe Jews killed assembly line within living memory... Ah yes, ceremonial pulling bootstraps, like! Anyone it! YOU, too, die economy!

Yes actually happens NCAA regret handling issue greatly.

This stoppage isn’t COVID. goes far deeper labor/amateurism issues go back far college sports do. NCAA allowed players make money wouldn’t canceling right would able come safety agreement players union, like every league has. guess they'll follow SEC stayed home kids 6 months. Decided flu better alternative. Yeah head often nowadays recommend covid19 people try make outlandish claims like hydrochloroquine zinc cure Covid social media platforms. #lol

You made evening :D Almost literally nothing reddit achieves anything level.

Would say epidemic? Weird suggest adopt policies, suddenly that's deemed socialism Imagine coward idea wearing silly piece cloth covering face makes sweat. believe term ""dumpster fire"" ""shithole"". Exactly times billion. fact people can’t comprehend nauseating me. interest language, word ""rave"" automatically imply already night? always knew people fucking stupid, pandemic figured majority people would taken seriously considering life others around line. Call crazy want live long enjoy life, want spend many years possible loved ones. cool, black men men too, still proves point Suggestions? laugh mad 😛 Oh, agree; Trump expression rotten core. party would allow someone like get nomination giant media ecosystem falls lockstep supporting despite flaws rotten.  Honestly, America strong ally Europe. us forgotten us World War 2 sending men die help us, afterwards, helping us get economies back running. (Shout Canada well, Netherlands)

Besides that, America's military budget big reason Europe safe many potential threats. 

We consume culture America country.

American people known friendly holiday America considered enviable many people know nothing positive experiences. 

I'm trying downplay badly Corona handled America anti-America sentiment general bit overblown. personally feel bad people suffering bad leadership America currently reflects poorly country overall think Europeans view Americans negatively think. high school age pretty conservative (much like family) learned lobbying thought pretty disgusting (at 14). 

Someone went college ended lobbying oil proud appointee EPA. believe evil become last ran them. least Stockholm buses sold tickets board years, use card tap. issue usual way controlling everyone valid ticket buses make everyone get front bus right bus driver sits, hence making extremely exposed. times cordoned front bus bus drivers lot space patrons. nice months could travel bus free. GONNA DIE! Boy Scouts went bankrupt. Where's preparation now? common I've seen 8 working hours, 8-5 hour break lunch. worked hourly jobs I'd usually sit desk continue working lunch leave hour early. something mindless like data entry. also lot productive summer temp ""professional"" temps, feel bad checking early. fact hater, lol Keep head up, America sucks moment hope change comes. Many great inventions, people, companies, music much come America. get president, administration, legal system, injustice turbo capitalism changed it’s place again.
Make America great again, Trump way 🤟 Nothing systemic oppression! evolved microbiome reasons we're beginning understand. mean, that's whole fucking problem country. theyll look even weak theyve obtained virus 👀 There's store near sign explaining shorter hours disinfect store.

Like, that's good idea. Shorten time open people come time. funny people get bored others die suffer around them!? someone else pointed out, never experienced worst NYC. March April much spookier. yet username is... Hopefully new lockdown mandates working. here, basically. work home rarely leave except groceries. go somewhere entertainment dispersed camping, hiking, things one is. see neighbors stay 6' apart, visit mom sit 6' apart patio. never leaves house either. Correct! forgot zero, haha. I've got 50k students institution, definitely putting conservative number. find precise number number students faculty attend work R1 universities. might write script run list aggregate numbers. It’s moot point hasn’t happened yet.

It seems everyone mad doctors medical expenses high doctors tough spot loans. study linked testing inactive form Vit ( 25-hydroxyvitamin D). matter color skin test accurate way determine deficiency. 

A healthy liver, gallbladder kidney's come play convert active form ( 25-dihydroxyvitamin D).

I idea focused race study white person without gallbladder poor functioning kidney's could show high levels inactive form converting active form mentioned issues....so would deficient.

As far blacks evolving prevent much synthesizing Vit prevent toxicity I'd see studies Vit toxicity incredibly rare even well current ""safe"" levels recommend doctors. karma wins end Destiny. agree mandatory mask Sweden rn. garbage idea since seriously can't find masks. access mask though support think they're fudging numbers?

Does Canada CDC? point immunity earliest cases might worn off. That's kind luck we've year far, it? Damn almost many new cases Dallas. Born &amp; raised Midwest spot this. less point making yeah. Agree disagree, frequent glory hole may well higher risk individuals. Add fact wouldn’t lend sanitary establishments... Honestly? 

You need rework American legal position. sad many Americans emboldened enough think right endanger others can't see gun hand. That's big problem. 

That 'social' framework everyone keeps slapping face model makes easier become stay middle class. pay tax make happen think many us feel bad it. people make nation great, millionaires hire them. inspires ferocious defense country times like these. Middle class usually turns wheels it? Dare say would also promote higher level social consciousness due better education systems? 

Canada done lot things wrong still does. feel 'do better' allowing something voted created population take wheel comes broad strokes. good nanny, perfect helps keep us safe really want go route. people elect purpose, get rid fast framework remains. Lockdown pandemic expected government federal provincial levels, railed against. happened country feels alien many us.

That's opinion dude Canada! Stay safe brother. Also player pay pennies compared owner’s value added. neighborhood anti-maskers ""don't sheep"" guys also guys flying blue-lives-matter flags. uhmerican citizens 97% fault here. ones refuse wear masks public.

In case, every bit mitigation could accomplish means lives saved. 

It's moral ethical dilemma.

I can't say certain happened here, could see someone get faced situation like that. guys really like read problem that, may see effect Sturgis area, won’t easy pinpoint effect communities attendees returned afterward. many people suffolk wearing bandanas. wish they’d require actual masks stores:  Haha, oh, sweet summer child. Statistically, meaningfully supermarket workers woman infected sent hospital. never know hospitals required funnel data HHS instead CDC. Guess over-sees HHS? Strange week switch over, infection rates miraculously started drop. Either weren’t accurate begin suppressed. Right switch, Trump started crow case counts dropping administration control. OK -- curious, understand mean ""burrowed in"". all.

But suspect college football players know careers opportunities risks most.

COVID doesn’t exist vacuum. want hear...

""I wrong."" Empathetic forgets position gene pool beyond contaminated. also forgets people people direct extremely negative impact on. Idk atleast thats rational side beating empathic one submission this. still wants know matters die! /s Seems like safety measures described sufficient disease infectious. would think research university would know better apparently not. honest, feel like effective way approach right micro every day level.

I’m sure you’re lying, you’re definitely stating things way they’re gravely serious. news though, scientific research. news sub, hence politics. Many points made... blacks also susceptible covids, big stars already opted season (which likely happen anyway) way way many variables  trust Russian process. deeply skeptical Chinese process. trust US, UK, EU, South Korean, Singapore, Japanese, Israeli, Taiwanese processes. Oh yes majority white bike rally, probably much disease ridden BLM riots news tells African American get disease much higher rate. 4? 1... Zero Federal Response. awful Yeah that’s try avoid sub! needed vent get positive thoughts tonight. Feels like good news slowing bit lately it’s tough fact still trial exactly ""potentially dangerous"" 100% self evident correct. require proof, null. 

A medication prove dangerous. That's burden. We're saying accelerated R&amp;D, burden proof likely available yet. 

That mean dangerous. mean either. means know. can't know. least time passed. 

What say risks virus worse potential risks vaccine, therefore everyone get it. least, hope confidently make claim time made available. Yep normal. precautions. Shut days. Open up. Rinse repeat implement something make changes. Oh fuck me, hate that's probably right. ....America really fucked it?

* *looks back fire*

Well,I'll damned. afford month Australia yea! Lol Hate one tell you, Rush Neal anymore either :( enforcing area (Shhhh, tell god loves giving babies malaria) I'm curious voted here. There's huge surplus labor US, virus surplus gotten even bigger due many businesses shutting good. probably took inside. smh Oh believe it. included edit made original post, sounds like wearing mask. 

Sorry hear though, would say stay safe kinda can't bullshit. “yes you’re also obese”

statistics confirm admit hate poor people already Except large paychecks Even demented self aggrandizing bigot stupid fucking hat white house ignored wore masks would better. “That’s *hot*.” Florida winning.  get tired winning Sure. explains San Francisco, too. today's Portland Portland nineteenth early 20th centuries, so, although definitely correct history think something else explains contemporary statistic. 

Any thoughts? Welcome Ayn RAND small government OK - get head...the Dells tourist trap. basically cheap version Disney 99% price

You keep Illinoisans Dells - stay care.

And we're subject- Wisconsonites Illinoisans go Wisc two groups could fall earth one would miss thing....

They hate us much ""great white north"" sure like money bring....

Forgetabout it! spend nickel Wisconsin That's putting mildly. many dead due poor leadership. No, tried before, less effective it. would totally sign reinfected name science even news?

It gets clicks, ratings. Fix comment  matter. rational people take stay alive, ignorant ones deserve 6 feet below. responsible people world long pleaded everyone wear masks, social distance, take virus seriously, selfish people put everyone else danger. referring Italy. 

Hospitalizations drop might something 300 deaths day average last week. pretty much explained me. Mongiloid racist term? thought used refer proto-humans... like Homo Erectus Neanderthal. Making stinging insult. Best part see parrot Russian/Chinese troll farm topics.

Good resource here: fuck read rest states following way New York's?  Lmao US fk! even insist opening schools, 100 thousands kids sick covid. Americans hate other. sadly creating keeping people stupid big business here. way easy huge disparity wealth poor working class stupid know better. definitely ending museum one day Hurry! stained glass windows! Hey! People take masks take pictures themselves. CRAZY. Canada here

We cared enough federal government provinces/territories got page (and provinces HATE Prime Minister right now). made world difference containing virus well have. think difference maker. Thank pointing out. Unfortunate, top comment. COVID cases good statistic, look deaths per million people US right line western European bunch overweight alcoholic smokers gather ingest virus. becoming like lepers world? Take YMCA hope so. think wait hospitals icus higher capacity close indoor dining/bars etc?  Believe me... world observing u guys US. simply speechless. global turning point. (I'm sure end point though) Wow 187 infants, horrible sad. completely unnecessary first world country. course “they” never hear horrible sad news “they” watch Fox News. Fox never mention this. Ever. Reminder FoxNEWS legally entertainment source news source legally consider news source avoid getting sued every stupid thing broadcast... even though CNN constantly called fakenews people fox news despite actually news source legal obligation share factual information. depending state

I live one ""safest"" states one cares. MAGA people; **everyone** blame. sheer amount people wearing masks, flaunting rules, amount government supposedly intelligent people treat mere inconvenience legion, consensus. terrifying, cannot even imagine living true hellhole state like Texas Florida. They’ve driving town week way sturgis. It’s... great. Agree one. Oxford: cute! Message got lost bit first part. That's guess votes This. lost job, thus health insurance, pandemic.
I'm diabetic. UIA cut $600/week, I'm going start draining squirreled away pay INSULIN things.
Republicans droning $600/week disinsentivises people get job. Like fuck no, need job health insurance! lost UIA pay ~$900/mo medical supplies? better bet want job!

But also terrifying. People taking seriously, catch it, mortality rate closer 45% population-wide 3.5%. even close high children. ages 0-24 IFR .036%. basically 1 3000 catch it. Here's IFR chart age groups curious.
 Hey, face shields I've 3D printing. Message could send them. No, Americans care. ignorant, self important, conspiracy theorists live bubble part sort national death cult. Source: I'm American.

Don't buy anti-American rhetoric. Many European Countries worse US comes COVID. look # deaths/million people get accurate assessment. US better many European countries, report deaths way done math project long might take shut considered non-essential services? agree CDC's guidelines essential essential? taken look countries, like Sweden, seem followed different guidelines CDC recommends? 

I'm curious. I'm dummy. US richest 3rd world country. think switched second grade collared shirts stuff. can't really remember started 2. Mamabear said nope going school brother I'm done yall 8,700 deaths far (and CA population 5x size). Devastating. 

For us partially governor’s fault, absolutely, delayed closing etc.. everyone remember Feds intercepted shipments PPE northeast. happened shipments? Trump (or Kushner?) sold countries, course, like stockpile hand pandemic. words corrupt devoid humanity administration is. Yes. also put stupidity display whole world. showed weakness clear day. 
When worked politics last election learned dumb politicians really were. Even “smart” ones. detached reality selfish. gave climate change fixed right then. hope people like Elon Musk private sector could help fix things lot happens 4 years. Musk jerk Fauci family getting threatened. 

We deserve whatever nature us. leave nature finish off. destabilized world. less world united less fix climate. think war attempt start one. 

We already see impact climate change immigration prologue. Mother Earth getting started. Conservatives.... yeah right Dr's, CDC, NIH, countries data... conservatives. I'm Conservative absolutely wrong. 60 years old .0002% chance dying covid 19. Cases matter, sickness going spread. 5 million positive cases, testing people every day, showing virus deadly previously thought. That's media telling false truths again, cases matter shows infection rate. matters hospitalizations, ICUs deaths ages rates increase, also PRE EXISTING CONDITONS. virus nothing politics, yet media making political assassination. get wrong want Trump president, mainly due policies (and can't stand speaking). grossly inaccurate, far right wing thinkers actually reading data put out. Yes virus killed lot people argue number inflated 25%, none less last number saw 88% nursing homes. country America socialist policies, Canada does. Canadians far less likely put politics front common sense idiot leader. Yes fucking care.. I've got cvid, lupus asthma...I fucking hate way handled here, like friends, grandparents matter. We're acceptable losses, dehumanizing angering. I've met plenty trash parents sound like one all. trash ones sending kids back school means to. wife decided children, much respect good parents. Even worst best can. Thank part protect rest us. Best wishes family. Greed. US gov't could lot citizens, they'd rather sacrifice us economy. tell based things talked - example, get headlines covering things like ""landlords facing backlash covid"" ""big business XYZ financial panic"", people literally losing jobs homes, barely able scrape by. see bailouts big companies, billions dollars, asked give people need help, response government ""we money"" ""it economically feasible"", even though current statistics shown taking care citizens financially large scale crisis leads far less economically disastrous results (and, know, right thing do). see way healthcare treated like privilege, product sold, rather right, right healthy safe. Meanwhile, price vaccines discussed behind closed doors people can't afford see doctor, even insurance. greed, thanks covid, truly impossible ignore systems place work us, protect us, serve select few, name almighty dollar. hope, this, lesson learned, need help receive it. hope become better. Thanks correction. realize they'd lower prior estimate. Immunity COVID-19 fully understood thrown wild curve balls, good idea immunity works general. relatively stable virus, it’s place flu viruses are. 

If already it, it’s unlikely catch again, particularly within handful months previous infection.

It’s quite likely documented cases twice quick succession cases testing gave false negative immune systems seriously compromised treatment. Wtf? study never seen wrong. what's wrong many mouth breathing morons talking. Half vote thank God Guys there's chance Covid wrecks ur balls

Forever consider there's probably 10x cases reported means approximately 1/6 1/7 people infected.  Karens arent people telling people wear masks right. karens people feel dont need wear mask, wear thing chin strap. Quite. funniest joke history.  people even go get flu test? I'd think majority people would say, ""fuck I've got flu, guess I'll go back bed"" 160,000 dead Americans. 

They need die. PDX, attest crazy strip club scene. reason Oregon Supreme Court rules strip clubs fall first amendment protections.

Couple hipster “keep Portland weird” crowd quite different places go. isn’t full seedy business men...lots women go strip clubs well (not LGBTQ women only).

Stripper karaoke? Check. Vegan strip club? Check. Cheapest steaks town owned cattle rancher? Check. club, Acropolis, around forever. known Milwaukie Center Performing Arts locals. BTW, steaks cheap amazing! Anyway........

Even Supreme Court ruling, Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) would take away liquor license thing got “out hand” dances. So...enter new business model.

The business started appear around “lingerie clubs”. reason places didn’t serve alcohol. meant couldn’t controlled OLCC. places called “jack shacks” obvious reasons. places closed pandemic hit...for obvious reasons. 

While wife would go club long while, can’t imagine someone would go right now. worth it. American, agree this. honestly blame country that's shut borders us; they'd crazy to. (Not Irish crazy, but...well, crap. offense intended, Ireland; understand position in.) Seriously, comes point needing flee country, Canada Ireland top two choices whole bunch reasons (my ancestry, progressive US, English-speaking--I significant hearing loss, helps understand people talking). I've joking lot wanting find right Canadian man Irishman marry, worse things get, less joke becomes. Need remove host contact hosts. clean ‘till knuckles bleed won’t much school outbreak. 

My over/under suburban urban schools 12 classroom days first day shutdown. reopening fools errand. Hey Europe...try looking deaths per million people. Many countries worse US. Nice try suicides / overdoses / domestic murders / robberies gone bad due broke ass folks job robbing places Lack testing Africa already established

I think Ugandan president said best quoted “we fighting Ebola plague, think afford covid test kits?”

He implying medical spending beneficial elsewhere tried little bit searching, see close contact definition actually via CDC purposes knowing contact trace: also issued clarification: maybe guidance reference contact tracing?

As far switching seats every 14 minutes thing, found evidence here: I'm surprised see news article though.. actually, last revision. academic estimates IFR landing 0.5-1% 0.65 pretty reasonable. 5 6 weeks result super-spreader event going felt every state union, learn true meaning exponential growth. right around time bad weather sets in. Europeans difficult time understanding testing (verified) cases? It’s common sense. one paying attention thats im wondering - think spain though probably taken care fairly good healthcare system man hell happens stay hospital months us. 

I went hospital stayed hours turned UTI kidney infection. BILL 17,000 DOLLARS !!!! Covid-19 'Immunity' individual let alone herd beyond wishful thinking point. article decent job explaining basket anyone putting eggs in.

 Good them. Deep South big trouble currently. Anthrax =/= COVID-19... 

That's like saying drink unknown clear liquid drank water also clear, nothing happened. Well, honestly masks inadequate virus. help slow rate transmission, do. kept us overwhelming hospitals. Thankfully, people getting little symptoms. wish elderly vulnerable better protected this, clear protocols deal this. elderly vulnerable rely constant contact young healthy, symptoms. Testing taken long, helped much. difficult situation. Nah. love country hate government. 

America beautiful, leadership fucking disgusting. That’s good. saying there’s plan reopening schools? Repeatedly tell going die long term health effects ultimately truth.  nose? Odd see plenty people wearing mouths. looks really stupid too. That...and daylight hours. Probable correlation. coming , sorry Yeah, Americans raped pillaged post-Soviet states thirty years perfect techniques bang-up job already reshaping economy whims. noticed wealthiest people becoming even wealthier among fastest rates fastest accelerating rates human history? Number 1 world BABY!! think ""two four weeks"" crowd officials buying time see things different better bit road. realistic, trying soften resistance people may accept short-term change, would go nuts announcement classes online weeks entire semester. heard people fully recovered months since recovery still ability smell taste gone. Flu that. think said flu bc misinformation first still saying mid march serious issue thinking skills. Good point there, country wide based one state Try looking deaths per million people true look US doing. Hint....most Western European countries higher US. Eastern European Countries trustworthy actually men deny virus real take seriously. fact study shown 50℅ men refuse wear masks here.  Good god fucking school administrators super dumb. Utterly reprehensible stupidity. hope live long life spend knowing much failed kids ostensibly supposed protect.

The way get get national testing plan place, going happen Trump power. Lmao hope (though still great) joking around internet points don’t honestly think people “trash.” Go get back knees think hear Cuomos belt jingling us care people made political call south almost like packing people building bad idea. care. lot. I've left house single digits amount times since march. think problem lack deaths. Since mortality rate isn’t high enough, ofc people won’t care. oh it’s slightly worse flu. That’s basically point view. Place bets now:

What month hit 100,000,000 amount caring matters 1/3 population militantly doesn't. can't make people care don't, caring mean shit. Eventually stop caring to. Would better born addicted Xanex...that's awful... America always #1 coming American sad there's pandemic that's killing lots people yet president worried banning tiktok ""Masks personal choice - there's practical way enforce that."" -An actual high school principal right now, America, high school dress codes routinely enforced There’s also people dating don’t live together regularly meet every week also possibly exposed people days leading tbh it’s everyone’s fault morbidly obese friend high school go hospital days swine flu. never ever said “hmm let’s shut whole school”. Im US dont know, dont send doctors, nurses, scientists (or idk person analizes swabs), also equipment, states arent crisis, bad situation?? help increase speed testing areas need. Tell 50 year old coworker thinks people 5G susceptible catching COVID-19, believes Fauci Gates teamed create international Kabal crime made said COVID-19 virus, oh also work Lizard people aliens Planet X. here. Plus kids need help things like toileting. can't afford lose job though. One way wipe idiots country. seems two types people America:

“It happen me” people

And

“It happen you” people. Yeah, would bring house cards built Irish politicians. It’s fun stay least SIX FEET AWAY!
It’s fun stay least SIX FEET AWAY!  read article?

Doesn’t sound like denier me.  first class pos. BG literally spent billions money funding research infectious diseases, fighting infectious diseases, warning happen public health infrastructure place one comes. people surprised BG two decades public health experience belt knuckledragging mouth breathers like literally die contributed nothing world sad, lonely little lives toxic, conspiracy-laden trolling mean nothing. work autistic support classroom. kids age 17-21 and, part, unable communicate. generally come us severe behaviors since unable tell us want need. use applied behavior analysis condition behavior language pro-social behaviors. students year need iPad limited sign language go communicate eventually. literally work skills like walking me, waiting me, accepting word no, giving sharing items.

Titties!  28 denier? I'm ultralight sub-20 denier fabric kind guy macro sense - argument made society.

Obviously, individual deserves blame punishment leadership failing offer viable plan. motto 2020 Everyone needs opt person learning rest country control. fucking racist. Reported. Florida playing game hard mode. video’s icu rooms hospitals yet? People hallways? need glasses still read undeserved. iOS timestamped photo inflamed right pink eye ""Can u see Corona Virus...Nor I..see gone.. magic!"" mean...that's great everything...

...but I'd bet dollars doughnuts person-to-person contact (and surface-to-person) primary avenue infection. Biden supports fracking. Good guy bill gates. US population 331 million. 1% would 3.3 million people dead. states ballot boxes court houses. Check see one. Maybe boyfriend could drop you. significant locked 300 000 workers 12 people one room dormitories. 50 000 got infected none died.

These workers never affected circuit breakers, lock-downs ever, simply locked lot got infected. 

So, none die? fair, school 1/3rd attendance decent distancing; long everyone wears masks good might possible. school activities really done person, like science labs. 

That requires good management. huge strain teachers format classes in-person online lessons once. Maybe reorganize schedules bit handle it, IDK. parent I'd definitely wait least week two, consider sending kid in-person class twice week kid thought beneficial learning (some difficulty online classes) socialization (we need entire generation kids become redditors, let's honest). that's high-schools age, understand enough happening know need know. 

Kids sufficiently low risk balance risk virus deprivation education socialization. may popular statement here, kids need childhood education. politics herd immunity? Well don’t think differences last 5-10 years would much difference due population growth I'm glad confident positive light. admit, laughed read pessimistic outcome country. Yes, ignore move on. don’t use word here...

So guys, Sweden? Aren’t performing perfectly now? Sorry man, I’m frustrated you. RT-PCR protocol used testing right straight forward bio/chemistry grad fresh college could probably run weeks training. Getting necessary equipment isn’t much issue either(at least facility work at)


The main issue repurposing labs handling COVID samples, becomes difficult work around teams work research clinical diagnostic tests. don’t space put new equipment lab techs even them. anything gun control someone murdered little school kids Sandy Hook. fact, Sandy Hook deniers! America poor fuck richest people She.

I recommend reading article. I’m middle school. sucks kids literally sense personal space all. don’t wash hands, cover coughs/sneezes, pick bottoms. girls need help they’re periods. general education students, can’t believe anyone expects near other. That’s absurd. Kids need social. I’m considering quitting go back. love job it’s worth possibly getting sick dying. would okay someone ending coffin? That’s fucked up. doubt want landed US right they'll allowed fly countries :-$ Good luck getting luxury lifestyle people fade away question sucks little less.  didn’t think needed concerned infected personally

I believe that’s literally definition covid denier. doesn’t mean deny virus exists. mean you’re part entire culture rejects everything including severity infectiousness. Denier many things  Fuck em? empathy? They’re still people.  Well depends level testing done. I'm going get vaccine family rushed that's sure. Eh, I'd say real hope country whether vote republicans democrats 2020. enough shake people ""aaah, trump bad, sides bad other"" bullshit maybe, I'm holding hope country pull through. 


Mind, hope *segment* America dead, think least hobble along survive carrying parasite outvoting winning long term cultural shift. Yes sure correct. don‘t know details testing.

But still: another test wrong 0.05% cases somehow complex analyse average everyone receive theor results 5 days later, might (just random exmple) worse.

Further: maybe millions people waiting test. may beneficial test „everyone“ slightly mess accurate test instead accurate.

Again, percentage game. sure accuracy lot important speed testing. Also understand lot bad covid 19 tests pretty dangerous. case, infection rate number required tests, less important considerations well. surprising one know follow social media socially distancing. Nice talk people impacted way? Hes another person got sick even denier beside point. got sick quit labeling people get first line, either, key workers etc will. 

TBH sure effects vaccine going less shitty horrible disease, idiots trying spread it, I'll take chances vaccine. :( People getting complacent I'm sure hell still wearing mine high risk people know (regardless political party) wearing religiously well. chill part, good fam. I'm glad finally 'meet' someone truly sees bullshit is. Oh no, seriously dont care many humans die more. 10% would nice reduction. Maybe oceans fish definitely single protocol. correct there. article written like shit. Even forgot write, 'days' 69.

I'm frustrated found today cousin, lives 86 year old grandmother, quit job (where able work home) work teaching autistic kids. time pandemic would great. make job change now, live elderly person emphysema? quickmaths (definitely scientific, throwing numbers there). State population 7.279 million. 20% 1.45 million. Confirmed positive cases yesterday stand 187,000. 20% number would bit less 8x number confirmed positive, estimate number actual positive 10x confirmed cases. numbers line up. Nope. Americans selfish assholes. I’m holiday Italy now, really committed pushing virus back. Masks everywhere! Really great see POS need go big house. know guy party actually, videos inside house make outside look like joke. tell complete honesty lot people care. parents diagnosed covid traveling Mexico. dad went quarantine longer went room. hand brother would go dad's quarantined room talk Willy nilly. dad finally locked door anytime brother came. Oh yes brother also went restaurant eat dinner night mom quarantined house. yeah people give fuck fucking stupid that's happens education fails miserably.

I’ve bunch times it’s always nostalgic magical me! imagine FORCED become president? would pretty cool, i'm high. actually cool. taken right measures early on, might took two three months. people common sense. seems severely lacking US much would cost fake one dollar bill? even profitable? American, really hope means people vote. im area (eastern long island) low levels covid. Everyone including wears masks. since ive seen anyone store mask. ICU Rapid City already full today. Good luck Sioux Falls Denver.   compliance closer 60%. give 100% mask compliance good try weeks see happens then. Nothing get fixed people electing leadership change. I’m also wondering kind surge think looking winter? think second lockdowns come Virgin alert! 
(Kidding. Good following science rest burn country down) could totally carrot stick though. get people cry ""civil liberties"" mandatory stay home orders could attach strings additional unemployment payments. Stay home get fined. check.

It's option. Lmao. Don’t forget eliminating older population early order reap accolades later. America far gone saved. There’s huge portion country wrong thing always think it’s important listen smarty pants experts think they’re better them. mean nation wide protest still going city is. 40% country purpose oppose rest us matter issue. vote, saying okay whoever wins, definitely are. totally understand sympathize go work open doors. US government nothing help us. people wear masks, maintain distance, practice good hygiene. trump cultists... oh boy. somehow head turned whole pandemic political stand. still understand thought process is. Like somehow entire world kahoots. Like somehow hundreds years progress science wrong. get depressed thinking it.. realize ones get solve issues. Let natural selection run course.

That report aged like fine milk.  argument cling ""Proportionately mortality rates similar"" line remain like long US' spiralling death rates. take long America way, way ahead proportionate deaths infection rates way things going, lack care virus propagating that.
 
But hey, least nUmBa WoN! I’m suppose face face interview owner company I’m trying hard video call instead. People don’t care Thanks book recommendation. I'm putting reading list. pathetic people downvote FACT REAL number. stupid ass state celebrating shit! I'll never understand percentage positive results versus tests taken emphasized data point. Changes number much function tests administered results. example, people move take prophylactic tests various reasons (flights, jobs, etc.) decrease percent positives. interest wanes taking tests, say, pandemic subsides, number could increase. IMO number useful. like, care. No, doesn't. Oh, that's entirely accurate. Texas leadership chose respond well local cities try something, governor shut threatening sue. too. Tired doom. Tired stupidity. Tired plans wasted never getting back. Tired literally waking going straight sub see good news, hope, still to. Tired comments giving next year god damn chance. Tired it. I'm huge fan gloating type news. Dude went pessimistic much. Cautiously optimistic =/= vaccine fail. whatever man, don’t got time type ANOTHER paragraph saying you’re tripping. Like there’s many things wrong said... like would get banned posting link saying Fauci confident vaccine. 

I’ll go quickly got shit do:

Link 1: nothing wrong cautiously optimistic, doesn’t mean vaccine going fail doesn’t like odds 

Link 2: flu vaccine isn’t effective either, everyone take quote context. turns coronavirus common cold pneumonia instead nothing cares

Link 3: above

So anyways disliking Fauci says using says context weird need pick side (and correct side trusting words)

So yeah you’re pessimistic frankly acting crazy. Stop little kid freaking out, disagree say I’m completely fine don’t lose mind trying type response emotions mixed everyone trying read Ironically that’s answer question “Why decreasing hours?” Nah. blame stillborn 5G  need term limits, term lifers government. instrumental lowering positive results reducing tests administered? Former Iowan here...to watch Kim Reynolds afar is... horrifying. parents inlaws still live concerned.  Ugh. viral infection utero correlated schizophrenia bipolar disorder later life. 2 months pregnant already terrible parents. scared stay home.

This aint't it. 

Not everyone stay home, even staying home guarantee. 

""Living life"" = spreading disease. Period. question is, **do right harm others?** No. Full stop. Same! friends offended. poor kid sees kids neighborhood playing can’t. Yet staying away everyone. you’re saying pirates Caribbean actually running? dude, hard, wish dead say it, stop running around question spinning circles. Nobody gonna go punch something said Reddit.

I think goddamn asshole tho, that's personal opinion Enforce laws? No, they're complicit. one thing, medical expenses way high. Equipment high, medications, testing, hospitals, doctors, everybody greedy charges much every little thing. Cleaning mess would fair place start. visit ER couple stitches finger cost $6,000. ridiculous. filtration specification? article light details. State's newest stupid slogan:

""SD Corona Free"" US got bored long time ago ate nothing ramen since March, probably would've killed around middle June.

And coming someone loves ramen. can't use comparison basis containment. contain it, objectivity containment merely based somebody else did. explain better calculation say Brazil hit soon? Colombia positivity rate 25%-32% weeks already. also mostly localized :( it’s 35k tests day though, 50m population... Working food service fucking sucks right now. I'm working 1-2 shifts week restaurant, dread every one. New Zealand's government actually went ahead took measures stop community spread importantly wear masks.. care explain preventive measures government took? Fake sentences, fake equations fake data easily discredited science. That's put faith science job. People believing anything like susceptible believing whatever fits line thinking. cannot stop that. trust governing body government dismiss anything fit narrative agenda without proof &amp; claim misinformation. call Governments misinformation &amp; propaganda. Anyone labeled conspiracy theorist guess. Fair opinion science filter garbage. believe things without proof threat anyone.  pretty much perfect opportunity ""no I'm not"".

If they're going short-circuit brain, might short-circuit theirs. People care what's going government doesn't?

I'm fortunate enough state attempted take seriously struggling financial burden national government stepping help. 


Everyone's fucking tired shit. Vote fucking year. Going 330 mil! Fingers crossed guys! unironically. Yes, laws meant applied universally indiscriminately. case clearly used tool arrest homeless, instead actual law people must follow threat arrest. 

It seems mask mandate apply unless homeless. sound little wrong you? need RICO act social media. Start shutting 'enterprises' down. sheriff also law enforcement outside municipal boundaries inside county 

So grew bordered unincorporated township hillbilly lacked policeman’s fire service 
But used township schools county taxes paid 

So cook county sheriff would swing trouble cops never went even though close UK still deaths per capita US. Edit: negativity responses pathetic. November... I'm aware metric, understand plan masks mandatory grade 4 up, younger kids classes normally, everyone option online wish. concern enough kids stay home enable physical distancing, best hope get community spread low enough reasonably safe kids teachers. ""dead babies"" truly care ones terminated pregnancies. others ""God's will."" say DNA term people know fewer people know RNA. wanted keep things simple.

If /r/science /r/covid19, I'd used RNA. I'd also left comparison human DNA probably talked tests done check virus still viable, like trying infect cells taken human tissue.  need real lockdown. President Trump, please make happen, sir! disabled woman literally chance country ever helping escape nightmare, even pandemic hit. Still, I'm genuinely wishing anyone even TINY sliver chance getting best luck. hope y'all make one day. Canadian watching describe shitshow, feel sad, angry, disappointed this. also isolated US, think constantly news, feels like mostly US issue. certain degree, happening lot places.

With said, really sucks hear people US choose health bankruptcy, foreclosure, homelessness.

I mean, government Canada actually able sit Conservatives, pass legislation programs help everyone. Like Covid Emergency Response Benefit, acronym CERB. applied it, stayed home March July, got $2,000 / mo. counts untaxed employment income, taxes next year may higher, allowed stay home instead going work getting sick. desperately wish Washington DC dysfunctional could done something similar. Truly sad trying times. hope manage stay healthy safe. willing let millions people die suffer prove one thing, life means nothing comparing big ego Prepare bargain flood lightly used Harleys! Harleys everyone! Get kid Harley ride school! Cheaper honda! planning moving? flu unique virus mutates fast structure.

Hardly viruses mutate fast. COVID-19 certainly doesn't, we've time check.

Vaccines targeted think. vaccine virus will, vast majority time, also protect many mutated forms. viruses mutate, vaccines still work, often decades later. 


The problem flu MANY different possible mutations. That's pretty unique flu. least exposed group. one adult taking care them, got sick, would expose them... Yeah fucked putting old patients long term retirement homes. like Titanic sinking, quartet still playing, chefs still cooking, people still dancing. Haha you’re fucking moron. NEW hospitalizations. need explain graph you. Jesus. happen better athletic orginization profiting billions free labor. Get ready bunch used Harleys go sale later year. Maybe finally able afford Road King. It’s going get worse. schools south don’t even open late August. September mess. Nah said enough data, recommend masks that. example, way effectiveness mask might tested exposing people coronavirus, wearing mask others wearing mask. unethical. best doctors told patients flu wear masks, effective stopping patients family getting sick.

These good enough tho, patients might follow every direction precisely, might not, might lie, might touch face. lot data like inconclusive, people would touch face decide wear masks. 

In order CDC recommend masks, needed hard data said worked. studies good enough, said could recommend masks. 

But, importantly, ""we cannot recommend masks"" distinctly different ""masks work"". Without context though, message quickly warped. Yeah, tell people power repeatedly attempt take away rights level stupidity selfishness America finally come light. want world know, us like this. 40% nation brain dead stupid quite big swath country. Welcome AMERICA good job USA, managed spread 'virus' else too. /s comment 100% pandemic response. cohesion outside party lines, 'for greater good' institutions. There's Team America decide go war.

Here's shorter explanation previous comment:

You need better laws outline 'your freedoms' mean damned thing comes health nation neighbor. say everyone opposed restriction 'liberties' defense public health love bang constitutional drum. that's case drum get tossed. someone gives 1 dollar bill i'l know fake literally one dollar bill

learn loonie here. Nothing comes house (mail, groceries) without either discinfected quarantined. Nopey, nope, nope. taking chances since high risk son. course not. viruses mutate, vaccines still work decades. know say. I'm disappointed American. I'm blessed able live freely America, embarrassing. Idk say. I'll cry given day 160k people died coz ignorant fucks laugh $3 vaccine..so long see sports Hollywood seriously affected think ""Hmm, maybe something this?"" Pure psychos. Here’s hoping. dad took family Sturgis 2006, drove past rider got accident. helmet, wasn’t moving. 

Pretty sure idea “I don’t need protection, it’s ride” ingrained culture. thought making competition? matter America losing? Well send 3 grand people claiming unemployment then. well anyone made certain amount next year. know strong economic comeback anytime soon. Unfucking america take time actually fix it. 

The patient terminal.  ""I argument left resort name calling sub's rule incivility"". neighbors party right now. Sometimes, yes, like nearly every disease. people catch build immunity less vulnerable immune it. talking crass. accepted America saying 'fuck it' letting chips fall may. go on, there's vaccine, still go many people think vaccine mind-control whatever bullshit.

The thing stop watch see high infection numbers deaths America achieve. American death cult following fascist leader who’s telling “free”. It’s not. reason hear news likes emphasize negative outlook. Researchers realize number positive test is. One step closer heard immunity. One step go back normal. going scrolling while. Really smart people made inaccurate predictions didn’t much information. Shocker.

We lot information now. real life examples happens lockdowns masks (Sweden), good idea virus runs course stops infecting large numbers people. also know treat people better venting right bat like NY Italy. wonder many died needlessly OBSESSION ventilators.

RemindMe! 6 months Yah trolling anyways strange feeling. want die.  want alive anymore..

And think I'm asshole like. I'm one ruined great nation. firmly path ruin even allowed vote. comes Europeans stupid European opinions. Annual passholders get reference. buddy korea/japan/china/taiwan/hongkong/vietnam? have, betting sitting bubble entire life gullible hell information fed. Go there, open mind, available you, watch want believe resist real truth man. There's link poll results original article hear bars violating policies US; I'm shutting down. follow policies putting others risk. leaves customers/profit remaining businesses like one operate safely follow policies. saw one without nothing happened

but least sign makes people wear (in area)  takes enormous amount calories maintain 400+ lbs. Anyone weighs much claims they've tried everything diets work full shit. Someone weighs much goes Dr. diet lose least pound per day couple months, that's without going hard gym. think people forgotten world like pre vaccination/antibiotics scrape arm could kill you.  could lot worse. Best research data indicate probablity spouse would infect another 28%, see Table 3 I'm going guess polyamorous partners living together fraction that, risk getting infected particular partner would 0.28 x 0.28 x 0.28 even used spousal estimate. Timing also matters, people infectious 2-4 days post exposure, GF day partner risk would low (unless GF highly unusual immune system). applies partners' exposures. want take supplements, evidence Vitamin may help. research suggested Vitamin C, zinc melatonin, evidence poliferate Vitamin D. Yes im start back work pre-school Wednesday. Im really nervous! historically accurate, don’t understand point you’re trying make? Today US super diverse Latino’s, Asians, people world migrate years. US still religious vast majority people ancestors came Mayflower Jesus. 

I’m case free zone, I’m 35 weeks pregnant don’t even go store.... 

I couldn’t even fathom. label sarcasm... never understood re-invest growth markets going driven climate change?

Your oil, gas, coal stakes mature investments. going continue grow fortune keeping money there. accumulation wealth primary driving factor, investing wind turbines, solar plants, nuclear fusion, new types nuclear fission, would smarter moves. psychologist? You’re theory likely junk you’re spreading misinformation. Knitted masks exactly sound said exact thing :/ It’s amazing short memory lot people board is. NY catastrophe early didn’t act fast enough. DeBlasio Cuomo indecisive early NYC paid huge price lives lost. they’ve since learned lesson done great job fact. NYC go well. horrible job. anyone says “yeah early pandemic” watching China, Italy, Spain unfold. acted 1000+ people started dying day small geographic area. 
 
Everyone bashing Florida, Texas, Arizona.... 
Yet NY official deaths Florida, Texas, California, Arizona combined.  Like crochet mask - stretch material see it. know I’m free Shut Honestly, fair question. Imagine ignorant us must look, wearing freaking piece cloth face following basic safety standards. 

The irony two issues allowed many countries relax restrictions. point? countries allow visitors now, stupid brethren can't bothered concerns own. 

Sigh. Sorry folks. like this. beyond retarded yet? fn stupid Americans?  supply side economics accepted principal.

This pleases *[Supply Side time pedantic troll ass. exactly end San Quentin Death Row good behavior 🤷 keep customers, likely regulars, safe healthy. Life isn’t money know Yes likley die car accident reference. European living U.S... I'm losing every day. Nothing prepared amount stupidity. Movies lie. Yep. think densely populated city entire USA randomly decided become super good social distancing fucking delusional. also wear diseases, possibly going case one. seem get it: disease enters exits people's bodies primarily respiratory tract, asymptomatic people seem driving spread.

This new info. refuse make necessary inferences. Neck fleeces, also known gaiter masks, least effective actually found produce respiratory droplets compared wearing mask appeared “disperse largest droplets multitude smaller droplets.”

Yeah, already thought bullshit anyone wears these. obvious anyone brain thin, stretchy piece fabric isn’t going stop anything. know they’re ineffective, they’re counterproductive Atp that’s really do, also hope others same. Thats live south central Kentucky see dead people. work place gives vaccine injections time give someone stronger dose anything people 65 flu vaccine. actually high dose bottle (we give extra regular).

As general rule, weight really factor much vaccine person gets. sarcastic right? true already cut 2-3 hours normal cutting even wasn’t really necessary.  Americans redefine word Retarded! Trump ~~profit~~ prophet! But, but... freedoms???? 😭 That's many us screwed 21st century America. exact mindset, hard blame people that. Right pandemic happens every year Honestly way long leaders now.

It way much longer.

I'm sorry. American astonished freaked out!!! I've thought sometime Cancer plague 21 century. believe Covid might possibly take place!!!! Well hope enjoyed ride! possible get chipotle without waiting hour? lines always insane. we’re going get downvoted this, mostly majority Reddit’s population 15 year olds social distancing years COVID

No, I'll downvote abundantly stupid thought all. dude literally meant can't figure CFR stands even reading lmao. air share. Good know heart right place. Hope stay safe superintendent principal need fired. school board members need replaced, well. agree, optimism way go. one model says normalcy fully back March 2020 said winter elements normalcy return one truly believe  clue. illegal wear one state trying send message, well, splattered brains really hill die on. Figuratively literally. doesn’t mean rush vaccine market without sufficient thorough testing expect won’t unintended consequences. recent examples vaccine injuries. know use google, won’t, contradicts want believe, namely rushed vaccine harmless. They’re defying virus, they’re defying common sense. virus couldn’t happier. incredible people ever doubted children could transmit carry COVID, despite zero evidence contrary. Great evidence organized religion God. men, power money. reason want people back urgently, 1) money 2) longer delay lower chance people return (money). Depends circumstances. [Internal air conditioning systems assist spread] Still, general, room long periods time infected person safe. [This true even large as, outdoors, air flow god send. Combine mask people fine regardless long they're outside. Hence protests largely mass spread events. read first four “papers”. One’s letter editor, one associated study, two retrospective studies feb-april included lots confounding factors like antivirals. 

This hill dying on. Please learn read “papers”. Actually opposite. Doctors make ton whole generation virus damaged kids. summarized two sides humanity. Scientific rational keeps saying good thing cleaning gene pool. empathic calling one monster. one popular Reddit, think they're right. Thanks, too. trying part. Fake news right. we're send kids school people back work large activities. mean already large part country. 

So right far individual health constantly monitored professional athletes ? issues yet. team quarantined organization, flew back home, immediately got positive tests days 100% negative multiple days row. flight back home ""back normal"" new infections. point Florida, Texas, Arizona now, New York locked already.

Clearly lessons learned. Going bar fine. people would go bar *right now*, however, probably skew pretty heavily towards would also refuse vaccine. deserve everything. guys fucked world got idiot president destroy country lmao. least testing students staff letting in? virus spreads people, matter visitors returning home.

Yes matters. Returning travelers interact closely family, friends coworkers spread virus people. Visitors mainly interact closely group leave. Sure spread it, driver pandemic returning travelers. administration incompetent needs replaced. specific evidence, also keep mind virus one year old, takes long time find effects (the sample size women covid early pregnancy given birth starting even exist), high fevers pregnancy general known cause birth defects. turn great case study pandemics road. would say ‘collectivism’ accurate description you’re implying. 

Socialism bastardized word point American vernacular lost meaning. It’s become vague umbrella term anything dealing government apparatus, totally inaccurate. Socialism literally means ‘workers owning means production place employment’... Despicable scum Horrific. still symptomatic almost 5 months later. couldn’t breathe well first 3-4 months still neurological issues. 28m runner up, keep distance, limit time around individuals avoid places poor air circulation.

Those exactly things North Paulding. I've got bridge sell! Yes has. It’s shame. High school jealous. literally everything. disputed card, denied appealed it. capital one, American Express bank Wells Fargo. None got reimbursement. shocked. even contacted US Embassy Athens BBB places. banned going obviously cannot go. couple facebook groups thing furious expected. Meanwhile Western Australia, they've told rest country thing. someone East Coast, rightly so! country prerequisite power money. enough money power typically care money. 3 candidates knock sucker park. think we'll concerts game attendance next year. I'd surprised still don't. yeah, young friends think - die like flu. think even post-covid fatigue last months great outcome. may lose job get financial problems. think Parson seeing bigger twatknuckle. “It is” Whopping big fine certainly order, followed 30 days pokey good Reverend, served immediately, bail. mean I'm telling people go get sick, like vaccination threshold lower think mean keep family safe whatever means feel necessary. that’s tad ocd. I’ve worked whole time repair peoples dirty ass phones day long haven’t got covid. don’t even wear gloves it’s real hard work screws small. taken antibody test recently haven’t it. wash hands don’t touch face. Don’t got restaurant gym anything breathing peoples air long time. Thoughts farts. like 9/11 though. ""You can't sue damages due COVID"" conflict interest here... may shock 45 years, understanding vaccines increased tremendously. Every analysis excess deaths shown explanation counting covid deaths. Cmon now. Let’s get real. think it’s much likely people alter behavior protect thoroughly hotspots. old people need cant reach toenails. Otherwise see need. one once, better job would do, seems unnecessary. Sweden intention protecting nursing homes aged care facilities executed poorly initially otherwise death count would lot lower, potentially. Man can't make shit up. Deleted still there, tell, people ""lax"" since lockdowns started. every day see new outrage porn picture people gathering park beach street, people would flip would lead second spike. turns even huge protests reopening outdoor dining, cases gone up. 

i say diminish seriousness pandemic, certainly helps people wearing masks. think real source success keeping high-risk areas shut down--indoor dining/bars, gyms, places people hang hours enclosed spaces sounds like something Devil Puppet Soros would indoctrinate kids with. kid owns guinea pigs agreed wouldn’t send back school either. Tots pears mean, First Amendment First Amendment. Ireland fear Americans vacation?? Try upstairs neighbour...glad live island near border crossing  Exactly! So, think means countries accepting tourists - worst worst us. much excited visit Ireland day, suggest keep us now.  downplay virus way headline quite misleading. said visited ER none stayed overnight got iv's. that's good bad suggested. *jerking motion hand* Deaths add bit tinfoil, Trump resort Ireland. Ya. sucks Well apparently blood dead children ‘the price freedom’ 2nd Amendment crowd... two weeks? know nothing disease. Players staff — players 40, staff aren’t necessarily young super in-shape. Let’s see (and how) vaccine (if indeed become Oxford vaccine) gets sold distributed across healthcare system throwing stones, speak. Yup. It’s classic 2 days, 14 days, indefinite closure.  parking lot town NC 50 cars teens park friday nights socialize. sandbar local lake always packed. People tie boats together walk boat boat. changes mean ... changes back things masks, social distancing right? Karens genders. horrible say silver lining likely contract virus boomer Republicans refuse wear basic ppe? unsympathetic sounds, kind deserve typhoid mary.

How many 150,000 republican? killing base good strategy? 

Perhaps demographics disproportionally blue urban, I'm sure data trustworthiness. 

I'm going lie, early millenial, I've waiting normalization house prices, stupid survive, I'm gonna buy house... Yes actually quite bit known already hit States. Assuming immunity exists. Would much easier duck. Masks required unless disagree. dont take money somewhere else please. folded pandemic I’m not, I’m saying hypocritical Bill De Blasio support one protest explicitly forbid other. Nice attempt deflect. come far. fear dementia paralytica stopped me.

It seems well aware Chinese could react. Phone location date checked see people stayed home cases started surge would also interested poll wearing masks practicing social distancing opposed month surge. would bet 20% thing applies rate people take upon (mostly) protect themselves. Thank you! went read it. I’m sure disinfecting school help much issue respiratory people much surface contact. Keep us out, Ireland. Americans acting far selfish allowed country. Yeah, sucks us everything right states, allow problem become problem help it. watched show recently catalogued positive outcomes pandemics. example, said middle class rose black plague fewer workers bargained higher wages. right moment unbearable. I've feeling hopeful watching show though. yeah big restaurant employee start dying. listed still entries DSM ICD, Manuals *Diseases*? country, important classified illness, qualify help/therapy. Dyslexia f.e. qualified disease, insurance pay extra tutoring kid. Protests are. Ok fine, country choose better guide USE IT. We're using GUIDELINES right now. care following NY's whatever. SOMETHING. We've got highest fucking deaths infection rates world right fuck's sake. Nah, would realized wrong along. Click read studies. understand read them?? is... painfully accurate representation midwest's attempt handling this. People carry gun protect others, wear mask same.

(Keep mind, I'm pro 2A) Cuomo run president ""glitch"" last weeks state's software collecting, counting reporting accurately, California's numbers F\*cked right now. Lots us Americans also aghast...(sorta). take 15 minutes 6ft apart masks required, know,I know... That's going little nothing. people bringing virus, surfaces. source except personal obstetrician (he one top ones area around amazing doctor). friend pregnant - couple months due date I'm 11 weeks pregnant - doctor. said told there's 40% increased risk miscarriage/stillbirth preterm delivery virus contracted pregnancy. family quarantined baby goes NICU, baby ZERO visitors first two weeks life - crucial time period newborns. based data have, obviously still little, better err side caution situations.
NOT worth risk ask me. Italy defeated coronavirus strong two month Chinese style lockdown ... meanwhile COVID deniers want go haircut, CHURCH strip clubs... exponential superspreading difficult understand them! Look jobs pouring back economy.... workers buying houses time. /s going thing wife job. time we're sit talk much willing put job clearly problem killing makes money. come conclusion yet like offer sage advice, seem worth tough job that's protecting know they'll cut loose replace heartbeat get sick. put much stock article, starting see stories suggesting covid19 ""comes back"" whether reinfection reactivation something know while. Anyone idea many people new York caught it? possible level herd immunity exists? Damn thinking got case aw shucks?  live Utah Mormon (LDS) church near open plenty cars parking lot,? know Catholic Church friend goes open (with pews roped rules) . 100 people Mormon church. People complain imaginary complaining way there's actual complaining. Would rather crowded outdoors beach inside restaurant? Basically says:

""go please refrain using medical services get sick"" essential service 

That done remotely. fuck socialism? mean like treating people hydrochloroquine early infections? way, 14 day average cases per 100k better, many places EU worse.(John Hopkins/European Centre Disease Prevention Control) Get little orange rage cage time. Lock'em up.

If enforce judge's ban, what's point?! exactly, I've shingles 4 times adult life. got chickenpox baby, never chickenpox vaccine, got Shingles 20's (pressure trying pass bar exam, exhausted stressed triggered virus come dormancy). get shingles vaccine, 4 scary bouts disease. Meanwhile, literally comments get upvoted say vaccine close... anyone else feel deep hopelessness? summer starts end think winter never leaving house, starts bit much. It’s hard feel positivity feels like never end. know, right. $600 weekly check would almost cover rent. Many people clearly living beyond means they’re paying $1-2k+ per month housing. side planet without US, even know states learn.  bestest hemisphere like going open bar afraid sex bears only. really issue. I’m strongly considering leaving near future, like almost guaranteed point.

Decades defunding public education reared ugly head, I’m lot American consumer culture toxic individualism.

I don’t think situation improve US, think situation continue deteriorate US population touch larger political system understand depth severity problems face. had/have idea words red one single study still. conclude comment ignorance arrogancy know science all. good. right NY higher death rate Midwest. honor families nursing home dead following clearly better death rate model states allow indoor dining allow people indoors together without masks hosting bug events thousands together.

Or maybe maybe here's crazy thought: multi faceted issue Cuomo something got lots nursing home residents killed time many people NY managed save lives reduce infection higher average (for US) compliance mask usage lock down.

It's true currently we're talking latter former. don’t get news, cases going way Missouri Oklahoma. Why? Yes place fine. Even Mick Mulvaney [wrote 2 weeks ago testing broken. Bill Gates [talk lot too. [problem last week, reopened schools many people got results yet found later positives. Georgia [1 2 weeks behind Can’t wait foxnews repeatedly praise New York it’s governor coronavirus response. remember March telling son's preschool teachers day would last day school year -- school would shut down. believe -- apparently father one kids nurse told virus hyped big deal. know countries exist outside US? Try taking MAGA cap while. Fuck man. know got it? Cries Brazilian Trump Jr. show posted Iives matter Instagram fpr couple examples. Awesome comment. sure logic help life stories may convince COVID deniers better science .... cant anymore. area yes. never line 1 store city (which 100k people). think areas? panda express locations busy food week. burger Chika fila 4 lines drive thru, .Localy owned ice cream, snow shack, smoothie type places lines 50+ people. Chipotle never seen 4 people place.  would argue even ignorance, still horrible person. 

It's simple: thing news, every day. Doctor's telling people wear masks, wear fucking mask! End story! CHOOSING ignore this, whatever reason, highly likely they've passed onto others.

Their actions may resulted death, suffering, permanent injury another. virus messing around. cause serious physical emotional damage. patience stupidity ignorance matter.

I care think conspiracy violation rights whatever fuck. Wear fucking mask. think reason wearing one important livelihood another person families, say fuck 'em. grade narcissist behavior, hate narcissist people.

I suffered depression two decades. want nothing suffering end. virus job, would good thing me. still wear mask. still everything get sick. actual care others. people excuse.

Let harsh lesson survive there's evidence pulled anti-mask bullshit, charge attempted murder whatever charges stick. die, remorse them. hate say it, kinda agree, time, I'm tired ignorant people hope catch it. want die, even wish long term damage. def wish serious wake call almost died. sadly way get many take seriously. issue they'll likely infect others survive. That’s fair case, agree that. totally agree. fact, remember it, even early opening done pressure. know asshole runs several major companies state, going open business memorial day matter what- I'm even talking Musk here. honestly think Governor Newsom opened businesses/people gonna regardless order, enforcement mechanism fine...the masks really help. Every state seen major drop states lot people wearing masks mandates. PA businesses requiring masks months cases dropped ton. surprising part US one fourth entire world's cases.

Well, guess surprising, still interesting yoh put way. Well bad title make point actual article did. ya gonna do. 🤷‍♂️ “I need 100% accurate fully detailed simulation entire human physiology including organs systems accurately predict human body respond various Yeah ok boss I’ll get right that. Maybe they’ll tech 30 years, anytime soon. new drugs tested animals humans.

...sorta figured. know impending breakthrough simiar. Canada's economic growth surpassing America's point recovery. Even though followed suggestions better completely (""suggestions"" never actual lockdown laws measures outside international quarantine, workplace safety regulations).

It sucks. every developed country answer SOOO obvious basic. Okay, already Covid. They're possibly safest people US right now. That's like saying ""they got vaccine already they're headed Disney!"" 


(I know there's promising research vaccine induces even greater immune response actually getting sick. actually vaccine, recovering Covid closest thing immunity we've got.) order online ahead? one nearby sorts online orders last name pick leave instead waiting line. qualify it? (not claimed dependent someone else’s taxes) Checkout Youtube channel ""All Gas Brakes"", walks around couple different Trump rallies lets people say ever want mic. depressing, happy i'm American. many TV channels need? Time open schools. Lol thought thing. short, Launched October 2006, Boy Genius Report quickly became leading destination breaking consumer electronics news well exclusive early looks unannounced products. Today, site evolved one respected sources technology news, in-depth analyses product reviews Web.  I’m sorry losses. can’t comprehend either. Urgh. awful situation. Thank God. hope least skip season Please find less racist way refer idiots. native really dislike term mongoliod. Trump control whole world's response virus. Yanks need tone exceptionalism. americans go profit prisons. way they're heading anyway, let's jump start it. 

COME ON!! shame principal way. I'm shorty know well like clothes fit. tall friends similar troubles.

Are US? I've come realize real prudes (as country.) took awhile get rid idea body = bad shameful. say norms clothing different contexts, general seems like waste energy police this. educator now, definitely would want waste time that. I'm really sorry happened Please give example current late phase vaccines rushed.

I believe antivaxer I’m willing entertain notion counties (especially Northeast) might COVID rates really low, data points little community transmission area. Fine, let’s conversation open.

But way hell happening South. politicians think magically remove virus. Fortunately unfortunately lot midwest states sizable ""first wave"". Hopefully whatever effect seems protecting NYC (it's almost certainly local policy) similar effect Midwest. find stable virus particles like 17 days cruise ship months ago? high school even, like problem little kids unable home alone. mean, teenagers might irresponsible leave home unsupervised cases that's parent. burned community already? never commented school thing article. far schools go. Neither children attending person year. think absolutely minds even thinking moment. seems though right leaning folks loud it. “the government can’t tell body” folks apply mentality masks social distancing.

THIS. unwinnable situation. want leave SoCal badly. someone link article/study im giving email news site us believe science willing heed advice experts get one-way ticket ban, least seek asylum there? Wealth &amp; power = horrible. true. called last week get tested told soonest could get tested upcoming Wednesday. I'm hoping get result Monday I'm supposed start new job.

My girlfriend called last week (she's symptomatic) told soonest could get tested would Tuesday. I'm curious result comes back significantly faster. That’s lessons, though. seems everyone else outside northeast select States done better job managing nursing home increased susceptible populations, learning aforementioned States. It’s bit nuanced limiting questions re-openings. 100% opposite happened protests. say protesters across country wore masks accurate know it. plenty protests one did. find anecdotes reddit protesters wearing mask. Yet **still** data saying single case covid single outbreak associated protests.  data true, know come conclusion outdoor gatherings completely safe masks not.  ""this administration"" assume mean Trump. Yanks seem think he's charge whole world's response virus. confirm satire comedy?  countries! aren't. literally opening schools back little online learning available. schools dont even require masks. want hear anyone getting it. However. fact dumb, ignorant, anti-science people seem getting slightly more, less upsetting. Dude literally sound different 5g, hoax, microchip wackos there. mental gymnastics think Trump force hand FDA select harmful vaccine order look good next level anti-Trump. live South Orange County, never hated people much. far I've lost father grandmother Covid19, house sheltered place since end February (when Dad died knew things getting real). go grocery week, 6 Thursday, I've worn mask public (even talking 6 walk) since end February. 

But one wears masks here. seen bad behavior- real pervasive. County government pure evil. one enforce anything. I've started wearing face shield masks too, goggles, need be. 

7 months pandemic, feel like I'm taking crazy pills neighbors resumed pre-covid behavior (tons stupid parties), instagram feed shows friends family across country going normal lives. 

I can't believe sheer denial, even amongst people family lost multiple loved ones. losing mother dad enough get take damn thing seriously, MF hope SoCal? rooky numbers, Florida guy. next week Wednesday Friday cases reported school, wide community spread Georgia. going keep shutting 2 days clean? deniers/violators required volunteer ERs ICUs. absolute rubbish. They're literally tests vaccines unknown. could argue covid completely unknown either.

In case, serious side effects mentioned elsewhere (e.g. swine flu vaccine) something like 1 55,000. That's far less chance dying covid (with higher chance serious side effects). (from January). that, mysteriously go organ failure weeks months “recovering” “mild” case. principal superintendent fired suppressing students' rights free speech. Karma. 

Only God knows many people denier infected taking precautions. country screwed. Fuck people! think point sentiment seems “lol fuck service industry workers want fast food” it’s someone wage slaves it’s “noooo heckin teacherinoosss!”

Do fast food workers kids/parents/grandparents? nurses doctors kids/parents/grandparents?

Whats good goose good gander. School essential service. Yeah school reopening quite experience. Hopefully staggered class times, plus outdoor learning help.

I've seen happened Georgia packed school recently, hopefully kids little smarter wear masks/keep health protocols Yeah, turning negative positive always bad thing, right. Instead making bad situation trying see bright side it, fuck guess. I've learned lesson try encourage anyone bad place look something differently. /s 

Are really trying twist around? Shred intelligence yourself, there. part ""no matter got there"" confusing? looking jerk? let decide respond feel instead starting drama something clearly meant positive. Jesus christ people toxic. Tell Desantis? thread chasing someone saying drugs, alcohol, meat akin pulling toenails. accuse lacking empathy I'm annoyed people comparing actual torture treating bodies like shit. agree you, closing borders Europe hard. people working living border areas depend country next them. Road border controls chaos. Agree started testing people airports way late.

Another source cases guest workers Balkans come bus. statistic one rki briefings showed second country origin cases Serbia (first Germany) I'm surprised press pick up.

I actually understand right wing Germany decided say ""covid real"" rather saying ""open borders bad"" perfect opportunity push agenda decided eat conspiracy dick. fruit burning. apocalypse. disbelief science troubling, deaths would much higher many people care. short answer: No. long answer: don’t. Take heart fellows. Eventually age comes us all, miraculously live long enough, regret crap words. agree 100%. Peace well. PR would worse DR didn’t get much help US. 

The relationship hasn’t perfect US got short end stick. 


No one wants anything PR problems. Go country. avoid debate cause stated millions gullible believe anything leaders speak ill make easy understand. state leader publicly came said month start shut down. many leaders, state, countries, same. another article written around time speaks differently article. opposite. understand im saying now. is. real issue Dems Reps fighting much basically cockblocked receiving would something similar. federal government becoming increasingly dysfunctional. REALLY want improve life, either help fellow Americans change system better, prepared become expat yourself. case, responsible thing abortion? Unless one wants argue life full suffering better life all.  Real world experience real world data, like every front line worker. Thanks input though.

Aka irrelevant anecdotal data. 🤦‍♀️

🖖😷 sane fuck alone. Hang there. Hopefully one day you’ll look back time laugh Eh.. They're probably ton deaths too. Still, may less deadly think. still ton bodies. Scamdemic-believers believe hospitals get paid diagnosing people Covid-19, there's whole act staged multitudes entities. Tragic don’t think could afford supplant unemployment reopening orders issued. hold pretty late. car insurance model wouldn’t terrible. “oil change” (physical, blood work, General check up) costs less $50, “loss leader”, minor disease(the stuff covered Walgreens clinics) similar pricing those, something like broken bone less $1000. carry catastrophic insurance “repairs” $1000, completely covered $1000 deductible. 

This still worse universal health care lot, conservatives gonna cry “free market” need make medicine actual free market transparency pricing allow competition. long need doctors permission get life saving meds, it’ll never proper free market.

I feel like typing post I’m seeing ridiculous dumb idea it’s still way better getting surprise $10,000 bills. Medicine may higher stakes auto repair shop general idea kind same. friend fairly skilled surgeon, practicing pigs, core medicine practical skill rigorous science, get higher levels care. many new cases today? positive rate?  probably right. find link stat, please add it. added Rolling Stone stuff topic. makes point, adds stats.  I'm denying we've handled badly. failures multiple levels. important people careful realize hold dominant view. Otherwise start feel like we're crazy ones. you’re washing hands public, even home, necessary rewatch finger touches inside sink bowl? Would soap already finger kill germs hypothetically covid?  regards measles mumps, herd immunity plays *massive* role protecting immune virus. Yeah, obese people getting measles mumps time, also 20 million people walking around diseases. that's fair comparison.

Diseases like influenza however lot common obese people susceptible that, get sick stay sick longer period time. 

Sidenote: article talking people simply overweight, talking people ""morbidly obese"" (have BMI 40+). little bit overweight worry vaccine working. I’m 13 deep can’t dumb full. tons space. Private schools person too.. fucked also guess majority people like told do. realistically problem wearing mask, becomes ""you wear mask"", gets feathers ruffled up. 

For me, longer care serious is, I'm going stay home anyways. virus serious, staying home I'm avoiding it. not, oh well, spent months staying home. realize I'm bit biased due introvert, understand people selfish stay home months. (Obviously mean people work, I'm talking people throwing caution wind taking precautions all)

This whole pandemic eye opening me. shown utterly selfish uncaring many people are. get it, large majority people really care anyone else. long effect personally, lift finger help Good thing look extremely healthy Let's something show parents care (disinfecting) rather something actually controls new infections (not fucking sending kids school control pandemic). skirt, come school wearing it, get sent home.

With mask, come school wearing it, take part day teachers looking. Probably pretty easy do.

Just glad going high school right now, remember, idiots back then.  do, Also, mother medical laboratory technician specializes detecting viral infections, believes get Covid twice per se, get mutated strand different. cases Florida counted per test instead per person people taking 20 tests coming back 20 cases. numbers elevated reason suspect getting manipulated something someone. Zero point zero.... Hmmm....make bad enough can’t vote lock sounds plausible especially hobbled postal service. continue seeing post blaming article female. also notice language judgmental. honestly see humans degrading much comments. types insults used create anger hatred toward other. post downright evil real person much hate heart would hate bodies. played thinking everyone real forums. know humans tell words speak. Peace you. tell same. really, death rate concerns much organ damage survivors have. *not* want live US healthcare system damaged heart lungs rest life, however long short would be. aka herd immunity. lot research pointed herd immunity lower pandemic vs vaccination due fact 20% people account 80% person person contacts. let's say correct let's play .5% means 99.5% fine, 1/2 single percent happens, joke chances dying car much higher, maybe need delete cars, moron NJ hold per capita record, now, though florida texas seem kind deathmatch beat us months folks figured keep thing somewhat tabs. Giving GA run money. days internet, highspeed. Otherwise forget Zoom viewing homework. heard NPR story child downloaded one minute video took half hour. 5 megs large people's standards. teachers driving McDonald's parking lots wifi upload assignments students. 

Yes, modern day America. Asians wearing masks since dawn time government created 7 billion masks prior demand? Nah, Florida still thinks hoax lol. Gonna year. Oh cool, want share name? I'd like patronize new, budding business times. even explain still seek answer question. lets put way state nebraska. numbers see lie. nebraska never shut start, state runner got live news said record cases. went three months straight. little thing right speak thousand words. open mind completely whole world. also. cannot understand paragraph saying thats me. live state. know fact numbers triple probually even triple claim. pledge allegiance... flag... United States America... latest says surface isn’t high spreader? stop disinfecting deliveries?  Rangers Astros still playing? live masks rare? everyone wearing mask go outside Anyone without axe grind want weigh [this suggests lab-tested overall mortality rates flu coronavirus almost identical?

And let's please turn discussion denial. I've wearing mask longer almost anyone US result living country took seriously beginning. disease worth fighting neighbor? illnesses worse? driving dangerous others? hope people continue pay attention.

Even lose sight, kids paying attention, experience shape decisions make they're charge. think said ""NY 'big'""

A vast majority NY deaths NY city surrounding suburbs...people travel use trains, busses, subways. LA example spread large area NY isn't. 

OP shoulda said ""NY one densly populated cities per sqare mile western world."" great, want couple boxes asap. makes wonder rest world compelled intervene US's covid response. US provide virus enough hosts mutate something un-vaccinable, WOULD affect rest world. Flordia testing also slowed down, like Texas? There’s basic instinct runs America “freedom” some, means rebelling government making anything, even it’s common sense thing do. It’s psychological phenomenon I’m sure it’s isolated Americans, proud don’t like told do. 

That’s objective opinion. I’ve careful mask toting since day 1 subway enclosed spaces thousands upon thousands people go everyday? seems go machine . wife got 15 minutes waited. Co worker took 9 days. mean. Probably not. 250k might realistic, though. Shit,That's heavy. That's lot mind. 

I hope able continue take care best can. Stay strong &amp; vigilant.   Thank you! misleading title! Theres room. Maybe park INSIDE diner much faith doctors average layperson.  Dude, wanna get planet without cutting wrists. way come pass, needs come pass, Democrats control House, Senate White House. People still try flout lockdowns, knock R0 2 1, help tremendously. see thank link Interesting. don’t know would work Canada tbh. look articles this. Thanks. went beach Covid before, however private beach 8 families max 5 people average island, everybody kept distance, also expensive trip planned month covid hit. saying cuz everybody goes bad guy. isnt healthy stay locked house 4 months strait either way. Floriduh benefiting knowing virus makes even dumber what's happening now. likely way ppl lifetime permanent damage. However wanna spin guess. True times us useless eaters allowed nice things like 40 hour work week social security, clean air water, world class education affordable millions, cheap good healthcare drugs job, job etc.

Now 1% wants all. Every single penny. lives safety worker bees longer important protected. federal response covid 19 pandemic clearly shows. pretty well documented limited impact mask is.


I'd love see still unknown makes difference countries low fatality rate countries high fatality rate.


No, makes difference?


Just example, compare Sweden three countries surround it. Finland, Denmark, Norway.


All 4 countries recorded first cases beginning March.

Finland, Norway, Denmark much lower deaths per capita, Sweden. went lockdown, Sweden not.


Finland, Norway, Denmark saw daily case rates peak middle April. Sweden's around end June. still seeing new cases nearly high 3 countries peaks.


It's almost like respiratory virus spreads person person, take away viruses ability spread got else go.


It's confusing, scientists medical professionals repeating message months. Americans really fucking stupid selfish. Tbh we've protests think real concern fall school reopenings, also seen full effects stage 3 yet work two months. stayed home stayed away people. Apparently fucking waste time people fucking stupid hell. could shit no, fucking Karen Chad need go bar Depending school is, full support community. what, 20% deaths Country? stop sucking Cuomos dick like CNN paying it, sent elderly COVID patients back nursing homes Europeans sit around worry Americans day? 😳 Well, hope not. Sure feels like it. stopped talking it, “Debbie downer”.  Every time hear ""gotta live life"" BS want scream SURE DEADLY VIRUS KILLS ASS DEAD! 

Christ almighty yolo sounds fun say can't breathe, kill family member, both! Vote. fix everything, help soemthings. wouldn’t shocked 80% crowds pass holders now.

Watching youtubers, seems case. Coronavirus + 🇺🇲 = boundless misanthropy I've following fairly closely read anything medical students interns quitting bring forced due covid related health issues. links? Majority us care. plenty idiots worried “rights” part help out. beautiful, benevolent stranger good man/woman/attack helicopter. 👍 bad title. Pure defameation. I've gotten comments strangers stores wearing masks wearing mask, place ""required"". Usually stuff along lines ""it's hoax"" soak well Bay Area residents pay ineptitude. bad, conservatives downplaying virus people buying it. move South Tennessee, done wearing masks, businesses seem require even proof upticks travelers. Makes sense. Thanks clarification that? people stay indoors winter? discovered r/NoNewNormal want burn memory it, difficult argue Likewise. awful. work essential field, job secure, I'm terrified getting sick. there's many people everything good, acting like nothing wrong, big deal.


My best friend jr high teacher, go back in-school teaching 3 weeks. Masks required kids, parents threw major tantrums rights trampled. parents high risk, visiting school starts back up, scared well. Lol, post 15 times day retarded stuff. you? see one place defined ""close contact"" within 2 meters (6 feet) 15 minutes? school seriously considering making students change seats every 15 minutes, student tested positive, one else would quarantined. Yes, real story.

I confidentiality report one part state enforcing anything related Covid. matter new procedures put place, everyone either ignoring actively trying subvert them. Maybe blow state budget pensions kick 55. amazing much Obama messed 

&amp;#x200B;

/s case obvious highest death rate US one highest world? ,😂 Yeah, that's fear too. one measurable mishap fear mongering escalate. That's news Reddit. 

They hate boomers passion. people brains care. leader needs committed mental hospital instead tweeting racist stuff taking shit toilet morning. stats coming yet affecting things? Econ? Deaths etc? deaths counted died Covid pandemic instead died Covid infection. note that's americans. instance, I'm type 1 diabetic absolutely despise fact can't get bottle insulin without paying $1k health insurance. suppose could call sick days beginning year? give chance avoid much exposure possible beginning hope school closes inevitable outbreak occurs? Anything limits exposure could help, know circumstances. hope stay safe. Europeans well, regions, allow people listed. Also none activities high risk spreading virus, pretty low risk activities. saying business purpose make money shit posting exactly? issue going testing back logged positives. buy pos % much right settles what's going on. Crazy sounds.... Except places closed wearing mask Go somewhere still open..... life virus. isn’t much help know, offer type empathy want know you’re alone. I’m right state. best support know you’re alone. Take day time. 
I’m 🔆 Possibly yes, least choice take medical recommendation take chances. Excess deaths counted types. Even someone get appointment died heart attack something, opted go hospital (or maybe tried room), still side effect pandemic/lockdown attributed such. However, would counted direct death covid. need compute couple lists get full extent - direct indirect. mood right here. wife everything safe possible. Even see friends wait 2 weeks see others. Meanwhile run park large groups (20+) BBQ. many people mentality ""If actively dying OK"". one WI. dad got covid, he's 70. far good. mom started chemo. far good. Remote schooling choice setup daughter HS. Day care might problem come October. Might work baby time. Buncha idiots. person schools shut 3 cases identified. Testing optional students sent home symptoms. Going shit show. Hope students die I'm community.  life one socially distancing easy. lived NYC. impossible there.  Every place go epidemiological curve sooner later reflecting regional RO immunity either vaccine prior exposure.  

That's pandemics end. think lot people understand conditional probably inherent percent risk dying covid. percentages see often chances catching covid dying it. chances dying negligible actually catch it, classroom environment pretty much ensures going catch it. Repeated continuous exposure lead almost 100% spread. American fucking astonished well. It’s royal cluster fuck care.. clearly  morons numbers see yourself. can't deal stupid people. read somewhere something dam lazy see true

I even said ok let's go number still 99% Idea risk factor compare daily risks staying alive Co parrot sick one think people sub would hard time disagreeing accelerationist loving fact disease downfall Arizona. mandatory indoors county basis, counties mandatory. live town elevation lower temps Phoenix, weekends masks outdoors groups 10-30 big picnics. Thanks, feel like days haha. time feel like trash parent interaction kids was, ""Hold mommy can't play you, we're making food die oh god, happened diaper baby crying OMFG CHEWED TV REMOTE, KIDS DOG, SHADDUP STOP SCREAMING EAR YA LITTLE GREMLINS!""

But we're good, lol. Ha! Oh, that's good one! support, mean financial? sincerely hope strong never give manipulation. put life risk, want ""support,"" gotta kidding me! School starts mid-september NY, recall correctly. You’re wasting energy dumb troll, he’s taunting you. He’s persuadable worth time.

Prob best cases post copy pasta links ton data facts general topic coronavirus reputable sources benefit passersby might see exchange dumb uninformed enough take troll seriously. Let's real here, Americans resentful countries know we're best, mean zero fucks given. would invite country care ? ""La la la la, can't hear you!""  playing bunch sick idiots. shit posting Reddit? job? r/unexpectedoffice Well original point make sense. believe religious nutjobs 1600s much effect policies culture Americans today.

But point handling pandemic US vs places Europe makes comment look super silly. seem like Europeans generally smarter morally superior. Exactly this. fucking excuses. people medical conditions go out. They're staying hone stay alive. Anyone going out, whatever pointless shit think need do, excuse. proven thing that's effective, like you, spent long hours masked working hot conditions, 5 minutes forget on. 

We stop sugar coating people risking lives everyone wearing mask. They're terrible people. They'd less terrible got wise now, they've 6 months. playing nice. Yep, I've worked automotive engineering 25+ years. simulate anything, get good goes it. Plus time something difficult emulate. test severe conditions emulating 10 year cycle, end actual ten years, failure modes far different discovered accelerated testing. 

Obviously feed back testing, improves time. case, Coronavirus, pretty much first run virus. know there's similar virus vaccines, similar mean same. Live performance Beatles. Yea, elected officials brightest bunch. Plus average citizenry make many great decisions either. minority group side taking precautions. US fatality rate rising. state right surging fatality rates. clue you’re talking about.  Hudson valley here. We've taken seriously start good hoped. yes Actually thought pre-existing immunity said seems like makes sense would bring little kids airplane, Florida August, dystopian Disney world, middle pandemic?

They’ll get local young adult Disney fanatics, that’s freedumbs parents families immigrated USA USSR give me, future child, better life. can't blame foreseeing bullshit back 1980's, I'm generally grateful raised came from. could favor future children, would worth it.  father believes whole mask wearing thing made global elites slowly brainwash us conforming rules.

It’s messy  Glad lives nation public health one nations priorities. Syracuse University already suspended students breaking state quarantine rules classes haven’t even started... Gonna dawg   said many people, expect life least start return normal memorial day next year. fall/winter rough, side either virus burn enough produce form herd immunity, get vaccine, people simply tire whole thing push us first option. idiots refuse vaccinated Finland seen say lot. Often advancements Nordic countries discussed, typical arrive couple really angry Americans talking ""communism"" ""socialism"" bad. Hey, want keep people sick homeless, choice then.  probably try understand proximate cause cause-in-fact are. Proximate cause ""an event sufficiently related injury courts deem event cause injury."" Cause-in-effect idea cause necessary events occur, happened close enough incident considered legally valid.

If old man slips banana peel, hits head, dies injuries, banana peel proximate cause death, also cause-in-fact, even someone younger could survived. banana peel, would alive, closely related cause death happening point. That's reality life. thing kills necessarily adverse condition face. one pushes edge. decisive blow, able overcome.

An obese person dying covid covid death. person diabetes dying covid covid death. person cardiovascular issues dying covid covid death. people dead time covid. people common sense care. many Americans want pretend like everything fine. I've pretty much lost hope. Lot American's dont give fuck anyone around  People love blame tourists getting cases guest workers come bus work farms, slaughterhouses, etc. Let's see things changed August. United States third world country facade wealth. I’m Philippines it’s fucking disaster here

We got officials conflicting statements , Health director saying beat covid transmissions getting low , Spokesperson literally dancing podium fucking beating prediction university ( shattered hours later ) 

Our health insurance stole around 150 billion pesos , corrupt officials , concrete plans we’ve lockdown 6 months nothing show 

And top , president thinking healthcare workers planning revolution presscon shifting strict lockdown

It’s cluster fuck yet keep winning el3ctions reason. Gee wonder why.  

They lie cheat steal elections voter purging, disenfranchment, closing polling locations 5 hour waits vote hevily democratic areas. There's reason they're bitching mail voting know they'll lose control government Democrats.  3% death rate pretty good tho. This. tired explaining this. No. answer no. 40% country functionally retarded. basically walking robots eat whatever fed believe whatever hear. fda hardly trustworthy past. Take look medical device castrophes due FDA. way ""regulate"" approve new devices. society crumbles further, totally see renegade medicine popping there; disgruntled nurse taking cash payment little things like that...

Or one dream. can’t stand I’m beholden doctor write prescription life saving med really cheap can’t abused anyway. didn’t health insurance I’d go back ordering medication pharmacy India. would guess guys kind far Wowwweeee! think even starving ogre would eat people! 

They're going vote. you? Bills suggestion stop paying delayed testing simple likely hugely effective resolving issue.

This exact type solution ""master businessman"" supposed able bring table. Hard fight corporations people money speech. outgunned. title super misleading. article says nursing assistant volunteering wasn’t concerned getting may vaccine bill gates trying chip us/ kill us crowd deep stupid. There’s arguing them. crowd I’m taking anything Donald trump apart of. could/can let vaccine used even unsafe able say see got vaccine made this. Depending Europe bringing topics like politics religion really taboo. Maybe let's bring [doctors work attempt bestow credibility insitution? Please update seeing this? number including 80% asymptomatic rate? studies I'm seeing recently imply 50% survivors mental physical effect still present months later. :/ ""Flushing toilet cat. Meow!"" shoul try fascist costume fit well. He's given charity anyone ever has, large foundation dedicated ending diseases poverty poor nations expanding education opportunities everywhere. might shrewd businessman, he's taken earnings literally give back planet individual person ever has. latest movies. good stuff 20ies.

And weak stretch.

Does Batman Bane Darth Vader look weak people? must weird going movies lol mediocre kid's film.

\-90's kid Switzerland here, wearing masks (except public transport maybe month now). also nation stubborn ignorant self centrics. actually stumbled upon event Sky Beach Park near Ingraham Street Mission Bay, San Diego last Friday. bonfire family yards away. people TV cameras them, shouting weird stuff evening far listen. thought political rally freestyle rap competition around bonfire article realized San Diego Karen, Amber wear mask Starbucks got barista $100k GoFundMe organized this. Wow, truly crazy plain bizzare.

Edit: minor typos. Queen Elizabeth  Yet massive number US internal news (even pure political ones here) considered spam sub. argument follow logic ""i wanna look weak. wanna look stupid!"" shocked decisions made POTUS many state governors well local authorities, acting like whole thing hoax, downplaying much were.

Trump president years now. certifiable nutbar. GOP supporting lunacy entire term. 

So can’t really surprised right? article garbage. goes men fragile masculinity afraid lose it. products marketed specifically men such. exact thing case women well. 

Of female friends have, single one would dare set foot outside home without least applying make-up beforehand. fragile feminity? pretty rampant IMO. 

This articles also never really explains statement ""men wear masks masculinity fragile"" comes from. Sure, state research shown men insecure gender role women (which I'm really sure case reality, I'd need check research that). never actually source mask wearing claim. proof causality. ""expert's"" opinion something involving way area expertise. 

It also subtly tells men women die Covid, implying men wear masks. Again, without proof. recent research showed genetic defect big factor mortality virus, defect could prevalent men.

Anyway, say article pretty poorly written. takes research left right, mixes together, without research proving causality... voilà, title, ""men wear masks want look weak"". many stupid, stupid morons. frontline workers danger PPE shortages, useless twits burn life saving equipment.  law kind stupidity, punishable fines, community service even jail time. think Defense Production Act right way go it. subsidize PPE manufacturers commit subsidies like future. reason I'm saying because, point, going problem someday (if PPE, necessity). Defense Production Act short-term fix, even know would identify produce PPE anyway. whole thing clusterfuck, many people saw coming soon US started outsourcing everything. article: ""Public health experts everyday residents said ""always saw America model"" world.""

From reality: yes admire USA's optimism, work ethic, inventiveness, ambitiousness. never saw America model. think rose-tinted glasses fell Clinton era. However, might say us America - there's persistent, simplistic incorrect view Europe America's problems due uneducated Texas hillbillies, Clinton/Obama blameless beacons truth justice.

Today's situation USA hens coming roost long trend towards neoliberalism starting late 70s / early 80s. European arrogance makes us think end way, leaders like Victor Orban Boris Johnson knows. Wait, Americans saying that? specific? think misused word intelligent Thanks! don’t agree, thanks explaining! U.S. became global power economy. Russia longer global power economy. Russia's economy par Italy Mexico. U.S. super power. pissing match Soviet Union give reason bloat military nothing more. Military spending never creates real growth unless sell arms flex power. Europe would flexed might wealth influence. try pretend countries Europe became benevolent WW2. BP tried take Iranian oil U.S. put stooge, Shah, power. Oil necessary commodity WW2 necessary nations try secure middle eastern oil. tried U.S. one positioned hold influence region. Germany lost WW2 large part running oil. Oil important war. European colonies let go let go much trouble keep much international pressure give up.  People always want brush industrial capability wealth U.S. turn blind eye fact beat game. 


We talking economies growth. want talk freedoms, yes U.S. free nation world. waste much spending military. pockets poverty fewer safety programs comparison Europe. though side tracking another argument though original argument weak.  cap ""young people care history world"" reason dig things way are. Ohio state fan, disagree. Lot calls went us, too. 

Worse, got hosed last year national championship game. 

It’s bad sad situation.  Aka Woulda, coulda, shoulda.... yeah, well could blow whole world 5 TIMES""

And? going to. lot reasons. i'm saying holding mass gatherings increases spread, greatly increases chances killing relatives, whether siblings, parents grandparents 

The kids get prom. figured. Hope know aren’t trash. Although virus probably makes less obvious can't handle opinions others breeds fascist!

Antifa clothing purchased Hot Topic weeb. Canada uninhabited. Canadian population accounted GTA, Montreal Vancouver. 72% lives 49th parallel. Blanket statements density work. Sure compare NYC northwest Territories going dense that's like comparing Toronto rural areas Midwest fair comparison. 

Both USA Canada areas high density low density Canada low density side simple less people larger country country empty. 

 never said ""never"". 

You really think pandemic gonna last forever?

No one prepare this, schools responsibility ""babysit"" kids go work.

I think many people kids without ""planning"" emergencies. Right now, government providing $ help families everywhere.

This pandemic now, people would wear face mask stay fuck home gov paying us too, we'd see results. well as, Stop sending kids outside without face mask. wearing facemask doesnt mean you'r kids opt getting sick spreading too.

 much people cant afford take care kids, people going prolong pandemic following lockdown (having parties, get togethers, protesting without social distancing), dont complain find numbers spiking teachers dont want around maskless kids. grandmum still thought America kind land free, recently learned otherwise still can't believe says done It’s like book burnings. Literally celebrating stupidity. dude whos going bald, start blaming covid :] wearing mask wrong! Normal people: 2+2 = 4

Morons: I'LL BELIEVE WHATEVER WANT BELIEVE SAY EVER I'LL SLIT THROAT They're saying education bad. They're saying weak US leadership going lead China taken over. don’t even attempt fix mess make rich democratic country good infrastructure middle class. state capable dealing mayor calamities.

That works rough definition. guy makes $50k per year pays taxes CEO making $20m per year. Lmao, can't believe really happened America. mean (since it’s apparently way things handled school) principal get PA tell everyone serious consequences bullying? Little evidence oh, know? Schools *have closed since pandemic got going March*! Duh! People saying stuff must thinking long enough it, another agenda. Honestly, makes think aren't? 

Personally zero us dependency point, could well also remove Reddit list. country imports U.S. gold jewelry, U.S. based tech products taboo anyway bad data treatment. I've isolating 30 days, actually terrible anymore, like I've gotten used Powerful men protect others around them. Wearing mask protects others. Masks = powerful.

Not wearing masks = cowardice. Pathetic cowardly weaklings wear masks. covid, hoax far left deep state. ""died"" really kidnapped sent secret underground factory make vagina hats will. 
 
/s opinions bring hitler back. grandfather fight fascists like you, although probably lying grandfather well, since cannot prove this. Great job allowing scarce rationed medical equipment become first amendment issue point assholes burning masks time hospital asking us reuse ours.

Great job, America. players want play. aren’t ones voted cancel. Politicizing wearing masks costing thousands lives. never made political. Masks prevent virus transmission thus save lives. fact, political statement. please wear mask ffs. look back years thinking stupid were. issue making PPE less profitable whatever else making. government could force companies make PPE not. could also sweeten deal subsidizing PPE manufacturing, far know not. wants voluntarily switch manufacturing something less profitable, even less profitable future pandemic ends? Good people sold lie people control media act much like worst Americans today. 

If change one truth underlies worldview, you’d probably act similar. 

Only questioning things told/sold help expose propaganda. Unfortunately level critical thinking simply unavailable large part world. going follow thought-leader there’s nothing change that. (Though take page manipulator’s handbook reach lead folks truth semblance sanity.) Globalism doesn’t account happens wars pandemics happen, account producer totalitarian dictatorship really doesn’t give fuck anyone else proven fact Florida messing data months; along Colorado, Arizona, Georgia, Texas.

Do sources ""proven facts""? True enough. consider entire personality, used something happy about. much death rate among children low. However ask people keep pushing schools reopen rate, pick kids like die. change opinion unless they're really heartless Thanks. China never stopped flights, flights transmit virus borders, got got it.

It's racism yo!. Btw africans China? good? Lol. fucking depressing labeled good news. Nothing prevents people suing. think lawyer chomping bit file class action pass holders? look extremely weak wearing mask. Weaklings run away fights protect others around them. wearing masks move pussies. 

Powerful men wear masks powerful men protect others around them. 1000 comments 900 times mentioning Sweden pretty telling people downvotes user everytime post, idk considered spam. one older man, wearing “M AGA FIGHT CLUB” shirt: “I’m ready die mission” but: “First all, need get Trump re-elected."" NFL going last 4 weeks. point players simply willing risk it. What's number call Canada? Masks general public clothing, medical supplies. keep sterile afraid touching it. (don't touch peoples masks obviously) general public wearing masks stop breath shot several meters front you. That's it, breath shorter range everyone else's. still get infected infect others.

What surfaces assume people touch mask to? rub face windows pocket home would dresser.

Putting ten times day nothing defeat purpose (the public) wearing masks. interrupt stream breath, nothing more.

If get corona front mask regardless whether decide licking public facing side good idea, obviously stopped particles shot directly mouth nose.

We treat masks used medical setting, people going remove masks pens going treat single use (even hospitals proper surgical/n95s) want rise anti-maskers tell people abide full sterilisation policy face masks.

 Make easy everyone, cover mouth nose kind fabric treat fabric like extra dirty clothes. Treat like courtesy everyone else, send germs reduced speed hopefully everyone else slow germs too. welcome. I'm pretty sure Americans vocal awful healthcare for...ever. understand anyone shocked specific aspect everything going right now. everything else shocks me. nothing shocks anymore, get angry depressed. always selfish people know it, maybe obvious overseas see can't be. Bye bye college Jesus Christ might well said ""I want big ol mass shooting happen!"", would saved time. FRAGILE! Explain statements error. absolutely scale up, that's densely populated areas affected.

Containment measures absolutely scale. properly fund degree scaling necessary.

See China South Korea excellent examples scaling containment absolutely effective done properly. Work sandwich shop lot large catering orders move day. asked classes said it’s gonna 90% online students still move in.” What. Good thing care think! lol Exactly. People act like ""blue"" ""red"" states politically homogeneous. forget even California is, like, 40% Republican Indiana is, like, 40% Democrats. Sports anything life becomes cluster. I'm clinging every second MLB NBA get still shutdown anytime. hate year fucking much. lol many higher education verticals, English enough. Many colleagues speak English job (although also learn German).
Almost younger people speak English. I'll pray them. It’s published peer reviewed. take grain salt. huge cultural event shouldn’t happen? Idk expect happen Where's proof threats? take screencaps them? I'd like read and, typical poor journalistic fashion, article include them. Ah yes, part why: pattern targeted harassment me. said, mass downvoting though, critic speaks issue frequently. 

And anyone wants compare accounts dicuss topic, check top posts. Mine varied , harass tend post Sweden, incidentally accuse of. Wtf spandex Know first trimester babies, you? Oh wait, can’t hasn’t even around long tell. Fertility, pregnancy, fetal development, early childhood development, puberty, idea affects things. George Bush Jr warned 2005 greatest threat USA faced pandemic, following Republican president refuses take measures China applied cities experienced Covid outbreaks. 

The USAs greatest weakness lack leadership.  headline link leads isn’t discussing protest per se; it’s referring event specifically spread virus. 

The webpage contains several titles, here’s one top I’m referring to:

【クラスターデモ】東京都内で意図的にコロナを広めるクラスターフェスが開催「マスクをせずに山手線一周」「蜜になろう」主催者は喉の調子が悪い模様


English: [Cluster* Protest] Cluster Fest, event intentionally spreading coronavirus, begins. “Let’s go around whole Yamanote Line without masks.” “Let’s close other.” Holder event’s throat appears bad state.

*クラスター Cluster loan word that’s used refer concentrated outbreak cases.

The “let’s close other” uses kanji 蜜, first character “three M’s” people told avoid, translate three C’s English: “Close, Closed, Crowded.” essentially they’re saying is, “let’s cultivate space it’s easy coronavirus spread possible.”

What I’ve translated “bad state” means sore throat, something throat, etc.

Edit: added clarifications. one study it?

Have hospitals started using lot yet? seems obvious cap many tests facility requiring set turn around time. continually swamped cases increase. much incentive management expand facilities behind make money. immediate transitioning model providing incentives/guaranteed minimum tests new facility assurance ramp time end pandemic would encourage adequate testing resources overworking employees. would affect unless going too? Lol still posting articles headlines window opportunity passed 6 months ago? real reason is, they're spoiled mama's boy candy asses. giving much shit people even know think point can't even live life make decisions epitome alpha. wish could wake morning instantly mind go men see me. want alpha big boy too. attack ideas. Climate science even stick basic scientific method yet anthropogenic climate change ""fact."" funny job use adjusted data sampling reports I'd fired entire town would end improperly treated sewage. Yes uncontrolled pandemic Sweden spilling border. Norway likely close border again. dangerous. True point wear masks even walking outdoors might see people busy park walk in. [This covid tracker shows 6 deaths last four days (scroll CO's graph). something going here, either site Colorado's reporting methods? Also, significant lag time person dies Covid officially reported. Colorado top reporting lag? 

In short, think actual death numbers particular period honestly accurately reported couple weeks after, least. trying pessimistic, genuine. get antibody test know sure. parents nasty flu feb/March, flu lol Great news  Jo det är jag. Och tro mig som en vänsterröstande svensk så är det inte speciellt kul att se hur illa de har misslyckats med det här. Yeah. younger days worked metal plant rolling 6ft bars tungsten 20ft rods. gassing blast furnace, wear full facemask respirators (aka, gas masks) times winter temps well 100F we'd manhandle 80lb bars 1500C metal rollers pair tongs 12 hours day. 

We lived. extraoplating someone infected constitute everyone. 2 questions potential vaccine:

1. majority population country gotten thr vaccine, return pre-pandemic normal? 

2. people sick survived coronavirus still get vaccine?  Discharged average around 300 day. aren’t experiencing 300 deaths day. certainly dying , mostly discharges hospitals. seriously doubt find definitions first world include anything ""state capable dealing mayor calamities"", convenient insert nonsense try twist things around fit ridiculous opinion.

So Italy, Spain, UK, Belgium Sweden going lose ""first world country status"" definition? mentioned mods several times. don’t think care going leave binoculars needed. probably 100ft away front porch. two possible extremes here, huh? believe earth flat, too?

Because arguments sound like flat earther arguments.

The science done is, fact, ongoing. consensus reached. experts agree. 98% scientists agree. 2% taking oil money like holdouts tobacco sugar studies years ago.

The earth round. Cigarettes cause cancer. Sugar bad you.

What degree in? peer reviewed papers? evidence contradict collective centuries study experience scientific community?

You goddamned thing funded big oil companies.

Your ignorance good knowledge.

Stop spewing shit go back treating it. happen December? can’t people attending events choose themselves? get arbiter lives? made king people stupid enough go huge festivals here, fault Sweden's. bad people need suffer them, too. stayed locked July *only* people must deal consequences feel sorry them.

But anger stems fact garbage-people working hard infect rest us trying best. stupid administrators school threw first punch suspending her. 

Remember, kids, bullying wrong, unless school administrator student says something like! Damn old you? high GDP help way solve ""third world"" issues country facing years? basically show super rich earn lot money? 

If look GDP per capita country U.S. far best, look literally (likely relevant) metric like press freedom human happiness index scroll bit find U.S. well. 

I live third world country rank better literally metric GDP saying US reason world language English? that’s going change China owns companies US. one ever going learn Mandarin. Idk vaccines they’re producing risk Fauci says they’d worldwide availability next spring

If treatment comes would reach greater accessibility quicker people sick need them, especially it’s cheap

If hospital treatment comes roll would quickest three people hospitalized need  Exactly move right every country us blocked entering? Trust would fact conspiracy folks reframed protocol hostile religion free speech. preach power collectivism spiritual communities show complete disregard national global community well being.

You can't falsely scream fire crowded movie theater, harm could boundaries freedom speech allows. feel folks see guardians civil rights. fact, anti-intellectual sheep, discontent government deep level see acts defiance nobel. fact, history judge vein prosecutors Salem witch trails supporters Sen McCarthy. unnamed fear embedded echo chamber social media arrogance ignorance. 

Make mistake, people choose spread virus terrorist. choose words carefully, mean sound hyperbolic. fact intelligence agencies reported, Putin's trolls seeding discontent division utilizing covid wedge issues.

Nothing more. Nothing else. Newsom sleezy liar. hopeful 20% thing. Also, check populated counties , see (except Dallas Miami) start lower daily cases estimated 12% population COVID. gives ton hope. 

 
I live Mexico according website, 11% population contracted now, happens weeks first ones see reduction cases.  


What I'm trying say must combination 20% T-cell article, making 12% percentage where, reason, cases start slow down. Absolutely.  know? Climate change real Al Gore took airplane. get pair binoculars wont get close car. studies coming last month indicate heart, lung, brain damage may prevalent 10% limited serious symptoms requiring hospitalization either. fathers brother

Well gonna weirdest game ""say uncle"" ever. Agreed. certainly coming back due laxity. People disappointing. would one thing speech. However even control social media. father renowned climate change activist do. felt strongly topic felt need go UN would least writing social media posts. must lack conviction. Well see least one person wearing mask thumbnail photo it’s safe say taken current pandemic say...a stock photo 2 years ago Well, eat horses. take long time tourists return numbers.  northeast ... yet see man wearing mask. sounds like mid-west southern bullshit. Stockholm great city. much underrated, people never get there.

But particular issue, national pride infected severe case stupid. 

This human behavior action. Since they're embarrassed admit they've failed, they're doubling circling wagons. people willing admit they've screwed make appropriate changes. Holy cow, 4 syllable word! growing fast live central Florida. say, I'm assuming shut downs hurricane really put testing back, lot centers back online &amp; running full speed right away. However, saw lot masks first started, masks really fell off. Now, masks back me, seems like people wearing ever. positive steps going right direction Things like wishing karma real patient volume go up, severity cases. age patients dramatically fell.

Huh, sound right. even get chance look deleted comment presumably account. super foreign sounding (nothing foreigners all, parents immigrants, OFC involves meddling domestic affairs *while residing outside country* acting interests foreign government enemy) QWERTY123 style?

I think beyond telling deleted comment. Fuck Kremlin astroturfers. Winnie Pooh. Poggers. Kappa. Oh, know. chained $500 month, pay rent late month I'm screwed miss loan payment. day finally caught pretty awful, I'd gone first might able negotiate better. people love talk population density Island

Virtual instruction requires slowing pacing, pinpointing important standards, intentional planning promote student engagement opportunities interact content. district planning remote learning, first day Sept. 8th, training starts today. month get prepared. students consistent routine come start school.

Starting virtual ideal, obviously, it’s better attending person, school closing couple days, going back, knowing long it’s going last. inconsistencies model detrimental student learning. isn’t student learning whole point school? There's always luck factor too. 1 every 5 tests positive

Yet another area, hope see critical analysis cases, things calmed bit U.S. - politically regards COVID-19. reveal anything already know. country lot assholes it. one person virus big deal? wish well, kids sent back school bound catch spread virus loved ones focus what’s going - single individual stay quarantine hopefully (most likely) fine I've always liked term ""Fetishized Individualism "" Kentuckian here, college basketball gets many us fall/winter.

Yeah, folks who've dubious term, this, right here. They’re hour away other. don’t think they’ll much choice, start multiple outbreaks every week they’ll shut whole thing down. don’t think person school last long places either. It’s much disruptive putting everyone quarantine every week go online. That’s weirdest thing me. 

The BEST thing economy, take proper preventions get whole thing control quickly, swiftly reopen little month, basically go back normal maybe wear masks, sort something travel, reduce high populated events like concerts etc etc 

But instead everything’s super fucked co tongue fucked months, maybe even couple years. It’s stupid joke. dig it, Twitter. Fortunately think remember Yep. Other's thoughts real man's actions hold charge him, actions noble. who'd thunk country completely run corporate interests give shit ""poors""? San Diego? thought state acting like complete imbeciles. happened 2008 recession?

Got ya. Masshole men taken giving shit anyone communities whole level. Individualism seems standard. Europe crazy people general public seems community minded. thing spreads like motherfucker point survival rate really doesn’t matter hung someone else said: virus contagious surfaces, we'd already it. Jokes them. already KNEW inconsiderate. throw electronics garbage. us too. really idea, despite living among ""us"" half century. feel US still going remain ""first world country"" despite GDP loss (which happening around world) global pandemic?

Yes. Yes do. I'm confident anyone properly functioning brain feels same. gathering 20000 people masks. Try Reddit. Arguments often end stuff like “without us you’d speaking German” “sounds like need freedom”. latter commonly said ironically always. dad's cousin nursing home caught it. survived infection itself, much damage heart lungs wasting away. transferred hospice care days ago. remember learned I'd *more likely* never see dime social security I've paying since started working 14. watching friends, think idea bubble could work really another family. 

The problem people forming multiple bubbles realizing many people exposing to. Instead family family B interacting, Family hanging family B, also interacting families C D, family B also seeing families E, F G. think they’re safe still “bubbled”. reality, bubble 7 families isn’t even close bubble families C-G also interacting people. work railroad industry every guy work with. Nobody wears mask except me. really sucks people handled whole situation. transmission “cytokines storm” associated severe symptoms. Potentially, people getting mild infections even thinking getting tested. hearsay worth considering experience man, guys try macho also insecure people I've met. think outward display ""macho-ness"" coping mechanism hide insecurity, extension, shame. CoV crisis revealed many things America as... wide political chasm Democratic GOP parties, many businesses badly run behavior actions Americans much toxicity hidden, bubbled see media.

America Americans never embraced melting pot metaphor lots prejudice differences remain. also careful Denmark nordic country registered cases (per capita) right anything weed policies? spitballing I’m lapidary deal silicosis daily. use n-95 p-100 every day extended periods time..for decades I’ve this..no lung problems, problems O2 saturation..NOW BLACKHEADS DAME THINGS..yes, lung problem part God’s Plandemic guess recommending :D yet vast majority gets submitted? you’re saying put institution, aka prison. pays Karen? Oh yeah, do. even that, humans same, even simulation 100% accurate one person, wouldn’t representative entire population Kinda happens let run elderly early on. Yeah, trash shops isn’t going give shit policy is. won’t wear mask many likely get violent told need wear mask. Duh US tested twice many people India second tested country.. mask? Fuck shit. isnt time play game....Jesus. state, quit, can't collect. get fired, can. seriously think consider this? you? fucking unemployment nation wide encyclopedia?

Edit--forgot say know shit. 50% tests per day, = 50% cases seeing testing. bad 75% population gave caring around May 31st. Don’t forget hate lack empathy anyone else. That’s main issue see. Americans selfish society evolved. It’s despicable. hate pessimist, fucked. covid destroy us, next ""thing"" will. hey, conservatives seem content destroying world long keep ""owning libtards"" think history books remember time period lot, actually. hope it’s accurately, turning point. Seriously. think NYC best viewed case study literally everything wrong way late.

Even states like Florida loose policy, compared national average, unlikely reach New York’s total death per capita.

In order achieve Florida’s results, mildly sane policy required (ie: don’t send covid positive patients nursing homes!)

In weeks, case count Florida, Texas, Arizona going low, comparisons New York New Jersey going make clear badly two states messed up. non-pandemic times, usually go Disney parks every weekend (I’m pass holder within reasonable driving distance). park since beginning March.

I tend agree. Trust government still significantly stronger Canada, lockdown ordered people pretty good it.  certainly beat means, [the different shocking. So... believe it’s worldwide conspiracy? 😂😂😂 Wait, USA population 300 million? happening common person cannot afford care. carry jobs lose everything, dying risk we're going take. Ever since started job turned literal hell, I'm berated treated like dirt customers 3+ times day enforcing mask policies. people care. want die decision fate alone, I'll best keep family safe come learn accept death. Probably. whole country getting fucked keep taking without putting fight. don’t blame them...

I guess understanding “excess deaths” looking expected deaths based prior averages comparing current deaths. includes causes death. while, probably undercounting COVID deaths, may undercounting number deaths well. 

In words, may COVID deaths, could end less factor think accurately capturing COVID deaths death certificates.

warrior strength. commentary NZ around COVID shockingly ignorant did, we're currently able do, considering quick bring us up.

I agree NY NZ wildly different, currently, we're able travel countries allowing travel. Yes, we've closed borders non-essential international travelers, entire cast crew Avatar movies considered essential apparently, plenty people still coming provided isolate 2 weeks return negative test. also still 50,000 tourists *in* country. sound like complete isolation me, sensible pacing.

We'll continue listen science respond swiftly accordingly. sake fellow humans, wish everyone government able facilitate same. America country insanely selfish sees people economic inputs system. neighbors, friends, fellow countrymen. simply living day day society soul crushing, filled people blinded racism classism can't make decision unless given add. 

Americans sick. us. Deathly ill, stick big playground kids gave years ago playing without us, what's worse, still delusional. 

When finances leaving. see road ahead. It’s similar situation family. I’m sorry deal top everything else. Family sucks. Americans? anti science crap either neglectful know they're really doing. 

OR 

It's malicious know exactly they're doing. 0 Everyone testing setup. people lucky separate production one. whole sentence nonsense told wear masks (as proven people’s actions since) selfish assholes would’ve hoarded important front-line worker’s PPE’s caused even worse mess.

If people aren’t intelligent enough understand that, point, wouldn’t mattered told wear masks beginning because, quite simply, wouldn’t cared - either way. Wow something agree on... one huge issues US, ""for profit"" model many things instead part social good. healthcare industry one best examples, back wild west doctor would setup shop run business, that's great. rest first world moved realized better suited thing benefits society whole US get past profit motive. layers upon layers businesses lobbying maintain existing structure, insurance industry, for-profit hospitals, drug manufacturers, etc.

They cry ""socialism!"" .. ignore things part social fabric, like infrastructure (roads, schools, bridges, etc.) basically freaking thing. Well course schools sore point seems too, Devos trying darnedest turn profit centers too. here, I'm single live family. anywhere since March except trips work. I'm fortunate employer letting work home, take care things office. Thankfully super empty.

We've ordering groceries staples online (and quarantine snacks imbibements, Lol). eat? Definitely ass. roommate plans continue practicing close proximity teammates without mask amateur sport even picking next year. get tested recently possible exposure work. I'm trying move asap well. two toddlers, one history serious medical problems. I'm SAHM husband working full-time home right now. absolutely DROWNING daily lives - seriously hell managing two bored toddlers completely lockdown - we're privileged send daycare. 

My oldest supposed start preschool year daycare sent last year still open, majority kids parents work essential jobs, mostly medical field. can't imagine sending son, spent first two years life constantly sick hospital, environment freaking pandemic sake convenience.

Neither kids fully potty trained, neither sleeps night consistently, bored right take time energy. outside socialization outlets everything either closed unsafe here; even public playgrounds shut awhile. We're basically resigned fact year spent survival mode. we're dealing it, sake kids whose parents choice. paying? ""you"" lmao read study. basing OB nurses recent experiences talked reddit. It’ll glorious guys re-elect Trump “Biden old president”. One ships first fleet 90% 17-20yos young children pregnant. often arrested stealing food eat.

After years hard labor here, given land started building westernised Australia.

A country built working together, mateship adversity challenging conditions.

So, opposite USA, arrived look better life, themselves. look themselves. land 'me' 'us'. know vast majority Americans don’t care think actions won’t affect me. 

This absolutely true. majority people support mask mandates. majority support national 2 week shutdown. 90% oppose reopening schools. loudmouths see news social media fringe.   Sandy Hook showed us children also don’t matter people. Earlier pandemic (and lesser extent now), brand new pet peeve mine. need multiple people store! MAYBE literally stocking months time, seeing people 10 things cart, three people household. Ugh. said last post, live NYC. hardest hit area US. Everyone know it, recovered. I’m denying deaths, I’m saying people recover. Government (specifically Trump bootlickers) care. could die give shit long taken care of. Americans always unfounded ego themselves, ignorant belief they're greatest country world. bread day one, even pledge alleges flag daily basis school (which slowly phased now). results much ignorance realities world. America flawed, incredibly flawed severely corrupt.

This ignorance go away anytime soon Americans willfully forget COVID ever happens 10-20 years.

Those learn history are doomed repeat it. This. suprised prision outbreaks getting coverage, considering could break surrounding communities. know many prisoners probally extreamly hateful things, mean shoudl pretend COVID 19 prison problem exist. Even hate people done, much care them, virus could spread surrounding communites,, creat alot problems, one reason care. Orlando resident pass holder never closing early ever. 100% sane person fucking going there. guess wear goggles too? Dude let go, people get sick, won't. People willing give way life due virus 99% survival rate, they.  China's lock downs easily draconian world, track trace brought quickly country, government afraid act like authoritarian totalitarian dictator, people complain en masse locked high rises. 

I doubt country numbers exactly right doubt China's fairly realistic. working January still Chinese foreign colleagues there. Lol nyc testing. march 6th usa whole 2000 test skorea day 140 thousand test. Nyc shut march 17 gauge wide spread virus was. Thats difference 

You cant ways. U claim nyc herd immunity thats low levels infection bay area low levels infection well yet never reach herd immunity. low infection today implemented rules preven spread. Thats upstate ny never influx cases like bay area. 

Bay area shut early cases low florida n texas look now. Bay area better implemented rules minimize spread. Thirty percent every large group people assholes. estimation based exclusively experience US. can’t help wonder it’s everywhere America ended extra assholes Bandanas nothing. Oh man, putting chips TESTS too? Lol (/s) exactly they're dumb. teachers know aware disinfecting almost pointless. makes parents feel better sending kids higher ups know they're doing. Teachers choice. hygiene theater know puppets I’ve dollar store once. stand said. 250k January given. Still many months beyond deal this. Yup. hard 6 week lockdown, everyone paid stimulus food water rent etc. also group causes trouble society due unemployment gender imbalance, elites nothing. Aussie stuck US, proud mates back WA. Good damn good conversations outside, 1st amendment activities allowed state dumb still obese that's 3 months hospital. already known symptoms worse obese people. underlying health condition. obese person 3 times likely severe covid symptoms. Every time read articles someone age already know they're obese. look picture since article conveniently. Lmao, world needs build wall around US now. good take know happened Spain healthcare system completely different I'm curious bill something like like esp. usa? seeing stories people spending months hospital million dollar medical bills after... seriously expected pay it? billing everything taken care of? people really surviving covid walking hospital million dollar bill? thats case imagine ton people filing bankruptcy year. This. understand everyone seems collectively forgotten federal government actively prevented state spinning labs, delaying local response spread undetected. marry live Canada? ;) time, feel like crazy.

Family co-workers keep telling like flu. Or, effects people pre-existing conditions. 

Family constantly posting photos visiting places &amp; keep asking wife child go them. Given father-in-law died back May COVID19, disturbing. 

Co-workers management stated overreacting one know died. mentioned FIL, dismissed excuse hospitals get money putting death certificates. I'm fortunate company work us work remotely, I'm afraid due would perceived current clients. national shutdown stay home except groceries pharmacies, health visits way I’m visiting Ozarks MO right literally give sh*t. masks anywhere... none waitresses, none inside restaurant people walking around, none gas stations. It’s kind freaking out. March know contagious is. towns get hard shows up. We’re getting started baby. Buckle up. sad. everything life affect working class americans most? hate it. think something like virus would great equalizer, rich people afford go work limit interaction.i hate it.

TBH think would cool every single person liked neither two main candidates voted third party something changes. understand happen though. 

Swing voters real though. 

And really two groups decide *every single presidential election*:

1.	Swing voters.
2.	People stay home.

People religiously vote party line never decide elections. things right now, barely even matter. Presidential elections decided entirely people willing switch sides people stay home.

Understanding automobiles rocket science increased tremendously too, yet still go boom periodically. ame students (who visit multiple classrooms) teachers (who host multiple classes) space (desks, cafeterias,etc) whole school one big super spreader. people go home families, go work possibly schools.....an absolute mess community spread. think misunderstood. would kid quarantined another adult working there. in, would remove kid exposed his/her whole class stick room adult watch get ahold parents pick up. think statement twisted journalism... definitely wearing mask ppe work, cant ""not"", setting,its hard do. youd get pulled shift pretty much instantly,and isolated. sure trying say wearing mask public setting, weird, like nurses start feel invincible think danger work anything public worried ""overreaction"". would great reminder young beginners healthcare danger starts outside workplace begin with... Let’s pretend it’s money coming from, it’s also issue it’s going. US seen ~$4.5T passed stimulus funding throughout crisis, rest assured effects reached Americans equally.

Hell, every single American, 380B them, every man, woman, child, infant, citizen undocumented, received $1200 stimulus check back March/April - certain every American - would account 10% $4.5T. could kill anyone death row prevent getting covid. 🤯😷🖖 That's entire problem though! Every country listens medical experts, wears masks observes social distancing. America! Years slashing educational funding anti-intellectualism made proud ignorance political stance currently holding highest office crafting jaw-dropping failure. 

We treat right absolute idiot face overwhelming evidence important actual, hard-fought constitutional rights. Someone dumb enough equate facebook research medical school **should not** considered valid dissenting opinion, put rest us risk end here, world's saddest punchline country. Full stop. Exactly.

*If ruler listens lies, officials wicked.*

*The poor man oppressor common: LORD gives light eyes both.* Coronavirus used mutate! bullshit right, actual truth entire opposite. Many cases undercounted, investigated filed pneumonia old age etc. Overall death rates increased significantly official Covid stats indicate. people stop idiots. There’s another fantastic mask filter Europe U-Earth Biotech combines nanofiber filter germ killing layer.

This sounded interesting, checked customer reviews online, apparently it’s really badly made, uncomfortable poorly fitting. addition, possibly doesn’t nose clip makes even harder fit bad us 4-eyes. something seriously screwy happening testing data recently. California ""bug"" apparently starting July 25 caused something like 300,000 records get recorded, look linked site see total number tests recorded TX plummeted since around time.

Good old-fashioned incompetence always option, sudden reversal exists states long start CDC / HHS debacle makes seem like bit coincidence. much individualism. much junk food. much divide liberal conservative. enough sunshine/vitamin D. enough outdoor activity.

Nothing special. know Columbus area? Looking visit unsure tbh mask usage all... go restaurants, hotels, bars, cafes, shops museums, etc...  run tourists well? people work go home family friends.

Sigh. talking risk infection. talking epidemic drivers. Visitors drive epidemics *already* community spread country. added risk insignificant. capable following simple procedures (keep distance, wash hands, go feel ill) locals risk becomes even trying blame schools taking winter break week later surrounding countries

Sigh again. Winter break Sweden mean *parents* kids go trips abroad places like Italy winter sports. Stockholm winter break coronavirus spread really took Europe rest world. later rest Sweden also Denmark Norway. country shutting down, Sweden saw opportunity invite EEA huge Covid Swap party.

Sweden closed borders countries outside EU/EEA solidarity members. support science closing borders significant effect epidemic spread. take word it. Sundhedsstyrelsen, Danish public health substantial scientific evidence works great effect is. confirmed director Søren Brostrøm National Board Health press conference Saturday.  political decision based many considerations. significant scientific evidence much effect have. historical experience regarding influenza pandemics, says.  stated recommendations World Health Organization European Communications Agency, ECDC, something recommended starting point relation epidemic control.

HOWEVER, looking back history, wary vaccine that's created months. flu isolated US 1933, come vaccine 40s, given military year given citizens. flu shot took nearly ten years develop test, doubts better technology, better research now, 90 years ago. do, however, conflicting data floating around things COVID. beginning US, said would take least 12-18 months come vaccine. Suddenly, we're looking one end year. also president orange head far rectum, anything get reelected. Seeing suggested people inject bleach themselves, really think he's putting vaccine fully tested, fully regimen clinical trials? 

Back pro science- know what's neat science? changes based scientific study evidence. know MMR vaccine worth risk side effects, decades data telling us side effects are, data, know vaccine due allergies medical conditions make vaccine dangerous them, must rely herd immunity.

No, dingbat, want everyone wear masks shutdown. Get head ass. no-true Scotsman fallacy.

Americans keep trying deny anything wrong country saying shitty people common representative. Yet, look are. 50,000 cases day. 1000 deaths day.

Canada meanwhile 300-500 cases day 5-10 deaths day. That'd like US 3000-5000 cases day 50-100 deaths. Yet, US never achieve that.

The longer deny something fundamentally wrong country, longer keep parading propaganda ""freedom"" ""patriotism"" go ""no true Scotsman"" country goes drain. testing cases gotten severely sick source others getting sick.

Things going get weirder Nov approaches. Lmao Americans good keeping opinions themselves. Shut dude. Meh still got local high school games kicking next week. tide Fall. I’m still pretty adamant opinion postponed spring Wow... wearing masks end Feb. Alabama. dirty looks real. 

The mask thing huge tactical error government. never reluctant share nuance behind early guidance wear masks. make things worse later on. heard doc WVsaid they've found virus mutated less severe form! want say anything would downplay people's/usa's mitigation efforts.

Way go Desantis ruin everything. living fantasy world ignoring actual people making vaccine said.

There 3 phase 3 trials.

AstraZeneca started US said hope FDA would still grant EUA phase 3 trials nations. They've said EARLIEST could apply EUA September.

Pfizer Moderna said EARLIEST could apply October.

That apply.

It would take time get approval. takes time distribute.

All 3 candidates requiring 2 shots month apart.

If US able start mass vaccinations 1 MILLION people per day would Christmas 10% population vaccinated.


If able get 4 million day end year would still around March US reached herd immunity.

Again using BEST CASE scenario.

Any slight hiccup delay it.

If 3 fail concerns safety mRNA vaccines mean least mid late 2021 vaccinations.

I'm actually giving absolute BEST case scenario. CHECK ORDER GOVERNORS GAVE COUNT DEATH CCP VIRUS !!!

 
Los Angeles basically stuck plateau wrt cases deaths. 

Here’s latest charts, plus running 7-Day LA slightly worse average terms per capita deaths. They’re currently 49.31 deaths per 100k. US average 48.81. “If piece cloth could wear mouths noses prevent spreading.” data 6 months ago showed it....

literally compare infection rates country country. anomoly countries flattened curve, google get there. EASIEST thing world figure out. 

Americans embarrassed fucking ashamed. can't eradicate virus, give eventually allow infect everyone? CTE strong one spare us catch bat aids please. NYC saw around 20,000 deaths, serological studies suggest 20% population infected time period. 20K around 1.6M IFR 0.8%. Public schools open end shutting down. amazing continue make mistakes over. Dunno national, area deliver free Doordash order 15 bucks worth stuff Seems like everyone knows Doctors COVID Personally, stop sheltering Americans vaccinated. However, death fear; long-term sequelae. might go back hugging virus becomes rare. Midwest guy here, seems mentality “we’re tired this”, virus cares. also believe much Midwest become northern extension south. I'm offended challenging perspective. defend pointless rhetoric name calling actual constructive thinking.

Or place it? say Americans care, seem care lot. know alot others too. wish every country peace health. many citizens ancestors around globe.

As challenging people US....i going local government town hall meetings, write political leaders, vote.

I disagree simple black white way thinking entitled it. wish luck health sincerely. certain wasn’t “the flu”? predict open back Canada indeed much better cases like nuclear option best. rule thumb debate people work worst-case scenario mindset, sorry. living fantasy world bluecamel2015 said  new narrative take away sacrifice New Yorkers pretend COVID actually ""miraculously disappear."" shame instead using learned people trying convince people die unnecessarily. unfortunately cant. think running distraction thing happened election well presidency. calmed 2018-2019 pop back right pandemic started getting bad. He’s genius say Sure Jan. Well, science begs differ garbage studies, late stage patients HCQ administered e.g. toxic doses chloroquine reaching quadruple dosages even high 2400mg. litarally murder.
*Garbage studies = lancet ( gold standard ) retract study fraudulent. 

HCQ, zinc azithromycin cure stage one ( early treatment) outpatient approach, way be. Patients breath 4-6 hours. believe you. advocate switching masks provide higher level personal protection. face shield goggles.

Full face respirator it. later week  southern Illinois county well ppl started posting Facebook trip Florida, ""sigh"", guessed happened next.  Great news! damn religious, anti-science nut jobs. cares sent man moon invented Internet. punt. stoppable. People need follow guidelines can’t even basics. regularly see people masks pulled down, covering noses close proximity other. guess don’t know time wear mask ALSO stand least 6 feet away even wearing mask. I’m going bother commenting complete asshole behavior throwing going large parties events like Sturgis. probably lot people feel like Nostradamus reincarnate predicting this. scenario playing week week, state state, nothing fore gone conclusion virus capabilities. almost note worthy month so. live town germany 0 active cases. last info 6 active cases 31 quarantined.

We 26 now.

Why cases again? Well, vAcAtIoN... “And again, nobody close critical shape, people deal things comfortable all. hopefully get behind them. They're getting great care.”

Ahhhhh panic!!! ...Why even news? None feels real,.. bad dream,... yet hit us smack face!!! Reality set yet think feel many denial. best thing NY, really doesn’t seem give shit anyone thinks point. someone works healthcare, south Florida less. Let tell you, old folks don’t give shit corona. work radiology xrays cat scans. Pre corona seeing 80 pts day. slowed lot put last Friday nearly 60 pts, returning normal.    

Anyway want say this. Young people age 40 wear mask, thank service, generally best can.   

It’s old folks, 60 crowd, especially 80. don’t care. respect health care workers. Old folks think entitled free healthcare everyone slave. Old people worst. spread diseases like other. Old folks reason corona crazy. They. Don’t. Care. 60 like stop caring fellow man. Old people worst. can’t stop corona old folks get check. rate long-term consequences significantly higher. agree still go back normal. dispute relevance IFR whenever pops here. I'm sheltering home IFR. want mf all. Probably sound advice really still lead life building instruction instead campus development Pure insanity. Nearing 1 million death worldwide, surprised poor reporting people counting heart attacks, etc covid deaths passed 1 million already. wonder long get 30, 40 50 millions cases reported rate? far actual cases, still ~10x reported cases, around 200 million people infected far? 

The amount long term health-related issues result pandemic really hurt across world years come even vaccine. organ damage people suffering despite obvious signs symptoms mostly ignored think move pass short-term damage (if ever do) see true impact pandemic life expectancy quality life. like misread article numbers instead pointing went super long rant made wild assumptions.

You didn’t *misread* article, giving benefit doubt..lol. still didn’t understand *death rate* vs CFR IFR, didn’t understand they’re likely spread virus risk that’s problem, still didn’t bother looking data see said correct. completely independent “misreading”. fuck can’t read one page article? It’s like 2min read max. 

Did read article accurately? 
Did still come give opinion? can’t directly compare flu covid deaths like infinite wisdom, CDC tracks deaths age group different two viruses historical data sets, dumb. find chart comparing flu February till now. super dumb flu season Oct Feb surprise surprise flu death numbers lower. 

Here go again, leaking actual shit brain onto internet see regard actual data look that, clinical public health labs showed peak %+ flu season tests February goes entire month. **you’re** one making wild assumptions. **In past 36 years flu often peaks February:** seasonal influenza (flu) viruses detected year-round United States, flu viruses common fall winter. exact timing duration flu seasons vary, influenza activity often **begins increase October. time flu activity peaks December February, although activity last late figure shows peak flu activity United States month 1982-1983 2017-2018 flu seasons. “peak month flu activity” month highest percentage respiratory specimens testing positive influenza virus infection influenza season. **During 36-year period, flu activity often peaked February (15 seasons)**, followed December (7 seasons), January (6 seasons) March (6 seasons).

February fine month start compare covid deaths flu deaths peak flu season. argument it’s flu season earlier flu deaths lower due isn’t factual goes data you’re claiming cite. 

What said? Oh yea: doesn’t care narratives.

Lol. Ironic. comparing deaths though infections different numbers overall cases. 

Yes, covid much contagious, every child US caught viruses flu would likely claim lives. isn’t reality we’re faced though; children catch sars-cov-2 year catch influenza, it’s **very** real possibility covid claim lives school aged children 2020-21. flu deadly terms pure IFR specific age groups, isn’t contagious lower mortality raw instead historical flu death data year year see deaths 18 compare total covid deaths 14 categories see even missing 4 years ages, numbers aren’t even close.

2018-19: [477 estimated pediatric [643 estimated pediatric [251 estimated pediatric [268 estimated pediatric [803 estimated pediatric full seasons worth *estimated* influenza pediatrics deaths. 5 year avg 488 pediatric deaths/year. 

[The CDC actually show deaths covid range separate chart. according total deaths ages: data missing ~3 weeks worth deaths, ~14% current total. knowing infer current 76 pediatric deaths likely missing data well somewhere ~11 deaths. around 87 pediatric deaths total. Remember schools open long many children catch disease. seeing bound pass yearly deaths flu? Even rate we’re currently at: 25 kids month alone, course year adds bound increase dramatically schools open. citing kid illness emotional argument work shut schools riskier pathogens like flu unless really bad.

Again: Children still spreading it, that’s main focus, terms *total* deaths kids covid come top. absolutely beat flu deaths college highschool students well, hey let’s ignore stats. argument instead towards ""how best protest teachers parents students"" focus mitigation efforts there.

In US that’s problem. Masks politicized there’s inherent distrust authority hundreds thousands kids young teens inside small rooms hallways hours time. It’s possible keep cases thousands school districts opening. chance mitigation comes schools months ago, needed planning, fucked still deciding move forward. everywhere read “it’s hoax” “it’s conspiracy” “we need get life”.

One things like other. Portland strip clubs per capita major american city. Why? idea -- part K-RAZY north american landscape. maybe I'm wrong. Maybe Quebec strip clubs per capita north america. 

But, course, US must number **one** every way -- strip clubs, pandemic deaths, murders police, corrupt politicians, sociopaths wealth, on. 

Nonetheless, also stands everyone acculturated fear STDs, thinks strip clubs ""safe"". reality is, deadly disease transmissible simply breathing, US completely stupid, even smarter cities. Portland smart. thing is: must face stupid culture made us.

I taught kids things sure right -- one encoded lesson:

YOU SMART STUPIDEST PERSON ROOM.

Obviously, definition ""room"" debatable. needed study know this? Well, alternatives might include beating people won’t loose chains, example. 20 million cases US 5 million 25%. One worldwide metric US also holds 25% prison population. US citizens also limited leaving united states due countries restricting access. Good times.  Portland could use little Jesus tbh understand headline trying say think entire month June proved isn’t. many people saying virus mutates whole time. ever vaccine then? watch briefings? like week never minced words, used term ""federal government"" It’s this. It’s “I don’t want to” bullshit justifications. guys ever accept help China Polio *nearly* eradicated, anti-vaxxers prevented that. see would 4% known cases, know cases. Wary taking geometry lessons PoopLoofah... No, sympathize antivaxxers, actually dangerous population refuse vaccines... 

Umm. ...that around decades.

Ah, saving caveat. pro vaccine.

As continue contrive reason get vaccine. freely admit doctor, scientist, immunologist, virologist, appreciate believe science. HOWEVER, looking back history, 

Despite you’re saying obviously *don’t* believe understand science time. wary vaccine that's created months.

Why reasons matter? science says trials ensure safety. aren’t anti-vax need beginning US, said would take least 12-18 months come vaccine. Suddenly, we're looking one end year. 

Why misgivings valid anti-vaxxers? They’re based evidence science are. Seeing suggested people inject bleach themselves, really think he's putting vaccine fully tested, fully regimen clinical trials?

What’s matter *are* going regimen clinical trials? no, don’t trust I’m willing admit mistrust apprehension share anti-vaxxers. I'd like give science time make sure long term effects vaccine. can't sit say trials tested that, particular strain virus less year.

They tell within months. point 6 years trials isn’t show happens six years. It’s logistically test lot people. trials huge, cover that. simply scientifically valid argument clinical trials can’t done safely inside year. You’re arguments exactly like anti-vax position contrive rational sounding argument that’s ultimately informed intuitive. mean don’t think that’s necessarily wrong, *when it*. That’s hypocrisy I’m drawing attention to. Literally, US Department Health Human Sciences page, says takes YEARS vaccines tested ... I'm trying asshole it, google searches tells usual time frame developing new vaccine. 

Do googling see though. It’s logistical. 1 year phase i, 2 phase ii, 3 phase iii. It’s see happens 6 years. It’s test lots people. doesn’t take 1, 2, 3 6 years see long term effects think unreasonable want wait 6 months see happens first wave public receive vaccine. can't tell difference crazy facebook mom refuses get child MMR vaccine, someone nervous first covid vaccine becomes available, know say that. Agree disagree?

Well, think you’ll learn 6 months science didn’t year clinical trials? doesn’t really make sense me, no. don’t think it’s unreasonable anti-vax. think it’s public health agencies adequately address concerns. don’t believe concerns crazy like don’t think concerns crazy. They’re completely valid answered satisfaction. don’t think you’re anti-vax you’re explaining aren’t going take vaccine regardless think it’s opportunity look consider aren’t necessarily *crazy* either.  GL US Chinese style lockdown lol. hate word much principle, assuming showered day, dick isn’t really dirtier hands... indeed, likely less lest exposed environment...

Totally different thing #2.

It’s still putting though. wash hands. agree, numbers. need talking long-term consequences. terrible Polio, people continued lives, except areas outbreaks. similar cov.  overseas Pakistani skeptical too. hospitals clearing graveyards longer filling up. looks legit, uncle aunt doctors think too, though judging downvotes appears don’t want true.

Seems like stroke luck rather strict implementation proper procedures, hey we’ll take it. Eventually ""get back normal life gatherings economic prosperity"" win out. current course sustainable. right. never seen riding one mask within past couple months. initial thought perhaps bit cautious. hey, better not. Well, complete hearsay disinformation attempt shrugged facts.

Fauci knew 2005. called cure vaccine SARS. 

\- HCQ/AZ/Zn, 99.3% outpatient survival rate (Zelenko) - reduces mortality (Henry Ford): w/ 0.5% mortality rate (Raoult) : Raoult one highest regarded scientist subject world BTW.

The lancet retract study complete garbage fraudulent, basis scepticism HCQ. 

Other studies attempted discredit HCQ used quadruple dosages chloroquine 2400 mg obviously toxic doses.

HCQ perfectly safe highly effective treating defeating SARS2-COV19. 

Here's list HCQ overdoses entire archive pubmed: 41 results, one death 2.5 year old kid getting 12000 mg.

 

HCQ alone answer. 

The answer HCQ, Zinc azithromycin. 

Budesonide, Zinc azithromycin works really well too, combined HCQ. 

It's flu time people get proper treatment.  No. Cardinals roster average age 27-28. people tip-tip shape still falling victim terrible virus. I’m sorry, but... *that headline.* sounds like weather report, prepared see something like that.

“Now long-range forecast. Heading start week we’re expecting see highs around fifty, chance showers Wednesday. Make sure pack gloves Friday, we’ll expecting see COVID index jump ‘light’ ‘severe’...” dumb, ignorant, anti-science people getting slightly kinda design, no? ones would social-distance do, get less social-distancing works. 100% difference significant enough. common illness severe fit young adult they're given IV fluids. Uncontrollable vomiting diarrhea usually takes get hearty person point. Otherwise, well, drink fluids. 

Other young adult COVID survivors complained combination severe nausea, weakness high unrelenting fever. Rather unpleasant. ...they predicted overnight recession would continue spiral control, hundreds thousands job losses. nobody gives gave shit pound already overvalued dropping, fact told *frequently* would happen people.

you're missing forest trees, predicted meteor would strike destroy earth, elvis would come back dead bear would shit woods. get props getting one three, insignificance one prediction outweigh *enormous* weight carried others, call cooking historical books.

put simply, made egregious, outlandish predictions based pressures objective fact, categorically, **disastrously** suppose still say ""but exactly 2 years unbelievably wrong 4 predictions!""

you get make kinds predictions, set time frame tell us ""well four five six eight years something might happen!"", sounds like doomsday cults promise us they're always right, nailed date. way anyone deserve kind leeway bullshit. hope get okay Gotcha thanks  Agreed. always extreme groups (don't want take vaccine want leave house tell 2025+) minority. early/Spring 2020 see taking place aggressively. vaccine (even 50% effective) enough years better vaccines come also.

People meant social. Staying home 2+ years SIP fantasy land (few resources well government support probably run year...).   Marketwatch loving comment..... keep em coming Fauci!! union  REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE **Reflecting series mistakes made tonight (potentially come) 😟**

*My first mistake:* clicked link see worshipping situation (was church, outside, related protests, unrelated, etc.).

*My second (and biggest) mistake:* read article.

*My third mistake:* thought myself, ""Hmmm people know misleading headline draw article heads directions may expected.""

*My fourth (and recent) mistake:* decided write post let know made several mistakes reddit post. warned. (And mistake taking forever get point.) Educate beyond preferred conclusions. free remain ignorant science begs differ. makes stop 500k? US cases (and track deaths) entirety EU countries like India China billion people.

The US 100x many cases death *per capita* China. *ground zero*. incorrect worse position use deaths per capita, apparently us US thats disaster Sweden somehow isn't?

Unless live New Zealand, suggest shut fuck handle well, except New Zealand none us did. Really? spend 15-20 days year skiing year Colorado I've seen couple times.  Great political insight master thinker George Lucas. next, Indiana Jones Crystal Skull analysis Suez Canal. Lots drugs look good early trials. promising, let’s wait confirmation another trial two start going hydroxychloroquine it.  insanely accurate.

I went grocery store boyfriend young child yesterday, us wearing masks. child really good lately using manners, washing hands best behavior, picked toy there. get register cashier really polite, asked bf's child got toy good. told whole spiel getting rewarded good large stretch time, cashier said: ""there far many adults need lesson.""

It really disheartening hear people, shitty American adults general. try come without mask pitch fit ""bUt MuH rIgHtS"" try push way store. bagger guy veteran Christ sakes, (rightfully so) downright pissed fought country, *for people*, realize apparently society supporting. bunch whiny little shitheads negatively preoccupied ""being told do"" freaking pandemic willing scream at, berate/belittle, even initiate physical altercations it.

At point time, bf supposed taken 2 different mini vacations, one postponed *hopefully* December. ridiculously selfish, dense people refuse wear masks, stay isolated properly quarantine they're sick COVID positive, we're probably going get trip anywhere year. places require two week quarantine time arrival, places allowing Americans inside borders all. Can't say blame places least bit, seeing America first place model *not handle* global pandemic.

I get it, people want live lives, go places, see things, visit family, etc. shit going away anytime soon, people indulge self-centered petty bullshit sake ""sticking man"", reason restrictions still place. seen rumors world going US $. would devastating. see Finch downgraded credit. I'm 38, believe I'll ever get retire. I'm educated stable career also belong first year millennials. many friends early 40s may easy previous generation, escaped struggles years younger. know people age optimism. exceptions know married good dual income lucky enough one rare lucrative careers. rate going American Medicare within months. (USA) ever listened? anyone....ever? child rather touch burner see hot, trust someone telling us is. Yeah, but, again, happening everywhere. BC exception. Germany went 250 cases 500 1000 per day like month. told expect increase cases, everyone's surprised happening. Good rebuttal there, lol. revealed lot ""Me! Me! Me!"" mentality. full rocks? Must ... fight ... downvote trolls ... dividing us further, showing us divisions existed growing time. 

It's also, frankly, giving us common enemy. sure take America’s response relates desire practice medicine. Giving sarcastic yelp review America’s response covid way denotes professional ambitions guess doctors supposed politically correct time even trying save lives pandemic face pay cuts, lack PPE, ever growing restrictions practice can’t even consulted use hydroxychlorquine lambasted cure TV. please use prove nonexistent point. post CORONAVIRUS relief bill coronavirus? Europeans wanting us less freedom sort reason country exists first place, I'm glad hear we're still right track.   sort of, think. folded tent far early far easily presidential runs.

I still think could 2016 fought it. forgive him, since think genuinely trying avoid we're dealing right now. But, know, are.

In ways he's independent, can't seem stop protecting DNC chips down, even harms (and us). test active form, even admit currently approved test bioavailable 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, although Thadhani colleagues working one filed patent. 

They basing belief bone health drawing big conclusions without evidence.

I read article linked study article. asking evidence toxicity. Obviously people darker skin evolved areas sun evidence prevent Vit toxicity proven study seen. 

In fact case Vit toxicty seen guy taking 4,000,000 IU day manufacturing error (should 2,000 IU). never seen case study someone toxic levels sun/skin exposure. Considering number whites living sunny climates I'm sure would common actually occurred.

 going make snarky comment like ""Is 2nd Florida I'm unaware"" see confusion people time.

You're looking CUMULATIVE hospitalizations. get negative hospitalizations means literally everybody see's ""new high"" every time COVID-19 hospitaliation.

You're confusing cumulative vs current census Florida specifically report hospitalizations peaked July 22 9508. 

Florida's current hospitalizations 6949.

Florida's hospitalizations 27% last 3 weeks.  Newsflash: America's dumbass handling covid information regarding pandemic. Shocking know apology. fully expect next argument it’s anti American schools closed. That's true; however, bars etc. responsible substantial outbreaks, occurred Berlin day. BC government imposed tougher restrictions bars clubs re: infections stemming said establishments couple weeks ago. derived idea hypocritical bad thing, idiot also bad thing. Therefore, anyone calling anyone else idiot, would knowing idiot. Believe me, I’ve ashamed American time now. put needs corporations needs people. paying debt now. 4 cards left student loans. save 100k downpayment house 15yr plan pay fast possible. main thing hoping 15 yr old cars make another 5 years main concern pedantics. u/DakodaMountainborn right end conversation. pointless analysis.

The federal government should, help public health officials, craft response caters citizen demographics, especially reason believe virus significantly effects certain demographics others. interesting. hope commenter right get back soon! people don’t live here. It’s always way Poll poll, recently Gallup poll July 13, found American men likely wear masks compared women. Specifically, survey found 34 percent men compared 54 percent women responded “always” wore mask outside home 20 percent men said “never” wore mask outside home (compared 8 percent women). 

? kill old people? 

Huh? point US military guarantees fuel logistics heat house, drive vehicles, cook local area livable infrastructure. second sentence incoherent jargon. guess American lead water fucked reading comprehension.

I tell way got defensive find position valid. 

You understand find analysis conclusions flawed? 

That's jargon? teach basic logic from? Funny kind often responds way confronted hard facts. believe anti-Semites completely unaware absurdity replies. know remarks frivolous, open challenge. amusing themselves, adversary obliged use words responsibly, since believes words. anti-Semites right play. even like play discourse for, giving ridiculous reasons, discredit seriousness interlocutors. delight acting bad faith, since seek persuade sound argument intimidate disconcert. **If press closely, abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating phrase time argument Jean-Paul Sartre I'm millennial cringe every time see one these. constant reinforcement victim complex makes harder people get lives together feel like deck unfairly stacked there's nothing do.

With exception severe medical issues (mental physical,) ability affect change life far greater recession, pandemic, outward forcing. worry, racked $55k student loans stupid Bachelor's like rest lol. choices, strategize, move forward. meh, dickhead back too. plenty better psychobilly bands that's thing important lesson trying escape class. escaped middle class life, barely, military route. student debt, foot mental health never same.

Potato, potato. facts. 

&amp;#x200B;

you know going popular bring salad facts party. Sometimes even get national platform position leadership/power so! Sorry see dumb person, tell em they're dumb trying say is, Europa country. best acknowledge continent country.

Wow. Please, keep talking. insightful. Make sure tell roommate viruses one things pass blood brain barrier.. skin baby get virus cause serious birth defects.

Edit: [also video last Sunday 

lol find funny media commented still process finding photo came however able find less minute.  observe even split males females wearing/not wearing mask. Sure *some* men might wearing masks reasons, promise majority completely different reasons. Let’s drop nonsense. hit phase 3? Bc started reopening little Canada day daily cases quintupled lost huge chunk younger people terms following mandates. We’re heading either massive spike back restriction - especially since school reopening “plan” currently insane “pretend kids don’t spread Covid” phase right now. Americans dumb fuck. friend works cashier restaurant said ""I know mask going help protect floors counters dirty fuck nasty germs"" sooooo true. work Amazon, private office. keener back always tried best things efficiently possible. ""they"" came. lazy fucks ganged me. One told ""Hey... Stop working hard ok? to... make us look bad, something bad going happen"" real WTF moment. point can't move can't afford move first place. completely agree you. progressives want improve ones keep eye for.

The DNC really care improving country per se. slightly less capitalistic GOP would rather hand victory conservatives real progressive take them. I'm glad pulled kids out. hope stay safe. :) believe entirely president. Let's forget America chose president. Also president bad citizens would smart go outside much believe situation could much better. Sadly USA seems individual culture, least way countries world. mean normal American give shit rules things anyway. Like protests, countries something would organized way everyone stands close BLM protests. protests complete chaos. really think Black Lives Matter, maybe consider protesting distant way. even decent amount Americans believe corona real. I'm saying president blame, that's weird guy he's definitely trying make look like he's well. bad president problem I'm sure would've better. country meets every objective metric regards first world. Every reputable list first world countries America it. know really hate US can’t make stuff up. US counted deaths way Sweden does, US would Sweden deaths/million. stands, US passing Sweden end August. they'll keep going going hit 1k/million next year. Sweden least accessible healthcare, unlike US.   let perfect enemy good.

What impressively idiotic response. 

We're talking perfection. We're talking good, solid policy people support. Genuinely, policymakers reason policy already. 

The problem politicians me. 

And trying sell people politicians answer us consequences ignoring people. 

And that, mysterious mechanism, politicians ignore us long enough might killed it.

And desire engage idiocy. could played football better response earlier no.  Probably less 50 million afford resorts mad decided go Marxists movement? mad choose vote candidate ""history"" affinity preteen girls?

Apparently response tells wanna civil. Public health authorities don’t want healthy Americans, want cash cows big Pharma buddies book literally changed life. entire worldview fundamentally altered reading could recommend emphatically.

This quote, obviously important, essentially 30 second soundbite. Read rest. beautiful start finish. Really? Data National Health Interview Survey (1997–1998) found men living center cities likely obese (39.4%) suburban men (35.5%). Similarly, 20.6% center city dwelling women obese vs. 19.1% suburban dwelling women Significantly rural women lived poverty, reported poorer health status, greater prevalence obesity. Urban women next highest obesity rate moderate health status. healthiest group lowest obesity poverty rates suburban women.

[Obesity health status rural, urban, suburban Southern Oh lord. smartest people society often sound like prophets retrospect. really current administration. come said lock wear masks start, instead calling Chinese hoax, would vastly different spot. virus made here, complete inept way responded. idiots listen guy would listened took seriously. Instead concerned economy getting re-elected. Sure thing. employer stops sending us work, I'll stay home. Many people stuck working, like worked whole thing far. Nobody cares safety comes brass tacks. Hillbilly here, bet ass I've wearing mask staying inside much possible. stereotyping help. Yeah like Republicans made people sick w covid go nursing homes? 

Oh wait cuomo

Also California? Democrats. nah must also Republicans call fragil 😠 Well uhh something happened 80 years ago Ha europoors rekt xd since none explanations make sense... got B list celebrity president makes sense. Oh, guess going upgrade depression worry intelligent people now! American leadership many levels absolutely horrible often Americans find unable see forest trees. 

However Americans inconsiderate incredibly generous domestically internationally Ass offensive find American absolutely lot Air changes? pull air outside? would low. energy efficiency matter, US south, recirculation normally high take advantage already cooler temp. Quite frankly, American, I'm quite sad USA handled situation respects. situations like guess naively thinking/hoping everyone could put aside differences collectively takes contain thing.

Especially leadership point view. Yes many citizens believe reality situation acted selfish way. starts strong leadership top way down. shocked decisions made POTUS many state governors well local authorities, acting like whole thing hoax, downplaying much were.

Respect government keeps people solidarity acting collectively takes betterment nation. Clearly respect, good reason. claim oppression asked wear masks annoying clear indication people understanding freedoms mean.

Unfortunately see US continue suffer virus death illness, also financially long long time, even vaccines widely distributed, rest world less recovers moves lives.

So many people whined economy shutdowns dumb. Well long term, going hurt us even lack leadership public cooperation actual guidelines provided. Hey bro take chill pill maybe get internet angry get assume due Uncharted movie resuming production Europe? They're figuring now? you’re pathetic Toronto stage province. Basically big events still go. think 2 new cases GTA 5 million used jealous america wanted born there, I'm glad born now. considered moving California? doctor friend move Cali practice think there's generous student loan forgiveness program. think program: citizen US would like say response pandemic fucking embarrassing, shameful, honestly, scary. 

If ""love leave it"" I'm ready leave it, option already financial means even case country would welcome now? Hence asked original question. State governments wanting reopen misreporting numbers? thing? (I’m asking honest perspective. trying push theory) mention normally mostly get outdoorsy Texans reasonably respectful us (compared say, Floridians), year we're getting ones throw trash everywhere fight bartenders wearing mask. Every restaurant person know says Texans specifically absolute worst, entitled tourists. would saved stayed shutdown longer nOOOoooooOoooOoo we’re sliding pandemic depression now. seems unrealistically high. Obviously know sure, tend think country size Iran around four hundred thousand Covid deaths would difficult hide. leak recently indicating around 50,000 deaths Iran seems likely me. good article discussing virus likely killing people Iran December, wanted hide information due upcoming elections. Given think confident death toll higher reported, trouble believing around four hundred thousand people died. Well leadership fair, although that’s big failure sure. US system also plays role. 

State vs Federal structures, constitution, US bi partisan political system, healthcare costs (people can’t access tests scared go hospital racking huge bills) lack readily accessed welfare (so people choice work, starve) 

Ultimately though yes, boils leadership one form another. 

I lived US 3 years (I’m Kiwi) constantly shocked aggressively anti human whole system was. vulnerable especially there, richest nation world allow citizens live desperate lives (&amp; pre COVID, shudder think now!) disgrace.  havent answered anything. suggested editorialized article irrelevant factor scientifically unfeasible posit correlating causation/action. Simply citing sexuality thesis counter argument crux vox article flawed bc takes things may sound like match up, without possibility countervailing variables, strikes broad brush suggest toxic masculinity reason men likely contract die covid19. sound like go well together asinine dopey rightwing conspiracy theories Hillary FBI deep state, not. 

So, ask again. answer thesis meaningful? Here's hint. none. toxic masculinity exist? Sure. men die likely contract covid19? Havrnt looked numbers believe it. bc toxic masculinity wanting comply wear masks? Ummm wtf?  province getting higher numbers cause dummy didn’t self isolate coming back East. uncle like this. still think it’s hoax. unexpected sickness wouldn’t let get bed ‘bad flu’ Two stories-

COVID-19 media mortality 80s.


COVID-19 bad 2 flu seasons. Covid-19, US Top 3 worse among Top 20 GDP nations, terms infection rate death rate.

False, especially death rate. 

UK, Spain, Italy ahead US. Brazil, France below. would pay attend Smash Mouth concert. Vs. say part 1%? work McDonalds, working 1980, small businesses employed 50.3 percent retail workers, 34.8 percent employed large large companies. However, decades later giants employ biggest share workers 47.2, versus 35.6 employed small retailers supporting somehow. AZ would herd immunity mode Maricopa County 30% infected like NYC, that's spreads, mainly major cities.

NY whole deaths CA, FL Texas combined. Living working China right now. city 22 cases. everyone within 100km get tested. We're talking least 6 million people here. 24 hours later, anyone tested positive sent government quarantine (66 people), along anyone may come contact with. rest us carrying on. care records broke killin it! Ahh yes, let’s blame Trump put something... fact I'm serbian we're proud Tesla's accomplishments bonus. obviously, sign serbian ingeniosity, always neglecting fact go homeland US fact croatia (which also boasts tesla) would prolly shoot sent concentration camp. I'm saying anyone better, I'm saying worse we're told. I'm well aware big US there's question harder control America NZ. I'm even NZ, example lower excess deaths locking down. happened countries too, easier see effect lockdowns less cases.

Seems obvious, everyone stays home, less people catch flu, get accidents, get murdered on. safer staying home.

We hope 2-day delay cleaning enough time people become symptomatic haul everyone back another round exposure clearly going require larger number cases realize going work. yeah, I've heard before, pure speculation. course didnt count every single case, unless test every single person population.  serious?! Yikes 😬 Yes was, bad really stressed recently It’s mind blowing people dismiss science data. Like, I’ll admit, back June states like Georgia Florida reopened hospitals weren’t overcrowded anything like that, bit skeptical “dangerous” covid really is. got arguments threads trying justify coronavirus isn’t really bad previously thought. even then, still abiding rules advocating them; wearing mask, socially distancing, keeping good hygiene (washing hands constantly 20+ seconds) etc.. Even corona continuing hit US hard even we’ve seen countries like NZ pretty much get rid virus fucking wearing masks listening scientists/doctors recommend do, people still stuck US follow basic rules admit “hydroxychlorine cure” shit virus *is* dangerous. 

This pandemic really opened eyes stupid Americans are, even friends family. Smh. hope make get vaccine. can't come conclusions. know plenty maskless protests. I'm US, we're much worse Canada. Sweden absolutely nothing common New York USA general, 5 times deaths per 100k country region. I'm getting really fucking sick hearing Sweden anti-lockdown crowd Denmark ""send kids back school restrictions"" idiots. ever want laugh, sort subreddit controversial.

Miss concerts, bars, traveling? chill months safely again. Lol Europeans still scared black death? FLU Ive gotten dealt dumb liberals. /S 

That's Americans spreading disease thinks, we've failed education death cult result even read article? says went got IVs clarity left. think they’re intubated ICU? Getting IV ER standard care, doesn’t mean you’re dying. wouldn’t know don’t know you’re talking about.  Florida....I know folks FL mention virus either “huh?” ignorance “eh big deal”.

Personally wouldnt bother going anywhere near state reactions like that.... de facto that's seafood market ""evidence"" recently, evidence hopefully doctor changed tune. like one know Kevin Kevin IRL No. like odds. stoppable, fuckups thing. uncle high risk covid still went work ill it!!!!!! (for work go people’s homes install stuff). daughter boyfriend flew California! aunt side family attending sturgis (motorcycle rally 250k + people) still wants go visit grandma birthday next weekend. coworker anti mask pregnant compared governor nazis Mao Zedong !! really don’t understand Another anti-american front page post, surprised? still fly anywhere valid visa. I'm headed UK January PhD programme right 2 week stay home quarantine (which IMHO big price pay). Ah okay. That's thought. recovered person contagious car door handle. say, barely. 

So statement survivors virus tell cant possibly spread it.

Might rephrased virus spreading virus way contagious person According Worldometers, Kenya 140th world cases 132nd deaths. might lack tests reporting. Thanks. need find middle ground, know things safe can't mentally bring yet. going hard things normal again, keep thinking take day day deal get there. Seriously happened ha American?! It’s red blue Divided States wouldn’t say CBC response sarcastic post news source. confused geographical reference. remember, dont know exact wording there's quote something along lines ""one death tragedy, 1000 deaths statistic."" Especially many mask wearing people, wear nose like stories. projection predicted 90k deaths Sweden July. Whoops, would say missed bit there. I've seen posted people previously thought sane. theories getting crazier day. shit rate, sacrifice America making people spitefully refusing go along rest world doing, breaks fucking heart. Sex worth risking life families. Yeah. care dad fact checks everything Trump's tweet coverage Fox news doesn't. trust Fauci's opinion anyone else dude Another click bait article scum journalist. police enforce law without fear favor. going arrest asshole tourists, arrest asshole homeless. also vacation Sweden, slow bit ehile. Itll increase soon guarantee. Instead what's happening people wearing masks ones understand gravity situation staying home sick, keeping much distance selves others possible. assume known cases outbreak 1/8 1/10 cases, seem consistent threshold somewhere around 20% population outbreaks start recede. Early on, Northern Italy NYC hit it, Spain didn't. Brazil whole closing in, within 2-3 weeks. Arizona seems gotten there, Florida possibly well, almost.

A lot if's description, thought interesting. think sure bet numbers go 1 1000. US leads way (in bad way) unless find medication reduce symptoms effects virus, rest world see figures. Netherlands 1 2800 now, almost new cases, although second wave making, nowhere near situation US. see us follow figures later year, flu common cold go around. Also country cases keep rising actually population wants keep reopening. Many people say number deaths justify closure businesses. February country founded rebeling authority

It's country [founded conpsiracy History already distorted. Mayflower pioneers. freedom. Thanksgiving celebration. Yet Americans proud tell wishful fairytale. retroactively traced back November Februari. mean idea something serious going November. 

How could know pandemic started, cases end 2019 right middle flue season?

It's miracle science someone figured anything going hospitals filling up. every 1 1175. Beating y'all. number 1! 

Now said it, American think we're obligated correct that. *We're supposed number one!* Yeah dude thanks putting simple easy grasp terms.

You know lay funnybone funnybone it’ll stretch 23 miles! It’s definitely right way measure human cost pandemic. believe take difference all-cause mortality subtract projected all-cause mortality. way less sources bias data set. mean... *am* American, so.

Flu America 0.3 deaths/Mpop/day. bad flu season gets around 1 death/Mpop/day peak times. Colorado first state start labeling deaths 

Before happened let’s forget places Florida I’m wrong want fact remains places done shady things others continuing shady things haven’t caught yet.

I mean trust government things like Watergate everything exposed Snowden? agree 100% 1 1175 Belgians died covid.

1 1458 Brits died covid.

1 1567 Peruvians died covid.

1 1639 Spaniards died covid.

1 1718 Italians died covid.

1 1754 Swedes died covid.

1 1898 Chileans died make sure wear shoes pants, you’re female, shorts don’t rise three inches knee width shoulder shirt must three finger widths horse ride must seven hands tall. No, FREEDOM! AMERICA!!!! Fair enough. think still temper expectations Australia.

If moving Australia think escaping right-wing morons, idiots general, hoo boy, one hell rude shock. current government (called ""Liberals"", go figure) bunch corrupt, right-wing idiots literally owned Rupert Murdoch bidding. politicians openly take bribes big mining companies pass laws allow pay tax also caught engaging blatant pork barrelling spending fucks average citizens. Sound familiar?

Oh, think Americans dumb, wait till see average Australian. Australians literally started panic buying toilet paper apparently toilet paper need survive viral pandemic.

There's bunch stuff havent mentioned, believe say Aussies dumb, dumber, average American. lack internet lot places others incredibly shit overpriced government corrupt allowing companies form monopolies remember right even fought stop Google fiber would mean people would cheap internet deal regional monopolies I'm honestly ok martial law point lmao reason picturing entire city empty got me. That's nauseating. I'm sorry American friends. yeah usual reality hits face start change, wonder anything get point mortality way higher first wave reached Europe, really comparable. different epidemics terms avaible treatements patients demographics (at least, that's clinicians saying Italy). Make Amazon wish list. PM first wave over, looking around me; second wave come quick honestly think insanely nice weather last week combined slow reopenings. second wave might already started, we're waiting incubation lag. separate topic agree entirely. government always fucks would expect different point.

Yeah, get tl;dr here? fucker seriously using pandemic advocate vouchers private tutors......... Another article showed 60% heart inflammation least 71 days diagnosis Reddit like 4Chan's clean shaven cousin wearing corporate suit. us handle word literally means ""slow"", still acceptable euphemism intellectual disability. stats wrong. 20 year old dies trauma motorcycle accident gets coded covid, that's enough info tell numbers lie. MN here. cases creeping since 4th July terrifying. 50 100,000 solution shutdown. solution provide citizens support shutdown things issues.

we're richest country world large margin, yet time time again, situations arise, government bails corporations foolish set aside small fraction billions dollars plan tells rest people barely get even best times go fuck themselves. people idiots wear mask public. hard, unless breathing heavily mouth saturating mask spit, cut oxygen you. work as? 9-11 every 3 days? Americans suicidal Let God sort em out. would disagree assertion written ""Desert Sheepherders"". people invented religion sharp indeed. probably realised, now, controlling simpletons could wield lot power make lot money. Wait R0 3 US? That's high, damnit. average number deaths per year pretty consistent. take average number deaths past five years, compare deaths year, find actually 200,000 deaths year previous years. like 2 stadiums. end year, we'll probably 1 1,000 Americans dead virus. People keep checking hotel Texas takes everything cringe. Even new cleaning standards rolled brand, bring hotel, someone going get it. Stay home, TX. (I live Italy).

They young, bet study shit hit fan stayed wherever were. 

Also, news day American guy ordered quarantine hotel, escaped stupid fucking reason, found Police forced test covid.

The reason allowed double passport, think there's handful Americans getting way. got be, think. first thought mainly American thing, thought it’s narcissism/selfishness thing, IQ... don’t think fit seeing. think people want life return normal much just... pretend threat isn’t anymore want force everyone else same. Again, exactly harmful vaccine help get reelected? Karens Bills America: ""No."" sure astonished, always going go way US Society Fair.  quarter eligible voters voted Trump. So, even less overall. Good thing we’re lot testing Honestly need guys give us lend lease. I'd ask statics information police departments FBI [or whoever keeps track kidnappings]. Crime reports someone ranting insulting away.

Edit: Police Hawaii least say increase child abductions: increase Amber Alerts Texas look details nothing masks: lot family youth really frustrated social distancing restrictions stay home, inability see friends, family, significant others,” mentioned. “And we’ve seen youth centers group homes shut due pandemic concerns. And, therefore, leads child placed elsewhere. prompts leaving care?

You must new here. would need strictly enforced lockdown, like Melbourne military deployed.

Sweden suffered exactly economic collapse everyone else, would point opening? dead people, is.

And LMAO tell lived there, still alone data world there. actual data show US somehow ""the diverse"" country, I'd love see it. 
 
And heck size diversity? moving yardsticks.

I guess matter. appreciate generally polite conversation far, think there's really point this. certain right rest planet wrong, there's much say cite, really, matter neutral.

Best luck, thanks chat.  deserve explore stars. **eat it.** Lol think america cares anything money diet required peel toe nails one one wouldn’t either. Home free, sick depraved.  came across recently going rabbit hole Hapsburg family/cousin marriage.

Sadly, dead disabled children, even own, carry much weight lot ppl. benefit us young too... 22 year old, surviving long term health issues option I’m willing take. Especially hell put body 4 years college finished. Lol That’s literally is. people around us don’t care. It’s simple that. /s? I'm Reddit. \^\^ brightens night. million plus people Germany protesting lockdowns ""astonished?"" honestly can't believe many people think need lockdown destroy small business middle class transferring wealth banks. Fucking idiots. 244 years good run see lasting much 10 years now.  sister law two immune supressant drugs refuses wear mask. Neither alcoholic husband. praying wind primary custody kid gets sick🤞 also sit optimistic view couldn’t agree more. hold history, difficult dark it’s been, still progressed. truly think shift apathy towards politics pave way real change. real. Science true regardless political bs. Might well tell Texas Florida even incredible achievement given radically lower death rates.  joke cuomo is. Studies =/= conjecture. Furthermore, much conjecture assume confirmed cases COVID cases. point, demonstrably false conjecture. Interesting take. would argue seeing widening middle respect political interests, extremes ends simply loudest. old adage goes, poor getting poorer rich getting richer. outbreak still bad there? \&lt;insert Chad saying *I know*  I’m you, friend.

Supposedly, names furniture models Wayfair names kid actually selling (which fucking insane thing believe) pool money buy kid save it? want righteously correct without sort personal sacrifice. Florida? hope right either way deaths could minimized action taking much sooner waiting till now... Yeah beyond shutdown. biggest problem people refuse wear masks wear properly.
If anything, set taskforce shutdown Bui allows maskless customers. inspire maskless idiots. packing kids schools? go school internet. Brazil, Peru maybe Mexico, Chile Colombia, country world less safe (due Covid) US right now? India also getting large number cases deaths, per capita numbers far lower. think four five Latin American countries dying higher rate per day US.  option, science says ""no"" no, ""hell no"".

You count bag. right thing. Thank you, appreciate you. Check post history. First symptom changed multiple times. Posting exact comment like 6 times row. echo chamber subreddit. Take grain salt. Maybe they're telling truth, odds much statistically. know weak minded cowards already, that's find unforgivable test wills right now. break. cant speak whole country, figured I'd weigh perspective. think generally speaking, Irish population upset government lack travel restrictions imposed American people coming here. people allowed travel here, understandable (to degree) assume okay. However, fact lot tourists abiding 14 day quarantine disturbing. Recently friend mine make essential trip Dublin west coast bus filled brim tourists admitted fresh plane US. piled seats sectioned social distancing refused wear masks sat down. current climate trip local corner shop feel dangerous, imagine traumatizing experience must been. However, think sensible people blame Americans general recent uptick cases. blame lies mostly individuals small groups showing blatant disregard health safety measures prioritising holiday wellbeing Irish people. went intense period lockdown almost everyone country displayed real sense solidarity shut homes weeks months end order get numbers control. pretty tough ordeal many, considering deeply ingrained sociability national identity. number cases spiralling control again, think lot people feel efforts wasted looking someone blame. Rest assured though Americans, we're shaking collective fists entire country. select individuals! see similar complaints, they're douchebag parents. Upset everything pep rallies parties, RUSH week homecoming. 

Never mention classwork...you know....the real reason they're there. Well meant young people generally. getting screwed.  u think NY NJ hit hard relative rest USA? unlikely rest country cases similar magnitude 2 states (on per capita)?

Just wondering take 2 states hit hard infection death wise states far seem resilient. “Revealed”? It’s pretty clear awhile lmao It’s weird Europe idea well getting 2000 case spike whereas America nobody really cares 1000 people DYING one single day. Like bad Europe probably I’d really rather see we’re still using February statistics hospitalizations. Preach.

Remember, *still* people iron lungs polio ""survivors"". ""revealed"" lol. can't normal conversations politics religion hardly anybody without losing shit. atheist 'hot take'. 

We need help. ex college tell wanted corporate lobbyist knew right soulless. though? thought 2016 election took care obviously do, considering need make posts like these. Oh another country says suck. better news ? taboo social context even chatting coworkers, depending workplace culture, would never mention politics religion job interview... Unless applying position political campaign manager church administrator guess. Failing weak mask makes look like idiot seriously. country eliminated virus community? Temporarily permanently? candidate would New Zealand. 

The virus endemic, way stop would go New Zeeland path: Hard border restrictions combination island far away country. 

And many countries considering option. Why, think?

Stop blaming countries higher infection rates community spread. That’s kindergarten level. 

It would silly blame China, Austria, Italy Sweden carrying virus places. 

Instead, make sure *own* measures good balance keeping virus bay keeping people’s life quality decent level. Every country must make assessment own. apparently, now, third option: take serious ""know"" heart deaths hospital admissions lie cooked entire world take president they're jealous great is. American, seriously, don’t even let us right now. American, deeply embarrassed, frustrated, outright angry countrymen - *family* - responded this. used ""let bygones"" situation keeping peace; can't let go anymore. unironically quote Picard, ""the line must drawn here."" Lol tell us repercussions likely take couple hundred years...and lot pain along way. [can't handle 

Say so! I'm 40. know generation fit seems everyone different opinions. think life hopeless. think things could obviously better definitely see retired 20-25 years sure.  Also revealed water wet. I'm Spain man. know shit. clearly look weak wearing one. This.

This country’s main strength used United part. “States America” Easiest refer *The Big Short.* Girl know thought knew better posted tanned Instagram photo Mexico - - live NY. captioned ""don't worry, I'll get tested!!""

Uh, service workers endagered? I'm upset. Calm hell KYLE Yeah find much online, article May Oregon saying FDA revoked certifications KN95.

But guess PPE shortages bad enough, better nothing. sad :(

I'm sorry going healthcare worker, thank much service! Please explain allowing economy open 22 deaths “wrong approach.” point said offended you. 🖕 

Sure.

You responded negatively article regarding Bill Gates said. said scientific consensus triggered you.

Do need help?  kiss! Yes I'm trouble reconciling handle risk people household need go world around people extended periods time. really confusing messed situation. SoCal here.

It's going worse places like Orange County Republican conservative population. north see places like Redding. LA is, nobody stays still OC antivaxers antimaskers travel city daily spreading it. Sometimes suspect they're trying cover much ground possible, see video OC mask protestor Pasadena there's little chance organic random event.

I took kids LA Arboretum yesterday everyone masks on. Joggers, kids, parents. *Everyone*. Everything socially distant, narrow trails redesigned one way, overall fun trip bit warm. Great. means Bill’s suggestion could help countries. obese weak ready weak look Alternative headline: *Random Europeans Asked American Politics Somehow Considered News* Lol okay... defend many things America really going attack founding fathers seceding oppressive monarchy? Give break else gets season heat world

Just southern US

I conversation someone month ago saying Canada understand need air conditioning etc

We midst 35-40C heatwave like two weeks time.

Today, literally right Toronto 40c humidity 

These comments come folks never travel anywhere know place came Bane wears mask time, he's strong af. thing happened London UK, apart small hotspots. millennial, came pensions expected.  Almost every place I've ever worked gone. I'm ok stubbornness. keep trying. I've driven bunch cheap cars stuck savings foreclosure picked up. takes years get ahead. Okay, me, US health care system fucked anyway really takes cake senselessness doctors accept certain insurances. make sense. paying attention country past 60 years something? Really, COVID breaking point? LMAO offense, mom sounds like c*** farked

TIL: Farked - web site made unavailable posting link fark.com thereby directing massive amounts traffic said web site. dont make things up, testing fine. positivity rate &lt;5% u want test, get it.

if testing per capita low, demand testing low, people unable get tested. saying young men women? last comments referring young men, switched young men women. want clarify. I’m front line Covid response.

These types headlines really bother two reasons- 

1. I, many others, busting asses zero support state federal leadership.

2. isn’t enough, headline true lot population. ""specific reasons"" nonsense.

The USA ""in decline"", even true, way means longer going ""first world country"". NYC influx white supremacists early caused spike, actually.

Sure, specific figures lead conclusion Europe worse off? _Chiropractors don’t want anyone know one trick_ wonder correlation oversized APC looking truck wearing mask. Maybe so, European capitalist societies much farther left US. US pinnacle authoritarian capitalism. government run fascist, nature fascism cannot bow nature admit stronger them. like giant marshmallow experiment except anyone eats marshmallow get one either Identical vibes title. Well done.   Certainly knocked us pedestal. embarrassing infuriating 5 months. Lol suppose asymptomatic people stopped spreading virus without identified testing? LOL, ya thinking MLB... guess common trend sports mean imply suburbs bad means. going see type politics covid world means following guidelines. r/whywomenlivelonger That's harsh. exposed truth getting punished it? That's crazy.

These ""kids"" 2 3 years old. There's plenty pro anti mask memes guarantee they've seen. They're old enough know masks better protection masks, people around them. want protect themselves, that's right expose others germs disease known killed 160,000 people USA already. saying they're stupid, they? Ignorant, clueless, evil, apathetic? like think that's poorly educated manipulated, however, even well educated people manipulated sure Yeah honestly Brain Drain I'm surprised happened yet. First Western country fast track high-skill American talent going absolutely flooded applicants. Though I'd imagine concern massive outflux talent would push America extreme right...and could equally concerning benefit talent influx might bring. I’ve seen kn95 masks around. legit? Currently use cloth mask pmc 2.5 filter inserts. work grocery retail don’t mind investing better protect idiots. Two words perfectly describe current president fan club. really split different countries already.

US one thing fire strong narrative place, man parts sure universal thing. open boarders everyone thought would let things freely, much expected. Locally reached sort equilibrium, daily new infections close daily newly recovered numbers, system lots headroom spike. used lots ""so far"", ""has been"" type phrase virus things change quickly, month might fall apart, think will. strong local leadership, proactive taking virus seriously. Also, many people bucking system her, ""but virus here, ant wearing mask"" type complaints meet with, ""No shit, right stuff, keep it."" read see lots ""USA fire"" stuff, certain strangeness match first hand experience. Granted I'm south, past current hot spot areas. polls back declaration men afraid looking weak? actual evidence presented Vox article (ha!) unattributed quote (presumably) reporter's man says: “It’s submission, it’s muzzling yourself, looks weak - especially men.”

If that's bar evidence broader demographic trend, well, wonder people inclined believe rather ridiculous things.

Personally, wear mask public reason carry: I'd rather need need it. However, certainly understand want bother wear mask, way understand want bother carry. entail certain amount discomfort, least annoyance. Yep. dealt pandemic like adult, could able actually enjoying sports personal freedom moment. Paying extra poorly built motor makes annoying noise definition stupid. image substance. Outlaw mystique bike mostly owned weight grandpas grandmas.

I think south park put best. agree. wear mask it’s hot you’re sweating, yes feel uncomfortable. Back March April, even accepting homemade masks. shortages pretty bad.

Now, we're heading direction again.  doubt. nutters creating fake organizations fake badges claim wear masks. 

It's really big deal. Special snowflakes everywhere. never said was? Taking flights absurd right see issue car indoors mask you’re massive dickhead well u need used bike they'll plenty 4-6 weeks Yes. also working inhalable version beneficial mild moderate cases require hospitalization. proven work clinical results, game changer.

However, would short supply still need go trials forms, we're still looking readily available, even proven effective. also idea cost look like, considering remdesivir, I'm worried US. someone NE PA area, mean bad place live, giant trump signs side road. Reddit works!! y'all sounding intelligent considerate one another?! Sheesh

/s doubters seriousness virus: virus joke. Based nationwide seroprevalence data Spain, overall IFR estimate 0.83% confirmed Covid deaths 1.07% based estimated Covid deaths. study there’s data chart IFR calculations based age sex.

Explain nonsense based definition gave me.

If understand bad leadership bad country, able understand idea applied USA. Ayn Rand myth individualism live interconnected society.

The Atlas Shrugged thesis becomes recipe selfish failure confronted pandemic. coronavirus death victim fat?

160,000 Americans dead counting. Orders magnitude worse 9/11. Yet people want rationalize normalize this. yeah certain demo made us look stupid also didnt realize many them. Paradoxa77 said well: ""There low-key racism comment. white-panic dogwhistle. cool.""

If think comment pro-china quite dense. affect men, right? real divide coronavirus numbers many men dying compared women. Minorities dying higher numbers also huge issue. whole ""women suffering disproportionately"" narrative silly.

shut fuck up. Brits shitter America covid. Belgium. title stupid way. Lots countries done shit. thought initial thrust Europeans’ impression (since there’s poll, “opinion” misnomer) clear unpreparedness falling apart USA wake Corona-virus.
Discussion potency Nuclear weaponry associated jingoism, proves point: YES, USA particularly current president , hopelessly prepared battling pandemic moreover, exhibits deep deep divisions culture amongst people terms value morals.
That “falling apart”. US gets things together beat Corona back levels found many European (and other) countries posts stop. then, news news shown such. I'm definitely correct agree wrong. OK. Thank you! number consistent I've heard death rate could actually - different people pushing 99.99% recovery rate see everywhere social media. really Star Wars Episode 3.

Donald Trump used peoples anger like Darth Sidious used Anakin's anger.

* can't rational angry.
* can't smart angry.
* make mistakes angry.

Rural Republicans Trump's followers Anakin Skywalker lost Padme. Obi Wan. matter hard tried, Anakin listen. instead killing Mustafar, cut legs arm, burned crisp; making even upset.

And look happened; Anakin managed take Galaxy Sidious. JEDI split up, killed, exiled.

We know end already. Donald Trump needs go. stand see end Republic.

He already removed troops Germany. think going use them? Right here; already started ORDER 66 protestors Portland.

This degrading relationship needs absolved. Republicans willing use Pandemic score political points; much conscience think really have? I've heard. I've told reddit (un-ironically) I'm one first people put wall. entirely sure I've done them. Kind got impression visited. 

I mean, what’s disgusting public toilets? Yuck! hard-hitting journalism Vox American, American predict either moron extremely naive. theory older people never faced true crisis longer natural disaster, usually handled relatively quickly (unless Puerto Rico) they're scared admit life changed dramatically permanently, live always have, enormous wall denial stopping rational/safe matter many times tell them, matter tells them, matter much know.   prosperous nation earth superseded China shortly. small countries currently best either small oil nations small european countries would beat similarly sized prosperous U.S. regions.

Why post? argue GDP growth measure long economic run? argue GDP GDP per capita. like scatter brained need post without ever adding anything. defense production act tool combat companies concerned paying expanded capacity pay virus timeline, unneeded expensive maintain virus gone. That's real concern, one prevents appropriate development fight virus. much without federal leadership properly coordinate everything. know daily conference call majority Governors thought might see leadership develop that, publicly known yet. done properly, would accomplish quite bit. problem US isn’t infections, problem infections prolific it’s impossible test trace effectively. Look Germany, look New Zealand, look South Korea. little confusing, honestly. suppose goes show cases make things explode rather quickly controlled, end lock doors opening tourism new cases expected.

That said, getting 5000 cases day from? ""Of cases reported today, 1895 new last 24 hours"". cool long stereotypes target correct populations. cough may subside, erection stay. ;) Yeah practical. pure click bait. top it, we’re cutting funding Medicaid part problem US instability. failing democracy. hole like him

How come conclusion? Oof. Insurance expensive, understand decision, take care yourselves. understand girlfriend's boss - want someone ill anywhere near food preparation, mask no. wish best luck, hope COVID-19, get mild symptoms. comments far fucking depressing. incredible country teenager die virus dealt long time ago, people's reaction say, ""Yeah, bet fat, that's okay."" Pathetic.  around everyday im pretty far north. easy....why end pandemic free spend 5 trillion keep party going?

I'm starting think reason feds let virus go could blow 8 trillion dollars friends family rescue package. Unfortunately, many Trumper/deep state/NWO/George Soros/end-time uncles blame good chunk rebellious anti-mask behavior.

I uncle. Everything MSM debunks theories FAKE NEWS them. mock anyone uses Google/YT use find dig nonsense rabbit-holes. 

Infuriating. [There bad take. You’re willfully ignorant. apply say, Florida?

Republican govenor, virus worst Miami.  Democrats run pretty much everything there. Orlando, another Dem city...

The rest state big problem. offense may want consider moving. Plenty RN positions MD fresh grads. wife got RN entire class got decent jobs within weeks. guess worth asking: *is* Pancake Expration Date? need know breakfast still good. think meant DOUCHEBAGGERY

Yeah, already talking Harley riders, so... I'd say provides awareness. Got it, actually know anything virus making ideas. I'm sure parents kids died glad hear kids must actually died. Hajj canceled think bunch boomers oversized bikes exempted ""culture""? American here. Could told without pandemic. Implicit subtext: 

""...I know beats time."" 

and 

""If Dad would stop beating start beating Dad instead."" Yes, rich people get richer, wealth almost funny anti nuke shield.. they've got ties every poor country want us hate, ain't blowing shit

edit: literally one first things bush asked iraq burn oil fields.. imagine nuking iraq.. would point - would halliburton etc forget discouraged wear mask

Actually completely forget wear damn mask was, since January. Fact matter is, humans overrated far logic reasoning.

We haven’t evolved past ton shit. believe horeshit suck.

We massive tribe within tribes lead old, stupid asshole. 

We pretend civilized people geniuses opposable thumbs little adversity show true animal colors.

Like Joker said, chips fake bullshit goes away people eat other. Rule 4: avoid politics

Coronavirus mods: mean avoid politics personally disagree tired America bs. wear masks social distance, nobody ever mentions that. Also, judged dumb articles exhausting. hoping sub would give good information instead inflammatory. I'd continue stay home ~ month legit vaccine came out. interest early recipient. I'd want receive vaccine track record fly (on airplanes) again. luxury self-isolation till then... Europe hasn’t paying attention awhile news. We’ve consistently maintained completely inhumane ass backwards system healthcare insurance, right screamed kicked cried idea Obamacare. WOULD anyone else think actually give crap citizens’ health? We’ve shown much not.

How anyone surprised it’s handled well... course isn’t.  Despite nobody actually making comment, essentially every reply basically shadow-boxing someone did. Yes! politics involved! Im still sure fuck force nature got political are! think infections family sphere, due tourism, btw still low. cases increasing steadily week though.

Looks like summer holiday kept down, going back high level infected. Post fb insane unemployed people would vote someone wants cut benefits brings hyper religious aunt “explaining” UE benefits supposed temporary. Thanks fucking info, doesn’t make sense pandemic. all..

These people think inequality actual social issues evaporate “unemployment supposed temporary” American, never embarrassed country year.  think pandemic occurred different leadership response current outcomes would different. amount generalizing see Reddit horrible US doesn’t make sense. It’s Trump defines us. doesn’t. defines small portion found outside US. Yup. ""Learned helplessness"" term, IIRC college days, paying die. country

Have ever said that? Since article talking masculine insecurity female insecurity exist, thought I'd bring example.

You call whataboutism, call comparison. Especially since article question also proof linking male insecurity wearing mask, assumes it.

The whole article basically screaming 'Masculinity toxic'. definitely sometimes is, much femininity toxic.

The players coaches want play. issues money, amateurism, liability. like too. mean treatment Covid. European think early tell come ahead crisis.
Sure, per capita death rate higher Europe, now.
But US dealt last 2 economic crises far better Europe.
Europe plagued high unemployment rates Mediterranean countries weak economic growth 20 years. could second much severe euro-crisis coming years. Would though? would result people instantly abandoning precautions taking due illusion protection. guess depends. lot I’ve heard personally also comes context Middle East, North Korea, historical conflicts. 

Someone pointed Reddit too. many people subs like r/conservative r/trump say things like that. wouldn’t surprised aren’t even trolls tbh. There’s conclusive research long term effects. “Educate yourself” GTFOH average doctor likely know much average person keeps science news.

You much faith average layperson do. course one day, maybe future, historical event took place here

Look everybody, ambassador whole world talking, right Reddit comment section!

What country buddy? Fuck!  bit usual. Especially parks aren’t WDW... Sept/Oct 2019 example, Hollywood Studios, Epcot, Animal Kingdom open least 9 often 10. they’re going closing Animal Kingdom 5 Epcot Hollywood 7... that’s quite drop 2019 fall. it’s generally extremely odd see every park close sunset fall unless there’s major hurricane something. 

Here’s hours days last fall reference: Dying libtards. Maybe call Caining yourself? One down, 159,999 articles write, post. “Neither background higher education, hospitality, event-planning.

All people following orders. Maybe America deserves. watch many sheep believe go get virus come back hate government. one finally realize much gullable be. Lol imagine calling “Boy Genius” naming crappy blog “Boy Genius Report” article dozens dozens errors  Oh no! cases! ever do! alarmist. close family member working vaccine research collecting data patients recovered. something want catch. doesn’t kill still likely shorten life. Please reading blindly calling people alarmist obviously haven’t educated single credible source. worried americans don’t care cases officially past 5M count, country would probably lot worse impending flu season COVID roaming about. open door anyone without one, bought box disposables could hand out. One maintenance dudes complex got super pissy shit's sake, dude. ""experts"" predicted American deaths millions. failed, think overall health populace. Americans high rates obesity, diabetes, heart disease.

Last time walked dollar tree stopped door tell leave bag/purse till. said way left time went difficult pay stuff employees paying attention people walking cash let shit get stolen they're worried might steal shit worth $1. 🙄 Meanwhile America, everyone going get infected die much europe  seen evidence either, ask that. I'm asking explicitly state think numbers every death China knows, thinks, died covid.

It's fine regardless say, I'm curious.  done correctly sports happen. However everyone rushing get back normal failing fucking spectacularly every damn time. first thought.

Why? lot people STEM good though fair I've thinking analogy well. IMO, 10-15 years ago, tabloids stupid newspapers cornered area register. post-secondary graduate would touch foot long pole case someone shames death reading trash.

Fast forward 2020: everyone upvoting sharing Buzzfeed Breitbart articles Facebook Twitter. They're trashy worse, they're completely normalized.

Worse: internet made trash profitable traditional news source, latter pressured competing axises. Wasting money, Online Classes only.

Way help economy... Banderas national treasure. need complete lockdowns, first necessities delivered drones, capital punishment whoever breaks it. Justin Amash Independent, he's running re-election :-( That's bit dramatic.

What needs happen reform system... need third party, plus changes process - first past post among things.

Then need clean government - remove money special influences (read: monetary corruption), ensure can't creep making constitutional amendment, ensure independent oversight government can't neutered executive order simple legislation, possibly way.

If US government ""fractured"" today states own, know would tomorrow?

They'd form new government new nation, that's easiest, cheapest thing do, form government works least well other.

Yeah, gonna say. perfect getting food without dining room going outdoors far away people seem like relatively okay activities. last paragraph. turned mean. TOOK BACK upvote!! know like now, education. People hated smartest people school went. certifiable genius high school, took calculus fifth grade, kept himself, even kids peg bullies teased incessantly. retaliation punished teachers kids started (though partly would start insulting teachers' intelligence would step break up).

When college, I'd told once, professors well students, work ethic makes underachievers look bad slow down.

Even educational institutions, stupid celebrated. Nah, got fuck you. accurate. hard bar clear one side one all, hahaha. Masks make look weak? Masks sign bad asses. Bane mask, Batman. Doctors wear masks, anyone think heroes, lying themselves. Firefighters, Special Forces, cowboys (bandannas), Master Chief, yeah, bandits number dystopian authority figures, examples heroes upstanding citizens, clearly solid examples masks, anything, make look intimidating, outright bad ass.

If think mask makes look weak, weak, wearing mask fix - though make look like asshole. donated campaigned hard Warren. Even got meet take pic mini rally donors. 

I'm completely loss wound Biden although obviously vote him. actually thought Sanders would take toward end there.

But think take another generation bullshit without disintegrating society. right, need big structural change. need Klobuchars supposed side asking months ago debate stage, ""But pay it?!"", i.e. ""realistic"" candidate.

We found we'd pay it.

Additional reviews patients suffering Lupis RA taking HCQ show infection rate society general.  Mom nurse supplying surgical masks clinic. Thankfully found provider N95s bought 50 her, that's short time supply $100. awful. I've often wondered design. Unfortunately US culture abhors people *working hard*, lot pro-business politicians likely see elderly parasites sucking finite resources. Countries like US still shock extending hand receve aid. people worried protesting streets. poorer countries working hard, usual, maintain normalcy, used crisis. Latam countries, everybody sells something, everybody delivers something neighbors, people small grocery stores, small businesses home bringing little money table. US , people make lines brand new SUVs get free food huge lines large Walmarts Costcos, people pick-up fights wearing masks. Quality life good answer. Yup parents never got quarantined traveled March. brought groceries even brought one cars oil change. 

We've barely seen months want chance infecting them, better see 6-12 months never again. 

I've even tested twice early pandemic weeks ago developed sniffles/cough. negative. also live northeast assure plenty wearing them. fact argument. effective vaccine comes fall hail NZ throw onions US, Sweden, etc.

If vaccine never comes, well, opposite true. Fortunately people wearing masks significantly lower viral load much better odds. Long term damage definitely sucks, hopefully masks keep good people safe. assume they’d maliciously withhold COVID vaccine unfounded.

The US refused lift sanctions bunch countries, even humanitarian reasons. ok US withholding vaccine say Venezuela Iran? stopping United States using vaccine geopolitical weapon? 

It stupid rest world place lives hands American people. People freedom decide themselves, Americans decide things them. doesn’t matter Sweden significant one. It’s Norway’s decision want manage situation.

And considering Norway land borders (that matter), Norway importing lot Swedish labour last 20 years would strange significant source. look like badass ninja! spec-ops. l337 h4x0r. Idk, maybe I'm alone thinking look badass. Hot take: things mission statement suck ass, mission statements written do-nothing pencil pushers like sit around think buzzwords day. last time asked question? headline want read day oldest flew back US second year college. hoped university would gone full remote sadly, nope.

God country shit hole.  Yep! first year worked. immediate boss helps scheduling important shit though, like work 10 days straight, take two weekends back back, work 10 days straight none takes PTO. managed get enough time wedding. Owner kinda fuckin' over, boss nice enough. always whataboutism people. 

So mean massive outbreak Florida Governor interferes local politics lifts restrictions local governments put place?  

Or want whatabout break Georgia governor threatened law suit Mayor Altanta wanted impose mask order. 

I know read change mind, advice adult. Sweetie world work way wish mind intended did. can't pretend Covid away honey. logic flawed whether agree not, whether temper tantrum lockdowns not, establishment is, will, impose lockdowns certain threshholds met, continue mandate masks certain thresholds met, temper tantrums children have, adults(epidemiologists) *obligated* protect few.




What happened ""christian nation""? serves *you*, eh? Mate, US government would nuke Europe thought it'd increase profits 0.5% fucking right Totally agree. said this:
GDP GDP per capita better measures ""prosperity"" GDP growth. neither measures best last 200 years. GDP, largest since 1920s, 100 years. GDP per capita, never largest. Therefore, said, prosperous nation (if accept actually prosperous nation) ~100 years, 200. consistent.

You one insisted GDP *growth* thing prosperity could mean.

Also, want nitpick done: argument, China already prosperous us, years! annual GDP growth higher ours! See, too! Europeans Say COVID-19 Confirmed Previous Beliefs America 'Fragile,' Inconsiderate Flattening curve measure slow, prevent, virus spreading, like I've already said.

That study inconclusive still peer-review process. properly reviewed hopefully validated studies finding mean more.

As right now, mean much aside hopeful optimism. worst timeline trio 6’ distancing bare minimum, indoors, droplets aerosols linger air. time spend talking without masks risk servers patrons, especially loud bunch. 
Basically, aren’t directly engaged eating drinking, truly better covering on. Even better eating restaurants! LOL wouldn’t compare state size Germany leadership state level? You’re taking word “country” super weird sense two “countries” alike. lot similarities US states European countries USA European countries Ugh post truthful hurts heart know population expendable 1% Many European countries higher death rates U.S. Berlin huge anti-mask march.  
This endless high horsing dumb getting old. really case Bay Area?

Boston still extremely compliant least well areas. Parks stuff people beginning relax little long good room socially distance, that's fair enough. Hospitalization still down:  


ICU still down:   


Deaths per day still down:  (Avlidna per dag) two weeks seems increase cases young 20-29 years like summer holiday kept down

This simplification imo. ""summer holiday"" keeps numbers, numbers decreasing since April? sound like troll.

You know already 3G.. 4G? Wifi? 5G nothing else thing, another frequency (different wavelength, stuff getting transmitted).

A 100 years ago people complained electricity getting everyone sick flu. saying electricity hurting you?

The 5G thing newest dumbest shit people clue technology come with. dumb assholes complained headaches 3G cellphone tower erected near neighborhood. Till phone company told even turned yet.

Fucking hell, delete Facebook account, stop watching FOX ""News"" (It label ""entertainment program"" otherwise would get sued real news) maybe read book. means important things worry moment like dying I’m threatening anyone lol think it’s kinda messed anyone reveling another country’s failure get thing control many lives lost  utilities going jeopardy several months going unpaid, basically covid relief lifted... We're going left dark. know congress make minds soon.

Not mention evicted soon rent relief kicked.. fucked, fucked.

I'm negatives overdrawn monthly bank charges can't even afford, need keep account open got first stimulus deposit on, really, really hoping second hopeful right now. 

Is American way? Yeah sucks games play on. It’s part game. Also part game parity “Any Given Sunday” team beat team.

The NFL shouldn’t won’t shut due imbalance talent given week. realize jobs constantly interact people, right? I'm saying masks problem, jobs afford luxury on/off throughout day. last time bus especially US? Wife road one younger college even far. Closer college way different first part ride. Always adventure got second vehicle drove opposite direction work early morning picked me.uo later. We're work located bus really worked unless option hours ride more. Large spread.out metro area. college closer straight shot. work would multiple transfers long long ways. mass shootings year...  Someone mentally cope reality.  Opinions something like whether pickles taste good, something like whether masks help prevent spread disease. 

You get opinion fact. Believing sky red make true. putting IFR 0.6%? end day, lot signs point outdoor transmission much, much limited indoor transmission. would apt suggest people socially distance outside risk infection drop dramatically  .0005 5 ten thousandths percent. 

Or it’s 50 100,000

Statistically much lower typical death rate within population ranges anyone 15 year olds.


[2017 Death Rate U.S. age  know. waste money going a4 start restaurant largely western europe now

It's not. Belgium, might close second wave. might already started. Antwerp-province invoked curfew last week seems like cases rising fast anymore, starting rest country too. 

""Thanks"" heatwave, plenty people flock coast too, seems like people least try distance wear mask - although news ofcourse full idiots *don't* use brain. imagine lot addicts/alcoholics. dont give much shit them, looks like that's come bite us. 👀 Imagine refusing wear camo freedom refusing turn lights air raid drills, risk person whole community vaccines 100% effective, could behind idea. Thing is, they're not. 

I'm Hep B non responder. matter many times take shots, develop protective antibodies. that's tried true vaccine time world for.

They're shooting 50-60% efficacy Rona shot, last read. means without 100% adoption we're still pretty screwed. Ann arbor ask question. know aggressive towards first time ever interacted. immunocompromised wife husbands right you. exhausting maddening. Gotcha, thanks taking time explain it.  old age preventable. differs clinical presentation pneumonia covid vs causing factors? Germany tiny minority managed gather around 16,000 18,000 people (estimations vary) forming alliance kinds idiots sides political spectrum. protest everything Nazis Antifa, Reichsbürger (German sovereign citizens) conspiracy theorists, on. politicians discussing combat idiocy.  

In US half voters sided Trump masks common public statement.  

So yes, hardcore idiots exist everywhere. average German way basic trust system science average American. Bottom line, America looks like coordinated governmental response pandemic. still raging here, long quieted parts world. people trying best, interspersed people trying enough, all, virus continue spread.

It's maddening living here. Cover holes! Stay away other! That's it. Rubick's Cube puzzle decipher. requires unity, empathy, bit selflessness. qualities diluted atrophied America, display world see.

Learn us.

Signed, ~~United~~ States America. It’s also exponentially difficult larger country’s population is. One absolutely expect country like US control virus well smaller country like Finland. side effects Covid cause lot complications. example, get sick forced stay inside. careful body begin lack vitamin D. 

I friend tested positive Covid, lost appetite, everything tasted salty. ended getting hypercalcemia due lack eating healthy eating day, (maybe). go ER started muscle spasms, shortness breath. anyone reading this, go outside, get exercise, take mask live healthy normal life. favors staying home getting fat. 

And catch ""corona"" take HCQ + Zinc make sure get vitamins. alright stadium makes itch COVID19 5 million entire population Singapore, ranked top competitive country economically across world 2019. basically product mass stupidity, then. shame, guys could prevented people take seriously and/or government taking seriously. America 100 million people country difference case numbers absolutely massive (120k vs 5 million), feel bad guys ACTUALLY cares health. What's alarming response want downplay serious threat bullshit.... debbie downer N95 masks less effective normal surgical masks breathe flaps filter open let air unfiltered, one way street. 
But good part staying indoors much possible! forget oh essential Super Bowl parties there'll be.

See guys 2022. seem matter average prior deaths people older That's still pretty small. comparison 1 700 babies born Syndrome. kind backwoods redneck states would allow 1 1000 citizens die this? Yikes! Yeah sister's response saying voted Bernie ""So want socialism!?"" 

What frustrates forming opinion Trump based hearing news source. source Twitter, words others! appalling wake nonsense every morning see tearing country apart.

Throw hear news confirms pathetic excuse leader truly is. RIP America. here's another number you, then. 

1 54 children U.S. diagnosed autism spectrum disorder, impacting families life.

If 1 2000 noticeable crisis U.S. concerned disease, 1 54 red alert. Alright, I’ll bite:

The virus genome sampled thousands times scientists world, confident public knowledge exactly genomic structure virus looking structure virus experts outside China Here's why: SARS-CoV-2 closely related virus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), fanned across globe nearly 20 years ago. Scientists studied SARS-CoV differs SARS-CoV-2 — several key letter changes genetic code. Yet computer simulations, mutations SARS-CoV-2 seem work well helping virus bind human cells. scientists deliberately engineered virus, chosen mutations computer models suggest work. turns out, nature smarter scientists, novel coronavirus found way mutate better — completely different— anything scientists could created, study found. Another nail ""escaped evil lab"" theory? overall molecular structure virus distinct known coronaviruses instead closely resembles viruses found bats pangolins little studied never known cause humans harm. ""If someone seeking engineer new coronavirus pathogen, would constructed backbone virus known cause illness,"" according statement Scripps. contrast, evidence engineering thesis showed near lab working bats, doesn’t explain pangolin Connection, even somehow came bat escaped lab would mean intentionally engineered.

Animal human viruses show regularity statistically predictable phenomenon, way mutation looks conjunction fact “normal” viruses show somewhere world every years makes “China engineered it” hypothesis unnecessarily extravagant explanation.

Basically, Occam’s Razer idea. God people seem understand shitload foreigners China confirm things eyes. numbers probably 100% accurate? course not. tell people I'm blue face feat China's containment virus was. mind boggling watching happen, never impressed. outbreak ended city MONTHS ago. last death end February nobody died since Florida. That's thing infectious diseases. there's outbreak, happens fast kills lot. kill consistent/linear number. timeline long enough, like whole year. becomes pretty predictable. sure popular sport is, Soccer, hockey, Rugby also extreme number concussions. Everyone gladiator sport whether want admit not. sounds like you’re *past* capacity then. it? can't infected, roughly dangerous spread virus inanimate object. Sure, spreading misinformation ""no common cold"" plainly stupid, change fact almost certainly infection risk himself. approved vendor, product denied. close long Sweden investigations Finland shown children contributing much terms transmission Sweden report comparing risk covid-19 different professions, showed increased risk teachers. conclusion, closure schools measurable direct impact number laboratory confirmed cases school-aged children Finland Sweden. negative effects closing schools must weighed positive indirect effects might mitigation covid-19 pandemic. Ok, problem masks prevent people spreading disease. form *source control*. Letting people wear masks *is problem*. Masks mobile quarantine-lite. protect contracting much help prevent spreading. want contract someone else, social distancing much, much important. However, still without risks. Allowing someone without mask building breath collect onto surfaces strong UV radiation sterilize harm people hours later. Exiting home without mask protect you. protect others. people campaigning understand. harming everyone, others wear masks. China great you’re right person. western businessman (which sounds like are) gets treated much better. goes Chinese wealthy connected enough work closely westerners. 

China gets dark happens really quickly. Let’s forget million people concentration camps RIGHT lying entire time. know satellite imagery disproving claims.

Tell uighurs stance China let’s see say population people able buy tickets growing   Dude every year something like 1 every 77 Americans dies. Saw bar scene modern movie day felt real anxiety lack masks / social distancing.  I’ve since switched sci-fi, animated, period shows/movies. Fairly easy figure out.

NJ population = 8.9M 
NJ COVID deaths = 16k

So yeah, actually 3, like 3.6 every 2000 NJ.

Or simplified even further, pretty close 1 every 500. :-( Ah ok. Good virus then!

Doesn't mean virus ""good"" mean people keep exaggerating it. Remember citizen reporter Wuhan peak virus, supposedly got ""disappeared tortured"" CCP videos? watched videos. Dude napkin math crematoriums number bodies napkin math pretty much matched official numbers. another instance man laying middle street. Western media portrayed ""bodies piled sides streets, bad!"" watched video. old dude cane fell get up. one wanted help scared coronavirus. Eventually citizen reporter helped get called ambulance case. 

As ""disappearance,"" forced quarantine apartment several weeks snooping around crematoriums coronavirus deaths. brutally tortured. Everyone Reddit assumes must saying they're gonna kill family. 

Like get it, CCP authoritarian dictatorship commits tons atrocities. torture dude pretty much confirmed official story. Thanks providing response. fuming responded entertained should’ve. Yeah, 7and 4 year old. really rough go this. knows mental side younger kids longterm. mean don’t want kid turn like Howard Hughes wear tissue boxes feet! I’m obviously joking there, issues longterm depression anxiety. Plague Rats. Yes, going hard sort since covid causes heart attack deaths, going doctor thought minor angina also cause deaths. Others like overdose car accident easier sort ""caused covid"" ""caused something else"" close long Sweden Outbreak investigations Finland not
shown children contributing much terms transmission Sweden a
report comparing risk covid-19 different professions, showed increased
risk teachers.
In conclusion, closure schools measurable direct impact the
number laboratory confirmed cases school-aged children Finland or
Sweden. negative effects closing schools must weighed the
positive indirect effects might mitigation covid-19 pandemic. long blows, I'm good. actions lack thereof minority very, bad consequences majority. data, Woolf said, **suggests COVID-19 death counts reported public underestimate true death toll pandemic U.S.**

""There several potential reasons under-count,"" said Woolf, professor Department Family Medicine Population Health VCU School Medicine. ""Some may reflect under-reporting; takes awhile data come in. cases might involve patients COVID-19 died related complications, heart disease, complications may listed cause death rather COVID-19.

""But third possibility, one we're quite concerned about, indirect mortality -- deaths caused response pandemic,"" Woolf said. ""People never virus may died causes spillover effects pandemic, delayed medical care, economic hardship emotional distress.""

I dont know ""concludes"" would word I'd choose premise. read actual headline, talking incorrect title OP posted? feel too. father, sister, grandmother vulnerable. mom ones likely ok get sick. ones working can't isolate rest family. one us gets sick give rest family can't begin imagine break me. chilling rate people dying, chances technically going  it’s difference opinion. spreading misinformation. Seasonal colds flu spread schools like wildfire. corona surprisingly compliant. really don't. think precautions ""Inconvenient.""

Kind like delusion nothing even going on. rationalizing much effort ego.

I mean. lot people can't even follow Traffic Laws. capacity. Delaying results 2+ weeks rejecting essentially same. produce single useable test essentially wasting capacity. Lab tested cases mere fraction flu cases full count covid cases, article proves covid deadly.

Thanks.I'll sure pass on. Bill Gates right.  Tests take longer 3 days paid and/or reimbursed.

We create wrong insensives paying useless information. analogy falls flat scenario they'd send cavalry shoot every terrorist dead.

Oh god! Tell Americans buying guns trying shoot virus protect themselves? would late. Watch Last Ship tv show. I'm sure who's side he's on. 3 people executed last 30 years 20th century none last 29 years. Kind makes think problem mostly fixed. biggest problems. believe 100% masking, remove need distance. People seem think incorrect No, compare similar country Europe...
Belgium good example, almost identical economic structure.
Equal population, equal city populations, equal market structure.

They Europeans totally different economic/market structures.

The countries hit hardest nations poor healthcare system nation alot international trade- movement people.

Have looked deaths per capita without anything else end conclution.

This topic bit complicated that...


As said, try objective critizism. wonder post shooting statistics food health wellness forum? Stop spreading disease Mexico! participating project design show feasibility small containment boxes house people developing country like India material said cardboard plastic material well main issue waste management human excrements thought using toilet portable ones wont work 14 days 55% people hospitalized, 55% people tested positive lol Look happened Chicago tonight. impact. CFR dumb metric. Would slightly better odds choosing one other? Wow... it’s like “law order”. 5% global population, 25% prisoners. schools cancel school last year spring break? everything ok? Would elderly buy lottery tickets though? Corner store gambling seems like elderly thing (especially peelers, like holy fuck peel side buy redbull), feel like number tickets sold population declining.

On hand, gambling corner stores seems mainly middle-age men (proline), also feel like main lottery balanced terms participation amongst population. Less people playing wouldn’t increase odds either, unless referring risk splitting top prize. anything, pool would take longer grow risk-return would worse often I’m town 30k, 15 people died. survival rate 99.95%. Sounds dangerous. Not. Two months saying opposite. China dictate America responded pandemic. Politics. think mean Ohio State fan Ah making shit understand perfectly now.

South Korea hit early. low deaths. UK hit much later. high deaths. know talking about.

The important factor response people government, response hospitals. 0.05% large you, wonder 99.95% looks like. somehow feel seems much smaller comparison. 160k people sounds like lot lost ones. rate corona easily beat cancer deaths year USA. 1 2000 seems few. highly unlikely would even know someone even aquaintances friends lost someone. sadly, quickly change current behavior government. 17 every 2,000 people die EVERY year. elderly.

Death fact life. better triage tests. management problem. Right use capacity produce 100% useless tests. Google abdl person idiots die COVID would actually win win global warming. Less population less people fighting implementing necessary measures. venn diagram people think global warming COVID real circle. Plus title article say 'stadia' 'stadiums'. literally illegal prevent haha even choice suffering.  metrics yet idiots refusing wear masks. need resort highly biased testing shows problem control. get sinus infections every year, like clockwork. didn’t get sinus infection Spring. Spring months stayed indoors 99.5% time. cOuLd PrEdiCtEd ThIs?!? like /r/collapse :) Depends point time set “expected death toll”

Early March would hear anything 1M 5M deaths U.S.  

I think CDC estimating 350k ish deaths 2020. first two tested valved respirators design easy breathe of. Oxygen depravation different issue difficulty breathing . issue people legitimately issues breathing masks probably wearing masks thick(especially heat). Blue surgical mask easiest huge gaping holes nose sides air goes easily. Try wearing tight KN95 2 hours moving heat. uncomfortable. Let’s risk anyway! /s US Pop 323 million. 
5 million cases. 
1.5% Pop = 1.5 every TEN people contract zero knowledge long term effects be. yeah, uhm, wear mask mask. ""Diarrhea kills people every year!""

My coworker. COVID killed twin sister, still give fuck ""she schizophrenic anyway."" Every state look like Florida year. give useful statistic like number years people acceptable fitness level underlying conditions lost also compared years? know people claiming uncomfortable hot and/or humid. is. I'm going wear it, I'm actively something hardly notice it. stop second, notice it, uncomfortable often quite sweaty. Winter time going aftershock lot us care.

Which one(s)?  mean many... crime wave

You know actually massive crime wave, right? NYC low crime rates, increase looks like large percentage increase.

Also, tax base billionaires going anywhere. They'll move Westchester bit, move back. 0.05% big part that, would died meantime soon, nevertheless. trying downplay gravity pandemic absolute numbers big indeed, trying put perspective, something many fail do. course, especially possible collapse health care system real issue face. mean hand know 2 people died whose deaths count COVID we're like 99% sure it. inflammatory headline😂 We're looking 1 85 dead. That's many die every year, keep life expectancy is.

Don't fall fearmongering, especially half Europe worse. I'm fairly certain picture used way show amount people actually looks like, show people irresponsible masks social distancing. would willing bet picture taken coronavirus/Covid 19 arrived world. It’s also isn’t. Means use individual? mean like personally?

why look way? Imagine abruptly dying getting enjoy rest life. imagine experiencing hundred thousand times Also, many businesses college towns depend college students also pressure bring students back campus. Gainesville, FL (University FL) ICU capacity around 9-13% remaining last two weeks. without 30 thousand undergrad students since March (about 1/6 population city). expect bad things happen..... size fairly decent sized city now. NYC sized anything, city 160k quite chunk population. insane people still acting like nothing. R2.5... great, terrible. is. must tough...turning back parents....and forced return classroom. Don’t know China disease Wuhan, despite labeling mystery pneumonia lockdowns early on?

Yeah fucking right. China probably million deaths, they’d never report it. mean, back March wore masks, gloves, etc. still caught it. still careful  absolutely best ride Disney World. even best Magic Kingdom that's Dwarf Mine Train. 

Weirdly, single best ride Disney World giant zoo amusement park hybrid Thanks, looking correct. Sadly notion get back work get lives comes top. president directly responsible countries apathy inability act responsibly.  what? Alchoholism celebrated states reason. every country cultural aspect it, Americans want live hard. 

I never seen party bus show want get fuck fast, states never good sign.

Our best resource substance abuse God, there's that. ""It unfortunate targeted scapegoat origin virus,"" said doctor working virology lab epicenter deadly global pandemic. course, that's social media. Imagine worse thinking best. Guy comes back Wuhan, virus broke anyone spoke threatened/silenced, somehow US fault taking measures early enough? Give break. Maybe chinese people werent eating fucking bats torturing live animals unsanitary conditions eating them, wouldnt issue all. sure hope so! 2018 midterms largest turnout midterm election since 1966.

Id expect turnout year even higher Clickbait nonsense. great article someone something it.

Scientific malpractice seems ubiquitous days. remember exactly whole lot taking 15 cents hour away (I made 4.25, back day). eventually got fired talking one cashiers parking lot supposed getting carts snowstorm. suppose union could helped wanted to, really hating job anyhow. comes voted then? response sounded fragile inconsiderate Every armchair war hawk chickenshit wants send kids die nothing buys toothless girlfriends. Deeeep, man Lock doors, bur.... America ignoring COVID fucking dipshit might late americans, late you. smart survive maybe consider leaving 3rd world country get chance. Stupidity skiped generations. ok appreciate links. I'll take look.

It wrong say claim US better country Europe unsourced. instance, [this shows several European countries higher coronavirus deaths per capita. Sweden higher coronavirus deaths per capita despite lower population density.

Now saying US better country Europe. quite possible, even likely, not. say claim unsourced incorrect. like source agree data accurate feel like tells whole story. That's discussion designed do--point things get truth. Shutting discussion kind comment sourcing valuable. I'm quite sad 

You need something stronger ""sad"".

There one party (and Fox) intentionally spread wrong information lead deaths thousands thousands people.

Do let party ever take uniform. party screaming send kids back burning schools right now. Since Rona contagious flu, people would respect her, flu season. ""Revealed"" implies hidden Gen Xers lucky graduating late 90s tech boom. also suffer nearly much 2009 recession. plugged ventilator ICU make look strong, dealing bankrupt homeless due hospital bill makes look extra strong, better yet ultra strong dead open casket cardboard coffin Honestly probably right. I'm used everything Reddit anti Chinese probably misinterpreted this.

And Chinese American daughter plan send Mandarin immersion school, comment drove wrong way. understandable mate, nice day I'll get right 30% unemployment rate source income family.

Who gives fuck job context. Also, health insurance tied job delightful American shade fucking retarded. Fix country, fix yourself. mean healthy pro athlete gets COVID dies heart attack think anything COVID? lol. Recovered means virus anymore. mean get permanent damage like heart lung brain damage seeing large numbers. real FFS ppl like denying dangerous disease.

* Inconsiderate
* Retarded decent person like laughs widows lost husbands? Yeah US put travel warning New Zealand. UK like US run conservative dipshits concerned optics actually getting pandemic control. also need remember 40% households children 18 women primary sole source income. head household own. Holy fuck. absolute delusion.

Did white supremacists force Democratic mayor DeBlasio tell people keep going out? white supremacists cause Democratic governor Cuomo put Covid infected patients nursing homes?

God damn white supremacists sure lot power. NFL shut experience major outbreaks one club let alone several. 

It's one two players would - like one two players MLB. Coronavirus gets team could easily half team - whose playing like that?

And half team 10+ days? good serious competition anything. 

It's DUMB try play sports middle pandemic. that's US - always trying wrong thing. Dollars people amrite. Yet everyone keeps coming here

lol. Post r/jokes  don’t hear AIDS often cases deaths occur developing countries. However lived worked countries you’d see ton prevention education measures place. going say, someone old enough remember AIDS. plenty videos YouTube Americans explain find life better Europe moving. Among things commonly mentioned: better work-life balance, free healthcare, better quality food (and life general) on. could also say see interesting experience, like cultures, etc. MLB pretty good players though. one bat bigs gets free healthcare life, example, form pension well. Used say time working family dollar near downtown New Orleans: I'm living movie ""Idiocracy"" *state* may “belong” group, somewhere close half, lowest third, neighbors still do. America “purple” country, purples indigo purples violet, absolutely battle divided ideological lines. watched “The Swamp” HBO even though knew this, showed much much worse expected. government. People failed themselves. We've months protests, riots looting wearing masks, anti-mask lunatics, people throwing block parties masks rich sport stars like 30 strippers house naked dancing masks (saw world star lol).

It's government. suppose do? try force things you, turn around say violating rights, like sending FEDs help local police riots/looting. much do. People stupid fuck. clearly can't follow basic conversational flow.

Shut front door buckeroo, I'm done you. late rescind Marshall Plan? New York didn’t 

Yes actually that. 

It's hilarious baby rando numbername accounts keep lying lying offended caught. there’s basically herd immunity.

You understand anything biology, you? various TN high schools already cancelled multiple weeks practice outbreaks iirc west virginia players refusing practice outbreak Explains much Gen X. 18 older Y2K. Nah, I'm acknowledging points, considerate thoughtful, get downvote 20 seconds post reply. Real different. I'm cool adult discussion flame war. Spatial technologies, mean geospatial? American - Yeah duh getting groceries delivered, grandma killer? /s

Seriously though, me. go outside exercise, lot virtual game nights, wear mask everywhere. I've turn in-person invites friends hang out, know coworkers planning weekend trips Tahoe. frustrating can't risk getting sick, still believe better behave sooner things return normal. Pick topic. Lol. learned Americans think know best everything despite knowledge countries societies existed thousands years. Guess wrong along. think America ( country really love) horrible tendency totally fucking ignore every country’s history came us. like “hold beer bro I’ll show it’s done”. predicted 350k dead end year. lack compliance masks, explosion hotspots, mass gatherings, schools makes worried gonna worse. Yep, third world is. Infrastructure bad, healthcare bad, political system bad. least people US perceive third world. May due brainwashing glorification. Can’t wait see one Sweden’s football teams square American football team: ball play with? 🏈 ⚽️ Everyone looking Sturgis super spreader event bad thing, long run it’s Darwinism playing naturally. Nope, Washington state. True, getting better US. contained like needs be. Look graphs Germany, Italy, France, Sweden compare US. Even Spain resurgence, got control while. can't get thing control all, 5 months. 

* US -- Germany -- Italy -- France -- Sweden -- Spain -- Oh indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed unfriend button easy click ;) education, work world too. demonstrably better something makes others feel bad lash out. That's people tendency sink lowest common denominator. Excelling something frequently punished. Quick google search friend. Yes. Oh, easy. AIDS primarily kills LGBT people ex-/drug users. Even though medicine make impossible transmit HIV, disease successful staying localized right demographic. look weak wearing one. 1-800-sorry-m-american probably right. less tests, less cases possible get deaths then🤔
america fucking stupid. everyone knows bad pandemic. tell people lies reveal ass. pretty damn clear lot going wrong states. since corona. since trump got elected. think play first game, surprised outbreaks couple teams training camp results cancellation season rather teams playing handicapped.

EDIT: definitely play short teams regional outbreaks.  Thank Mr. Veggiedelite. always respect someone agree disagree. hope good day too.

By way, veggie delite sandwich always get Subway 😋 bring amazing point.

Drugged.

I've met many Americans travels taking sorts anti depressants anti anxiety pills dead inside. really care anything.

No country drugs population like this.

I wonder factor... news? thought everyone already knew us? told supposed friend thought rhetoric. meltdown blocked me. except NBA teams involved. MLB last another 4 weeks Next year see single American women men list international dating/marriage sites.

People places like Taiwan might able marry American woman wants emigrate. Germany GDP 4 billions, Texas 1,8. That's flattering Texas. Maybe aids spreads someone comes within 6 feet worry it. compare car accidents covid next lol Thanks, smile. remembered Pravda Izvestia inseparable partners, like Fox CNN. USA turning third world shithole eyes, grateful live peaceful covid eradicated New Zealand right :) That's said ""so many of"" instead ""all."" rain parade there's coffin shortage. Probably going decay morgue truck month two straight cremation chamber urn they're lucky. Mass graves ditch they're late party.

Source: New Yorker healthcare American Bill Rights Bill Responsibilities. Bunch pussys wearing masks. Called 100 people public never say shit back call murdering selfish assholes. always start offering mask, say make excuses, start guilt tripping like mother caught lying. American, damn time. Maybe we'll able come better. *Welcome son machine* really revelation, it? Think treated dying AIDS 80s. ""they"" different ""us"", many people care, even thought ""they"" deserved die. also mean people moving even within USA. Much less reason live cities now. many quarantines seems attempt teach going constantly disrupted. far PTO, that's insane. treating teachers way retail workers treated. Difference is, finite amount teachers, plenty desperate unemployed people replace sickened retail workers. 

Opening schools current circumstances one cruelest, foolish things could happen. close knows many casualties. loss respect people / countries think it’s funny many people losing lives that’s “I keep real!”

Real stupid, is. would careful term herd immunity everyone throwing term around mean anything.

But it’s makes sense 1 five people immune spread slows. Honestly, it’s probably difficult moderate longer. America made GLOBAL PANDEMIC political, Trump’s fragile ego. He’s convinced brainless legion it’s hoax, propagated entire world, affect presidency, you’re seeing effect has. that, US essentially new epicenter infection, definitely second wave. article explanation why, absolutely affects rest world. mean, come on, banned travel now, that’s pretty sad. schools foreigners learn German wish to? Asking myself. area state completely meaningless, Alaska less people city state Hamburg. 
Germany's population much 1/4 entire US, US states tiny populations. 
Several German states larger populations majority US states. 
46 US States smaller population German states like Bavaria NRW.

Besides California US states populated, comparing countries extremely ignorant. 200,000 dead Americans.

Trump: ""Shoo Shoo China Flu!""

&lt;his crowd goes wild...and cough Racists tied public education funding property taxes intentionally deprive poor urban (black) communities resources allowing upper middle class (white) communities fund better schools. 

As population grew became integrated urbanized, bulk population subjected underfunded outright failed school systems. 

Now, seeing end result generations people undereducated assuming adult roles society. 

The chickens ignorance come home roost. Agree. Plus, unlike women, men probably used told government cannot bodies... ever wiped shopping cart? might well poking around body. Exactly. like warned multiple times shown horrible outcomes simply chose ignore say never happen them. dont think like group anything, people I've talked years. mean Americans larger part snowflakes??... well, duh. Lots tough talk woods little behind them, empty platitudes mixed pride. I'm guessing slightly different now. college around '05; online tech still somewhat infancy. think lot emotional maturity. lot selfish idiots we're talking older generations, stupid really celebrated school. older brother (graduated '89) gifted courses school, found popular purposely failed classes.

Still though, idea stupid things ignoring idea consequences lot people consider ""cool."" masks used political weapons, know something wrong. always work sink holes!  really funny preach whataboutism literally it.

And condensation top with. bet gave big ol pat back comment lol. probably huffing paint first Fragile polite way putting it. would call shit show west rn. One biggest surprises utterly fragile capitalism is.

I mean, pretty big critic capitalism, incredible inability economic system handle shocks become utterly apparent.

Think many times American consumer taxpayers bailed billionaires last decades.

That system cruel unable help average person surprise though. say but, flip side, I'm seeing masks midwest seen entirety pandemic. don’t see much difference whole league bubble vs half league bubble. It’s money another hotel Disney. People said thing baseball Everyone keeps saying get degree also invalidating teachers good reason concern. I'm personally weighing options, many us masters degrees built careers education. Many sole bread winners need jobs support families. 

For personally, lot lose quitting. would lose $10K already invested masters (which incomplete) take loss. could lose certification quiting contract pay fines. means wasted money time career potentially barred from.

West Virginian educators sucessful went strike, support broader community. teachers' shoulders. need community join us fight ensure safety students.

Collectively probably 100,000 deaths? whatever now, 100,000 deaths 4 countries alone catastrophic. reach threshold can't stand moral high ground talk much better Europe done (not you, i'm talking article refers to). perhaps little anecdotal experience UK, i'm questioning Europeans feel like condescend US continent passed 200,000 deaths last month. 

Europe population 740 million (sorry know that's EU whole continent) slightly double US. Europe 200,000 deaths US 160,000 ish. course next months US going get worse ratio really say Europe leaps bounds US. 

in Europe that's percentage 0.027% US that's 0.053%. compare Asian countries numbers, Asia that's leaps bounds ahead. think Europe anything cheer about. always wear mask. try avoid stores enforce it. democrat run places highest deaths needed pass mandatory mask order right opened back up. Repost also nothing confirmed yet. - fragile American said people aren’t worrying? care one thing. love seeing posts, infection rate area high can’t access medical care need. hope don’t catch suffer chronic illness, don’t want people joining club. said, hardly death sentence, survived heart attack too. sick two weeks, never hospitalized. Never got really serious. again, come family tough kill. think that’s true. point nearly every job that’s still occupied human sales.  even jobs changing. last company got rid outside sales reps thought would effective use inside sales reach old-school, relationship driven clientele. primarily private equity ownership told corporate “well, Netflix doesn’t sales guys.”  World fire, bout yours? American exceptionalism fucking lie

Never exceptional. country morons. really Darwinism works humanity. Sure might get ass like Hernán Cain (who isn’t reproducing anymore either way) die inevitably mostly gets weeded poor Responding insult empty threat break war treaties?

rightist fragility best 😂😂 agree. I'm extremely affluent educated suburb Chicago people around still likely wear masks poorly take seriously. fragile.... inconsiderate. 2300 percent 23x. percents trick folks. Anyone says Germans arent social hasnt met German \^\^ r/unexpectedmetallica  Going completely honest, I’m definitely guilty. live NY. March, April, May, June took things super seriously, quarantining older mom upstate. barely leaving house, going groceries, Lysol wiping groceries. didn’t go eat opened indoor seating. I’m back city, idk, seeing curve remain flat basically June July, going lie it’s hard force stay inside. always wear mask (properly aka covering nose mouth) outside, guess that’s I’m justifying myself. friends go park, we’re always pretty far away groups. go eat (only done twice since beginning July) make sure it’s restaurant tables actually spaced far apart. Idk maybe it’s irresponsible That's voting work. Question: would know? Hey, know life experiences. I've never seen SpyKids kid came out.

Also Banderas decades-long established actor Spy Kids. ignore Spy Kids cultural juggernaut? Yes, surprising someone would know kids movie work point adult-oriented films. would interesting see US media outlets report Asian society views Europe America context.

That would disallowed editor China bad.  Everything administration says disingenuous best. It’s I’m thinking going several evangelical churches ‘healed’ end catching covid summer. Hence I'm asking there's place go see necessary skills pick up. I've already started teaching coding web design development. vaccines pathway safety, cannot distributed properly outside potentially 9-12 months time frame.

I bet anti-vaxxers going get woods full force one. hope devolve yet another shitshow vaccine available. least Sturgis asshats bikes. 'Rona ain't fast enough infect people riding bikes /s


But concerts? Holy shit Yet AIDS still deadly, mean anything you?  wear masks helmets. get fancy athletic ones secure better. Revealed? Nope. knew.

Confirmed. Yes. Me. I'm today sorry. Covid doesn’t know it’s messing with, doubtful escape zorros wrath think anyone thinks funny

The rest world surprised saddened growing looked US certain way, changed 

And changed Yes every state lockdown intent getting soon safely possible. Americans crossing borders could potentially ruin economies would need lockdown i.e. keep stupid people borders please.  worked Amazon havent you... lol swear thats exactly there. work hard try move ladder others like wtf bro chill slow down. country now? reliable control deaths within timeline? would interesting see way contextualize this. Like percentage Americans normally die within timeframe? article based study yet. NJ checking in.  concern beaches. Meanwhile Western Australia cases, one cleanest places land masses world I'm sure cases counted, opportunistic secondary bacterial pneumonia infection uncommon cause death individuals infected influenza. possible good number pre-covid numbers accounted cases like that. 

I'm sure phenomenon holds true COVID. know virus final cause death, beats body point secondary infection prove fatal. However, given nature current pandemic, would hope second scenario deaths still reported COVID, whatever opportunistic pathogen happened be. 

All say I'm sure accurately compare 2 reported numbers. said, know really pressing right now. Whatever result is, actionable information still tens thousands dying state, distancing measures need bolstered. Yo must understand optimistic facts pandemic (which bad is) mean anti-mask anti-vaccines virus denyers. remember F.A.S.T (it's even printed ambulances area)

Hold steady, I’m saying things get better.
But least hopefully make things little better others continue thinking issues world never seemed time.

Just keep looking silver linings clouds.

Hell, cry need to.
Might well die good cause least? NYC started terribly turned around May. 

I’m using example specifically I’m American rest country still seeing surges cases hospitalizations, they’re trending direction. expect CDC calculating permutations. They're number analyses real time data come (excess deaths without COVID, % deaths coded pneumonia/influenza/COVID, etc).

But likely published considered accurate 2022, year's mortality counts finalized. comparing numbers numbers still awful one thing credit Sweden statistics accurate guess.

Are implying countries accurate statistics? decline flu. People keep bringing up, people get flu don’t get Covid vice versa. true, one nothing other. boat Ontario. schools opening 100% beginning September.  


Eventhough cases, takes one kid. One kid know infected, snowballs there. Well done take upvote would part mandatory public service citizens, like compulsory military service countries instead drafted public president short term 3-4 years lol. mention, need keep mind Many don’t believe brainwashed. victims. 
 
I get mad too, spreading others didn’t make dumb decisions, it’s largely education issue. 
 
I don’t fault adults can’t read. It’s usually due poor schooling. Yes. Well aren’t testing population random, definitely can’t extrapolate positivity rate whole State. 

They’re testing people symptomatic contact confirmed cases. obviously 20% high, show spread community significant Ok, think might've fallen propaganda.

I know bit China, I've lived Chongqing Chengdu 2 years, early 2010s (HSK level III Mandarin). maybe experiences differ mine. Yes, soapy water effective disinfectant. Surfaces considered low risk now, worry much it. 

See surface effectiveness soapy water disinfectant. Note virus amount go exponentially time even surface uncleaned. flu MAY kill large numbers indication severe lifelong complications apparent COVID. Without immunity testing even verify longterm immunity Covid shot still places risk maintaining wearing masks social distancing know immunity clock runs risk again. death rate children increase substantially. reason morbidly low protected. They've generally downplayed it, constantly reluctant anything it. Masks mandatory shops 3 weeks ago, instance. Anything exhale valve like gas mask much easier. Try things kn95 sealed face. take gas mask day. Wow, that's actual title. Interesting article. side people hesitant seek medical help anything covid, leading preventable deaths. ignored real thing. care old/frail people life. Bunch old people. age 40 prexisting conditions, less fatal flu. great spike deaths occurs 60-65. 1 half stadium. Michigan's stadium holds bit 100,000 people

A lot would probably dead anyway considering old people many diseases had. UK count numbers properly. comically bad count COVID death. test positive march, get hit bus June, death counted COVID death. summer time open economy let's go parties, night clubs &amp; restaurants!!! fair way look this. around 3.000.000 yearly deaths US. That’s 18.5 every 2000 Americans.

These hundreds thousands deaths largely due incompetence government, community individuals killed Americans selfish reasons - many could've prevented. Comparing deaths old age, cancer, car accidents heart disease unfair. Yeah, we're sending *teachers* die. kids get long-term lung damage. matters why? nice staycation? one fucking traveling right now. Ask Canadian much baby cost they’ll tell outrageous $24 parking pay staying night. som parts Spain last week 42ºC. much hotter USA? particular situation, thinking differently. idiot one. since coming defense idiot, appears also one. It’s going 9 months *average* age person dying 80 years old. WASN’T pandemic going said 1 2000 Americans alive last Christmas passed, entirely believable. It’s sad, people don’t live forever. study link talking rate specifically Wuhan height outbreak. says study infectiousness countries remains seen. IIRC, Greeks anything people appointed random lottery spend positions. could argue unfit position (conflict interest, total drunkard, etc) people could claim unfit would next randomly chosen person; essentially still lottery.

It's essentially like way juries work. Random schmucks thrown positions. 

It work well. all. turns need expertise knowledge run government entities. Plus, lot people shit; either people workers position. There's reason Greek democracy last forever. complete insanity. Keep eye TX, plan right major districts bring back special/high needs students first, currently Sept. 8. priority given specialized units.

Those units comprised low incidence disabilities almost every student medically compromised. 

How bringing back kids severe underlying conditions first makes sense anyone beyond me. ever manufacture real mass product?

What talking true individual products huge number products. would extremely surprising possible error always going side.

I fully agree long numbers low comes millions. Statistically, errors follow Gauss, simple. It’s way late/early me. made back back N95 posts thought responding one questions.  0.05%. Pretty good wanna hear even chilling figure, excluding World War II American Civil War, Americans died Covid-19 died combat every war combined american history. includes world war I, Vietnam Korean war. I’m happy watching people masks  live America know states frequently ""heatwave"" like weather people rely Aircon (perhaps also due humidity? Idk.)  actually read chart incorrectly right axis label displaying mobile. realized within couple minutes made mistake, time comments deleted it. propaganda thanks prick. virus 0.2.


Yes, particles smaller .3 easier catch filter mask material. called Brownian motion.


People Finland, Denmark, Norway die much lower rates Sweden. Due social distancing.


Masks work, social distancing works. Stopping spread person person works.


Studying million one variables Singapore 100 years going keep anyone alive tomorrow.


Especially people going accept locked dorms couple months. U.K. approximately 1 every 1000.

It’s truly terrifying virus gotten everywhere :( think states going Trump ordered hospitals report HHS rather CDC.

In words, think HHS cooking books. drop new cases coincides exactly date changeover reporting.  potentially serious side effects: 
 aware one research stated symptomatic patients lung changes CTs 75% time asymptomatic 50% time, seperate study showed good recovery two months, one study reported 78 100 patients heart inflammation issues 2-3 months, another study showed 55% patients neurological symptoms (in study 60 patients). early say certain, would expect majority complications go away without requiring treatment, though one say right long take, subject symptoms seems sometimes linger imaging shown organ recovery. Hopefully larger thorough studies available soon. ten extreme cases hospitalized covid people six die, disease sixty percent chance kill you. still less half one half one percent chance. true irrespective culture creed medical insurance medial practices infrastructure. talking CFR basically way make things seem far worse really measures accurately degree testing available. one sixty people four hundred actually get tested, thirty test positive, actually exactly real stats work we're told reading, Woah golly six thirty hospital! That's head line!

The thing cfr good forum context fear mongering. flu bro. Remember Trump election, Brexit vote passed? huge argument heard losing sides old people didn’t deserve vote, weren’t gonna soon anyway voice doesn’t matter, they’re ruining future etc. people seemed flipped position elderly death toll convenient them.

I’m saying either argument 100% correct, observation. medical system trash long time.

Like, don’t need known cared, acting like it’s something new silly. think talking too, idea think lol.

You're 15-year-old nobody internet, probably amount anything much life. 

That's facts kid. want amount something life, get internet, get away WoW Guild Wars, start going science textbooks learning much instead. math textbooks too.

Otherwise, average nobody like rest them. chy-nah saw massive increase pulmonary embolisms. Primarily young adult males. tested positive Covid. missed decimal point? America's health system fucked understand point extent. Indian states 2% medically certified deaths. That's atrocious. example, people would dying covid rural Bihar doctor say covid. deaths reflected officially. 

This article accusing India fudging tested patients deaths like China. undercounting deaths inevitable India thanks large population non availability medical services everywhere. goes undertesting well. time NYC started settle cases, 1 every 350 died.

Source:

* [NYC Population - 8.34 [Coronavirus related deaths - clearly ignoring science one. 1 150 people die every year America? cold efficiencies profit health care

lol health care system efficient. bloated shitmess. one early arguments asymptomatic transmission. technically symptoms minor realize them, debate whether distinction worth making discussion disease public. Oh absolutely. I'd rather people think opening schools sending kids die means there's public pressure keep schools closed open necessary safety precautions. 

I'm worried kids. I'm worried parents, teachers, staff, anyone else kids interact with. High schoolers pretty much good carriers disease 20s-30s, although elementary school kids seem less likely transmit others. 2.2 million confirmed covid cases, antibody testing indicated actual numbers comfortably 20 million plus. Yes? Found Sharty fan Yes, care. held hostage Republicans decided reality, fit whims, longer applies offensive, right offended.  fucking hate place. Arkansas. like [1 among Black Americans.

America really headed dustbin proud it. I'm kind expecting economic sanctions countries let Americans point time.  It’s localized, lack federal direction. state separate fed wants pull funding unless schools fully open. Trumps America. hear city online only. wast majority Sweden low population...
Which see deaths per capita region.

Did Google population density compared result? XD
Sweden like 80% forest follows covid hotspots weirdly enough (its weird all).
You compare nations economic structure bulit.
How much international travel per capita example.
How much movement people etc.

Im saying Sweden fail contain pandemic beginning pandemic.
The Swedish goverment way slow set foreign travel restrictions didnt quarantine people covid hotspots, like italy, China etc.
The local municipalities also failed protect elderly population, maybe due recent privatization local elder care system.

But saying Sweden bad job idiotic objectivly wrong...

Looking simple numbers trying push gotcha politics objective observation...
This issue broken small simple pieces... leader needs set rules people follow. Trumps harsh rules amounted saying “wear mask want, it’s compulsory won’t wearing one” (ignoring countless times statement downplayed severity virus)
 Trump also let states decide lock many allowed virus spread deep rural populations Dr Birx stated. 
 America failed first step enacting meaningful action contain spread. know. get irritated people probably never set foot New York saying herd immunity. need stay lane. I'm also happy 600 cases day. someone know gets severe case, that's real person sick. fair examples used good ones. Melbourne Australia call phase four lockdown, pretty much tightest lockdown short welded apartment.

We go drivethroughs go park. high risk activities. say mask mandatory times. people going work, however, unless work grocery store essential job. Childcare schools still open children essential workers.

The point comment think what's going America crazy (and part is), required fix things actually big change. 0.05% isn’t high death rate all, also gotta remember every American infected isn’t accurate representation death rate Current best estimate must deaths covid? 10 every 2000 would already dead year normally speak Mandarin can't use perfect tense English? That's surprising. 

The pandemic early 2010s, btw. you’re older content dying rather couple years? southern states would rather die take experience Yankee state like NY.

It’s pain ass would much easier. endemic, eradicated. talking lockdown *for rest time*. fuck that. moderately effective vaccine better management tools developed time means go back normal. I’m ignoring it. I’m pointing agreed me.

You wear mask outdoors engaging heavy exercise *can’t maintain appropriate distance beyond passing contact.” you’re going get caught crowds people running alongside you, need mask. you’re going maintaining distance outside quickly passing people, don’t. 

“Of course, one never say never anything medicine, still learning lot virus, chances catching virus unmasked, infected person merely walking past very, low....""

Exactly said. Cool but, uh, depend kids use them. need masks schools open.  Dude, that's like half world last couple months... living rock? It’s dosage. It’s immune system can’t react vaccine.

Whenever live mind sharing? NY locked almost month peak, actual peak may earlier captured, based testing capabilities hospital capacity. Since improvements testing treatment, states ultimately fare better even taking risks. we’re talking that? people symptoms don’t say things like “pulse oximeter” “costochondritis”. talk like I’m anxiety attack health. That’s I’m saying. 

And first symptom changed least 3 posts post history. went knowing sore throat first, advocating protective eyewear, knowing first symptom pink eye. It’s like added things realized may related symptoms. that’s necessarily case. would call nothingburger - seen proof surface transmission yet. I've seen cases surface transmission ruled out.

""We tried nothing ideas!"" ok - how?

How US could handled pandemic better? said, lot things preparation cultural - i.e. things late change shit hits fan.). could probably 500, these:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Avoiding politicize issue (Media people can't stopped that, political figures manage elsewhere). 
2. coherent national strategy expert authorities (CDC, FDA ...) allowed handle situation rather actively undermined.
3. Avoiding laymen \*speculative rambling medical treatment\* (UV light, injecting various things body, repeatedly talking HCQ evidence etc). 
4. I'm huge proponent shutdowns, let's say \*if\* shut down, clever open middle outbreak.
5. Introducing mandatory paid sick leave would great idea time, least quickly temporarily would no-brainer start pandemic. People going work symptoms afraid lose jobs/don't sick days/don't get paid one worst reasons transmission.  Places like New Zealand Taiwan give much hope, thing defeated. Time start limited trading tourism bloc keep economies afloat.  privelidged

Archive link: municipality Indre Østfold, south Oslo, facing strict restrictions since 59 people tested positive covid-19 recent days.
- critical situation, says municipal chairman Saxe Frøshaug adds number expected rise sharply.

To counteract spread infection, public activities closed: leisure centers, preschools, libraries, sports facilities bathing areas.

Employees municipal health care required wear mouth guards throughout work shifts, contact patients. addition, social gatherings private auspices prohibited all, practice means residents allowed socialize within household.

- municipality Indre Østfold using strongest tools slow development, says Frøshaug.
#The municipal chairman believes government's decision open border Sweden - Indre Østfold 45,000 inhabitants kilometers national border Värmland - behind outbreak.

- cases people abroad, **even green zones Sweden**, says.

- want call government close border Sweden again, situation control countries.

The restrictions take effect 10 pm Sunday. private contact ban initially apply one week, ban public gatherings apply end August. PFFT can't pay people working mcdonalds living wage, make 15 dollars hour, makes look worse comparison! supposed feel good someone else makes livable wage?! right, except “silly” business.

It might better stay remote statistic improves. administration seems choose ignore this... I'm kind angry accomplish anything except delaying two days wastes already small budget school has. need shut down. bet don’t support shutting “protests” even though none practice social distancing standing shoulder shoulder 3 months. Protesting “right” cause makes immune covid right? live Galveston Texas. day driving around, restaurants completely packed. top lines forming outside. Nobody masks on.

Unless parent trenches, idea going through. idea many nights obsessing trying figure best possible outcome kids. 

Actually, even parent...Mind business. That's absolutely true. There's tons rapid tests available, problematic way.

Counting serological tests would matter equally accurate compared PCRs, not.

There's also way say ""This PCR replacement"" mark specificity/sensitivity/brand reporting. Right better count data separate database/reporting system tabulate things equal. data lag percent positives better indicators missed infections.  go mall free. Entry Disney park $$$$. Remember stupid newspapers used sit near cash registers Walmart local grocery store headlines papers always ridiculous? would say things like, “Aliens get jobs McDonald’s!” Proof inside! Or, “Mermaids destroy boat coast California!” Or, “Dinosaurs spotted local wildlife park Colorado!” Yeah. fucking newspapers. would read think yourself, believes shit? Well apparently lot people did. Uneducated, hillbillies. That’s United States right now. Taken uneducated hilljacks, unfortunately, lot positions power. divided, selfish country planet it’s embarrassing. explained coworker literally ran away.

Care explaining British black friend? He's Euro I'll ever be. Probably not. 50% increase small absolute risk still small number. dont care does, hes hole people reddit including you. two main routes infection Balkans Sweden.

So sad Balkans Sweden. It’s worse Finland Sweden next door, since it’s repeatedly shown many infection chains Finland currently traced back Sweden. was, example, [one period Ostbothnia basically infections traced Sweden]( case, good see Finland also adding face masks tool kit, esp. R value rising (but noted always bit wonky figure cases low Finland). perform 25% tests normally do, get 25% positives could say maybe 60-70% people charge making decisions pandemic. I'm actually little curious see would happen Trump administration would same. flip 180, it.

What think would happen? honestly think response would exact same. Hey thanks! Fixed policy changes people taking mask thing seriously?

It's full month mask mandates biggest counties. Big chain stores walmart publix mandated masks even county mask mandate. Definitely effect. knew masks work. There's absolutely way NYC public schools adhere social distancing. 

Source: former NYC public school attendant Lots people screaming open schools lots people screaming close them.

Yet, rational plan yet either... surprise. long since stop shocking many hateful, shitty, people there. dodged shoe, oil paintings hands candy. It’s *totally* different!!! Everything exacerbates millennial anxiety.

Literally everything. hear that. mention breath timing. Testing data messed up, also means New Cases data messed (as saw CA). HHS took Hospitalization data, numbers got screwed gotten fixed far aware. Deaths always bit screwy politicking.

Basically, seems like totally flying blind. 

The number seems legitimacy left excess deaths calculated CDC, *wildly* lagging indicator. numbers even remotely accurate nearly month passed since deaths actually occurred. Even still, deaths roughly follows ""new"" infection situation like nearly month that. say ""new"" even *that* data lags weeks. person needs get infected, make incubation period, show symptoms long enough actually go doctor, get tested, wait (often several days) results.

In order prevent infections, make decisions *today* prevent getting infected all. That's lot harder work months-old data &amp; projections. ""success story""

We success story look hard numbers. failure look social response. bored pandemic acting like happening.

This right mean. period months, population done 180. manage population all. 

When pandemic first started equally unhealthy response: mass panic, bought every roll toilet paper store, stockpiled meat canned goods, etc. care anymore. another lockdown September October due skyrocketing cases here.

We expected fighting next 3 years. response way shape form designed it.

Our lockdown stricter Sweden, sufficiently strict pandemic fatigue set Sweden not. worried optics many deaths short run. Nevermind current trends hold deaths greater. 

But time looser New Zealand's, therefore insufficient eliminate virus. virus contained. 

We still manditory mask policy transit. Let alone anywhere else. worried privacy can't get proper contact tracing app place. Nevermind population problem Tim Hortons app bigger violation privacy, strategy worked South Korea. 

Our strategy full inconsistencies. traveller New Zealand must quarantine 14 days despite New Zealand cases. traveller another part Canada exempt quaratine. Especially considering Calgary, 300 km border contained outbreak traveller caused outbreak. 

If attempt lockdown people flaunt orders hold house parties, containing nightmare. Voted what? Nah know lot it. Namely hes asshole dumbasses looking him. British never started war Like 1 hundred confederate flags I've seen. think there's lot people loves motorcycles want come version anime convention lol actual fuck Finland ever reopen Sweden?

The place seen plauge bearers. litterally putting everyone else danger reason all. Personally think way harsher consequenses Sweden disallowing tourists.

MTV News followed latest twists turns Finnish corona situation Thursday morning.
Lasse Lehtonen, Director Diagnostics HUS, Helsinki Uusimaa Hospital District, live interview 9.30. Read story here:
[HUS boss: 30–50 per cent weekly growth corona infections, 7 new infections day region - ""The second wave start testing Finland coming weeks""]( joint press conference Ministry Social Affairs Health STM National Institute Health Welfare THL start 10 am. MTV News followed announcement moment moment. 

The situation review attended Kirsi Varhila, Chief Staff, Liisa-Maria Voipio-Pulkki, Director Strategy STM, Taneli Puumalainen , Chief Physician THL.

#The infectivity rate rose one

The number new coronavirus infections nationwide still low, although somewhat infections detected July, STM bulletin reports. 

Last week, 74 new cases reported Communicable Diseases Register. number infections increased rate 10 cases per week, according ministry. 

The estimated infectivity rate currently 1.10 1.40 (90 percent probability range).

The nationwide incidence new cases week 31 1.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. higher incidence found hospital districts Satakunta, Helsinki Uusimaa, well Southwest Finland. 

Some new cases related known chains infection clusters cases monitored, infections source infection known, release states.

The infection chains new cases traced new infections prevented effectively possible. 

The number weekly tests risen almost fifth 619 tests per 100,000 inhabitants. proportion cases samples low several weeks, 0.2 per cent, ministry's press release says. 

#The order press conference reverse order:

**The press conference over.** 
10.47: Testing capacity currently 13,000 per day. proportion negative results likely increase due seasonal flu. tighten testing capacity people apply tests flu symptoms.

Improvements sampling capacity desired. summer, staff numbers tight, emphasizing tests nevertheless accessed low threshold. 

10.40: specified amendments Emergency Preparedness Act planned, draft law Communicable Diseases Act submitted Parliament autumn. 

Journalists opportunity ask questions.

10.35: Early Grade: Face masks may become regional recommendations. 

Puumalainen: Limit measures new corona cases consideration. current r-value quite small, even small increase raises values 1. 

10.33: Voipio-Pulkki: Multiple mass exposures identified. proportion positive samples tested low, regional differences also considered future.

Helsinki invested tracing infection chains. 

Voipio-Pulkki continues. 

10.26: Puumalainen: situation Sweden improved, situation Norway comparable Finland, slight increase Denmark, 
An average 10 corona cases per day detected Finland July, 20. Denmark, 50-100 infections per day currently diagnosed. situation Baltic countries good. 

Puumalainen continues.

10.17: Varhila: municipality city responsible organizing tests airports ports.

Negotiations underway cities Helsinki Turku modeling port traffic modeling border crossings Tornio.

**The two main routes infection Balkans Sweden.**

10.15: Varhila: Plans previously presented. Increasing testing tracking capacity 15,000 days 20,000 - 25,000 Korona starts spread strongly. possibility rapid tests also explored.

When corona application introduced, asymptomatic people receive infection notifications. testing tracking capacity municipalities hospital districts must order.

The quarantine recommendation updated tightened.

10.13: Early Childhood: Scenarios activities currently planned: 

1. Local infection chains manage

2. infection spreads population without possibility tracing, case situation spring.

The aim stay number one scenario. 

10.07: Varhila: try avoid closure large part society situations

Constraints bitten keeping adhesion curve low. Restrictions lifted downward phase curve, impact deregulation also begun assessed. also 4x population US we're hogging world testing supplies. told family friends got sick could help delivering groceries medicine doorstep, running errands need, I'm friend's backup care dog need hospital. bit research sanitize dog. Humane society recommends bath dog shampoo water, like hand washing effective. could order Instacart groceries without leaving house.

So there's help give safely. fear, too. permanent immunity possible, get sick know multiple doses needed. Hopefully point still impart partial protection--making cases mild.

But likely become endemic hopefully vaccinated kill many (or we'll know identify treat likely severe cases). unstoppable choice. Teachers really best defense schools reopening. know many scared losing jobs, I'm sure want person learning much anyone. good. Collectively could shut every school down. do, fire every teacher nation?

I know easier said done takes lot balls something like that, fact teachers fear lives job telling itself. teachers know hardened willing teach circumstances enjoy challenge. can't tell virus sit corner send principal's office think done. make show HBO. No, “flattening curve” means work hard flatten curve aren’t overwhelmed hospitals lots death — New York didn’t overwhelmed hospitals world’s second highest per capita death toll New Jersey. New York didn’t flatten curve. curve flattened New York there’s basically herd immunity. really feel people simply mimicking president yeah, got MAJOR problems. hope Trump loses, people Nuremberg Hangover realize acted. 

Somehow, know that's true still want hope. Deep down, I've always hopeless optimist... light gets dimmer day. Andrew Cuomo Bill de Blasio stupidest, worthless fucking people alive decided good idea send people sick novel virus nursing homes long term care facilities even knew elderly susceptible virus thus leading massively high death rate. low positivity rates virus burned out, like Sweden. congratulations, New York, got virus control creating situation able quickly burn susceptible vulnerable population one fell swoop. Great job!! fact state going get bad New York matter much keep saying “give two weeks.” It’s like need get bad validate beliefs virus make seem like NY wasn’t complete fucking catastrophe say “told so” us dumb midwesterners southerners clearly aren’t smart coastal elites whose states deaths literally anywhere else entire world. know freep focus locally would like point MSU respected ID doctor President Michigan physician well. know what's Ha! Ohio state beaten us 15 17 years Could colloid too. don’t get making fun doomers. RIGHT. Deaths increasing still didn’t say everyone stay. You’re welcome join sane side long nationalized health care, quality public education services, strong social safety net ideals. keep pro life gun sucking assholes out. case obvious implying comment perfect illustrated moron problem lot Americans. Rip football Super Power house world crumbles cuz single bad president little virus.

Whatever happened United Stand, divided fall... Yup USA divided literally killing themselves. Even schools providing PPE, level hospitals. They're giving teachers non-surgical 3-ply masks N95s. face shields made available staff want wear not. overcrowded poor ventilated building, need protection healthcare workers since students staff go school COVID unknowingly unfortunately cases knowingly. Take pictures feeling shitty post Facebook. 3309. many died call Long Term Care facilities home Florida. 2000 died last 45 days. Based solely trajectory, end ordeal, Florida eclipse NYS nursing home deaths. Yea, waiting right time. get one shot rehabilitation screw up, done. job isnt stable enough handle kind 1 time burden right now. private loan beyond statute limitations want settle $200 think that. regular FFEL loan sitting limbo, past credit reporting period fell well. doesnt stop trying collect. Poor Americans see displaced millionaires temporarily disadvantaged. Everyone thinks one capitalisms winners instead vast majority losers required support outsized winners.

The greatest trick devil ever pulled convincing world exist. vaccine never comes I’d bet people won’t willing forego following activities rest lives:

Work, Weddings, Funerals, Church, Restaurants, Reunions, Bars, Concerts, Sporting events, School, Gyms, Shopping, Etc. Ah yes, daily America bad thread. prob trolling operation work for, since 3 year old account started spamming Coronavirus literally yesterday?

How long burner accounts usually last get banned? Whats record?

Do pay crypto, what? english great, especially cursing insults. overseas troll farm I'm impressed.

Maybe I'm over-thinking. Maybe complete loser bag accounts nothing better fuck people reddit. public education joke begin with. take seriously someone know dies. might specks hands, we're elbow deep dead horse asshole like 'merica is. Careful. guy pushing misinformation conspiracy theories.  Every protest I've organizers make perfectly clear everyone MUST wear mask everyone I've seen does. Sit troll. one many related articles. It’s statewide, limited particular county region. Oh yes, government agencies never anything shady definitely that. I've lost friends it. Clearly want friends anyway that's feel Failing what? 

If strategy prevent C-19 deaths only, bad strategy. strategy prevent excess deaths overall, works bit better.

Sweden, doesn’t like claim strategy spent lot time talking nevertheless, ranks much better terms total excess deaths terms C-19 deaths only. countries aggressive socially disruptive strategies seeing resurgences, Sweden’s excess deaths actually normal, long run, rank likely improve lot. Yeah, could publicly police mask wearing much publicly police pregnant women taking sips friends' beers, would rad. gritting system compensating tests whose turn around time makes results irrelevant. 

So get claim samples collected tests provide talking point vile powers fisting tax payer. Baseball one easiest sports social distance, yet MLB still can’t prevent outbreaks Wow, really want finish indigenous population country. worse outcome boarding schools, Covid kills children months days instead years takes psychological, emotional physical abuse take toll. And, like ethnic minorities US, many live multi generational homes serious underlying health issues, means psychological torment accidentally get family member tribal elder sick. Fuck Devoss. needs reckoning administration. CA lockdown month now. Downvotes confirm reddit. made 66 people cry America, case loads sky high! Please stop playing sports gathering places!!! Please!!

Sincerely, rest world. dont need think conspiracy theory. People tired told might sick even know reason law everyone wear mask times whenever leaving home indoor settings (laws vary based region). Couple fact realistically living virus years--this idea healthy people, people believe healthy, wear mask 2-3 years. masks problematic IMO, combination inconsistent rules shame culture. dont think realistic expect people walk around believing asymptomatic case. would bring little kids airplane, Florida August, dystopian Disney world, middle pandemic?

Check apply you. I'm sure dont follow half things. Probably get pandemic advice bill gates yet actually read study.

I like described post. Insightful. Amount something? Lol according you, like would give shit approve lmao. 40 feel fucking way. despairing. appreciate comment, honestly man wondering. idea would push hard reopen schools first place. least makes sense. Thank you. Could imagine weak can't even wear mask? Weaklings. Assassins? stock market bidirectional measuring stick, businesses measured units money, money measured units business ownership.

What’s round sides high O-HI-O !&lt; intense American desire freedom, governed, come crossroads national situation requires freedoms taken away, governing. obvious hindsight two exist well together. wow, get education, work too? spent life finance, say want environment, people best ideas usually get capital. maybe union-dominated work world?

but guess surprise me. grew small maga-leaning town got fuck soon possible. best decision i've ever made. winning lottery billions die get there.

Obtuse. Contrarian. Moron. even missed worst part said Desperate Housewives.  even bother go Wikipedia IMDB check. 450 people quarantined Cherokee County... Give break: realised ""obey"" already taken, find bullshit quick, last minute... CFR. IFR representative one would consider ""the percent catch die"". IFR implied 0.3-1% based numerous serostudies. 

Even serostudies estimated range 0.3-1% researchers going far back Feb 19th stated SitRep 30 since China's testing capturing mostly higher degree severe covid case. Well live south plenty people appalled plenty people don’t give flying fuck. 

But look statistics bad California, it’s bad Texas, it’s bad Florida, etc.. relatives begging parents figure way get New York City bad there. described like ghost town. 

I family (mostly older take seriously) appears descriptions whole lack caring pretty widespread.

Since, seroprevalence SARS-CoV-2 IMID patients without cytokine inhibitors similar healthy participants, factors need considered account low seroprevalence SARS-CoV-2 cytokine inhibitor-treated IMID patients.""

I take medication provides level cytokine inhibition immune compromised, like immune system disregulated. came covid19 like illness spring symptoms far mild compare SO, rarely gets sick. first time ever, symptoms 5 days, SO, never sick long 20 years, needed two weeks recover still another 2 weeks getting lingering symptoms. wondered whether medication may played role bounced back one gets sick get illness.

The mainstreaming conspiracy theories anti- intellectualism downfall USA. **Despite promise open schools, many Gothenburg's high school students forced continue distance learning autumn.** 

**The municipality's politicians introduce new schedule rules later starting time limited attendance school's premises older high school students.** 

**The purpose new rules reduce pressure public transport.**

The upper secondary schools Sweden reopen autumn, government decided, Gothenburg still exactly usual. Monday, chairman education committee made accelerated decision new rules limit activities city's high schools. three points principals adapt schedule to.

• School starts 09.00 teaching school premises.

• university preparatory programs must maximum 60 percent students site time.

• Vocational programs must maximum 80 percent students place time.

\- happy open schools again, time must follow Public Health Agency's advice. believe directives great effect, especially morning rush hour public transport, says Per Gustafsson (L), chairman education committee city Gothenburg.

**Approximately 10,000 students** attend municipal upper secondary schools Gothenburg. many studying private schools. Per Gustafsson hopes principals also follow municipality's example. 

\- mandate decide them, inspire similar measures, double effect.

The recommended distance education certain percentage schools' students intended primarily include students already established upper secondary schools. Beginners first year shall given priority teaching school premises.

**The rules introduced** initially apply August September.

\- According Västtrafik, pressure public transport usually greatest beginning autumn, evaluate effect necessary, make new decision October onwards, says Per Gustafsson. 

**Have time get reactions principals yet?**

\- No, quick-footed March switched full-time distance learning, think handle well. nice able open again, also feel safe everyone involved. 

At one city's largest high schools - Hvitfeldtska - 600 ones call Tuesday next week.  

\- place, pass rules. twos threes start days later, decided come school every day, says operations manager Mikael Karlsson.  no, either. 
threatening people makes people scared crazy. scared crazy people make complicated problems complicated. contagious via surfaces... people sent home within day. Fake news. feels like everything still going usual many ways. still go drive thru get meal, go outside park nature preserve, many us still go work

The surrealistic part Europe already back mostly normal, went drink river-side saturday night, restarted sport weeks ago, start going back work twice week bringing work home 3 remaining day. Yes still constraint like wearing mask inside shop (or denied entry security guard) 6 weeks hard lockdown followed 6 weeks progressive reopening mean pandemic less control (Still moment dead car accident due covid).  yes yes US, countries locked lol /s I’m saying it’s great idea, saying that’s probably logic is. know kids’ mental health suffering general pandemic — big question address keeping everyone safe. Turns wrong hype indeed real Honestly everyone virtual snow ever hits ground New England. aerosol evidence time major vector demonstrated effectiveness masks. aerosol, masks shit need respirators sealed goggles Huh, maybe good idea offshore meds medical equipment hostile communist nation college problem sucks matter slice it. I’d pissed pay full tuition experience guys get. I’d also unironically kill stay home parents see friends/have relationship another year.

The government already tell everybody stay home, honestly effectice possibly could large, diverse country. need move on, somehow diminishing losses.

I'm place.  hear you. hear frustration despair. please give hope. calamity caused relatively small group Republicans, look population whole. defeat polls get country back. Start flipping Senate. Inability answer questions spot way, shape form indicates own. That's why, example, oral exams work all. Neither literally anything else said. Eanest P Worrell presented opening Splash Mountain Disney Channel, recorded VHS. Sucks hear starting break down. Good Asian, tell also wonder thing.... Americans value fellow American lives?? fragile easily offended little inconvenience tolerated greater good (with exception expensive healthcare, school shootings bad service, seems well tolerated). Maybe better understanding human nature, maybe honest human nature. I'll bet school shit bullying either. There’s something need understand “conservative” politicians: don’t care people. care things they’re paid care about.

Brian Kemp particularly heinous example trait. believes government meant facilitate transfer wealth resources right* people, amount social responsibility tantamount communist dictatorship.

*white rapid tests fairly high rate false negatives though... Holy shit. That's uncannily accurate. perfect description dance floor taco night. fair point - players others directly involved suffering real adverse effects pandemic, shame way.

But still, entertainment industry, including sports, given outsize importance culture. people saying *need* football concerned welfare players - want bread circuses. Afraid look weak... mean can’t afraid look weak you’re dead lmao suburbs Pittsburgh nothing like state college Scranton. I’ve never philly comment that. Thank you. getting at.

Like speak people handle customer service. see struggled. Pretty sure Renfrewshire back George W Bush elected. Trying persuaded results means expend resources something believe unlikely work. kind irrational. Sorry you’re even allowed acknowledge Families generally buy homes. highest home ownership world. normal family mid-30’s two working people. 20-something single person, still beginning career, doesn’t need able afford four bedroom home. never thought neck gaiter scarf/bandana could good substitute masks. Maybe cdc concerned supply masks wouldn’t enough back March, think never should’ve recommended neck gaiters scarfs. try tell people don’t work 5 months? way people would listen funny. people stupid ignorant backwards education politicization disease give fuck voted for. allowed leave New Zealand going holiday seas coming back asking contribute 3000 dollars towards managed isolation costs  someone explain death rate per capita figures please? trying get facts straight. U.K. highest death rate per million people behind Belgium. US much lower list. 

So... media focused US problem? numbers media doesn’t seem add me? reading something wrong? ""Dag Nabbit Boys!""

""You're runnin' fast enough, that's Covid gunna catch you!""

""Do Again!"" Blame Trump shit that's fucked decades

He one disbanded pandemic response group instituted Obama. really can't wait point come can't blame team team town fucking decades

You know administration Obama (who served less decade) Republican, right?

As Congress, since 1995 House Democratic control sum total 6 years (non-contiguous) Senate 10 years (also non-contiguous) unified Democratic control House Senate ***only 2 years***.

What mythical time period talking about? mid-20th century? think many people don’t realize losing teaching license means real terms. partner thought meant retake Praxis exams shocked explained without either existing certificate reciprocity recommendation licensure accredited program, test scores meaningless, it’s simple applying license new state existing license yanked. It’s rule abiding Canadians Scandinavians guess replying thread explicitly talking experts United States discussing situation United States. can't jump conversation U.S. feign offended give examples U.S., unfortunately predictions likely true country well. I'm optimistic, leading health experts world give us opinions inclined believe them. Thats truth. worked shipping dock could literally every job, threatened girl worked office whose job could top mine. got new manager dug manager convinced worthless. manager rode bit lectured things already. held head up, respectful her, job. year later great working relationship pulls office apologize treated told valuable her. easy worth see girl office lose credibility held higher regard. Psychological distress understatement. local school district much attitude - I've discussions school district, local college, city working build ""a pipeline"" elementary school local jobs large employer, if/when could attract one. kids lack soft skills like you? argument father, cases I’d usually totally agree you.

Only, pandemic we’re talking about, government asking case bear slightest discomfort order get virus settle reasonable levels, long pandemic continues. impose requirement would allow virus continue spread kill citizens government literally designed protect. 

As matter health safety, it’s fine me. similar restrictions drinking driving, speed limits, sanitation requirements restaurants, ect. There’s nothing wrong those. 

If federally imposed restriction, there’d issue (the federal government telling states solutions unique states needed. Alaska chilling example, don’t need wear masks). requirement continues new daily cases dropped low tens, might start getting rather annoyed. However, new daily cases still high hundreds state, there’s reason complain executive government state *literally it’s designed do.* likely also hate I'm psychologist Whoa got hands one grade 12 mixed CDs? better way frame number. people die. Trump killed them. There's chance Cruz Bush would mismanaged pandemic response spectacularly. also get ger downvotes.

It's obvious deaths lag behind. would mean everybody died day tasted positive. weird people think that. Nice perfect example point withholding year schooling socialization children science experiment right? lost IQ points thanks It’s multi billion dollar industry 

A lot people’s livelihoods depend sport played

It can’t safely played, agree cancellation

But it’s crisis nonetheless That’s said all. Carl Sagan smart man, exactly hard prediction make. live 20 minutes away Pierce... McFarland

And lets forget ER Doctor sued malpractice least every 2 years every cent have.  actually sue every doctor shift, get sued even didnt see patient.

Never mind life saved. parents claimed emotional distress Nothing says ""I want live anymore"" like going Smash Mouth concert pandemic. Straight hell go! Despite USA's flaws, many, definitely ""third world"", hyperbolic nonsense. 

First term ""third world"" even used anymore part outdated colonial lexicon, probably good idea drop it. terms used developed, underdeveloped, developing nations.

Second, even remotely true, immigrants disadvantaged countries would come make life. immigrants come say place world's better home country living standards ability support oneself. 

Third, take trip REAL underdeveloped country, power outages norm clean/heated water readily available. bureaucracy steeped bribes lowest level, zero worker protections medical care almost non-existent accessible.

Yes. issues providing public welfare, crumbling infrastructure, thirst consumerism, apathy complacency sake comfort, tribal politics, paired unfettered capitalism, blind patriotism, anti-intellectualism, srtratistified judicial wealth system, inability many introspect realize countries failings?

Edit: Looking agan CDC showing NEW hospitalizations CURRENT. number sky high two eight weeks Arizona Texas Florida accurate Marrakech Morocco. headlines still won’t believe looking back ten years Great, thanks much links! appreciate help lyrics “My friend misery - Metallica” actually fit America’s situation perfectly right now. Sounds like diet plan - 30% fat, 30% protein, 40% carbs. Only, unlike diets, need increase carb load expense fat protein. Something like 10-10-80 would better (DON'T diet like this, even 80% protein!). think eliminating conservative liberal voices entirely would healthy, need spectrum discourse, extremes help tug middle road population guide society new middle, - arrived caution foresight - better all, much like tolerance - color sex sexual orientation - slowly drifted toward mainstream (it ways go, natch, moved right direction largely). see Karens wearing masks men. post front stores sans mask chopping non maskers. proving badassness put mask nose enter building feeling extremely superior us sheep. FPTP constitutional issue, local one - already places within US using it. think Maine use RCV even presidential election year, example, already uses statewide elections.

Most areas use municipalities, require amendment constitutional changes. Neither effectively killing EC, matter - check interstate compact. party goers thinking

They're selfish, that's really end critical thinking skills. dig bones 1000 years now, unmitigated stupidity white Americans going dumb found takes phone tree way many lines. Even countries still bought time.

Even sake argument assume vaccine isnt coming soon also know far treat disease now, survival rates better.  seems pretty disgusting kill people low intelligence. way type person fucking us right would willingly take pill empathy. bet you’d weak grave. thought though, expert. pop Google figure trying say.

No, that's it.

Most kids saw film child probably don’t even know looks like. countries full lock partial? lock party like 1999? much better mental health kids staying home learning online. Trust me. Big huge difference. People call ask got good teenage mental health numbers. Beautiful numbers. sounds like marketing. Even amazing, month? virus love long surfaces. Welp, said CT then. thought New England handling pretty well.  making typical mistake confusing short-term trend future outcome.

If virus society behave ways spread it, eventually spread again.

This notion control problem behind delusional hubris. Something might different.
I know, hard grasp. although ends noting hasn’t slept days, maybe he’s unclear he’s exhausted worried.

There couple days barely slept sweating, shivering, sweating again. coughing want vomit can't stop abs fire.

Shit sucked. Russia can't even take Pakistan... i've heard people difficult task. i'm like kept troops less supplied years europe radios, went moon nothing much technical calculator. able handle testing contact tracing computers near instant communication keep economy going least 80ish%. whole shitstorm that's happen fall schooling direct result country whole really wanting things marginally inconvenient everyone top blame much one plebs. well kinda. consider Europe hit USA was. virus area longer USA has. also look daily increase death see European countries death rate going even flat past days/week. quick look, past days died around 200-300 people top 6 European countries. USA 1000 deaths time frame. I’m 100% corner here-if *any* chance vitamin supplementation help, I’m (I’ve taking/forcing family take since February). said, list conditions cause vitamin deficiency looks whole lot like list leading underlying conditions severe covid cases. jump conclusion vitamin deficiency *causing* severe cases (rather underlying conditions causing deficiency severe covid cases) without data backs akin assuming ice cream sales impact crime rates everyone’s favorite causation vs correlation exercise. harm supplementing may deficient, harm jumping conclusion ignoring possible factors (obesity, socioeconomic factors, etc.) country land propaganda? Stop nonsense mask protection people. mask make look weak, makes look considerate. Maybe angle emphasized. Fucked 6 ways Sunday, got it. represents worst US opinion. It’s country 300+M many immigrants. He’s certainly substantial portion US. get helpdesk phone bank spot CS degree (at least prime burger flipper position opens McDonalds).

Going go training 13 see reliably trust changes made. preexisting condition puts high risk category, medical leaves office reaching next see options. miss normal sure! compare College sports? seem forgotten College sports compares Pro topic UFC makes way College sports.

Stop playing stupid. Exactly. downplay deaths, still sucks. feel everyone that's lost someone Covid. certain extent, kinda unavoidable. Super flawed - said, masks required almost countries (if any?!). 

I’m guessing someone cooked survey either support sort asinine agenda - bolster ego, regarding good Americans wearing masks.

No real scientist professional would ever produce survey, without even checking mask ordinances place sample countries. 

Super. Dumb. Ugh. article explaining why. I'm ready going back school per week 1/3 student body. feels hopeless reminder, pro-ccp account. Review post history, flag ignore. meant end suffering family mother-in-laws selfish ways, I'm ok heading out. PM I'll mail Pixel 2, backup need more. Wish could help cash heh. Least someone. Uhh... hey kiwis... trans-tasman bubble still yeah? 100% agree. threats taken seriously ones article mentioned. wonder seriously school takes bullying. 

Our daughter bullied last school nothing. moved new school shut immediately. Canadians also dumbstruck hoping border stays closed long time.  entirely unexpected. Extremist religious people tend criminals get away crime guise religious freedom.

Legalized hate hell drug. want reopen schools push narrative things getting back normal. logic behind decisions. disinfecting thing show. reported cases someone contracting covid fomites? Disinfect 2 days. 4, 8, matter, pack new cases keep happening.  really don’t think people denying virus? Talk propaganda. reminder, pro-ccp account. Review post history, flag ignore.

Those go hospital admitted “hospitalizations”. Stay home stop posting uninformed crap. Thanks. I’m proud American Europe done well compared America.

Compared Asia, however...  Yeah graphs follow expect, everywhere there's outbreak there's ""long tail"" cases tapering off. Meanwhile FL TX cases dropping fast rose. virus work like that. hoax people going argue herd immunity... I've shock since realizing US response nothing claim nothing done, many people ok that, nothing really done. also white parents loudest wanting schools open Hispanic black neighborhoods cases county.  crowd going need time machine, generally speaking. reason New York state even position entertain level in-person school length time near lockdown. never difficult figure out. earlier locked longer stayed strict requirements, smaller pool people wound even able spread virus restrictions slowly lifted common sense, science observant way

so Florida Arizona Texas Georgia? months staying course mandatory mask wearing, work home essential businesses open etc even contemplate idea in-person school without complete shitshow. jobs teacher one wife failing actively participate school boards, electoral process, responsible.

You talk ruling class horseshit day long, end day comes fact people want people take care problems them. participate, surprised results hope for. 

If show up, voice. 

So, yes, us failing participate republic. NZ cases also quadrupled month well.

0 x 400% = 0 Nah. Fuck then. 

The people wearing masks receiving threats. Nip bullshit butt. wouldn’t jackasses protesting back March shit beaten them. admin don’t wanna shit, need enforce happens Americans bigger virus/threat corona? patently untrue. quick google search shows plenty people protests wearing masks. masks keeping people safe protests. got something else. guess outside air volume virtually infinite. know. clearly masks though. Exactly. Dress code. Well schools kids can’t mask enforced use argument dress code guess.  Yep nailed it. Coronavirus FOS made early phases outbreak China active effort CCP remove information. Information leaked China pulled China Flu sub many others. situation since remedied. True, women particular, feel like BMI would perfectly acceptable measurement. Neither look overly muscular.

Doctors probably well aware downsides BMI certain people, fact matter BMI generally pretty good determining health people outside exceptions. 

Also keep mind obesity related COVID-19 probably exact metric obesity measured using BMI. highly doubt doctors medical staff using body fat percentage data collection address obesity issues related pandemic, simply time that. 

If data using obesity measured BMI, obesity shows people risk death worse outcomes, that's really need show obesity generally good thing infected virus. 

The outliers bodybuilders overly muscular people workout probably exist great enough numbers change that, either. many people positive case spread to? Eventually we’ll vaccine idk  Eh, given response think kind solidarity dangerous. reaction 9/11 worse 9/11 orders magnitude. I’m using word Darwinism stand what’s really going on. American can't believe took notice not? rural Alaska? less college degree skillset developed via internships college PLUS location college. college place like Bay Area, Boston, Austin, Seattle, etc, ton internships available tech companies look really good resumes. sucks, truth is, enough go college, need go college that's area good job market (for internships) set career college.

Lock fatigue occurs people cant see people cut social supports. Humanity based social interaction. fwiw that's probably true. Social security going die within next 10 years what, 30 years now? president actually kills social security ensures party losing presidency+congress next election minimum. Old people far politically engaged demographic, people tend like fucked over. 430 kids hospitalized Florida. kids ""don't get it"". Heck. google plenty reputable sources. There’s lots. real question would take convince mother. she’s open minded show data might help. she’s already guarded, throwing things like facts reality don’t seem work. dad like climate change. well half league, toxic masculinity looks like. true.

actually true.

Bravo!!! entire post straw man. see opposite am. see it’s right infect anyone want to. Yes, rest world moving without us recovery mode. lost continue lose economic, diplomatic, intellectual, moral standing world leader. We'll literally make America great again, instead clear playing field like world wars, well competing China, Russia, EU, everyone else stands gain loss stature. economists think take least 10 years U.S. economy come back pandemic over.

This nail coffin careers many Millennials. Gen Z little better since teens early twenties likely able recover thirties. Germans ever met always super friendly, hospitality great.

I speak little German tho. Yeah, figured may people saying listening end... reddit fast though 😉 think it’s one half, mistaken. Democrats rejected presidential candidate whose platform overwhelmingly support media told things every country “too extreme”. speak Europeans, personally think able blow world even pretty useless ability. like here. planet beer. where's covid cure HIV yet exist, ART keep healthy many years, ART reduces amount virus (or viral load) blood body fluids. ART recommended people HIV, regardless long they’ve virus healthy are. **ART also reduces chance transmitting HIV others taken prescribed.** Well, go back life normal won’t “done.”

If you’d expect: Initial spike, introduction measures social distancing, closure schools universities, encouragement work home, general emptying bars restaurants - mandated “lockdown” - long steady decline, yes, rather much quicker decline seen places hard lockdown enacted. virus everyone collectively forget disaster Italy set whole thing off? advice, would advantageous avoid people much possible.

Just stat stat. Expounding this: dozens every price range. attend online, group, individual classes day, evenings, weekends. Speaking European, people know before?   Hey 1987 year! Yeah, sucks. **do** worry them. That’s we’ve spent 40 years prevention measures testing treatment options developing vaccine candidates. 

Why assume people don’t worry it? considered maybe reading trillions dollars spent measures worldwide last four decades?

Or nothing strawman yourself? Hahaha yess!!! Yeah? Try invade us see fragile lol Well, us, dang it.  find COVID condoms.. talk... 

oh, wait.

 

those masks! yes will. bad mana gement worl d. time Amer ika 🤪 rest worl gett ing stup id main reason go extreme lengths take seriously, parents 70+ year old, especially Dad every single disease makes someone susceptible death getting covid (except diabetes). take seriously could fucking kill parents, I'd never able live myself.

So see Trumping moron work, telling office ""no mask zone"" want tell go fuck himself. Luckily, dude broke arm weekend, he's picture weeks. Lol, really science works though.

Yes wait peer reviewed.

Yes peer reviewed things get retracted change time,

No don't, go rigorous vetting process even published happen. journal process, I'd suggesting checking one called scientific method.

That scientific method is, super glad heard term week though. Building upon someone's work, fixing flawed work ""the scientific method"". Deductions based upon data part it, can't call retracting editing scientific yeah, pleasure talking sharing info.

The pleasure yours. COVID-19 akin Spanish influenza pandemic anything else since then.

Downplaying produced 160,000 dead Americans, lot come. Lol Ja Rule feel situation? saw easy target took shot. also 5th make it.  empty, what's causing rattle? way! Everyone California votes one way everyone Texas votes other. like they're mix look way huge flaw winner-takes-all electoral college. nationality tourists? many Europeans shot load upon article China Flu first sub actually covering virus specific topic ya fuckwad. time posts sub dedicated particular virus. I'm glad. 50,000 new cases yesterday. That's sign country unified solving problem, regardless pockets compliance there. Well, Lets hope Im wrong right, Bill Gates saint, want help fellow humans. hilarious since *they’re* ones profited thrived post-war economy. maybe it’s protecting lives, healthcare infrastructure, preventing mass people getting chronic illnesses? maybe. Leave even 6 feet can. believe droplets travel 27 feet.
My kids better I'm still getting worse. Thanks kind thoughts. understand Europeans referred Americans ""arrogant"" entire life. IDK man, things alright Obama office. Trump moved completely trashed everything decided burn everything ground.  true! NJ look stats towns want full remote, poorer, diverse towns, 50% parents want keep kids home. wealthier, whiter places, they're sending kids school. mom works wealthy district. 10 families signed full remote. Funny thing mostly half day, meals, 10-12 per class. So, kids may fine, they're pushing whole state go back. poorer communities, school opening plans full-day, full-week. Essentially, poorer kids come going exposed, teachers stressed since get much planning time.... pretend like done name equity. think large swath Americans sincerely believe country meritocracy. That's there's always push ultra-capitalism, free markets, cutting social programs, cutting taxes. nobody gets help, fair. fact that's truly way guarantee fairness! even old Fox motto: Fair Balanced. 

The truth course we're still effectively ruled dynasties. soon tell people order true meritocracy forced give wealth society instead passing children, get **pissed**. trust states run certain political party mail ballots properly throw half due ""invalid"" signatures. I'll risk one day. no, not. 

because cure HIV yet exist, ART keep healthy many years, ART reduces amount virus (or viral load) blood body fluids. ART recommended people HIV, regardless long they’ve virus healthy are. ART also reduces chance transmitting HIV others taken prescribed.

Countless times. actually got sick hearing part. Especially leadership point view.

I'm Iraq Afghanistan Veteran, I've seeing things saw theaters:

1. Fragmented chain command.

2. Denial reality (failing understand situation first step solution).

3. Lack security (moving forward ready).

4. Lack coordination people talent, treating numbers (people move government private sector, get paid more).

5. Taxing allies instead investing them; American Exceptionalism exists people believe does. fail understand concept peril... people immigrate countries (brain drain America standing alone, without help, surrounded enemies... that's future continue path). Lol wish was. truth hurts, it? oh sweetheart, 'condescension' 'condensation'. ok, best :) shit. Whataboutism fine it, know? Get cold, unfeeling logic outta here!

In honesty though, good counterpoint. economic system, economic order, system production, resource allocation distribution goods services within society given geographic losing homes suddenly enough everybody. entirely caused due way resource allocated, definition characteristic economic system. contrast, everybody Soviet Union housing provided government, true places like Cuba North Korea today. one think masks make look like BAMF gym wherever go.

A great thread him.

It shows LA (Louisiana Los Angeles) ""second wave"" second wave entirely areas built low immunity.

LA also great control 2 hard hit parishes (ie ones built immunity) essentially zero second wave even though right next 1 mask order nearly 7 weeks made difference.

Masks HELP number 1 reason places slow population immunity.

Using different metrics come states like Florida anywhere 15-30% population infected.

He estimated Southern States probably 15%+ infected already.

Even Trevor Bedford finally come around stating US South clearly seeing effects form partial herd immunity.  book made athetist.  doesn’t take long build habits. humans adaptable. mean anywhere else really.

Killing sparrows particular destroyed ecological check insect destruction crops, namely locusts, large part causing Great Chinese Famine resulting est. 15-45 million deaths. example thought wholesale destruction Chinese culture name egalitarian revolution - like many Marxist movements, portraying entirety country's history ""bourgeoisie"" engaging de-facto book burning campaigns, obliterating culture, history, artifacts, centrally, destroying context thought outside party norms. Hope happy cause I'm getting sick typing today. They’re slowly trying take everything over. Give religious schools institutions vouchers cripple public institutions. explained situation twice, also pointed many people AC. Way live stereotype fragile, ignorant little friend ;)

And course could mock Americas backward payment systems (you guys still use cheques, lol), dire infrastructure, fact classed ['flawed fact halfwits elected literal celebrity idiot represent word stage, shitty cars, terrible food, failed healthcare system, tragic mishandling Covid-19 crisis, constant riots protests, idiotic racist wall, wooden houses (lol)... won't.

I'll simply direct sub, laid bare: /r/ANormalDayInAmerica 

And I'll block fragile whining. tears, vaguely amusing ultimately bit tragic.

Toodle pip ;)  Dems center right every political spectrum is. Republicans far right, almost spectrum.  opposed looking like selfish cunt. Okay.  Wait - quoting Marxist philosophy? That's illegal. think need call names - something. mean, understand it, someone said something sounded scary Marxism, I'll react emotionally fear anger I'm told otherwise talking heads tv make feel good myself. Medicare better viable.

I'm interested settling can't control politicians aren't. USA. cannot inherit debt. estate held liable. 

That article even address claiming, read it. 100% wrong look like idiot. See 2nd line post.

Everything talking direct result move toward post-scarcity society automation enables people slave entire lives away wage, people top economic food chain trying strangle last bit life dying system capitalism.

These exact 'growing pains' referenced. sure inclined disagree. studies regarding blood clotting came surge NY. I've read articles people treated die going reduce deaths parts nation. 

New York guinea pig US. widespread community transmission really knew course hit us like truck. New York's peak still fairly early pandemic. act like 2-3 month study virus told us need know world still learning long term effects effectiveness treatments. People Jonestown would laughing afterlife. don’t feel way, no. negativity bias sure. recognized many years ago cut news wasn’t tech sports. Made life easier. always like quote Twain saying, “Most things worried never happened.” hindsight that’s apparent. 

A couple years ago talk sense mother become scared world thought matter time attacked someone public. explained things changed since younger, way thinks. ignoring negativity bias encourages media focus bad stories, told population doubled since younger alone would double amount crime. Take account news bubble changed local, per day, worldwide constant. reality less violent crime since late 1950s. don’t mean now, post pandemic. mean 2018 so. discussion. took FBI website great charts showing amount violent crimes per 10,000 people last 70 years so. proof eyes. 

Sadly didn’t help. continues read much news has, believe false idea, world lot worse used be. doesn’t understand spoon bent, her. American. Yes. Well left world maps lot cases might onto something.. fair, Electoral College intended overcome limitations Socrates stated. Unfortunately, never really functioned intended even limited functionality eroded time, notably since 1970s parties started controlling electors vote. working intended framers Constitution, Donald Trump would elected. 

Alexander Hamilton wrote essay 68 Federalist Papers regarding election Electoral College:

""The process election affords moral certainty, office President never fall lot man eminent degree endowed requisite qualifications. Talents low intrigue, little arts popularity, may alone suffice elevate man first honors single State; require talents, different kind merit, establish esteem confidence whole Union, considerable portion would necessary make successful candidate distinguished office President United States."" claim two... like receding hairline... backwards, son  guy clearly hopeless young idiot thinks invincible, ignoring fact age catches everyone. applaud kindness, but... going change short-sighted narrow-minded worldview. UK reports 685 deaths per million Sweden report 571, means UK report 20% deaths per capita Sweden. that’s *reported* deaths UK found *under* report Sweden not. Looking excess mortality UK close twice death toll Sweden. Seven. Day. Average. still posting 17% positive test rate. certainly set aside differences long enough agree extending tax cuts wealthy, refuse cut military budget measly 10%, extend Patriot Act, keep troops Afghanistan. always agree things like that. ever social science issues disagree. Yup. wear blood enemies mine. 

People know I’m dominant life form. Local shitstain politician city fully authorized schools school sports open fully today. Anti-mask crowd applauding this. County next door opened schools last week Friday. Five kids tested positive. 

They're going learn. Labor Day weekend, I'm predicting cases school district climb fairly high, spread parents home, turn zaps barely running workforce. Oof. feel that.

You can't endlessly discuss pandemic without also, time time, touching upon pandemic fought (or not) power so; politicians. EU regard helping Italy Spain crisis? 

Europe probably pay attention itself. ""fragile"" accurate description US right now, also accurate description European Union. plan use predictable white outrage spread American resources thin, starve beast, catalyze process transition new world power Uncle Sammie spent **trillions** dollars bombing **millions** Muslims. 

so yeah, resounding success, US spent million bucks kill Muslim did. Turns Osama actually prophet. Fffuuuuuuuuck Don’t forget Netherlands doesn’t lot bank holidays. one occurs weekend, well tough luck, free day you... unlike Belgium.

So really depends country. likely US approve first vaccine widespread use. not, that, first country get vaccinated (aside anti-vaxxers every country these) we've already ramped production great financial risk. go ahead respond something like this, saying incorrect, hundreds Yeah get 10.000 new cases 1st July.

Have we, though? We’ve gone through:

-	The Civil War
-	The Spanish Flu (among others)
-	The Great Depression

What we’re going feels like three time. haven’t Fort Sumpter yet, way things going? bets off. fifth column openly subverting government one stop them. else could end?

On top we’re also dealing intense natural disasters regular estimates get worse.

And I’m perfectly honest, feel like people lived periods way stronger less complacent today.

The history species one empires rising falling, don’t view overly dramatic — we’re seeing actually natural state human affairs. ""some""? blocked 'em. Less satisfying smarter choice. keeping scholarships  R E P U B L C N = E H C U L I’m pretty sure things gotten lot better since school. college, never saw sense anti-intellectualism, even high school, school fairly large conservative portion student body, AP kids, popular kids, leadership kids largely kids.

Leave NATO(better yet dissolve whole thing) maybe we'll start taking criticism seriously 41 billion people, half humans ever lived last 200,000 years, died malaria. don’t care malaria? aren’t worried 41 billion people? Case point, Trumps sad little handshake antics almost everything 82 year old dad smoked life, lung collapse go untreated month, result both, bad COPD (bronchiectasis). He's oxygen nearly 100% time.

He endure extreme social distancing, manages go scooter neighborhood strolls, issue wearing mask runs neighbor wants talk distance bit. 

In words, dad, really shitty lungs fine mask. 

***

My cousin, 50-something year old alt-right law enforcement guy (think really, really low level federal law enforcement), buys every anti-left conspiracy theory former smoker, otherwise healthy. ""I respiratory problems can't wear mask - plus right!"" 

He also pulmonologist refuses sign mask waiver. response: ""You'd think pulmonologist would know dangerous things are.""

I hope cousin never gets COVID. - I'm concerned health. I'm concerned he'll infect dozens people he's fucking moron. Correct. surprised read written original comment. I'm sure happens somewhere, even places least expect it, heard seen high school-esque behavior like higher ed institutions. putting mildly. really need good dose self defense. Oh put smile face today. Thank that. still makes news articles? 

Europeans known long time USA pretty incompetent it’s COVID-19 response utterly surprise us.

It’s breaking news. Let's honest, Europeans already considered us inconsiderate. people claiming mental health also don’t seem care mental health forced go work others entertained extremely non-essential activities. certainly isn’t better Covid all, grant that. occurred one year, would like one year 33 percent deaths usual. Put another way, would 33 percent higher chance dying year. (Assuming covid-19 deaths would occurred underlying reasons year) going forward.

However, perfect solution besides absolute containment source. experts say ship sailed places.

So look options going forward. unfortunately, stage, people going die virus efforts try contain it.

If look overall excess deaths, C-19 deaths, better measure success failure, notice countries lighter touch, less socially disruptive responses, like Sweden Denmark rank much better covid-19 deaths alone make seem. generation fight WWII, would speaking German.

Such weakness. resolve, willingness buckle right thing. use Metric, hours length. There's many horrible things Bolton's book, Bolton horrible person. start making rounds reiterated point book opinion worst thing Trump go war Iran. make list top 10 horrible things Trump did, would even sniff top 20?

But that's discussing. discussing A) Bolton terrible person matter book, B) lot people become insanely anti-Trump fawn literally anybody says bad thing Trump, even person worse. (Bolton undeniably worse.... wants us go around killing millions people.)  tube throat strong look? figured flint Michigan would done that. guess bigger scale. fuck...a lot We're polarized politically.... politicians journalists act like children appears we're fragile, inconsiderate that's Europe sees reads.... We've got idiots issues citizenry pull us through... No, 2/3 month.  Maybe Americans start taking seriously Almighty Football on. need project insecurity everyone else don’t know won’t one two like don’t know won’t one two! entire point you’re working assumptions that: assumptions. thread vitamin gets attacked people believe reason PoC impacted strictly socioeconomic reasons, systematic racism, etc science.

In fact people thread making positive comments Vit downvoted.

Vitamin immune system well researched (1920's sanitariums started). link amount melanin skin higher risk deficiency also well haven’t seen studies suggesting aforementioned demographics would less severe infections simply increasing vitamin levels. 

Plenty studies read....you start tuberculous studies 1920's work way Covid, busy long time. Get colgate peroxyl runs out. (1.5 percent hydrogen peroxide). Since significant percentage people aspirate fluids lungs deep sleep, good idea gargle 60 seconds sleep knock viral load lower risk getting severe form disease. Debated two I'd argue we're corporate oligarchy. really comparing ww2 America 2000s America? Really? “While can” 

Arrogant 

Also haha authority power life brag randomly happened born  Oh must new active cases. cumulated cases. Maybe lern basic terms statistics trying argue them? know right? never really gave damn first place. remember wife hesitant booking 2 week Europe trip, went “cause never know happen next year.” 

I’d embarrassed travel today!  [state's health department show huge drops ED visits Influenza-like *and* Covid-like illness 1 month + now? yeah do, can't even apply citizenship residence 8 years. special cases reduced 6 years.

also, Germany generally allow dual citizenship non-EU citizens. give US passport want citizen here.  hit early, without prepared. US (New York) also got hit early without prepared. longer excuse. Texas Florida can't say ""we see coming"" instead say ""we saw comming care people's lives"". Europe say ""we see comming fought hard longer issue"". punch face? would ask I'm really worried going devolve nonsense.  Surgeons wear scrubbing clean wear gown also seals forearms behind PPE. touch sterilized equipment nothing else. 

Unless cuts hands something gloves help prevent contracting covid anymore washing hands touching face will. twist narrative karma. know evidently well professions industries stronger Europe USA. Eloquent always frame argument absolutisms obviously incompatible basic laws protecting public health. Keep saying obviously wrong thing, get obvious correction.

I assume lead risk/benefit garbage plainly inconsistent basic argument. Violations rights ""risk/benefit"" threshold. Could imagine did? allowed rape wife daughter promised donate 10 million dollars charity?  much money would one donate rape wife daughter? 10 million? 20 million? even dumber argument first. think point saying Trump *root* issue point ignore fact happened system already fucked up. minimizing that, essentially burying discussion points needing larger reform. Yes, stifling heat commercial kitchen. Look, don’t choice. need money lose job shows calls out. It’s homeless. Nether us want spread virus, neither us want starve homeless either. S/NI/W far perfect themselves, least hell lot clearer rules. Russia: already still thousands fans smashmouth??  That's really science works though. wait peer reviewed. Even peer reviewed things get retracted change time, called scientific method. yeah, pleasure talking sharing info. they’re really trying here, far know, show testing methodology valid. They’re necessarily saying best masks worst, they’re putting forward easy way test masks. 

Which articles say “new easy test made Duke” course, researchers eager emphasise focus study actually low-cost testing method developed, test results masks least effective – kind testing could conducted robustly systematically proof-of-concept study here. Like give shit europeans think, USA lives rent free heads forever. 8-4 fairly common neck woods, including workplace. receiving worse threats. receiving self defense. You’re really going use Alaska comparison? think it’s okay certainly concerns vaccine. Especially since last week, Trump made promise vaccine come November. Fauci top scientists don’t seem support idea vaccine ready least Q1 21, I’m certainly trusting vaccine come November. 131 R1 universities across US. That's easily 100,000 students, include faculty staff. understand naturally causes decrease spread it’s worked way enough population, possible there’s also social behavior change community hits 20%? Zoro!! He’s little crybaby ❄️ Greed selfishness - population government 
 - real disease here. 

Without pre-existing conditions, COVID bad is. keep going, harder daddy got tested yesterday pre hospital procedure test. Got back nine hours, I'm Wisconsin. Thanks story, I'm going similar stress. part, get stressed MAGA fucks, majority thankfully impact think have. make headlines news love clicks controversy stupidity. can't change rotten minds, however ignore keep part. idea else ask.

Oh god world omelets vs it’s interesting. jail time used former pandemics. bullshit going right somehow, apparently, taken table, yet it’s perfectly valid worked before. would stop mask refusal employee harassment make us safer. Yep, made false sense security. Masking along proper distancing measures way hope bring numbers manageable level. zombie rhinos everywhere Amen. too. Graduated college disaster. thing older Gen Z experiencing now. You’re right. don’t trust numbers. way higher. Yeah internet seen dumbasses, know heap genuin people America dumb ones make much worse Antibody tests matter anyone except epidemiologists right now. ignored politicians, really care they’re dropped “people tested positive” counts. Tabulate separately, love god, don’t stick column PCRs. Someone COVID May impact decisions made managing disease right now. One simply become multimillionaire billionaire without stealing wealth. way steal work instead someone else works makes them. whole “make money make money”. slavery, got little better. feudalism, got little better. capitalism think it’s time stop all. I’ll heading Maine next trip!

But time get two weeks New York Vermont. good rules. 

Looking forward seeing state, even I’ll minority wearing mask. I’m tempted bring virus home let kill comorbid parents since would rather suck Trump’s dick give fuckall care anyone else’s well-being.

My mom invites friends drink swim; dad already wants send jail merely disagree anything say. Meanwhile I’m 23 learned drive friends taught me. Thanks quarantine though, plenty time reflect on... ever cared respect them? help keep informed this, offered help anything all, whether grocery shopping keep safe?

Everybody, need check article linked OP's headline! ever wondered happened classmates peaked 11th grade desperate, easy girls knocked up, there's answer! I’m sure they’ll wanna wear mask get someone love gets Covid. nerve threatening her, audacity. You’re fat-shaming! victim-blaming! It’s fault they’re dying preventable disease... way prevent wear mask stay indoors. That’s it. solutions. sirree. people (about 80%) recover disease without needing special treatment, majority – especially children young adults – illness due COVID-19 generally people cause serious illness. Around 1 every 5 people infected COVID-19 develop difficulty breathing require hospital Specificy numbers, what's level? 8 Months later, still investigation stabbed him. Teachers seen running show town. whole area 20 cases since March, non now, teachers union got system hybrid model, worst all. teachers refuse consider science local medical experts call reopening. little disheartening seeing teachers ruled emotion data science.

And bus drivers higher risk? fresh air delivered space, I'd assume sell tickets crisis.
This would mean people walking high risk.  Unfortunately, healthcare deadline u dead. Even lab late, u going go say no? Every lab full u may ever inching closer death. u wait, however long takes. 

That's profit healthcare always insanely expensive. asking simple question: ho much u willing pay ur life? friend keeps bringing mind validates insane instagram based theories whole world becoming aware resisting conspiracy implement tyranny wearing masks.

Im sure reason ignorance stupidity... “child / children?” 

Following logic, become un-immune puberty? 18 they’re legally adults?

NOBODY DEFINED YET MAKES INSANE. post location pictures eating hash-browns covered melted Tillamook medium cheddar Reddit. Go on, time research. point seems like enjoy arguing internet sake it.

Go research theory, come back find substantial evidence. take things girl? school 9 infected cases already already shut temporarily, regardless poor girl posting picture online. Go then, state counter argument false. Ok, yout last point fair, bad.
But still, two countries much better established medical systems. Much better know driven private healthcare providers. 

In particular situation, oddly enough, problem. 

The FDA/CDC dropping ball testing, big time, beginning. Tests work, tests take long -and infuriatingly, refusing sign waivers / releases allowing private universities/labs etc get help development/administration tests. 

This pandemic revealed colossal structural flaws across almost every aspect American society. important ignore forget blame convenient scapegoat. IMO, misleading must intentional. think got bad England? Hang rest us. depressed to, want see ends. still beautiful things world seen yet. -40 -50 windchill out. What's problem. actually guest die ride getting log ride. They're trying save life. Please tell US leaches PR? 

PR produces nothing outside making reggaeton music poverty. Haha what’s like neoliberal pigeon? I'd really love see citation coronaviruses mutate nearly much influenza.

They're RNA virus RNA scientists see future /s. It’s called hypothesis. I’m sure time data supported it, data changing, longer supports it. science works. National distancing. mean, I’m 5 month nationwide road trip right even I’m smart enough go within states distance Florida. Thanks! 75% parents district PA said child going person school. could say Trump number UK media outlets though - UK Government actively pushing narrative atm despite evidence contrary. NZ Madagascar real world Pandemic flash game. Simple calculation--162K deaths 5M confirmed cases. CDC thinks maybe 10 infections every confirmed case. least 280M yet infected.... lots room serious problem coming winter. Latest IHME projection almost 300,000 deaths Dec. 1, assuming status quo population behaviour. also implicitly assumes adequate economic assistance forthcoming otherwise workers forced mobile rather pessimistic projection scenarios become likely. Congress really get act together?

Doctors learned lot treatment uncontrolled serge could still overwhelm capacity. even vaccine coming early next year expect see significantly higher number mid-March: would 1M deaths outside realm possibility? 

Given short time frame get right, maybe time ignore key advice ""Hitchhiker's Guide Galaxy"" -- panic!! (Of course deniers would say ""overreaction"" messaging tad tricky.) Bullshit nEaT real sadness harbingers system, politicians accepted lobbying bribes system full swing benefit play populace.

Declining cases place people become enlightened new yorks glowing example? sturgis weekend instead. Whataboutism help anyone. True that. Lol, no. USA terrible response coronavirus, despite opportunity observe happening Asia Europe weeks prior becoming heavily spread throughout US. dozens upon dozens countries put forth better response us used examples respond crisis one.

The USA embarrassment shown puts money wealth lives citizens. USA absolutely deserves ridicule gets.

Personally, lost faith handling around late March/early April, Folkhälsomyndigheten decided holding back would delaying inevitable despite [developments like made Norwegians reconsider narrative countries politicians running show extremely exaggerated, mostly seems exist within country.

[Here's longer take happened Neat. Tremendous positivity. best. kind example set? ""Get line shut even we're putting life risk. make us look bad.""

""They don’t want population citizens capable critical thinking. don’t want well informed, well educated people capable critical thinking. They’re interested that. doesn’t help them. That's interests.

- George Carlin  Quite bus drivers immigrants well. Reading comments seeing difficult everyone wanted throw tips helped friends family. 
- Prepare concoction ginger (mashed), honey black pepper/turmeric drink everyday
- Take steam everyday morning everytime go outside return home
- Gargle warm water everyday (add betadine available)
- use mask without washing it
- Prepare salt solution water spray masks washing
- possible, use baking soda wash anything everything washed receiving outside
- Keep bin door antiseptic water dump mask soon get indoors. 

The government care anything. take precautions keep family safe hard times. best wishes folks. Stay safe kind! old data, technically, old approach. give shit South Korean mortality rates. They're meaningless applied country without shit together like US Brazil. one wears mask live except asians. ones dying fine Yes, decades research gone vaccines general. genetic sequence SARS-COV-2 even published January 11, 2020. 

Nobody said anyone cutting corners. truly believe scientists working earnestly thoroughly. advocating logical impossibility. can't claim perfect 10 year outlook something exist 9 months ago. 

I'll first line vaccine available. understand others might cautious. Early vaccine recipients basically part trial. monitored development side effects. Side effects may reveal large, diverse population time.  that's part keep ignoring. Time.

The disease novel, rapidity vaccine R&amp;D unprecedented. 

And mean word ""unprecedented"" truest definition. vaccines take 5 years reach market. name one developed 4 years? (I'll save Google. mumps. 4 years, still holds record). we're attempting beat world record here, 4 times over! That's exciting. Amazing. without risks. Americans part either acting appropriately listening science acting like spoiled child got told cannot something want throwing tantrum. Full grown scum earth spitting employees faces asked wear mask 😷 screaming rights like shoes shirt service isnt thing exists every day america.its completely unreal here.At point people know taking darwin approach hoping enough crazy ones die chance try get back normal.

Edit. I'm New York got ravaged first states badly food trucks filled dead buried mass Graves control spread. patience ignorance gets others killed. Show approved test then.

What harmful asking approved test?

Would like country bases decisions crystal ball? always, simple. Sweden asked private citizens businesses donate money and/or PPE hospitals we're one highest taxed countries planet. 2014 name stand age? must six years old think makes sense, right? Take look European numbers.

There clearly visible spikes (in countries). interesting think lower excess mortality age groups. Children teen answers die less often expected. would best true older people force teenager wake 8 ffs. “Let’s send children back school!”, said. responsible worst hit still there, making decisions. South American countries took covid seriously seen flu numbers drop precipitously wearing masks helps prevent flu Covid. predict opposite also hold true. countries poorly managed covid responds (cough USA cough) reap benefit toward fighting flu, combination two viruses could exacerbate death count. Yup, that's excess deaths useful stat. Many secondary effects (as listed), still effect virus.

It also bypasses inaccuracies countries initially undertested &amp;probably missed cases (eg UK), entirely trustworthy (eg China), led incompetent lying idiots (eg US, Brasil, Philippines). Fuck em!! even streaming twitch dating tinder, important like us! Sure, think public transport, especially subways, key driver COVID worst spots. London, Stockholm, New York prime examples. Stockholm saw way rapid spread rest Sweden (and sees slowest, certainly due much higher immunity). 

But point kindergartens same. cesspools. crisis routines kindergartens changed dramatically, teachers infected less average population time almost half population barely leave homes points something else. agree there's lack evidence? 

Anyone say little evidence something. tells we've done little prove outcome either way. tells nothing whatsoever. nothing those? literally wear seat belt dangerous. Nobody says banning everything outright sensible thing social distancing wearing masks, hard, much simple, civil duty. Something wrong GoFundMe, can't seem log reset password.

there transcript Spanish flu times. Studies excess deaths concluding least third due virus itself. They're things like people dying home things like heart disease diabetes they're afraid seek treatment, sharp rises suicides drug/alcohol related deaths due stress depression isolation, financial insecurity, fear. Canada terrible place.

there one justification death penalty mind, whether accepted personal matter. people need removed society safety society. life sentences without parole would fine me. ultimate punishment however, could persuade people take plea. lesser plea sentence possibility parole, course. Since sometimes case weakened evidence indisputably identifies killer must thrown out, seek plea deals, sometimes killers go plea end going free. And, sometimes, take plea. world death penalty ultimate punishment, find several killers fear outcome, certain percentage accept life without parole avoid it. end, country slightly safer death penalty then, admittedly much. concede people paroled difference ultimate punishments would 60 less likely kill again. think would increase cost non-capital cases im guessing. 

the root issue problem wrongful convictions. course mistakes happen, certain parts country texas! aggressively pursue marginal cases. bigger problem focus fix. 

the death penalty almost de facto eliminated everywhere else texas. We've changed procedures mandatory waiting periods careful, san quentin death row inmates waited 25 years executed. 

TL;DR I'd rather make simple changes avoid wrongful convictions fix texas worry death penalty point. Surely doesn’t transmit zoom Exactly...everyone would’ve case math is. Ah yes, let us completely fray away US, reason Europe steamrolled tanks China Russia. Truly smart option!

Without US millitary supremacy, Europe would completely invaded simple enough millitary might counter whatever China Russia put table, especially strength numbers.

Better title. Eh, European vaccines development well. interesting see wins race, &amp; us, 'fragile &amp; inconsiderate' developed / manufactured. Since many us make it, sincerely hope saner countries use us teaching example children greed, arrogance, willful ignorance country. handling pandemic one example. others. used work lot younger I’ve slowed lot tend spend time reading stuff. family still gets panties twist hear went vacation don’t stuff like think people work time. also wonder they’re always tired don’t many close friends do. terrorist attack almost 20 years ago? particularly. Oklahoma City something spend lot time grieving days either. worst part beginning. They're still pretending try best bring peace back. result? Schools reopening across country. full force everywhere, oh no. New York we're half reopening, partnerships recommendations put kids daycare programs rest week. instead kids isolated single classroom, they're going mixing multiple ages. They're foisting liability cost parents, whose option homeschool (full time virtual schools elementary kids? Lol sure). restrict spread (we told cloth masks considered PPE social distancing measures we're going notified even there's outbreak class unless health department overrides them--they fucking email us lice flu mono that's bullshit), put kids school safely.

They've effectively figured way fuck parents think kids go back parents think shouldn't. insane. tough guy macho men actually muscular. seem overweight.

Customer: (jaw drops) $10!? Wtf get shit swap meet street $5!!

Me: Sorry best $10 even cash, also swap meets dont much overhead costs rent, labor, etc..

Customer: Throws crinkled sweaty bra money proceeds cuss throw racial slurs walk door

Of course fucking customers continue come back week later needing another charger either lost one bought us ""broke"" aka wire ripped base charger wants free replacement

Also amount people thinking PERSONALLY shut phone pay bill astounding.. explain countless amount idiots store takes payments payment goes MetroPCS shut phones off.. one customer think pocket entire bill asking discount money

We getting lot comeuppance world stage society fails every leg saga.

Hope something comes good this. 

What moving money around case deal personal worst case. majority media growing up, movies, video games, music MTV, always English maybe accurate, American (FYI I'm dutch). Meeting American citizens always felt kind special me, I'd see tv time. 

When visited New York, basically went downhill. feel like views gone hill can't live image portray media distribute around world. feel like Covid exposed are. people value 'real' 'honest' much, sure lot 'fake' build culture. It’s deliberate step top cripple economy force even cushy comfortable “middle class” Americans gig $15 hour less jobs. That’s it’s nothing half measures since day one. easy see thing dragging out. pushed “flatten curve” giving real strategy going forward. course cases deaths spiking now. Quit expecting anything government money. don’t respect you. fact, fucking resent you. cite sources. Show actual data reinfection, news reports, doctors anecdotes real scientific data distinguish relapse reinfection. That's XCOM, baby :( Fuck Sturgis sideways! Talk super spreader. think someone like gives shit anyone except himself? suggesting would require constitutional referendum, long FPTP voting, two dominant parties. attempts introduce third party act weaken one dominant parties (the one similar new party), give control dominant party. essence, presence ""successful"" third party would lead fewer goals accomplished. wrong. Upvote tired

no matter wake life, working unemployed, let’s see many us wits end. Ahhh yes, toxic masculinity strikes again. definitely thing I’ve noticed, men wearing mask partner is. It’s pretty horrible. you’re really walking around store changing gloves every 5 minutes?  took hotels office buildings filled homeless people. Turns virus loves indoors actually safer street. Sounds like something Prius would say Obviously Trump sucks forget Nancy Pelosi, Barack Obama, Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden.  four Democrats massively corrupt support universal healthcare even seeing Coronavirus US population. like Trump evil corrupt scum run Democrats would rather take bribes give Americans healthcare. Barack Obama Trump united belief children die healthcare executives make massive amounts money.  That's fucked country. Two parties run evil easy bribe scum. founding fathers, like Thomas Jefferson, indeed things. Others, like Thomas Paine, abolitionists. Founding Fathers different one another. Also, impression English monarchy somehow better? really meant one big 4 engineering fields (Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, Civil) computer science. 

Computer science especially rewarded either. software industry really computer science. fact, actual smart people tend burn fastest SWE. Software mostly menial work— every researcher designing next-generation neural network, 500 losers working Jira tickets— reason highly paid expectations absurd (because software engineers terrible social skills, collective sensibility, awareness business always see cost center matter do) burnout rate high. shit job, tech dumping ground blame people notice works well— that's case even FaceGoogs unless paperwork sufficient get job elite research division. Research different, regular software 10-year career. Things change PhD level fields, frank, BS science know enough science actually it, PhD programs tend pretty competitive that.

It's need PhD research-level jobs. learn science PhD program, learn job. latter happen much, employers invest people, that's hyperspecialization— economic system garbage, government irresponsibly lets employers survive even treat workers badly.

Back global corporatism— back actually country— could get BA-level research job (those actually existed!) would send graduate school part-time. could work PhD time get paid full salary. That's sciences like back things actually worked. Since early '90s, though, we've seen credential inflation, total collapse academic job market, well corresponding collapse private-sector research... recent years, even public sector become dysfunctional. Cold War sucked, ""winning"" even worse— end, worst thing happened American people— led us global corporatism. Lmao *EU designers architects entered chat* might well walking sun. No, that's completely unfair. shit scary, idea going end, people dying, people losing jobs homes, social isolation months end hard especially there's clear exit. 

If see that's objectively rough person's mental health, that's conscience. played Sturgis... Explains lot! valve danger others, person wearing it.  selective reasoning. know trying justify bullshit. think people really stupid, feel like superior intellect able bedazzle us brilliance? Either way amateur level attempts push narrative R bad good. dont even want say #1, LA, Blue decades 200k cases. mean that's 5X cases OC. go check population county discredit this... 3x pop OC, 5x cases. Quiet down. There's danger thinking ""*those people* nuts, people safe sane."" baits brains thinking we're subject believing crazy things interest.

All us evil stupid things think okay. need consider actions carefully. say keep saying it, Russia least partly responsible much this, coupled rampant abuse social media platforms sow discontent disinformation.

Note absolving bad people bad things, everyone (politicians included) drinking poison water well (AKA Russian influenced social media), worse off. country split like 30-30-40.

30% conservative 30% liberal 40% middle road. don’t know you’re shocked. It’s clear start current administration give rats ass anyone themselves. turn 2A debate? didn’t say anything limiting gun possession, haha! I’m saying US nasty domestic terrorist situation. Don’t throw stones glass house all. right...the better behave sooner things return normal. thing everyone part, unfortunately that’s happening.  Lmao. joke, fucktard.  rest us eagerly part.
 
Sans protesting en masse month straight groups 10s thousands, sure. situation would hope daycare taking possible actions stop getting infected then. “Deaths per capita pretty low”


Dude drunk what. That’s exactly put can't see one big circle jerk similarity public shaming news ""reactions""?

Most people post comments reacting headline. There's less less actual content day group bad group bad. constant attack Americans president many times.

Nevermind density, tourism factors contributing covid far outside control leadership. imply even concept owning house live banned?

I actually seen someone farther left make argument. seemed idea property ownership general, thought immoral housing without using charging someone else to. like, ‘Okay, woah there.’ middle ground ‘take shameless advantage vulnerable people’ ‘abolish property ownership.’ one party's goal improve country, party's goal troll opposition.

Kind like poster said... think trolling goal. Staying power looting country goal. Trolling turned excellent technique reach goals. Given people power actually stated openly manipulating data plan, hard argue least *trying* carry out. far succeeded, one say sure. That's beauty plan. fact bare minimum ""we're china"" opposed higher standards country says everything you. 5 days paid least? sounds like nightmare. country, years work (overall, one company) get 26 days paid vacation.

Edit: whoops, wrong comment... Looks like it’s time let Europe defend itself. Shit talking Americans hold begging cups toward us. Pathetic. Yea 60+ notably obviously bad. I'd say though IFR really starts getting bad jump 40's 50's. Also, data much worse men large. I’m sad hard work can’t voted top back literally shooting Nazis en masse today entire political party totally cool them.

In 2002, BCRA passed made following broadcast, cable, satellite communication"" ""refers clearly identified candidate Federal office""

But many organizations-- including ACLU-- sued language clear could used chill specific political speech (Specifically believed would used majority party ads run regarding platforms candidates (a grey area), ads run regarding platforms minority party's candidates would let through). becomes much narrower definition ""electioneering communication"" actually is, deemed violation individuals making contributions' right free speech.

Your statement congress anything stood financially benefit ruling make sense passed legislation banning first place-- organizations like Citizen's United ACLU sued get overturned pointing finger at, believe easy solution.

(Personally, reading opinions briefings lawsuits ACLU, agree them-- easy determine counts ruling.

In uk stuff upper lip knuckle deal it.

Our politicians inept hence spread people told quarantine generally so. Maybe 5% never small. Respect shown NHS govt worried rich folk richer wanted open shops relax rules flared again.

But large number people politicians act way Americans appalling. you’re talking people support things like reparations, misunderstand us. bear personal responsibility slavery, power deal legacy help put fellow countrymen equal playing field. made comment state divided removed. WTF? feel similarly you. keep thinking ""yes, consequences, like Katrina consequences."" difference seems see inevitable like Katrina, others seeing bad/ something choosing overreact. tend fall first camp, think inevitable take much caution can. guess think caution warranted unknown, others think lifetime things like prom worth (to insignificant) risk.

My kids teens. understand fears, prioritizing different risks. Nobody (read: many citizens) respect US government *because* legal lying known lobbying.

I still hear people repeating lies Reagan era. unfortunately lot voters stopped growing up.

In this, late February, March early April scariest time Sweden I've ever experienced, country came standstill, streets Stockholm fucking empty. 

The guidelines put place held average citizen still held today. Sure, summer seen large gatherings outside parks example raised concern, basically events in-doors, festivals anything, numbers looking good.

Edit: looking death per capita bullshit point, number lower. lowered every statistic is. way death per capita number look good countries pass us, nobody wants. Although countries seem trying, US example. Many major pharmaceutical companies take advantage American R&amp;D, Americans footing bill Europeans getting drugs cheap. I’m sure would cheaper Europe go whole process themselves, rather effectively subsidized American consumers. I’m also sure American pharmaceutical companies “fewer options,” drugs often patent-protected. don’t enjoy situation try optimistic almost fault I’ve used pandemic get closer God, get better shape, work disinfecting least something combat spread... obviously want I’m accepting trying make Seeing last time guys decided break turn well... feel one, shoutout 2019-2020 flu season giving me, long-distance runner, fucking asthma. Serves right getting flu shot

Maybe viral load, really wonder something specific person genetically determines gets totally fucked fine. Tbh know someone moved Miami Ireland still wonder why. someone who'd lived Ireland life can't imagine someone would want live Miami... 

I mean sure US problems completely dystopian, there's lot things life America imo actually better life Ireland European country. I'm saying ""cure"".

But even example...if 300 lb person diabetes started supplementing Vit February got sick July firmly believe supplementation would positive impact outcome ( he/she deficient prior) based know correlation immune system.....and would downside.

It seems looking peer reviewed data impact specifically Covid may years I'm looking standpoint know helps immune system general can't hurt it. people dumb too, new generation always dumb inconsiderate. ever traveled abroad seen Americans/American families are, entitled inconsiderate cultures. It’s always even country think happens US definitely problem well. shows future relations need well thought through. Well... already case guys elected Trump. Oh wow, don’t say. Big 12 sweeps offseason.  love football too,but NBA NHL using bubble strategy.

it's super annoying every post hot circlejerking bad us europe god tier something. Apologies offending uhhhh something. 

Anyway til im stupid american thanks bud experience 100% location. mean, explained US worse Europe. explained US numbers lower countries Europe. 

New Jersey. 1796 deaths/million. That's 211% higher Belgium. insane. US 600 deaths/million end august. That's officially. Unofficially, US already 600. 300k dead US end year. minimum. claim US better European country idiotic statement. claim.  listed company problem! I'd rather information spread accurate possible, helps one spread misleading info. thinking entitled know-nothing dip shits. us, way fucking many. husband thinks work good enough excuse. 

When son age, 1, set playpen kitchen could catch cleaning cooking keeping company time. would listen music usually fell asleep afternoon. nope, kids get sick. COVID kids school times lots kids absent virus strep whatever going around.

normal stuff life earth I’d say it’s mindset government “the problem” Reagan really pounded republican base party hammering ever since. 

Power rarely created destroyed, gets transferred. convincing people it’s best government power, mindset resulted massive amount power given private interests. messaging along naive belief “the market” creates fairness cases convinced people it’s better power reside parties wholly unresponsive unrepresentative rather reside parties inside admittedly flawed representative system. 

This worked making private interests insane amounts money concentrating wealth, system mindset moulded obviously equipped deal emergencies effect public good. We’re seeing starkly ever. government “the problem” shouldn’t take steps manage virus response it’s better left hands private enterprise and/or individual. Except we’re seeing that’s obviously case desperately need top response run system mechanism accountability, like voting. dont stop comin Yeah won’t hurt hiring process company. Yeah overall now. right it’s highest top 5 weeks. compare New York too. It’s safer NY right Moment Florida. course feel people. car accident victims - advocate banning cars suggest anyone spend large portion day caring traffic crashes. that's generation people left do? Move every 2 years, unable put sort permanent roots location, make keep friends 2 years up?

What thoughtless selfish comment. saw nobody, went nowhere, nothing months. see girlfriend March - June. Left house essential goods always wore mask. Sanitized everything came house. Washed hands bled.

It become apparent idiots around going force either live way indefinitely accept certain level risk I've finally chosen latter. mask up, keep people 6 feet, avoid bars/restaurants, etc. I'm done living hermit. I'm low-risk enough I'm worried myself, longer care reducing community spread - fuck community. deserve whatever comes. Yeah hasn’t happened mlb. can’t bubble sport big football especially since amateurs. MLB they’ve send players home partying away cities, players going strip clubs casinos, led outbreaks. Remind pros college kids. It’d worse mean thing killing us?

All us? Unless elderly there's low chance death. guess fits narrative US total trash.

Your incorrect analysis based flawed premise? suppose not. That's America you. Problem LOT places going completely online. places hot spots develop burn entire student body matter short weeks. 

You're also talking getting college-aged athletes abide bubbling restrictions environment that's probably partying studying...or even playing. 

It's realistic. money come also ""super low taxes?"" Especially considering Russia also spends massively military (relative GDP) loses lot government efficiency corruption. yall fuck partisanship. No-one disputing deaths lag infections, obviously true.

But uptick cases necessarily mean uptick deaths going follow. Maybe. Maybe not. depends demographics cases. question wether giving everyone exactly one virus particle (an EXTREMELY small dose virus, less would even get wearing mask getting infected someone around you).
Would work, would one virus particle enough produce antibody response? would backfire cause virus possibly replicate extent could cause severe symptoms death body?
Thank  guys talk shit backpedal soon call out. great masses people employment? social programs cut? UBI? Corporations 1% running government?

Now throw scarcity issue. that, America's military budget big reason Europe safe many potential threats.

such nonsense propaganda - yeah Iraq Afghanistan bomb Munich, thank god US stop America sending best article poorly written? back in? hair fall out? There's flow - typical Fox News though. Every person coming anywhere abroad quarantined. safe automation economy turns sour they're first go. Huh Honestly I've always wondered genetic self-selection going US. 

It takes certain kind personality want leave old life behind get settled random middle-of-nowhere continent. 

And contrary popular belief lot immigrants Americas desperately poor, least able pay way get (and criteria far stricter). 

I'd wager Americas selected certain kind ""high risk"" personality type, type correlated lot typical behaviors people associate Americans. 

I also think behaviors would less expressed Latin America, due large pool Native admixture, probably much balanced array human personalities. 

Think it, let's pretend colony Antarctica opened tomorrow. Would leave life immigrate there? kind person would? government keeps people solidarity acting collectively takes betterment nation.

Eh, agree points making, think respect government things. think basically treating others way like treated it, rest things fall that.

We've long, long away standard very, long time. Everyone othered everyone else point nobody respects scream past other.

There huge shift Trump's election, coronavirus made worse, I'm sure rabbit put back hat ever again. money-making machines designed rake grant money.

Those institutions primary (and only) goal bring grant money, historical reasons grant-seekers occasionally required teach courses. students accidentally learn anything courses, one much gives shit.

If anti-intellectualism advantage getting grants (and sometimes is), they'd laud like everyone else. It’s pleasant, try it! likely manipulation powerful entities would benefit fall US. Encourage pack destroy within. It’s funny stop discussing asked source. wonder why... read “Snottling” sort creative insult first. may borrow such, don’t mind. Yes, will. telehealth call PCP simply sucked ISP situation America garbage. end early bad connection get wanted schedule person appointment. somewhat correct. political sad. 

You one side claiming cant breathe masks constitutional right wear mask - rubbish. 

But there's also side (your side?) claims can't send kids school daycares fine. group seems shutting intention inflicting pain. 

I like think Im middle ground. Okay comrade also plenty grad students bright.

I'm saying every school same. real trick past 4 years exposed government mostly based around conventions everyone recently generally followed. What’s happened certain actors realized aren’t disincentives ignoring conventions want ends. reform needs happen enshrining conventions important law limit future exploitation, treat laws evolving/living document (I.e - loopholed found exploited, quickly patched revised). kinds rules codified somewhere appropriate penalties dissuade actors breaking system get healthier. masks? years gonna stop coming... Dude make mind. guys representative democracy not? Antidepressants Hoping NFL watching. Wait... think prior COVID-19?? obviously satire. Incivility? see posted many subs deleting every comment?

Honestly, exposing scheme. says terrible things, deletes people start complaining calling out.

I hope consider banning outright, saying truly nasty things insulting personally.

Thanks, great evening. [Absolutely Sorry, guess I'll repeat responsible death hundreds thousands middle easterners pushed needless war cost country trillions dollars could poured number social programs.

If think Bush presidency was, least, destructive Trump's... honestly idea say. Trump unique destructive is. Ok first even 300k Americans died January still wouldn’t say it’s worse WW2 multiple reasons. 

But you’re missing point. original comment said sports matter great deal many people livelihood ticket generational poverty therefore sports happening big deal people least able acknowledge instead acting like doesnt matter might canceled. Nothing working! pay for?

Everything working fine. pay for? Thank clarification, scale country governmental structure, makes sense.

I could see people reaction, even Presidential decree, that's that's slightly different topic. pressure politicians go primary oath “do harm” becomes non starter many don’t want throw medical careers away. reddit empathy compassion There’s reason neuticles exist. said today basically..they’ve made people distrust every reputable person news source people started creating narratives ate candies 13 years since I've stopped trick-or-treat give children instead. but....

Come now. Im sorry, anyone ask? try. think read statement wrong. referring suburbs areas comparing Pittsburgh suburbs State College Scranton. Pittsburgh suburbs red.

It's actually scary well Trump counties cities in. Almost 40% Allegheny, 46% Centre, 46% Lackawanna. also got least 35% surrounding Philly counties except Philadelphia itself.

Thanks kind message! &lt;3 2 countries 47 common. shithole, third world continent. Nevermind I've taken look numbers, seems herd immunity worked failed protect elderly population. gather cell immunity possibly main contributing factor, would mean strain cold causing coronavirus possibly spread Sweden covid19. waiting game see large region Covid slows even lifted restriction. anywhere else gamble, people prior contact strain train cell immunity, Covid19 hit hard definitely need hard measures slow spread.
For places like US, obesity heart disease runs rampant, restrictions means overwhelming hospitalizations.
This method cannot applied elsewhere easily, statistics needed anywhere wants implement Swedish method needs look best possible way protect elderly homes. certifiable genius high school, took calculus fifth grade,

I find statements like interesting, difficult convey much intrigues me.

In head, geniuses ""get things older kids get do"". That's measure it. someone got what's essentially high school (or even college) class nth grade (where n significantly less than), they're ""genius"".

I think developed notion (but neither certain someone pushed deliberately).

What calculus difficult astounded 5th grader might able dip toes it?

Why never crossed mind 5th graders take calculus courses, public school system set inflexibility permit much, ever?

Did never notice helicopter parents pushing school board find poor kid do? maybe (though less likely) connections local level made college, I'd told once, professors well students, work ethic makes underachievers look bad slow down.

That's call education little teaching anyone anything. social system, sort allow successful, must squashed flat. Last comment got removed try again. Website appears front someone claim represent.

1) repeating extremely tired old ""just wait two weeks"" line, people saying Sweden since April. predicted disaster never materialized.

2) probability death virus *highly* dependent age comorbidity factors. uptick cases *might* result uptick deaths, *if* vulnerable people ones getting infected. since age breakdown new cases, know. might 100% high-school kids, case expected upticks deaths 0. Simple assault typically misdemeanor. Battery aggravated assault severe charges simple assault. WORSE: political powers-that-be (read: wealthy 1% owners everything) *want* Americans dumb thoughtless---and thus easily manipulated. (Manipulated either follow party stance lock step feel frustrated enough retreat political sphere completely thus abdicate right vote/self-disenfranchise.)

How (limited examples):
-Advertising ""lifestyles"" sell image (and monopolize time &amp; attention everyone seeking attain image)
-Obfuscating facts (and outright lying)
-Keeping education unequal possible
-Dividing public irrational extremes

There structural changes help, require informed public mass action. Examples:
-Ranked choice voting
-Refusal live credit cards? (Forcing living wages?)
-More women, minorities, truth-tellers running public office
-Voting incumbents standard-of-living improving
-A better economic measure ""the stock market"" (which measures economic health wealthy) current system unemployment numbers (that ignores unemployed people frustrated they've given underemployed people)
-Fewer monopolies Shouldn’t considered basic cleaning flights regardless?? Simple assault battery least serious form assault battery, usually involves minor injury limited threat violence, misdemeanor. Felony assault battery (also referred states aggravated assault battery) involves circumstances make crime serious, victim threatened experiences significant violence amounting substantially minor slap across face punch I've always wondered people hundreds thousands college debt high demand field fucking bail move actual civilized country?

Disgusting! 🤮 ""There idiots everywhere"" Americans reply confronted. country cant face reality situation.

USA lots morons lots people passively accept them. Obviously resigning salvage little credibility left. fired obviously cooking numbers promote ""sky falling"" syndrome. go that, cognitive dissonance.

Yes swedish troll brigade idk considered spam.

Talking one subject spam? Ok, let's close reddit save Sweden. /s become mask. tight bonds formed N100 mask. cynical side suspects many folks prefer *idea* children actually care them. 

But validity phrase “it takes village”. Kids can’t raised parents isolation. person US, never met someone salaried job whose standard day isn’t 8-5 (assuming work “normal” business hours) honestly idea term 9-5 came lol. I'm sorry, comment long. give 10 second tl;dr? Would actually harmful though? New york fuck ton protesters infection rate go all. thing? 9 million kids access internet home.

The stupidity staggering. strong like sub zero. strong like scorpion Maths far soulless, it’s beautiful. may clinical, powerful tool good there. use right. America proved can't trusted. Look treating closest neighbors north.

Get rid Trump begin slow process repairing damage done US world stage. Every state response too, federal government hasn’t mandated sort sweeping legislation. 

Comparing wealthy country Europe whole US dumb comparing wealthy US state Ukraine. state, living lives last four months. Literally thing can’t go movie theaters. state doesn’t even 4000 deaths, people going beach, going restaurants, going bars, going vacations, enjoying ourselves. notion everybody society stop want sake elderly sick people ridiculous. Back March April, things seemed bleak. Now, completely obvious virus severe thought going be. I’m sorry, it’s people actual danger virus social distance limit lives, everybody else.

Whenever bring state taking practically zero precautions towards virus yet life going normal, people always say stupid shit like “your government sacrificing citizens profit!” even better, “just wait see! weeks/months going piles piles bodies!!”. Yet, it’s four fucking months still less 4000 deaths. point, rest country needs pull heads asses realize virus deadly big deal originally led believe March April.

The notion POSSIBLY spreading virus somebody else asymptomatic transmission warrant shutting whole country. Go ahead make fun men wearing masks, us haven’t worn masks six months affected all. doesn’t mean selfish, doesn’t mean “sacrificing elderly“, means living normal lives. isn’t Ebola, isn’t polio, isn’t black death, it’s disease kills far less 1% people actually facts. countries actually require bachelor's matriculate medical school. also think lot Americans really strong attitude want. ain’t mask yo people it’s someone telling do. goes huge part national history. isn’t helped Russia successfully spreading conspiracy nonsense since JFK. kind moron ignores wide spread protests violence country order make dubious claim it’s citizens think live utopia? Nothing? Really?
Was “opinion fact”? I'm definitely selfish. ideals align guys anymore. actually give shit happens people mind paying taxes assist that. worst idea ever heard entire life health chief praised New Zealand “global exemplar” response pandemic, country celebrated 100 days community transmission Covid-19 Dr Tedros also praised Boris Johnson government’s decision implement local lockdowns UK France’s Emmanuel Macron introduction compulsory face-masks outdoor areas Paris.

He referring us. alone. I'm getting terrified every day. I'm also getting angry. Whoever said become conservative get older full sh*t. I'm mid-50's grow anti-establishment every month. scholarships 1k per year, rest taken loans paying back. one cannot play football, assuming go college entirely simply wrong. Work getting loan pay back future. everyone gets free college bust (paraphrasing OP)

But u raise good point, curious colleges decide hand student athletes scholarship moneys. ""Have 4 vehicles driveway? 
They may damage home tornado!"" ""Playing politics"" ""rationing"" redundant. ignorant take. personally might country likely does. smell vile thuggery Trumps base mile away honestly point think georgia country handling better georgia state Wtf European here. lot European countries means come smelling roses. lot cases initial response poor led lot deaths. Even spikes cases occurring least response pretty swift. Europe overall threat taken seriously. loved living America adolescence always admired country now. saddens me. None actually addressed comment. accused Democrats failing help Americans without authority evidence, proceeded lot irrelevant information.

But I'll humor comments. said Republicans gotten lot legislation passed. hear favorites last years? value? right people would really value Republicans working help actual Americans instead trying set another corporate bailout.


By way, really taking reductionist factually incorrect view happened around Affordable Care Act. going take much thorough comment help educate actually happened, let's start claim worst healthcare bill time.


America expensive healthcare system among peer nations 2:1 margin more, despite worst health outcomes group. Infant mortality almost double comparable nation average. Maternal mortality closer Turkey's rate comparable nation.


Our healthcare system far expensive non-competitive far long. finally tried address ACA aimed huge factor terrible numbers: massive number uninsured Americans. decreased uninsured 17% 10% years millions millions people need access healthcare.


It huge step right direction time necessarily popular, going claim that's worst healthcare bill? merit?

Luckily anyone frustrated ACA, times changed 70% supporting various options universal healthcare thanks ongoing pandemic. Democrats want build improve upon previous plan compared nothing plan Republicans put forward, sounds like great next step. sound confident. Got sources us buddy? Reddit millennial victimhood, name iconic duo MAGA Fantastic book! Thank sharing. life right teacher needs make money parent school age kids. 

Every plan major downsides. 

We really fucked fully realize yet. Trump cares Israel US. No, hes nationalistic. Staying alive higher priority.

Not mention they’re starting talk permanent heart defects caused simply Covid.

How fuck person going able career getting Covid makes can’t compete level someone never got it? 25% us horrid, suffering 25% Wait wait...there’s Skillet *and* Big Skillet? liberal media part dumbing yes? Like CNN. also think FOX extreme. comes dumbing factor. can't wait next American Gladiators everyone intubated wheeled obstacle course Based I'm programmer I've meetings big names brands corporate world.

The amount anti-intellectualism US goes bottom top industry general society. talk janitor company China Machine Learning algorithms MBA probably came back yelling hard working waiter 3 hour lunch break smoke coming ears try explain VR AR. maddening I'm smartest room know damn well be. myth. fact US relies NATO far countries, constantly dragging NATO 'allies' illegal, immoral wars proxy wars. thanks proving posts point shithead scared lol Dude get bitter getting way bosom.

You ICU beds better furnished country similar modern medicine, knowing much pay them, that's absolute shame! 

And reason priority medicine vaccine ones unprotected enough government choice paying 3000% real price new medicine.

We priority probably there's shit ton legal process involved order allow commercialisation new medicine realistically reasonable price.  Really? Democrats care much improving country best present senile old sexual predator? 

Both parties same. differ certain details. part 2 organizations goal: leverage votes controlling access government. 

American politics void ideology, overton window shifted much right electoral choices either polite (D) angry (R) conservatism. 

In end, American voter realize they're ""product."" like Facebook. vote basically ""like"" ""influencer"" (aka politician) users leverage attract $$$ platform. 

There obviously politicians exceptions, sort furthers point. Based sure murder. personally would prefer rude people don’t kill polite ones might. it? Yes, think used wrong wording.

But would say electricians higher skilled workers. general least don’t deny science. say “masks good, stay socially distant (even gatherings).

I've seen countless images BLM protests people pretty much top tons people crowd wearing masks. Better safe sorry. There's reason cheap something small. You’re absurd *Psychopathic 'ethicist' Parker Crutchfield advocates doping selfish masses submission.*

I’ve always said US always awful really good pr dont think much ""revealing"" exposing extent everyone see.

There many causes worth fighting dying for. another /r/covidregret Places millions people live deaths 3000 pop podunk conservative towns? be?! mention protests US. know you, see value even tiny risk contracting spreading virus completely luxury experiences like eating restaurant, indoors out.

Everyone talking NY things hunky dory there, even though things better NY I'm thrilled proud accomplished, believe way we're going win actually *everything* possible reduce transmission.

1 case easily become 100, especially people returning normal lives socializing going eat. suggest stay dedicated truly essential there's treatment vaccine effective. Anything else slower propagation disease, matter slice dice serve patio :) Well, Americans think Europeans lazy parasites guess even! would love know how. 100 percent 100 dollars $100. 2300 percent $100 $2300. 

Oh saying increased $2300 plus original $100 makes $2400.  chime say whenever see bullying mentioned. Bullying social phenomena, individual. bully enabled social structure, fellow students including parents, teachers society large. US loves big bad strong daddy get things done. kids try turn that, others follow happily blind long direct target. radical individualism, Cult me. collectively takes

America's core principle individuality freedom. end result that. I'm mad last year insurance cover telemedicine. Maybe make insurance companies accepting it. pretty clear? latest report VOTE taken place yet. still expect cancellation minute official decision made. Ok. people states follow this. enough people states follow this. get mean, right?

This pandemic country, know. Unfortunately see US continue suffer virus death illness, also financially long long time, even vaccines widely distributed, rest world less recovers moves lives.

Your statement suggests US government recognize vaccine - especially one another country. totally see government claiming proven vaccine developed another country ""fake"" ""false"" try sell us unproven ""vaccine"" zero medical evidence suggest actually works, developed company trump politicians financial interest in. completely messed response pandemic. 100% fuck vaccine part this. want go back normal life... government plans though. Education strong leadership. American's proven given opportunity, rally behind cause. 9/11, US went full Homeland Security next thing know war middle east. disjointed messages unclear purpose, cannot lead people need be.   said greeted landlord speaks German, sign contracts German, receives weirdly official looking German letters find Doctor speaks English.

Also redditor another sub recently mentioned it: emergency hotlines in... German.

Oh assumption even let work. paging r/selfawarewolves August yet single case re-infection.

I also told places opened schools would blood bath (Indiana, Georgia, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Montana, etc).


I also told Texas Arizona would run beds going NYC 2.0. 

I told virus would need infect least 70% population slow down, maybe more. Virus going grow ""exponentially"" Sweden, Arizona, Texas, Florida, Wisconsin, Iowa, South Dakota, Indiana, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee, Alabama, etc unless made drastic measures.



What new BS going start spinning? see would happen Hoover got terms. thought masks protects people. bc would die wearing one? ""your boy"" stuff? attempt insulting?

I Democrat since immigrated US UK.

Keep political shit sub, easy enough. Yeah kinda like “essential” business calls employees “heroes” bare minimum safety/ distancing protocols temporary compensation. honestly expected 9/11 sort response - everyone coming together beat thing. Everyone part stay home, minimal purchases, masks public, etc. see March April. got May though, seemed like people got COVID fatigue since didn’t personally know someone impacted, didn’t matter. 

If doctor nurse, I’d organizing strike. working around clock, general public doesn’t give damn. give damn, people actively promoting misinformation. elected surgeries, well visit appointments, nothing aside emergencies general public wears fucking mask vacinity people, tele-companies actively stop spread misinformation. Okay hmm ladies know do!! Start telling guys sexy think masks ... Anyone world shocked Americans fragile inconsiderate (among things) paying attention us last 100 years so. problem empathy US. Months ago talking coworker kids detained border. said care they're kids. Shit not, straight faced, said right front me. 

Fuck people like him. vent tube makes look weaker. asking help Yeah, well, already knew Europeans pretending weren’t anti lockdown protests UK, Poland, Russia, Spain, Germany? Last time checked, Europe. careful rational thinking reddit. deal extremities here. 

But serious note, nail head buddy. said better. totally way is. started career 17 I'm 40 now. I've lived except Pacific Northwest. reality time started. 

I got education (not teacher) took huge pay cut. get 6 paid weeks vacation per year respect time. worth it. news, getting shower make wet. Huh??? ""There's way could known, experts said bad. We’re pointing that, many times, articles say “healthy underlying health conditions” *did* fact serious health condition pretty much know affects odds dying COVID. Obesity.

I agree national response pandemic absolutely awful. It’s embarrassment. could, should, done better.

At time, also embarrassed 40% adults 20% kids country obese. many coronavirus deaths thus far could prevented victims weren’t obese. think misunderstood.   
The point white people Europeans. Rather, Caucasian US citizen, ancestors probably Europe.  
2HandedMonster deny comment people ethnicities Europeans (or Americans). that? keep getting alerts posts sub I’m sick argument straw man? focused personal experience, said ""it worked me, I'm tired hearing lazy millennials want paid living wage - work harder!""

I said I'm glad worked you, worked mean works everyone else. ""Strategic plan"" lol immune system damn strong trying kill decades. swear people brag system strong understand Cytokine Storm deadly. Except parents ones raised kids, bully taught, born. Yet Europeans go war centuries slightest provocations.  true number probably closer 200M 1995... Springer beginning end.

Noting, course, high WIS helps save, thing, easy pump saves bad WIS stat. Um, sorry, price that? good/bad anyone else. us way worse us comes cases per population compare deaths U.K., Spain Italy worse... 

we fucked beginning testing enough (like lot countries) letting virus retirement homes got easy way kill bunch people. choice close wasn’t “suicidal” didn’t leave us worse place rest world. wasn’t like didn’t shut everything, didn’t anything else either. us listened instructions. Yeah. It’s false bubble point. existence article problem. somebody thinks possibly good idea remove people's sick. How? literally happening everywhere. Fuck around find American already saw lot stuff see daily basis. far away revealing view it. really need move elsewhere, can't stand countrymen anymore. selfish stupid. Ah yes people also monolith growing like moss stone. born one place ideology matches leaders lives. Nothing ever changes conservative lives LA! /s

My original point can't treat states like monoliths. think would explain can't sum people geographic region way well. Besides revolutionary thing called transportation moves people place place - county county. Blows mind tell what!

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide mean transcends politics. black white nature American politics large part actual problem here. treated (to many) football game treated - two 'teams' one 'winner' (and winner America). crux issue: personally think people general (on average) pretty stupid. they're **more** stupid larger numbers jerk congratulations like-mindedly stupid. POTUS unbearably, laughably moronic might wear ""I'M FUCKING STUPID"" hat proudly thought looked cool -- current system, millions people (his supporters AKA fans bleachers) would rush pre-order ""I'M **WITH** FUCKING STUPID"" companion hat.

Without two-party system, people forced think critically voting instead saying ""I'm Republican vote Republican"". course lots (related) problems anti-intellectualism extreme lack investments early education, would argue even problems political nature. Put bluntly - Republicans **want** stupid/uninformed US electorate want suppress turnout manipulate ones show voting interests. are, paying stupid hourly wages, signing bonuses Recently moved Germany. intensive language course 6 months B1 certificate. Highly recommend that, know many expats ages speak German. find rude tbh. oh, where'd go? gonna admit wrong now? American, feel like I'm living episode twilight zone right now. Greed need push economy treating pandemic like joke. Never dangerous health official, teacher, essential worker. Never lived time Science taken lightly. Never see lack care wellbeing others vain ""liberty"". 

My husband wanting child reeling back, scared, thinking would feel child force exposed hundreds others government says physically go school. 

Also, forced feel different parents, part whole problem. pro trump Republicans father straight accused brainwashed argued masks necessary made us safer. 

American currently exhausts leaves melancholy. 

Thanks anyone took time read this.  Yes no. dumb people much easier talk without deep team mentality states have. grew Shrek caught dead Smashmouth concert. someone else it. way see it, NY leeway even attempt something like this. really hope works out, think long completely honest. postings /r/science issue seem US politics getting polarized. 

There also really good planet money (maybe npr politics) podcast looked history got here. couple years since listened it, gist C-SPAN became thing people (notably Newt Gingrich) realised gave lot power define narrative. started making speeches empty rooms hours night knowing comments broadcast people seeing them, comments would get picked news agencies. control media kinda snowballed there. 

This obviously part story, I'll see dig podcast again. classic deflection. wear mask, *someone* must think dumb. get around simply claim hoax. ask someone really can't explain shut down. many people Facebook feed going vacations, wearing masks, social distancing. Lets jeopardize lives people schools we’re Pull school enroll one districts online learning. Entirely reliant degree. even legal? They've already done twice lol. Oh, we're talking nukes? American, wish could produce rebuttal claim, cannot. What? BSN get find job, associates?

Ok look im critical US handling sure obligatory behavior changing drugs daaaaangerous path. Yeah, progressive Europe nice cultural values are, people still rely mostly one thing deciding move that's jobs. U.S one place high number jobs enough educated people take since education expensive value education also low among Americans. think going closer 2k per day 2 weeks reporting gets accurate. I'm 4'10"" woman, know can, too. I've done before.

It's funny focus hate USA tho. biased, objective call every country continent covid problems ""fragile""? honest, hate USA, using article hide bigotry.

Then get panties bunch someone points Europe handle well Italy &amp; Spain. many dead infected there?

Re-Read comment end time Explain how? “fragile insonsiderate” USA somehow ruined everyone, didn’t “fragile inconsiderate” Europe also ruin everyone? Well 'President' politicized least people could - masks - beginning. Went far suggest wearing one sign disapproval. treats pandemic something happened *him* one else.

Turned federal effort address pandemic hyperpartisan shitstorm instead taking even little bit seriously. whole 'Dem governors suck, GOP governors awesome!' schtick exhausting, even obvious truth 'blue' states vilified responding far better 'red' states he's glorified.

All support 40% country. beyond embarrassing American year. incredible easily manipulated case #'s willing population. People continue point case#s proof virus abating. Yet, positivity rate likely increase due lack testing. get articles like this.

Do Americans know country kind fucking sucks? someone outside looking in, could told entire country would bungle Covid. Everyone world shut except you. Y'all fucking reality tv host leader country. recently half country still waved flag union lost civil war, existed 5 6 years.

Yeah, *are* fragile. long time. fault many citizens, wonder many Americans actually see USA rest us do. feedback loop. social media makes easier A) get radicalized disinformation B) treat fellow citizens poorly social pressure that. feed disinformation cycle continues.

nobody's going pull little information bubble. authorities observe situation pick whichever path likely sway votes, long votes matter. 

eventually matter. that's end game authoritarian personalities. long believe ""their guy"" power...they care freedom choose leaders. Even true, thats still 3 months sickness death. hundreds epidemiologists think he's full shit? Unions lot undeserved luster left workers killed authorities.

k seen data I've following thing since Jan 6th.. peer papers needed, please provide. ever heard Vietnam? Millennials care pandemic? Apparently mask mandates never happened either /s I'll bet companies holding back want make huge investment ramping production see vaccine come sooner rather later nullify investments. I'm saying support this, I'm hypothesizing. government would probably heavily subsidize get go along. We’ve always way country, took year bring light. people going refuse Covid vaccine, they’re gonna take kind morality treatment. want find specific result. want published. hard get negative results published many marijuana studies done important share data people waste time redoing them. america reacted covid sad honestly Close two days ""deep clean"" essentially sanitation theater. Everyone point knows indoor air person person transmission seems efficient way virus spread. Sanitizing area week prolong exposure positive members pony show. dog too. stay home mom planning return workforce fall youngest enters K. job searching work home positions in-person school. also massive marital problems planning divorce. issues top pandemic worries over-the-top stressed. 

But feel like one lucky moms, probably am. Moms *struggling* right now; somehow entire debacle got put backs. course care them. curious. orphan? grew abusive household? Americans gave shit broke euros say think Europeans slam Iran, Brazil, Russia, China, South Africa?

or going focus USA? curious objective hate is. 8 years lot person. Go look photo 8 years ago. Sorry laughed.... Yet, acknowlege science part deny wearing mask denying science claiming covid fake news.  agree 100%. fact Americans, can’t put aside bullshit safety others, atrocity. mask save others. It’s literally easiest thing still can’t it. It’s embarrassing another level. never lose control sides. Granted, Sweden's death rate increasing really badly? relatively low infection rate. part problem. pandemic?  Americans say Covid-19 revealed Europe ""just retarded ever""  fair it’s easier control smaller pop less geographically large diverse area. Here, I’ll cut CA govt slack. TX Fla governments need much more. Wait holdup open schools rn?! I’m buddy.

I read first thought was— anyone surprised?

Donald Trump election four years ago caught “hook, line, sinker” describing molests women hot mix took credit for. Sadly, that’s even worst IMO.

I found “""You know else say people? polls, say loyal people. ever see that? could stand middle Fifth Avenue shoot somebody wouldn’t lose voters, okay? It’s like incredible,"".

He said voters still follow day. told uncertain terms— “I could commit murder idiots still believe ever say”.

Exactly! Remember this, doomers! People still managed go baseball games 1919 zero worries! year flu rigmarole. Unfortunately, US' response pandemic heavily influenced current discord country. see three main factors here:

1. Wealth disparity US. personal opinion (I'm far expert) term really used describe fact US becoming oligarchy, laws passed best, end hurting poorer section society disproportionately, worst, favoring richer section. consequence there's every growing gap opportunities. People feeling hard daily lives. 

2. Existing social media allows messaging spread like wildfire country. Everyone unrestricted platform, regardless veracity message. used effectively misdirect frustration people feel due #1 above. 

3. leaders government interested using division political gains, helping root cause. Specifically, helps rhetoric political groups operating extremities ideological spectrum most, precisely problem (#1) non-partisan one, affected people ranging across political boundaries.

The pandemic unfortunately spun ploy started ""deep state"", which, again, bought folks affected #1.

This obviously opinion; concede folks cannot follow guidelines would take away ability survive. think he'd advise revising numbers reflect positive outcome. Maybe reality, positive. definition ""they"". Texans deserve this. see, words meanings, example Earth, meaningful. putting words together sentences makes connect changes adds meanings knowledge. sometimes someone put lot meanings context verbiage together convey astute sense purpose, leads vortex understanding. need open eyes, mind, keep hand wallet opposite want. burden grasping convey alone.  /satire think may referring SUNY/CUNY schools. know people attend ( Hunter &amp; Stonybrook), it’s gonna 50/50 classes person (namely labs studio classes) &amp; online. know Stonybrook also letting students dorm fall.  trying say wE'rE NuMbEr onE!

Even benefit lot hindsight managed royally fuck things up. I'm gonna get sad ending Jesus plan.

And plan corona virus. many died? seeing posts social media week people early lecturing others wear mask ones partying without one. Many starting get complacent letting guard down.  long enough time wait? 1 year, 2?

I'm apprehensive feel like living constant fear already stressful enough would likely tempted get first available. Same. love getting away people hiding wild. work anywhere, need active cellular connection times (although 'surface' ocassionally pull data).

I think virtue signal thing. spreading coronavirus people want shame us home. yes right damn thinks like this? share TV films hours, replays peak times. not. Quite European countries higher deaths per 1million people US What's me? ;-)

The two sources WIKI lists Neither says anything excess deaths. clearly look them. CDC agrees claim wiki excess deaths people article suggests 1957 pandemic, deadlier someone 5 someone 10-50. mortality 65 higher age group. read book earlier year, seemed prophetic. found Q conspiracists(I refuse call theorists going bother connecting dots), even know them.

The NYC response send old people hospital back retirement homes set worst cluster deaths we've seen yet. would federal government stop that?

Aside total lock else could done? 

High risk individuals elderly advised take extra precautions.

A strong point. get link research states men insecure masculinity. 

And get stats men wearing less masks.

And called expert linking together (Not even actually, author article cuts pastes stuff together research fit narrative). Without proof causal link them.

He uses phrases ""Masks caught eternal battle men versus masculinity"" make point.

But 0 actual research proving hypothesis.

&amp;#x200B;

Even research link, read, talking qualities considered manly: "" single answer:The qualities shift change across time culture,depending changes larger economic, political, social structures. Sociologist Michael Kimmel (2006), example, notes specific meanings manhood America change across time, underlying need prove masculinity remained constant throughout history. ""

So yeah, men need prove masculinity research link, states know qualities actually vary economic, social political level. tell me, claim know fact men react global pandemic likes seen 100 years?

But article, answer clear: ""Men insecure masculinity. Men infected. Ergo: Men want wear masks insecure""

They take many shortcuts prove biased point view.

&amp;#x200B;

They also state "" adulthood, men expected demonstrate “real man” status eschewing femininity behavioral, linguistic, emotional repertoires ""

So simply start claiming reason men wearing masks women are? see ridiculous simply invent causality stuff without research back up? 18 year old wants drive 100 miles hour generation would 99? actually 8k first week August 7 day dropping. CDC plain terrible stuff. random dumbass could see case count peaked start month deaths would peak soon. English teacher (who learned lot from), who'd send back copyedited memos. could usually cut 50% zero loss meaning.

Iceland vs USA? Even Germany 1/4th population landmass 1/10th size. Europeans call Americans fragile inconsiderate many also poorly? Sounds like projection Europeans nothing better shit US non-stop. Jesus fucking Christ.

This needs front center every time people say something dumb like ""people want doctors socialized healthcare make lot money.""

no absolutely fucking med school longer cripples decades don’t know need “revealed,” inconsiderate. We’ve earned reputation long time many countries tourists frequent. life begin?

But take seriously. immune system fucked made 19 year old twin daughters move covid picking-up steam. Since 19 year olds best thing around sneeze away death. Sure, hugging Italian Chinese descent started outbreak Italy, got got I’m sure would ever even consider good idea. mean come even chicago went online know come projection, say it.

The people wear masks people would exactly mentioned. micromanage world large slightest infraction, probably record post (insert blog type here),and make multiple facebook posts shaming person question. pets carry virus? see dog exempt? know rats, rabits animals carriers. firm like CDC checked out? hitler Kids project feelings insecurity self-hatred onto others especially people know enjoy fame, success, admiration. 

It's jealousy ugly human nature. bubble, full contact sport, lots players per team. give October/November. Stay mad New York deaths literally anywhere else word worst South, sunbelt, Midwest (which already passed) never get even close bad Northeast. kind person fan President Camacho ironically.  could wrong, think Americans happy Trump's attitude toward Canada (or be, bothered pay attention happened). Hopefully around much longer foul things up. I'm sure he'll better Trump. point America needs radical change. problem festering since Reagan gotten worse every years.

And Biden man radical change.

Obama promised hope change. America instead got ACA - minor improvement, one still left America far worst healthcare developed world - usual fossil fuel/war/Wall Street bullshit.

The lot poorest 50% deteriorated every year since Reagan Obama left hanging dry.

And Biden even man Obama was.

What sorry bunch losers Democrats been. 

Yes, Republicans far far far worse, evil fucking bastards, Democrats failed put good resistance _since Reagan elected 1980_.

I really cared one major political figure US politics. Everyone else ended carrying water 0.1%.

So glad left. Thats problem pandemic people never understand. 

If take serious, obvious hospital admissions death. 

If take serious, feel like reacting. California pretty well early put good policies place. 

However, governor eventually caved immense business pressure allowed things open much fast. could avoided proper federal support policies like Europe put place keep people employed businesses afloat. States resources things like that; feds do.

Instead, people DC wasted trillions bailouts stock market told everyone else get fucked. I'd love Europe say ""we once, that's takes"" Imagine genuinely insane person this. world would truly better place without folks like that.  Much appreciated! Considering schools across country rushed reopening seeing outbreaks, entirely reasonable. there’s anything trumps base cares politics, it’s football Yes expect read write speeches. like 16 year old would expected school. literally even words, puppet. two ideas equivalent

People think schools MUST open say kids need education delayed

People think schools MUST stay remote say unknown, non-zero number kids educators DIE schools reopen

We take time formulate better plan remote learning, reopen countless kids, families, educators sickened killed, it’s bit late “plan” fix governor, Jared Polis, excellent job encouraging mask use, social distancing, testing. posted [an AMA announce governor reddit back I've following ever since seemed like normal sane person. drops hospitalizations people dying released? awful Ms Milano, right doctors better figuring still yet discovered pre-existing condition leads poor woman’s symptoms, well symptoms long haulers.

If one bit good come pandemic, it’s figuring someone like Milano Nick Cordero, totally healthy, known pre-existing conditions, die suffer months months majority cases are, words doctor, “the worst 2 week flu entire fucking life”. Countries without travel bans seem done ok well. Korea, far know, never banned flights China, seemed done pretty well. 

&amp;#x200B;

  Korea**  [April travelers entering South Korea must undergo 14-day quarantine. Travelers “long-term residential” may self-quarantine residences, “most foreign travelers short-term travel” quarantine government-designated facility expense 14 days.  [South restricted entry travelers passports China’s Hubei Province well anyone visited region previous 14 days. Korean visas issued travelers Hubei canceled.  entry Jeju Island foreigners, well visa-free entry Chinese nationals travelers headed China, suspended.

Since China bully flight restrictions, SK never put official ban February, flights getting cancel airlines. understand situation. point medical professionals work environment, course access N95s. schools option virtual only, given backing federal government support families can't afford work outside home. reality schools open opening in, teachers school staff suffer die. Kids suffer small percentage die. avoidable, federal government taking actions. State government pushing responsibility county. county pushing responsibility school districts' superintendent school boards unqualified making decisions like this. guidelines provided constitutes uncontrollable outbreak schools move virtual. Everyone flying solo little concrete guidance. Basically fever dream. Yep. live PA, I’m shocked amount older people see every day wearing masks, talking closely one another, hanging restaurants. leaving apartment walking car day, older gentleman (I’m guessing 70s) walking well ahead me. waited 30 seconds hold door fumbled around mask bag put approached him. kind gesture, risky unnecessary wonder break down? Like, United Great Lakes States America, United Atlantic States America, United Pacific States America?

Who would get nukes ships stuff? Didnt say people dont they're lazy. know one guy spent $40,000 cars last 4 5 years. He'll get car $10,000, drive bit. Put thousand it, trade $2,000. says can't afford house. know people that.  There's mass downvote brigading goes nearly everywhere Reddit re: submission many comments show Swedish strategy negative light. fact, kind mass downvoting happens anywhere there's option social media (such youtube). quite remarkably consistent. Occasionally posts Reddit break out, check submission history see Sweden downvoted oblivion. Eh, much thing Orlando. grew nearby, there's like two hour swing sunset time solstices, they're pretty far south.

Moving north summer sunset 10p winter sunset 4p blew little brain. move goal posts?

Wheres study mate? first mistake treating state like monolith. Orange Country example governed five member board directors - 4 members republican 1 democrat third highest case count entire state (39k + cases). 

To go state second - Pennsylvania Democrat Governor, local county (Lancaster run republicans) gave businesses green light open despite Governor's lock order still effect. 

Local government matters fight well many places suffering local leadership task takes keep people safe. Yeah point making Ain't truth. we're 6 months pandemic Florida still trying figure fuck do. That's called ""not handling correctly."" You’ll pleased know least one unelected official plan let virus spread amongst democratic areas, forgetting we’re interconnected also it’s insane let people die. know company, Dollar General town mask sign front one employees chin someone asked customers wear one, said worry it. Fewer people going out, fewer people afraid they've infected, thus fewer people getting tested. positivity rate scary note 7 day rolling average confirmed new cases going down, number deaths per day.

There certainly cases going unnoticed, people staying home rather going even much required get tested, worrisome - death numbers going down, pretty evident overall numbers fact going rather rise number people choosing bother testing.

But better believe spike TX election... there's opt mail voting here. absentee (only town) disability ONLY. Everyone else vote person. are. POTUS picking fight 15 years old twitter followers threaten teenage HS girl. think anyone alive 90's legitimately claim Gates selfless. Janet Reno throw anti-trust lawsuit nothing. sure, he's game, focus changed improving world.

Sure he's objectively better person Trump, that's really low bar clear. Well honest, spiderman kid Oh,I understand people sad events cancelled. I’m surprised many parents willing protest closing schools reasons.
I would like think health safety students teachers would priority formals pep rallies.

Maybe I’m different,because never thought prom major life event. I’m college now,and never really think anymore. call pneumonia rather COVID-19.

^hope ^that ^helps know ""first world country"" is? killing grandma also lasting effects Lmao that's argument actually mine sure, provides insight minds pandemic value structure. person weighted (ha) important everyone else. Wear mask! Shut everything! diabetic three hundred pound older might catch flu! sure mean certain groups people exist every state. spread well back spring U.S. simply get testing together point? really see delay proper reactions.  Jesus fucking Christ. people aren’t Christians. $1200 + electric actual, real shut mitigate virus fine anyone breaking guidelines shut fined. there’s that. economy stay shit decimated control. let’s fix right time. Oh wait, leader coordinate national response. toddler instead cares self rich friends. Idk anyone thinks economy coming back like this. honestly think necessary explain idea US, country matter, going ""lose"" ""first world country status"" absolutely ridiculous.

I suspect prior comment reflects opinion person idea ""first world country"" actually means.  Yes :( Yup, attack people, ideas. waive BLM ""marxists"" without even getting discussion racism. punish children dont skills kids?

Instead allowing students flunk skills, perhaps actually start teaching children creating reasonable inclusive assessments.

My god dumbest species. OAN Science, epidemiology, hundreds years direct experience pandemics, common sense dictates bad idea. smoke pumping gas? walk across street without checking traffic?

If announced going take 20 visitors random string outside Sturgis die slowly rally, many would go?

It *it lie/it happen me/I controlled* childish mindset reinforced shitty leadership playing votes enables stupidity. difference states basically intentionally killing populations.

Texas Florida combined combined deaths NY over, happen whatsoever. open bars month pandemic. specifically trying say teams consider Michigan rival way around. simply untrue, except maybe case MSU. Michigan considered top 2-3 rivals Wisconsin, Minnesota, Notre Dame Penn State. Shows much enemy media is. carelessly word like people would jump think she’s dumb horrible person. post like 15 times day. friends?  Yes No. 

I'm usually pretty stir crazy winter, especially small child. I'm looking forward cooler fall weather spend time outdoors. purchasing really good cold weather clothes kid spend winter outside too. plan nature walks, identifying trees stay green feeding fish local lake. Also plan starting summer garden seed soon can. 

So hopefully, better us year little world. Currently hot can't enjoy outdoors much anyways. figure prepare mentally, it'll better. make year, lay low we'll getting back normal know it. Surprised username isn’t already taken work in-home sales rep, literally going random people's homes 2-3 hours time. wear mask Everytime, sanitize samples sanitize hands before/after appointment.

Probably 1/15 people wear mask I'm home, completely shocking care considering many homes visit sales rep I’m Mississippi people don’t give shit. Lots stopped wearing masks. We’re truly fucked something worse Covid comes around, Americans first die mass millions. “but muh rights!”. yet. remember right end August early September always astonishes Americans little look countries. trust government COVID? Fine. really think pretty much every government world lying? Seriously, shofar? one ""instrument"" rivals annoying sounds vuvuzela. ass-hats annoying enough. actually believe ever privacy laws. hahaha. reality. never was. cell phone tht 97% percent humans tracked. Whaaaa. never said solution. 

Frankly, America put position frankly ambivalent get out.

Let world quarantine US fix mean trending cases hospitalizations miles away deaths per capita so...  actually think NY might able handle school opening.

Many Asian countries reopened schools. Masks, testing, tracing, etc. think NYC pieces place. Nice call back. I’ll tell it’s unstoppable:

1. US thinks they’re greater every country.

2. greed unmatched. It’s easy senators retreat million dollar estates unlimited supplies air conditioning, rest country cooks heat fights scraps.

The American dream one toxic mind controlling devices world ever endured.

In fact, 99% people reading right now, know, you’ll never Jeff Bezos. “dream,” select few. Abolishing slavery? Please, barely notices costs workforce, lol. It’s modern slavery bought it. wish people would stop posting countries awesome numbers. I’m ashamed American. need keep showing morons bad comparison.   well, Europe 3 million cases. ""Don't both?
¿Porque los dos? Yeah, stand that? Middlemen make profit, hold delivering. can't deliver, boo fucking hoo.  This...ass teeth SMH take like year actually get everyone, that's effective 50%. dont wife health care worker. Went local doctor bought sort rapid machine sit back room back 15 minutes. said normaly results day getting tested since works hospital went ahead run test. Meanwhile coworker went another doctor across town send test took 9 days. local hospital takes 3 days run tests batches. 
Moral story call around different places take different times. someone would love visit canada America....just shut til spring. goes everyone. see then. numbers become mere statistics now. Sad Religion big part America shite. I'm immuno-supressed need register mail-in avoid COVID. told boyfriend day didnt even think necessary mail ballot trump fucking mail system somehow vote labeled fraud shit. 

Boyfriend replies: ""well trump got exactly wanted- feeling powerless dont even try"". 

I shut up. I'll mail god damnit. Wow, discussing topic recently. much worse thought, would 30/40% refusing vaccinate. don’t get 42% got source back lil chump? Go 300 million Would get really nasty here, better solution would make financial assistance contingent compliance COVID rules Hope everything works out. similar experience GFs mom. taking care dying dad past year regularly flying Oklahoma. last (even though GF told fucking stupid travel especially hot spot) sister, living tested positive. Instead quarantining getting test started whining allowed see dad people unfair.

After convincing quarantine bit came back Colorado proceeded take son (GFs brother) visit university Wyoming. even tried swing visit us way there, GF it, stupid stubborn understand serious situation is.

Anyway good luck, hope things start going way soon. almost completely usual me. go work like normal. get drive eat outside restaurant. went vacation. places could eat inside wanted.

Most changed wearing mask whenever public eating and/or drinking keeping distance people, avoiding hotspots trip. Thanks sharing details links! username check out. H_E_R_O. really change though. 

I remember watching TV interview interview republican coal miners received treatment due covered ACA. 

Although express varying degrees thankfulness getting treatment, certain number still persist original mindset ACA. NY deaths essentially NY city deaths...Does rest country 8 million people living tiny tiny little group islands? Aussies! Australia manpower annex whister time wants.  send COVID data. I’ll take care it. turns wear masks congregate outdoors, risk transmission low. sure shit good news like Lmao anyone believes drivel belongs Facebook grandma. common cold actually often rhinovirus. Also think we'll thing matter 6 months Comment day right here. Depenz crowd go  now...  watch video linked? common cold coronavirus, never faded away, vaccine. know people need hope, truth arms around long time, certainly longer single year. muh freedumbs!!! idiotic people make best systems suck Uneforced mask policies inventing legal cover. ""We required masks, cannot held responsible"".

They could care less actual enforcement. Lmao, Ben Shapiro's secret feet account NZ? Completely locked away outside world, airlines stay alive without massive subsidies. Regional flights still fine, basically equivalent highways America mountains, fact it’s 2 main islands. people go work them, would horrible stopped logic nonsensical. simply agree statement, billionaire's social media constitutes principal source reliable information. worth, find individual straightforwardly acknowledges direness pandemic lot trustworthy somebody spews blatant misinformation somebody calls hoax. can't ""recommendations"". People give shit. enforced mandatory. mandatory mask-wearing indoors, crack parties, close high-risk venues, we'll locked early Fall. bullshit US incredible. endlessly think wtf wrong people. know wearing mask numerous hours (Due moisture), cause rash irritants, sensitive enough put barrier cream. Seriously though, choose wear one, walk around nose exposed wearing chin. make one fit face constantly touching it. would take account increase populations. theory every year deaths rise given day assuming population growing past 50 years. That's thoughtfully stated... Thank you, I'lll use reminder patient others.xo 20.3% positivity, quite possible election day anyone left infect. anyone know, that's terrifying idea. :( man! himself, said young man! put mask face, stay home! Until. This. Virus. Fucking.

You’re right echo chamber. hoping two us friends outside Reddit.

I live liberal area people know already voting blue sound mind made mind vote third party.  Yeah every country asserted thier independence. literally nothing special unique us thing. Relearn wrong word. knows walk, muscles support anymore. 69 days laying = muscle atrophy. tried dance Seattle go downtown get license like $275 nearly 20 years ago! care. We're fucked. too. it’s really difficult. It’s quite frustrating :/ Difference caution, fear. afraid media saying. cautious. There's difference one extreme moderate. moderate. We're good. We're track exponential growth infections. People partying, barely anyone wearing mask, barely anyone social distancing. [Infectious disease modeller predicts big spike B.C. COVID cases \[by September that's funny considering I'm exact opposite everything mentioned. keeping faith mean faith facts accept true indeed true, sure faith given scientific understandings.


look, none us certain we're correct anything. reason, makes sense advocate believe (aligning scientific understanding) also holding onto notion may incorrect. that's sets us apart people mentioned. ITT: people gleefully painting Americans broad brush. 

Get fucked. 

Signed, large number Americans *are* wearing masks, *are* social distancing, *are* trying act responsibly whole debacle. Covid kill people WW2. dangerous anything else there. thought letting whatever feel part problem though Idk 300 lb nfl linemen today incredible physical specimens. two scoops mashed potatoes arms ruled nfl 70’s. 200 lbs skinny fats regular America. I'd suggest reading guidelines governor's website. rush back like places. Sounds like nickname given coworkers due young accomplished. know. I'm seeing lot jobs places like grocery stores pharmacies Tinsel looking bit tarnished, Micky Mouse got Covid...The Matrix collapsed every U citizen see scam ... ...good luck .. seasonal park ranger(in Oregon) also ex Portland stripper lol. it’s US wackjobs?

NYC Lombardy US. Shock value running dry nowadays. comment proof. Move north Canada. would love ya. 
Lol dont bring rona. Remember Lt Gov said patriotic sacrifice health aging American “economy”? Wonder that’s still tune. would likely explanation assumption fact real discrepancy. HOwever using CDC estimates benchmark comes drawbacks. CDC IFR estimates moving target 0.65% now. gaming? Yep. little scooter years, reliable transportation, number jobs specifically wanted car mind-boggling. 

I can’t even imagine it’d like still rely public transit right now. Nah, would died sodium intake alone. least added 10 pounds water weight. Unfortunately true. people wearing masks, behaving responsibly, people also saying ""YOLO!"" enagaging reckless behaviour. Unfortunately couple dozen yahoos party bus undo hard work thousands reducing cases. things true Canada, every one them, yet we've 120K cases. freak 60 million cases h1n1? masks use back then? reveal much know already.

The USA parading decades centuries, they're land free.

Freedom core value; cultural explanation basically everything.

We universal single payer healthcare? Good, otherwise would enforcing health insurance upon us, want FREEDOM choice.

Scientology churches clearly brainwashing people scamming them? Yeah that's sad deserve FREEDOM rest us.

A war declared abroad? obviously FREE people tyranny.

Etc, etc, etc.

Of course would extremely dishonest claim Americans think way; they're Borgs hive mind.

But would also dishonest see something quite exclusive US.

The minute heard Coronavirus spreading US, predicted going sh*tshow lot Americans would see pandemic measures actions meant save rather attacks personal freedom.

I wish prediction would turned wrong, yet... I'm always saddened Americans vote small percentage voting age population pick President. Voter suppression voter apathy diseases also fighting want healthy America long run. masculinity line always drawn stupidly. Ernest Hemingway, great writer obsessed interpretation manhood, shot couldn’t sustain erection. hand pills that.

Consider following: 


Someone making 50,000$ year can't afford offshore account hide 95% wealth. 


 richest 1% pay [effective federal income tax rate 24.7% 2014;](http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2014/04/who_pays_taxes_in_america_in_2014.php#.U84UG7EYdOg) someone making average $75,000 paying 19.7% rate. That's including fact thousands people make million dollars year pay [zero total income tax, period.](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/08/irs-1470-millionaires-paid-no-income-tax-in-09/1#.XzFvoG1jOC8) 


Averaging total number people making million dollars year, total average taxation millionaire 5%, vs aforementioned 19.7% rate. yes, person making 50,000 year pays taxes someone making 20 million.  Frrrt4 ee4 reef  fucking south managed kill one things love ruin rest us. CFB fan, truly ironic. ONE dying something containable preventable.

Great, spend rest life living bubble. must know, no. didn’t expect one. Someone gave gift, thanked them. Yes.

California Coronavirus Update: Top Health Official Reveals State Underreporting New COVID-19 Cases states accused manipulating bungling COVID-19 data Scientist Says Fired Manipulating COVID-19 Data Massaged Virus Data Reopen, Voided Mask Orders accused fudging bungling COVID-19 testing data hospital data hot mess feds take control pivot new HHS COVID-19 reporting rules meant 'chaos' hospitals Christian here, Christians know mentality “God didn’t give us spirit fear”. “why would afraid going Heaven?” ignorance.

You don’t care die? Fantastic. don’t think neighbor’s rush grave though. Broth gator aid might useful people sick. Okay it’s ridiculous travel Disney world Columbus? Oh, happens definitely learn lesson. got offered go work Washington 6 months, expenses paid etc. ended spending 2 weeks nearly solid personal time coming better option Canada successful.

Not Europeans want go US.
Btw mid 2019. Pre-pandemic question. Good, we're page ""Red Zone"" become ""Dead Zone""? Refusing wear mask petrified people think nadir weakness. men wimps. really big deal high school seniors miss senior prom pep rallies?

""Pop culture depictions high school ruined us"", theory. read headlines assume everything peachy don’t you? Meanwhile, young Korean men know cosmetics average western woman. NFL preseason games cancelled, may start season like MLB issues arise players cancel season, Yup.

Too many states run sales tax instead income tax. Income tax, businesses still generate state letting people work home. jobs work home, true, definitely enough weather storm. Sales tax? Fuck no. Folks spend! get house. utilize local services. keep economy running. State relying sales tax relies means rely people individuals participating economy keep state afloat. 

And means selfish fuckers every reason flaunt federal covid guidelines keep pushing keep states open. Because, design, states cannot operate actual emergency. also avoid condom look masculine. Ffs, wish cow bird deal humans. John Bolton. Gross see newscasters salivating stupid book. Information unfortunately trustworthy. truth really know full scope happening Florida.

1. Reduced testing
2. faulty tests
3. lack quick results,
4. lack reporting VA care facilities
5. accusations data tampering yet investigated
6. complete lack transparency data well collection process.

These first things make anyone seriously interested know whats happening take numbers massive truckload salt.

Truly terrible state affairs.

BTW, first reaction ""see getting better"" remember confirmation bias protect COVID 19, need wear mask , wash hands, social distance much possible, stay home can. people running data religious right ideologues. little science training. “On average, coronavirus accumulates two changes per month genome. Sequencing SARS-CoV-2 genomes helps researchers follow virus spreads. changes don’t affect virus behaves, may change disease’s transmissibility severity. “ changes per month rate infection 3 month ago. Today would double.
Watch India closely, could get 8 changes per month two month. 

The changes predict: 
1) Death rate drop 
2) Longer asymptomatic incubation 
3) Organ damage death long tail 

Kinda like Like Hiv thats still us. vaccine/cure/medication/what-have-you comes covid-19, long take accessible worldwide? Hospitals Texas Florida overwhelmed reason we're seeing deaths 1500k day. 

Is mean say seen hospitals overwhelmed. work hospital surging area? please stop conspiracy? It’s frankly getting annoying comes every thread debunked: find evidence support popular online conspiracy theory switchover CDC system Health Human Services system explains national plateau new coronavirus cases. theory unsupportable: explain below, hospitals report case count testing data federal government, trends data reflected across many different independent sources subject centralized tampering. move. idea vast majority Americans feel need stay there. Grow back bone move. us voted someone else. unique trick election system He...erm...""win"" vote. anyone investigated irregularities oh, apparently \~10% cardiovascular damage, quite old point. learn worse gets  sure fragile inconsiderate ate correct words. Way polite way describe it. Cope EU many countries higher death rates crashed economy, hard talk shit. results Lowest number tests they've run since June. 20% theory true, would huge means need vaccinate fewer people herd immunity. We’ll see plays think part societies failing indicating people live new reality.

It really feel like options ""pretend nothing happening"" ""act like can't leave house"" neither really sustainable long run. basically tried give virus ""suspension""? 2 give expulsion get rid together. many options life can't even get extra $200 pay rent. wife embarrassed married someone can't provide Well, fair, could blow anybody up. However, might seen inconsiderate help perceptions. ;)

We actually blow stuff regular kinds countries, I'm pretty sure people living think inconsiderate us so.  true. Mississippi leads nation positive covid tests. That's funny children decades. kids stood front Congress gave speeches civil rights movement, yea wrote themselves. Sadly ton people area allowing children play sports right now. sad kinda embarrassing. I'm embarrassed parents lack understanding (or caring) virus. Sure kids die even healthy ones dying, would really want take chance? It’s surprise country SARS discovered first contained well time around. lucky decent sized yard ""get house"" piddle get sun. Driving grocery pickup enough madness 14,500 nuclear weapons planet, Russia United States lion’s share, combined total approximately 13,350 nukes. Good agree muricans dumb, chinese happen liberate pandemics every couple decades shits giggles. Nobody deserves threats something like this. care side on, threatening someone going cause panic, distrust fear. saying kids masks get threats. fuck would do? threaten one person threaten others? Maybe kids parents enough mask, know people's lives. Paid $100 rest, got result 2 days later. coworkers’ free tests, took 10 days. Yeah, one really get context hearing numbers quoted every day, gets normalised, perhaps someone publish figures reference. People fully isolating caves stuff said thing. crazy human body mind adapt point wanting leave isolation period over. everytime group fox news disciples gets shown they're wrong feel threatening child's life alright? bit assholeish high levels too... football players/coaches lot harder replace regular students Bingo. ....for approximately 4 weeks. Won’t take long things start going sideways (again). 1-800-trudeau shame Jesus weigh specifically felt men openly brag sexually assaulting women. PrOVE It! 

Prove Eurotrash progressive scum bucket Preach bro. wear mask outside home car. disposable gloves shopping carts.

I look weak. look alive intend keep way. Guess wore masks spring summer talk like epidemiologist. you? it’s enough. people complying put complying-but-having-to-work virus’ way. 

Some us trying hard, actions negating efforts.

As usually, doesn’t take effort destroy, takes lots effort build. CUNT tight 

Kind disparaging there, Karen  Definitely lie anyone moving foreign country, especially prospective employer. know anything EU visa process business culture there, claim true, sounds like kind lie saves 15 seconds uncomfortable moment risk hours days headache covering later. saying south part insult. guess thinking terms something like ""minor league baseball player michael jordan"" something. possible midsouth promotion relevant time wwe. years prime years wrestling viewing Bruce Lee died aspirin, exceptions make rule. Less testing. Florida almost cut testing half. California reported last week reporting software showing accurate counts....still resolved. Speaches class one thing.

Speaches World leaders quite another. Yeah exactly; faith God protect good little control situation, purposely putting danger saying “hey God catch save this” wrong doesn’t work. case pandemic, right way you’d follow CDC/ guidelines much pray God helps get infected despite precautions; wrong way go crowded places without mask shake people’s hands basically pretend everything normal, you’re “immune” virus. That’s God viruses work. Mid February actually places US wearing masks properly now, hear ones don't. wish people would hurry die, get things. Oh well I'd start worrying getting better dying instead many opinions life 😂 Brazil second worst also Trump's fault? pin number things man politicizing literally everything toward ""Trump bad"" remotely productive. force idiots wear masks. certainly done *capable* of.

On second thought, yeah, probably even done much. Definitely same.

Keep schools open group: fail consider virus.... distancing... masks... alternate days... lots (which disproportionately effects immigrant poor communities).

Keep schools open group: fail consider single family households, food, rent... lots more.  (which disproportionately effects immigrant poor communities)

Like said, incompetent embarrassment.

Edit: need solution works middle class white family parents living home, family living one income. honestly say want “better work/life balance.” Europeans pretty proud that. 

My husband use work 60hr weeks US. Since moved EU, works max 40hr/week he’s still working longer hours colleagues. That's rest world used show Americans. America blew away Iraq War

What odd sentiment. everything Iraq consent (and help) Allies. Ive provided sources every fact, provided one aliens going find us now? Pointing someone's inconsistencies misleading bullying. I'm betting take well criticism you? hypocrisy people ☝️being anti-protest much. pretty damn close some, assume, good people Sorry, part entirely untrue. work small pharmacy, boss. gotten heated debate heated debate. Nothing changing mind. I've showed stats, videos, journals, articles, studies, name it. keeps saying masks dangerous conspiracy puppet Masters tighten grip.

People think bad flu/ hoax/ conspiracy constantly move goalposts believe believe. human nature defend beliefs. think there's many people saying ""I thought fake, me/family member got it""? get crackpot theories backing already incorrect views, get empowered. pandemic hit 20 years ago, guarantee situation internet echo chamber misinformation. Oh care alright. FrEeDoM!!¡¡!¡ /s think NY back blows mind downvoted..

&amp;#x200B;

/r/coronavirus filled news articles pictures people wearing masks top comment always ""Lol people fucked...we sooooo FUCKED""

Your comment sentiment....I dunno upvoted comment thread. That’s work did, found someone tested positive assured us everything sanitized even defogged building feel safe going work. worst part tried explaining didn’t give fuck moreso fact working next someone idea long. didn’t seem care gotta stay open matter 

You're worth arguing with, idiot. I've told reality. unprepared face that, worth speaking to. assuredly not. TX FL halfway epidemic already surpassed 50% NY's death rate higher case count per capita. mistaking timeline lag better  disagreed, said nothing gave bad advice public, upset represented agreeing them, stood official capacity made announcements? Real profile courage there. wish confident you.

Hell, even **if** get affordable &amp; safe vaccine (and I'm hella skeptical affordable bit), sizable portion Americans even get bullshit read facebook! mean, could use police keep doorsteps...

No, hit around 15% start come down. happening world one wants believe it. 

Look places like Pakistan Afghanistan places Africa shut economy, shot up, shot down. eerie similar lot curves are. place like Philippines looking like smashed it, highest mask wearing world, yet reached inevitable. **7-Day Avg Positivity Rate 20.3%** 

That number horrifying. BYD 3-ply ones made melt-blown fiber center layer. mask meets ATSM F2100 level 1 yes, I'd trust home-made fabric face coverings.

You disagree that’s fine. What? could say thing. Spain, France, Netherlands, Croatia, several European countries seeing surges cases. Reopenings mean cases, whether Europe US Japan. think anything changed treatment side past couple weeks Florida deaths started spiking. Depends distribution trial, age, race, conditions. Phase II done predominantly young white patients. Even then, 30,000 vs 300+ million (US population)... talking less 0.01%. 20.3%. high rate unless literally 1/5 population infected testing extreme cases. believe literally 1/5 population infected, means testing WAY little. parents got tickets see Black Jacket Symphony (figured may mean) AL April. bought pandemic really got full going.

The virus give single fuck agreement part safety bubble. Stop trying rules lawyer viruses. Dr. Gottlieb made interesting comment yesterday Face Nation. said we've always assumed adversaries release respiratory pathogen biological weapon fear blowback population. noted foreign countries may change mind given US handled pandemic. thought really interesting, I'd never thought standpoint national security. Finger Lakes region checking ... watching Cuomo tweet daily numbers, stagnant. Active cases declining sure, drop 80,000 tomorrow that’s awesome. every day new cases, hospitalizations deaths hovering. It’s weeks every day number new cases same.

Record low infection rate today, awesome! hell break cycle start making things BETTER again? think able travel, see live music, go games next year. Right? Like obvious best choice safety, economic recovery. opposite progress congress. People like say, ""What think Hillary could done better?""

Well, certainly done fucking worse. That's actually disgusting. easy actually take measures prevent spread virus remember Sanja Gupta, Atlanta medical consultant CNN, saying first disinfected things coming home learned spread stopped that. that's good enough me. Someone may thought, thousand people already I’m 1.001 citation!!!! False positives real-but anywhere near enough false positives account troves COVID cases there. science dogmatically limit discussion confirmed cases know fact cases. Look one analysis CDC. exact number show extent undercounted cases Man rough. Sorry hear USA! USA! USA! WE'RE NUMBER ONE! WE'RE NUMBER ONE! suppose ironic?

How far fast fallen country. protests allowed? tried warn people. mocked us relentlessly. thought fascist government would keep safe. think test enough even hide stuff?  Lmao come spend 2 weeks holed hotel. Top quality holiday right Good Albuquerque. hope rewarded continuing low rates infection. think lot people used think tomorrow like today today like yesterday something extraordinary happens can't process it.

Back february, anticipated coming hit us almost everybody still unaware, swear found wondering really happening descending madness. Herd Immunity works! pregnant woman whose told doctor there’s evidence support Covid dangerous pregnant women terrifies me.

You continue cautious (social distance, mask, etc), live terror essentially Facebook post actual medical professional advising otherwise. AstraZeneca firm saying may SEEK approval September. Since failed start trials US unlikely FDA get approval.

Moderna Pfizer may submit EUA approval Ocotober. 3 candidates require 2 shots month apart.

Absolute best case could start vaccination late October. Considering 2 shots month apart even able 1 million day would take till Christmas 10% vaccinated. 

It's going happen. Including guys: Also "" dems new hoax."" secret bubble protected death destructions counting money shit like this. greatest fear amongst New Yorkers, assume, people state coming part large gatherings (let's say, state students FL, GA, TX, CA, etc... attending colleges open Fall). 1 state case become 10 community transmission cases 2 weeks lecture hall 100 people. need kids educated need. Post coronavirus people SERBIA need workups. Got thanks. aren’t businesses US taking temps entry? 

At gym take temps entry feel much comfortable places. you’re gonna bit everybody’s temps taken, right?

They screened temps like crazy China helped even asymptotic spreaders. course masks. say wasn't? isnt logical. Teen suicides keep happening even return school, greater numbers. 1) Kids dont go school still social life. 2) fact, school interactions lead online bullying leads suicides. 3) CDC director controlled administration. iPhone tried mobile get entire article. don’t suggestions. I’m sorry. want employee bars, concerts, etc. hotel campground grocery store anywhere else people area going congregating, absolutely, 100% guaranteed spreading Covid. mostly spreading among themselves, they'll carrying back communities. shit illegal, definitely stupid hell. wish lasted longer could there, sick travel home (provided locals hole avoid them, obviously). they'll rolling back hometowns time seed new wave infection. second paragraph explains ""analysis impact nation’s economy **immediate period two years** following vote leave "" strictly adhering literal meaning exactly two years vote (6/23/2016 6/23/2018) predictions:

GDP: predicted -3.6%, actual +6% 
Real wages: predicted -3%, actual +1% 
**Pound: predicted -12%, actual -13%** 
**Inflation: predicted +2 points, actual +1.5 points** 
Home values: predicted -10%, actual +7%

So seems get predictions unbelievably wrong, they? hope rest come true next year, surprised. suppose still say ""but *at exactly 2 years* unbelievably wrong 4 predictions!"" kind executives get top jobs Dollar Tree? bottom barrel saver everyone respect viewpoint keep mind that’s ultra worst case scenario vaccine doesn’t work terrible side effects (which uncommon outside right injection) today, Sweden performance NY State terms daily deaths way better performance terms daily cases. 

Do think Sweden alright? all, deaths per million third NY. country would ok many people caring life mother's womb people caring life inside it. pay (with lives.) telling don’t need mask situations.

That back January, February. Meantime, people research, outlined article. 

CDC, Faucci changed stance since. recommend masks, along physical distancing etc. take lives, never take freedom

-America reading lot pandemic histories lately think you’re bang on; every single one seems vocal naysayers outright conspiracy theorists. It’s oddly reassuring it’s something us that’s recently gone awry age social media something. gonna isolate 5 years? still isn’t Spanish flu, matter many times that’s virus Reddit heard Part severity must walking around huge viral loads without mask many tests done?

For comparison, Ontario, province population 15 millions, 79 positive cases yesterday. 27,000 people tested. Criminals also sent America, especially South. colleges look things cut; going football/Basketball. Expect swimming, diving, sports get cut. I'd imagine bigger outrage arresting church goers arrest homeless black man Nashville, masks refused wear warned multiple times. Curious: headlines?  Save next milestone. find eye opening depressing seeing amount stupid people coming woodwork pandemic

especially since you’re seeing result russian psyops deployed united states. already rolling dice unvaccinated

I'm isolating.  really good odds. Unfortunately anti mask wearers wont get vaccine endangers cannot take it, take risk potential side effects working all, number people wont get either fast tracked. vaccine isnt solution, people need stop damn selfish wear mask. Good them. gatherings legal church too. 4?! Lololololololololololololol. Yeah right. Coronavirus different parameters diseases mention. Also fully understand covid-19 consequences. may
Disappear. might become something „like flu“. also well
Possible masks / distance etc new normal stores, transport etc. Time tell. makes sense stay catious degree. contact trace US situations can't get peoples' names way track without names? What's like there?

I casual wrestling fan late 90s. I've always gotten massive narcissist vibe Jericho, mean gimmick. Dude seems really himself. Wanting front man corny rock band totally consistent that.  Viruses cull herd. Taking, large part, weak stupid. feel sorrow compassion weak. feel nothing stupid save sense impatience wait virus take them. going do, raid church arrest congregation? would long, costly fight.

To think years ago many praised fact police Feds enter churches arrest undocumented citizens. I’ve read small counties states many cases day try say due delayed reporting. Pretty much. I'm vaccinations ill wait months either way *""Hundreds millions disappeared pockets deputy assistant associate athletic directors administration, conference commissioners commission commissions Nick Saban’s corporate-welfare army “football analysts.”""*

Ok, description made lol. scroll up, replied comment looking Virginia department health's website. exactly right. report tested positive, contacted Virginia department health verify first three letters first last name along date birth cross check test results. verify fact test positive, give pin number enter app location information released.

New Zealand pretty much completely open point, large events, all.

All need carefully manage anyone comes country. pretty easy country geography. anyone else still quarantining? feels like me.

Mary Poppins show give everyone sugar.  everyone immune every disease also taller, stronger, smarter, better looking, able dance unison everyone street.

Lol, think going happen?  bunch people spreading covid school shuts down.  question many days take, might well start betting pool. It’s screwed many levels. many people, including VA patients, get prescriptions via mail. many small businesses rely mail. Rural communities don’t alternatives USPS.

It breaks heart think vets can’t get meds. lot drugs meant stopped immediately, people suffer withdrawal worse sudden discontinuation.  didn’t spread fully agree Holy cow, I'm sorry. 😳

No, throw whole family away find new family. come conclusion redeeming people. Correct. think adding negativity universe going help situation resolve. happen lmao, real life Disney. think situations like keep coming up, every part human history, dictatorships keep happening one learns anything, that's human minds work change, part humanity dumb shit maybe get hopes doubting chance source this? also privileged think easy rewire entire relationship food, learn nutrition, learn like healthy options, stick diet exercise without visible changes extended amounts time, maintaining normal life.

Losing weight getting healthy fucking hard. even harder conditioned eat trash knowledge eat well. It’s crazy people don’t understand mild case basically knocking deaths door. haven’t personally, know people got “mild cases” thing separated mild case life death getting tube stuck throat breathing you. even you’re debating wether would better dealing mild case. It’s fucking nuts... sure cases don’t feel thing.. people don’t seem understand severity all! 

Also saying theory wrong. I’m sure people think that. Lol  Yes whataboutism. current issue unrelated reply (covid vs pedo), know they're searching anything ""whatabout""

Basically they'll look next topic makes sense derail conversation to, soon one debunked loses steam, choose next one. That's see topic making less less sense time, okay ones already used. I'm sorry.  NHL NBA going well, leagues use bubble works likely become shit show Americans come in, Canada decently. Yeah, three Brazil objectively badly US (with similar per capita infection death rate). Russia 1/3 infection rate 1/5 death rate US, Iran 1/4 infection rate less 1/2 death rate. necessarily trust numbers coming Russia Iran, can't hide hospitals getting overwhelmed. fair trust numbers coming US either. covered insurance Oxford MAY seek EUA September. yet start trials US. find unlikely FDA approve it. probably limited usage.

We good idea numbers. functionally impossible get vaccinations level reach 10% population Christmas.

There absolutely zero way majority US vaccinated Spring 2021. BEST case scenario.

If vaccines fail. production issues. phase 3 trials inadequate show efficacy (this actually already happened AstraZeneca first phase 3 May) timeline gets pushed back lot.

Also, considering 2 3 phase 3 mRNA vaccines new tech zero approvals zero long term safety data likely mass vaccination mid end 2021.

I’m bummed, I’m glad hear city right thing canceled year. Maybe we’ll try make next year. embarrassment way country divided genuinely costing lives. people say ""that's cost freedom."" cost poor leadership, poor education, &amp; entitlement. problems always existed. greatly magnified. Holy shit! true didn’t get impression all, giving insight 20% thing could happening. saying right schools open back another surge goes beyond 20%. Bad bot. You’re encouraging pandemic Snek hungry though, fair snek That's 'effective' means. means catch virus, get 25% it. instead 2 weeks hell like 4 days significantly lower side effects long term effects. That's means flu vaccines. 75% people immune 25% people aren't. catching 4 hour flight Saturday. safer? Wearing N95 mask bought November used 10 min previously wiped anti-bacterial wipes, KN95 mask bought never used. wearing either mask Face Shield. would even move beginning middle year.

As well, government benefits run soon. People get back norm. SIP prolonged time never viable solution. even able maintain roof heads SIP throughout year. unfair snek! Yea place magically disappear spring....... OP, wife teacher situation. survive income alone long to. 

She doesn’t want quit, also don’t want COVID, soooo... That’s highly debatable. Schools provide way services teaching.

Families kids free reduced lunch plans rely school feed kids.

Schools offer daycare, afterschool programs, etc families parents work put food table.

Not mention health consequences depriving years worth socialization could kids.

Consider sheer fact call “Alt-Right” instead Neo-Confederates. publicly self-identified white nationalists start rebranding, news can’t let get away it. figured game for-profit media gain legitimacy.

But seriously... cannot imagine frustrating conversation was. reroll stats. pineapple weakness. Hate guy that's really really unlikely happen. Half world virus never happened.  Mine’s senile even definitely noticed. Maybe one 10 Americans knows word means, maybe one 20 knows look up. Gotcha, tremendously complicated thing. I'm probably giving thought deserves, sounds like u/DakodaMountainborn saying thing.

For many words, u/DakodaMountainborn seemed saying current system broken, called ""Capitalism.""

You seemed saying current system broken, called ""Capitalism.""

Honestly, think floated terms ""plutocratic control"" ""crony capitalism"" toward u/DakodaMountainborn, they'd probably agree that's currently have.

There conflict except definition ""Capitalism."" might constructive arguments recognize agree go there. Without strategic plan? plan keep supplies low prices high, problem everyone board plan.  I'm American, like there's another (undeclared) civil war going on. point got find common ground. Y'know, ""united stand..."" pandemic seems dividing country further. Lol, *could*

The people around concerned catching corona teachers. Everyone else seems ready throw kids said teachers. What? Even countries national health system, doctors aren’t mandated practice. boards/course scores work due competition Actually world war2 better a) people shoot b) actually fairly social thing, strengthened social bonds (a natural human connection) soldiers, support around military, war home. 

So let’s stop world war 2 comparisons! ............okayyyyyyyyyyyy “Other fields STEM better than, dunno, theatre major”

Theatre Major here.... it’s always bad, especially auditions/productions done two years. said years theatre degree mandatory “waiting tables” class. oil gas industries always volatile.

You read hear stories people industries good bad times cyclical. survivors ones put money away savings retirement others blow earnings without savings buy stuff plan ahead. find job first? That's impression actually make move happen.

I'd love move Germany--I even speak language some--but can't imagine flying tourist visa going get many job offers despite STEM-related professional field. Oh, they're hallucinogenics. figuring cyanide caplets. also remove things political. half reason political.  early hit million continent 2 million cases fewer US rising way slower

The US 52M people 65, France/Italy around 15M 65 countries well 2M individuals 65.

NZ? 700K 5M people 65 they're clustered retirement homes. 

Vietnam? average age way lower significantly fewer 65+ individuals US deaths come from. 

With exceptions US #1 number seniors 65-- especially way cluster retirement homes instead family home like countries really dragged numbers higher whereas countries like India, China Japan similar numbers elderly fared better.

American work culture toxic. always ""company man woman"", getting earlier staying later anyone else. Sacrificing life fuel company fire reason, matter loyal are. 

Burnout real thing American culture. People understand balance work-life sometimes impossible. There's reason someone bragging much work put in, country's culture probably never change.

If vacation time, take them! need time away work, take it! Fuck stigma. coworkers still whining every day ""overblown"" ""politicized"" worse annual flu death rate less 1%. tell economy important future lives 65+ year olds. One study showed people post daily workouts Facebook (""gym day, can't wait!"") mostly sociopaths. Europoors triggered lol Dying watching Smash Mouth concert embarrassing dying taking shit. would start learning language culture well moving. I've recently really considered making kind move. No, really don’t care. life still going on. Americans don’t stop silly virus. It’s really sweet gig. Get this: there’s thing conflicts interest lobbyists.

But made mistake adjusting population.

1 million deaths adjusted population:

1957: 2.75 million

1968: 2.2 million


So I've said. COVID-19 even 1/3 low end estimates multiple flu seasons. Stupid simple. parties use situation political gain. people vote guy because, ""My person right thing, everyone else needs change."" nothing changes, assholes stay power.

People like blame Trump. easy, largely sucks job. real perpetrators fuckery Congress. one stimulus bill beginning it. Everyone hung dry. lack empathy part bad Trump sign executive order lessen it. peak way pleasure! That's nice. get time Americans, still match seems pretty many countries there. Case point, local government mandate maximum size fucking fence!?! so... Weird Quite frankly, American, I'm quite sad USA handled situation respects. situations like guess naively thinking/hoping everyone could put aside differences collectively takes contain thing.

It really exposes broken US regards functioning society/democracy.

I'm taking active measures looking relocate overseas plan B actively hedging US right now.

Frankly, half country collectively lost mind I'm really interested putting life family jeopardy remain part insane cult. Bro feel badass black face mask, like superhero something real question is: American men think makes ""look weak""? Men everywhere else seem problem nearly kinds numbers USA.

I would assume American men refusing wear masks closely correlated supporting Trump getting high doses conservative, pro-Trump propaganda telling masks work, meant control you, etc. governor, Jared Polis,

Polis done ok job. honestly would credit Hancock (mayor denver) mask order early on. Now, hate hanCOCK passion smart move. 

Polis responsive, state wide mask mandate cases started surge. also closes bars 10pm. policy around safer home, i.e. keeping place giving variances, keep counties focused cases. Overall would give A. Welcome club. rest us knew wouod happen. live country normal everyone leaves 3 4, anything past 40 hours week considered lot, nobody ever really force work overtime work 37 hours/week unless work specific niche fields.

And funny thing Americans stereotyped slow workers. work lot hours get lot done. sometimes meetings American offices everything painfully slow. Stupid small talk start meeting, pointless shit repeated constantly, waste time basically.

It's like Americans work 50 hours week 10 pointless non-productive stuff. least thats general feeling people know.

You also hear many stories Americans pretending work even though work do. Like sit computer 3 hours nothing reach target hours. Anyone know would go home nobody would care.

Basically boils culture perception rather productivity. ""Hard"" working countries productive guess look good always look like working hard. satire post?  I'm sorry. I'm happy stable recovering safe facility.  

Campaign wear mask hard asshats spread misinformation. Thinking guys! express group belong to? Ugh, sounds right. go downtown LA see less less mask wearing. live right Sun Valley, 90% people see community don’t wear masks.

Importantly: fox Facebook (the platform) actually misinformation coming from. done little help, sources driving this, understanding crucial understanding actually going on. Simply blaming usual large corporations really knowing enemy comes actual source problem. Two typical possibilities...

1) Someone made 30-foot fence ruined everyone

2) ""Property values"" (which also rationale used keep black people white neighborhoods) probably purposely cut air, shedding much negative light PPE availability.

Obviously gonna screw make short-term decisions [mirror](http://archive.is/o6Too) case original gives trouble. problem wearing one here. felt weird first it’s something didn’t US. comes wanting die. even gonna bother arguing someone plays intentionally obtuse card factually false, literally speculation opinion. Links proof b.s.... forum circle jerk whiners appears. Everyone figurative, fact express explicitly sad. Nobody claiming control. Two weeks ago got recommendation everyone country remain working home possible end year.

Even success latest weeks terms lowering death per day, everyone still taking seriously. get chance visit grandparents year, still outside, behind glass panel.

Also, claim people get kids school - evidence whatsoever, fact evidence seems point unlikely. Finally, worry reinfection - evidence points extremely rare even possible.

All aside, think wear masks. Welcome capitalism. money made. Lol what? I’m attacked telling people sister recovered 6 days doctor also told virus lesser issue healthy people sickening way school treated her. would want go back there? 24k cases day vs 60k cases day look happened Israel opened schools I'm sarcastic. honestly wish best guys struggling.

Thats almost tell really American. must used stranger cares others. 

Thats wear mask. myself, others. 

Respect others easy concept me. People saying years. people ignored, shunned ridiculed. Countries profit prisons, healthcare education systems always going fragile inconsiderate. business model allow strength, integrity considerate. 

This political issue. Democrats Republicans loyal constituents blame this. watch teachers start dropping like flies next months. work 8.00-16.15 mon-fri. get 38 vacation days year + holidays off. Taking care others, kindness, selflessness hot. Patriot men forced wear bras man boobs start talking face masks.

Trump soon list shithole countries guess he/shes referring social system rather socializing public Speak lmao pride. recognizing place higher population crammed together going deaths township neighbors live half mile one another.

The reverse also said course. low pop places much better high population areas, people?  Shouldnt US citizens flocking droves? testing problem? symptoms going vacation small group friends, thought good idea get testing spend weekend together. took 20 mins get test got results 2 days later (negative btw). Wait, done, I'm interested again. consider authoritarian measures? great advice. Thank you! sure follow it. Would mind taking moment reply telling things myself?

I even give head start: wear mask everywhere public (since March, common), family member die COVID19 family/loved ones become sick pandemic. endangering anyone. Masks pointless best. 

And FYI wear one like going market get Eggo Waffle cabbages whatever. get Reavers I’m well aware, quite sure person saying probably couldn’t even pronounce word. Lol America country used be. France also non-nonsense nuclear strategy: 100% counter value.

Argument: ""We big enough play games tyring shoot nukes destroy silos launch something. invade soil full counterstrike goal kill many people possible targeting biggest population centers.""  literally sounds like Europe.

All world common ground moments clarity..are weapons Warlock. Well aren’t wrong give universal health care blowing shit though.

It's fascinating how, perhaps, largest socialistic organization world US Department Defense. Lol. Love it. job 2 years. People crazy man. don’t know fast walk gotta dip.

NZ quote marks interesting. makes sound like they're repeating Americans fragile, objective fact they're inconsiderate. It’s anti American views aren’t mine /s like 101 days now... mean, unless change election system, 2 parties. game theory. Never thought I'd see another southern governor make Tater-tot Mississippi look intelligent comparison.  look nations uniformly? say rest world worse, he's stating 4 European countries listed done bad worse US terms containing amount people died virus. Unless think rest world Italy, Spain, France, UK... Eventually zero everyone it. Lol I’m California. Here, haven’t seen maskless face indoors since April so. people even jog masks on. strictest lockdowns, drastic measures, considered failure.  Imagine risking illness death Smash Mouth concert. 

Damn.. didnt though. outbreaks happened near simultaneously. First deaths regions end February. Xers lucky graduating late 90s tech boom.

Bullshit. also tech bubble crash. know LOT gen-xers, personally, major financial difficulties crash. One ended losing everything, declaring bankruptcy, never working industry again.

None benefited me, anyway, assumption ""lucky"" makes genuinely angry.

So wanted go university mid 1990s -- almost full ride scholarship major university. cover health insurance. Pre-Obamacare, pre-existing conditions covered. Pre-Obamacare, Medicaid coverage also less robust, mother keep insurance past 19 (I 20 scored scholarship couple years community college.)

I major health conditions, going without insurance recipe bankruptcy and/or death.

I learned that:

* made pittance (something like $200 dollars month) qualify Medicaid.
* living home, looked mother's income, qualify Medicaid.
* get Medicaid maybe could pay student housing, since live home, meant either to:
  * Take loan ... nope, much money bank account qualify Medicaid
  * Work ... nope, that'd disqualify Medicaid.
* Maybe could take loan pay private insurance? Nope, pre-existing conditions, get insurance.
* Apply grant cover housing? decent chance I'd approved couple different grants according guidance counselor ... nope, even never touched bank account, considered income, qualify Medicaid.

Fine, got full time adult job came health insurance. Said job promptly changed hours conflict college courses chose dropping university keeping job. kept job ... pension seemed like promising career.

I worked several years decided freeze pension.

Okay, fine. would still get $100 month, adjusted inflation, pension retired. figured utility bill something. vested \*kept job chose university job\* pension.

20 years later, 15 years working (I eventually got fed quit), ""cashed out"" pension ended $4500.

Nowadays, scenario, I'd least qualify Medicaid able go college. threshhold higher.

I've looked going back college full time within last years.

All good scholarships kids, actual cost college much higher make sense ... I'd paying loans day die.

But go kid ... 9-5 longer standard US akaict. It’s typical expected work 8-5 don’t pay hour middle day. There's reason automation can't positive impact. right wing nut jobs blindly follow president called virus “dEMoCrAtiC hOax”, face masks kind protection, said “it is” asked deaths thousands citizens isn’t problem america? 

But sure go ahead focus rioters that’ll Okay, well hopefully right need look one statistic choice states know pandemic going. 

I can't seem find even getting data talking about. thinking spanish flu. yea really hard see, especially days. Since trump got office republicans shady stuff open one cares. thats years religious political brainwashing propaganda gets That’s truth... giving point? lazy weak become. ancestors survived 1918 pandemic would ashamed Yeah many died? /s know college students live much lower cost living area college, even though college completely online allowing students special circumstances live campus, still drove (from CO CA) find housing area around campus Vietnam done incredible job disappointing get credit deserve western media. job market like

""Looking office manager. Must 20 years social media experience, masters degree, must speak fluent Irish, Chinese, Spanish.

America tried get 3M stop sending masks us Canada, even though use natural resource (wood pulp) manufacture them. college, I'd told once, professors well students, work ethic makes underachievers look bad slow down.

Good lord, please tell troll. mean go shitty schools yes. Top public private schools country hands celebrate smart grade school colleges. school like Harvard isn’t going tease kid smart are. school would celebrated. yes would tough smart kid public schools America. jock funny kid celebrated versus nerdy smart kid. first lying outright. misrepresenting. Now, even though admitted 1400 millionaires pay income tax, need know one personally? Lmao. Next I'll show tax returns too.

Also 0.5. ones evaded taxes legally.  man! I've said. COVID-19 even 1/3 low end estimates multiple flu seasons.

Globally, perhaps. US, COVID deaths passed deaths 1968 pandemic, passed deaths per capita well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, though seen WIKI suggest estimate 1968 flu 4 million, source encyclopedia britannica article source. writes good That’s replied world syndrome costs millions people lives freedom Nothing. Engineering sounded like fun. also need transfer. also want get equivalent PhD.

I like math. That's pretty soulless. also necessary solving problems like climate change. Law necessary society too. accounting. think saw John Oliver thought joke something. cannot believe actually real person really get elected. Holy fuck Georgia!


Edit: tbh, kind comforts know wasn’t elected fairly means stupidity didn’t completely take over. course still discomforts greatly cheater cheating. wear N95 KN95 day. expect there’s enough oxygen, certainly effort breathing, takes bigger breath get oxygen due stays internal space, air hot wet. pleasant, pleasant hospital. sit car eat lunch.

Of course is.

Is anyway catastrophic pandemic? relatively mild one.

It goes 

1918 Influenza

1957 Flu


Little down

1968 Flu

COVID-19



Both 57 68 flu killed way people killed children killed millions human population much, much younger.

COVID-19 median age death 80

If world population pyramid equal 50s-60s COVID-19 would even pandemic.  Oh god fucking hate everything didn’t help you, first time hundred years, election president never held public office.

It truly sealed American decline chaos  pride population density fucking bizarre. ""podunk"" meaning places flooded murder, drugs, disease, rats, renters, foreign governments etc. It’s pretty much still way Midwest. different hoodies kids don’t classify emo anymore. Hollister kids parents red MAGA hats. Lots interns work part-time working internship, makes harder since second shift, least helps bring money live. else would China gain invading Europe besides natural resources, land, millitary supremacy, ethnic supremacy. sure look like bad reasons invade! mean logic reason attempt annex Hong Kong put Uighurs cages

Secondly, I'm comparing economic power. known fact Russian millitary par whole European Union millitary, terms strength terms technology. Hell, SU-57 thing country fight back Poland UK F-35 terms technologies. Without US, culmination China Russia would absolutely steamroll entirety Europe.

If gain territory natural resources, need economic partners trade: sustainability new territories achieved enough sustain whatever nation develop.  Peace Love Unity RespiratoryViralInfections idea talking about. Puss Boots literally highest box office role.

Furthermore, stand-alone film fantastic. stand that. EP'd Guillermo del Toro. rich class. can't say Germany Texas anything similar, except maybe terms size. example child mortality 5.9 Texas, slightly US 3.7 Germany. Texas size South Sudan, maybe better comparison Germany ? all, unlike Germany oil. figure would make sense 330 million infected. Last checked around 5 million. disease stoppable, countries literally back normal economy barely suffered. What's hard spending time home potentially saving lives? 

I'd govt cares they'd make sure able afford eat 8 weeks beat PREVENTABLE virus that's killed 160000+ Americans America race? ought say call Ameriphobia (Xenophobia) anything. put chin, looks like they're wearing jockstrap face. would look whole hell lot less stupid wore like they're supposed to. Confirmed. Food service retail life.  Haven’t always fragile though? Trump pushed openly display EU+UK already hovering near 10k despite less 3k weeks ago. US hovering around 20k explosion 65k steadily decreasing lot people sensible things (albeit little late). EU get little complacent people start tire lockdowns clearly showing recent weeks. 1. Yep. 
2. Probably not, probably hurt, either, though imagine they'll somewhat low list general. It’s safe. South America. could generalize Europe stinky poor shithole wanted apply logic Walking Sun? must Old, that's I've always associated Smash Mouth with. Anyone living Canada could've told past 20 years. are. never mentioned protesting protesters “if contracted covid-19 may qualify free test check organ damage”

But there's manufacturer sue damages... seems counterintuitive, remember point view healthcare worker. Say beginning community 100 cases say 10% bad enough go hospital. explosive growth cases, suddenly 10,000 cases 1,000 potential hospital cases. triage take sickest sick point view severity goes up. 
 
That age fell surprising either, they're active essential workers continue risk. Zero less 19%, not? grocery store gossip tier eat /thanksimcured #Hot 99.7% survival rate tho Literally? didn’t write anything “utter destruction”.

When last time significant wartime restrictions? 1945? pandemic restrictions anyone noticed maybe sometime back polio problem?

Do think response pandemic something effective dignified “utter shit show”? Ya Reddit odd place, stayed away China locked Wuhan. stayed away, militant place simping little girls. Netherlands country noticed most, live here, 490 new cases yesterday whereas exactly month (July 9th) 52. Germany quite drastic percentage-wise, 8th, 1,100 compared 400 month prior. know people died fucking cunt, doesn't. also know 50 people lost jobs financially fucked lost health insurance crazy fucked reaction. grandpa quarantined die, grandpa same? agree — US fantastic place right now, crisis shown Europe needs establish independence bloc. say American. However, caveats:

1) Europe needs make sure decoupling US doesn’t force hands Russia-China bloc. China executing active genocide Uyghurs moment, spread propagandist misinformation COVID resulted boatloads deaths, actively waging war Democracy Hong Kong. Contrary much reddit believes, greater evil US.

2) order this, Europe needs stop piggybacking US militarily. Don’t like US military does? Ok, fund protection then. require either higher taxes rollback government spending? Maybe, can’t cake eat too. one-sided dependence extends beyond military sense...a decoupling means European countries might actually pay market prices pharmaceuticals well. US citizen, trust me, I’m sure want that...

3) It’s Europe doesn’t problems too. Many people forget Europe isn’t UK Switzerland. It’s Hungary, Ukraine, Romania too. Within Europe, regions significantly less Democratic US (Hungary, Poland), regions *much* poorer (Ukraine, Moldova), regions bungled COVID-19 outbreak even worse, even deaths per capita (Sweden), regions even historical blood hands (Germany, Belgium). It’s like Europe paradise US dystopia. 

That said, *do* hope Europe find degree greater independence, though hope sensibly responsibly. think highlight would better term... position arrogance. Plenty men claimed immunity virus claiming stronger virus. sports practices “community events” first place concern truly health students? dumb hell. I’m glad school district going online sports. It’s recipe disaster. bet enjoy US military economic protection No, *economy* agreement society split resources. resources real finite, way distribute resources create money human invention literally greater esoteric meaning. Jeff Bezos earned 18$ billion single week recently, meanwhile child starve every two half minutes. 

Currency human invention, made up. 

In March alone, nation spent 1.5 trillion dollars nation bump stock market two week rebound back 2017 ish March alone. 1.5 trillion federal dollars pumped stock market, American populous got less third single time installment cash flow bank accounts.

Imagine instead set aside 1.5 trillion pot split among tax-paying men women nation, monthly/weekly stimulus months; went right back normal business. know, like practically every developed nation earth. Hell could even set portion stimulus check would paid back 2022 something. 

If worried people's lively hood, correct option would give people stimulus say home got initial outbreak control, allowed economy reopen properly reached safe level infection rate. would better long run (A) initial lockdown would shorter *actually* taken necessary measures counter spread, meaning less out-breaks across nation therefore (B) would able steadily open up, business would know doors would opening back could plan accordingly; consumers would confidence market safety go out; workers risk lives, families lives earn paycheck keep afloat - workers would able know return work. 

It driving force market trying get people back work feed endless earning top percentiles caused terrible situation. 

The US mess Capitalism, capitalism works exploitation, functions earn highest possible margin minority owner class, expense majority working class. Capitalism care die, shareholders make money.

That's wrong. 2 weeks ago turning patients away. NY back March treat people. losing people over. 

Hospitals wings setup certain issues. person gets car accident need go OR. put cardiac wing. works. equiped handle issue there. Similarly, person car accident rushed hospital going brought covid wing patient turned away. 

The reason response besides insults I'm truly astonished know things. common sense 20 vacation days entire month, lot full time workers US. 100% failure leadership.

Is euphemism impending economic collapse? MLB even outbreaks teams quarantined weeks. opponents quarantine saw transmission playing infected team.

This case football. one lineman plays infected, see bunch ancillary cases days/weeks following game. 


The NFL start season. chance finish season. Mhmm...remember many deaths sweden has... compare norway... dont even say ANYTHING ELSE...just hihi...

Btw..

Your mask fell xD exposed...

What else say anti masker... SHAMEEEE! Yeah. Good luck that. We're experience one largest mass-migration events US - wherein college students going swarming one state another. complete shitshow postponed March roaring right back us month, bringing jello shots, beer bongs, party-till-you-drop attitude fucking wheels fly off. Oh. think Harrisburg near Gettysburg, Civil War knowledge comes handy. rate, wonder High School football going go way college football? around middle March, one hospital Cremona, still Lombardy region Northern Italy. outbreak terrible region Veneto, rest Italy faring much better. two regions caught surprise left isolated lockdown one knew deal virus. [Not enough PPE ventilators, literally pick lives hope understand facing back death rate different. hair loss covid? hair loss infected covid? hear constant construction outside, guess get quiet perks, least we're murica. Although, mostly US news articles. lot articles places seem particular focus drawing unfavourable comparison United States, especially posts comment sections full Americans seem understand particular issues country.

I hope principal gets schooled principle... Hard disagree. Specifically paulding county, backwater fucking hicktown. dank satire, bro. shot couldn’t sustain erection. hand pills that.

Even today men flip fuck can't get erection. seen guys normal full psychotic dick can't get hard sex. open conversation it. Getting see doctor next impossible. remember feelings solidarity 9/11 I’m shocked something even larger scale, affecting entire globe, doesn’t bring feelings. 

I blame social media. WHY???? America fucking stupid? Near Harrisburg Younger people get ill older people. nurse taking care COVID patients months. Viruses love mutate, let get control infect people mutate. It’s unlikely, it’s true it’s happening right now. people get infected, severity cases gets worse. doesn’t get better lesser people get infected. (\^accurate summation events) I'm aware, every president used either though. also little bit different literally powerful person world wrong words could spark war economic downturn. think Greta writing speech could spark war ruin economy. really makes think there's something idea COVID hits roughly 20% population, kind herd immunity starts kick cases decline. saw New York, Bergamo, think we're starting see TX, FL maybe SC now. 

I guess we'll see holds true schools start back people world maybe otherwise home. hope does. Republicans wear masks afraid. Checks out. also explains hide churches, smother guns, resist interacting anything *milquetoast* experience available -- they're afraid everything.  


More specifically, chosen media platforms churches spend inordinate amount time terrorizing them, entirely fault, turn TV. mitigate effects global warming. Less people people working home might give us time. mean, US, probably makes huge difference.

But US, massive crowd COVID deniers constantly point incomplete data evidence virus big deal. optimistic anything, directly trying pretend virus threat anything stop spread. Try moronic/oblivious/apathetic/entitled

...Also, I’m American People dying Walter, wear fucking mask. fragile. rest us eagerly part.

How explain NYC? Weird entire rest world (yes, including Europe) also capitalist heard drug. think breaks phenomia, restores oxigen blood faster drugs? how'd get it? rest come later week Public health experts everyday residents said ""always saw America model"" world

LMAO that's bullshit It’s Detroit Free Press local teams MSU Michigan. Oh wait got this!

*what president United States!* hate broken record, numbers provided HHS places getting case death data. switchover directly affect this. switchover totally screwed (easy) hospitalization info factors. sites getting case death data CDC. Couple entire political party based inability admit uncomfortable truths telling people everything fine source lot problems. 

Europe grapple lot tough national identity problems last century, I’m sure helped crisis. Americans can’t even agree fought half country demanding keep right humans. Weird saying even misguided child doesn’t deserve death threats unpopular sub. fighting covid 5 months, I'd trying call attention too. difference make OP? Also due people moving away. Hey look. Toxic masculinity. source this? Interested read affected lockdowns shoot gorilla much tests? Bingo least people coming Skopje agreed tested, 157 passengers 27 infection. case 60 passengers 100 agreed tested. coming Romania situation looks pretty bad. hell lead hair loss? get blood clotting, heart lung damage, everything else, make hair fall out? know use masks social distance back then? 

using masks social distancing new. reason Fauci initially told us wear masks conserve masks, scientific statement.

Students set come back Thursday, masks required. Staff told tell anyone principal tested positive. Georgia preoccupied digging grave even consider preventing spread covid. Lol decision States manage PPE distribution themselves? Federal government typically provides funding lets States figure best utilize resources. system mostly works, I'm sure got messy broker international PPE purchases without one centralized US entity. watched Interview Vampire last night - love cast much. hope easier go it. asked first fascist asshole debate style ask bunch questions guess. think idea asking endless amount questions never bringing anything table tire opponent.

C'mon guys. cancel season point. played 5 games people going ER? stoops. Yes. I’m speaking personal experience. shows people don’t give shit truth care agenda. Lmao fucking horseshit, issue inherently political country Lol Interview Vampire?!!! months ago someone told pandemic isn’t affecting anyone’s personality, limiting activities. 


L L troll, posts generally high quality. Except we've pandemic pandemic restrictions before.  We've also wartime restrictions before.  

Labeling ""paternalistic"" ""repellent shit show"" projecting fears ""utter destruction"" makes emotionally harder bear, change facts environment we're in. go first fascist pal asshole mean literally representatives... would ask Reagan, died bacterial pneumonia day care. used get sick time there. fragile lol Covid 19 ""revealed"" decades American Tourists already revealed. think he's ""Trump Boot licker"" opened Colorado ""soon"". protect people afraid someone looking giggling weak. true, fall would look much brighter.

A friend who's ER nurse says flu season going brutal year, need another thing worry about. ""wait two weeks"" thing carried alot weight back Jan/Feb everyone waiting explode U.S. people still denial whether would ever get here. Now, we've seen fact take 2 weeks hospitalizations rise cases, another two weeks show deaths. aspect? Covid? plenty, rofl. They're playing Darwin's Roulette hoping win Darwin prize. Throw selfish, conspiratorial good measure. 

We good place guys, I'm really sorry. need full time re-think somethings. Carry without us bit, maybe sometime November check back in. Honestly, people reddit whilst severely sleep deprived exhausted. Would make much weirder lurker experience. positivity allowed sub positive tests CDC changed guidance April 3rd. Still pretty early on. I'd like point dumb people disagreeing would sound virus had, say, 25-50% death rate. idea *shouldn't* threatened least scenario like would literally lead end civilization.

People wanna use terms like ""the greater good"", either realize, refuse acknowledge sometimes means using threats violence needs done. 

There far many people unwilling accept that, means *real*, doomsday virus outbreak happens, 100% fucked. 

The choice eliminate denying/actively trying spread it, simply allowing everyone die think anyone deserves hurt/killed, much stomach.

**TL;DR** Fuck em. think drop countries comparison, use fair comparisons instead.

The U.S. 200,000 excess deaths Mar July. translates 1 1640. Still better Belgium said nothing transmission. specifically talked cytokines, implies treatment.

Also, one people still trying claim marijuana medicinal benefits? That’s get point it’s late. Even Boy Scouts know this. motto “be prepared”, “fuck it, wait see” Bummer personally, understand. move Spring would pretty cool. Especially since garbage weather games would frontloaded instead backloaded. Switch WWE way entertaining Lol like Indian Arab security guards. Heard Astros got big brawl yesterday. thought Gen-X's got slammed last recession housing crisis. Well, drug, sex trafficking, general debauchery hot spot, so... Hospitals Texas Florida overwhelmed 

Really now? means get car wreck die parking lot hospital hospital ""overwhelmed"". what's happening right now? not, overwhelmed. ""At best, Americans feeling distracted, forgetful, disorganized helpless.""

Minor point actually good number Americans great things, like volunteering make masks need, providing free food vulnerable populations, beautiful things humanity capable of. really fan news paint inaccurate pictures. may lot people feeling distracted/forgetful/disorganized/helpless, that's definitely Americans best even times COVID-19. think reinfection one got dropped least, like never see one anymore, think new one “the vaccine rushed” Swine flu came Mexico, Ebola breaks regularly Africa, MERS broke middle east, essentially viruses respect boundaries. Viruses fact nature, human failing ignore threat around others don't. want know Millennials care pandemic, things sucked long time, somehow going fault end, anyway.

If someone constantly attacked, eventually learn become apathetic towards criticism. things always suck, eventually learn live it. Millennials scape goats people still think we're 20. I’ve missed “Ow balls!” Big tough guy! Look exposed nose mouth, tough. yet nuclear weapons grow trees

That includes social media censorship well Reddit.

These type people actively censoring r/Colorado r/Denver regard increase Coronavirus cases here.

I relentlessly downvoted derided r/Denver warned Gov Polis [was reopening without enough targeted testing mask-wearing place. [I've proven (and makes Polis look bad) response downvote account, attack personally permanently ban simply linking local article showing climbing cases. warning. ban.

r/Colorado mods want anyone share articles negative effects Gov Polis' early reopening unless hidden away pinned sub little visibility banned (without warning) merely linking news article showed Coronavirus cases climbing, etc. r/Denver (which desperately trying provide cover Polis' mistake) turned screws immediately banned well without warning bogus reason.

I mod come try feed false info (on purpose otherwise). bad mod I’m *also* mod privy familiar r/Colorado censorship happened me, fairly surprised draconian move r/Denver. wonder mod shift led it. perma-ban implemented almost unison, they've responded exact, obtuse way well asked banned. Looks like there's crossover least comes censoring articles could possibly make Polis look bad regard Coronavirus.

Or perhaps there's someone subs u/DeviatedNorm business owner (or part group) wants hasty reopenings happen matter many people kills, dunno. Whatever motives appear sinister due obtuse, draconian methods permanently banning account without warning based upon lie refusing offer nothing lie asked banned — proceeded mute contact them.

They obviously want local articles surge cases go away — them.  parts Europe underdeveloped, Europe whole pretty developed. US similar ignorance 


Oof .. Well one hits mark days Lil well... would great anybody power could held accountable. We'll probably blame health officials. end. Thank you.

Your premise conclusion flawed ok princess. jargon. initial comment grammatically incorrect, though less so, remains way. Learn punctuate. 

Which words outside vocabulary valid, logic, flawed, valid, premise, conclusions? discuss logic pass reading comprehension.

You want argue fight. already body would relapse fully getting initially.......re-infection would new infection another source. 6 days sister confirmed case covid symptoms included bedtime Netflix. 

You’re severely overstating virus. reasonably healthy, expect full recovery within week 2. Maybe not. goals though? drifted 20s working minimum wage jobs mostly treading water. reached 27-28 (and mom got really sick) started reevaluating life. want? could get there? went school (despite going 3 separate colleges already) finally started gaining ground. ever life grandparents had? No, won't. amazing conveniences (like cell phones internet) things missed on. love video games, internet. generation dealt unique hand guess ways.

My point - understand coming from. unique struggles, can't say work you. setting goals, figuring wanted life, slowly working towards really helped me. deciding ""I want network engineer 5 years"" set foundation could stand on. Anyways, hope nice week. Life crazy right hopelessness easy feel. Hang there, it! mean, need Europe, Spain Italy, air conditioning common. Sick assholes getting jollies “a crying lib”.  You’re wrong bubble concept make sense all.

It worked really well NZ, conjunction lockdown. original idea bubble getting lockdown period - preemptively decide going spend lockdown (your household bubble, lived alone, could join someone else's' bubble). period lockdown, work. They’ll drinking mimosas 10 AM, they’re totally alcoholics anything, “expensive taste” Absolute fucking disgrace. could’ve played front empty stadiums. God forbid anyone anything fun enjoys part life disease going around kills three every 1000 people get it.

In shape 18-23–year-olds dropping dead virus. don’t need “protected“ it. many players shot NFL I’m something awesome lives going ripped underneath fucking liberals north get sucking decks health experts virtue signaling everyone obedient “down“ science are. state Ohio, six months, still doesn’t even 4000 deaths. 3700 deaths Ohio has, 80% deaths nursing home patients. fuck warrant shutting college football season? It’s disgrace. 

Furthermore, virus isn’t going eradicated one year now. guess won’t football rest lives! Yep, graduated college middle last recession, havent even finished paying student loans yet. I'm probably gonna laid next month two. I'm afraid try line something else son's situation daycare (needs 10 days every time fever, toddler like TIME). think I'm gonna kinda forced stay home mom point... like fine whatever guess. Could least loans paid first though! Ugh. 


I'm lucky financial situation recently allowed us move city onto land country. least get laid ""homestead"". water, heat home wood, grow food starting next year (and preserve much possible). I'm glad got did. Call crazy, bad feeling this... Dear men, nothing find sexier man wears mask. showing new posted ten hours ago? 

Did get blocked? curve? Cases deaths?

Case curve reflect actual cases beginning July, testing insufficient, large wave June backlog people wanted get tested, finally able to. Yes, drop June July, that's backlog ran out, people went vacation stopped getting infected.

Death curve linearly declining since mid-April, zero correlation weather vacations severity restrictions decline mobility. news many. hair loss recover time? Trump even symptom. responded Trump was. fallen nonsense he'd marginalized term over, I'd still believe beginning end American experiment yet arrived. its, we're clearly seeing decline impressive country.   need new reasons dislike music, go pulling stops. except awesome technological wonders, they're literally hands everyone one uses fullest potential Ok, think not?

Take deep breaths. Clear mind. Picture this: elected people represent them. several colleagues blocking solutions.

What do?

I would whatever took. 

I would buy every goddam ad space. I'd go every single show podcast would me. would write op eds. would leak phone numbers every single politician. would absolutely arrange organize several mean, fucking treason high crimes....

If wanted show constituents cared concerns, I'd impeached put chi cages. waited attacked wealthy, privileged politician's son. profoundly bad message clearly something doing, it.

But fighting we're talking lot bills great, actually.

*buzzer I;ll agree regarding Schumer. He's worst. Senate Dems bad, House Dems lot better.

Virtually leadership bad replaced party also hates democracy we're left gatekeepers pass conserv legislation call prog. see! Cause lot articles shared closed borders Sweden on, got wrong impression. He's race worst Governor coronavirus pandemic fragile constitution what’s wrong America. Americans doers, victims. Life isn’t sunshine rainbows. warm blooded American duty take whatever shitty thing life throws persevere. experiencing nothing compared civil war, world war 2, Great Depression, even life frontier. don’t warring bands angry Native Americans doorstep common criminals running rampant. life hardly danger compared 120 years ago. Verbal abuse excuse. Non American here, may cultural differences I'm aware of. key question different scenario irresponsible behaviour lead injury death others yourself, also legally contained enforced. drive dangerously start pouring petrol sewers, police would trouble restricting personal freedoms, I'm danger others.

Being authoritarian role, people assign government, prefer anarchy. That's 'govern' part government, light current events, telling people wear masks seems like really good idea.

America used known respectful society, seems 'personal freedom' promoted peers 'personal responsibility' 'civil obligation', country known largesse generous support others need, caring ~~yourselves~~ better?
EDIT: Word reinfections due virus already inside body? new viral source? Kinda nuts much time people countries spend thinking talking U.S. meanwhile U.S. even care enough know names countries much less map. put responsibility teachers?

Yes federal government sort plan. Unfortunately separation state federal we're fu#ked anyway. one main reasons American much worse rest world. weird thing (at least me) get machine use it. describing would explain getting diagnosed first place, getting diagnosed refusing get machine. apparently man gets diagnosed sleep apnea gets CPAP machine, there's still 50% chance use it. One two main front page stories NYT Arts section today: 'Europe's Illegal Partying: Spreading'

Here's quote Berlin: ""Despite sign instructing partygoers maintain distance least 1.5 meters, five feet, dance area packed, nobody wearing mask.""

Here's quote France/Paris: ""The popularity 'free parties,' illegal events known here, surging recent months.""

Here's quote person: ""'I give damn,' [NAME] said, wiggled sound heavy techno beats. 'Of course virus scares me, I've got enjoy 20s.'""

Here's quote London: ""Dancers packed tightly front D.J. middle improvised dance floor, tall man stood eyes closed, moving arms like bird's wings, transported music. People chatted moment, hugged, instant friends.""

I get sub say 'USA bad' get tens thousands upvotes, dipshits across world. Cases increasing Europe right now, largely things like this. people, difference U.S. bigger leadership issue vast majority European countries.

And even paragraph I've written highlights one big issues country- we're extremely divided. POTUS, news, everything seeks strengthen feed divide point America really one identity all.

Guaranteed already sort dress code. requiring mask ""personal choice,"" also personal choice wear hat class? Idiots cowards, sure -- perhaps both. agree comparison fair, without extra context earlier figures bit misleading.

In link shared NY Times says: ""These estimates C.D.C. adjusted based mortality data lagged previous years. Even adjustment, it’s possible could underestimate complete death toll increased mortality causing states lag past states changed reporting systems."".

You correct lot fair comparisons. data Belgium probably show overestimation. count suspected cases (so pretty much everyone fever and/or coughing) add excess deaths number.

There also orther factors reporting statistics. Belgium relativly small national registry deaths. Doctors bound laws procedures around death certificates, figures less lagging behind.
Because coronavirus less political Western Europe less reason underreporting.

I can't commend situation UK. specific knowlegde data UK limited. gives shit Europeans think know USA? appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Ugh wish actual skill could move away with. Europe ain’t gonna want anything main skill knowing clean deep frier. 

It’s especially shitty I’ve taken classes every JC within driving distance I’m stupid instead dropping classes stopped going...to around 30 years. can’t afford conmute another JC 30 Fs transcripts. horseshit grades Highschool pretty much means getting education. 

So it’s gonna lot minimum wage jobs rest life I've since start year remember all.

Many states US, like Texas, got hit late game. guess seen latest numbers. Spain others booming new cases right now, faster rise US states.  ...

What's address? I'm moving house. centrist, moderate


The democrats better plan Something revealed deeply wrong trump got elected. Covid magnified even more. I'm referring covid-19, tell obvious sub literally named coronavirus covid-19. feel like you’re ignoring small bit context we’re pandemic lol mean, course agree, covid response awful states im glad live there

But reddit circlejerk achieves nothing, that's I'm saying. Correlation necessarily apply causation. could be, need data sort conclusion. Peru one earliest strictest lockdowns Latin American (and world). Uruguay enforced government lockdown/shutdown. Peru one worst outbreaks Latin America, world. Uruguay, mild outbreaks Latin America, world.  


Many states shutdown better states strict ones. Obviously lot differences country/state comparison completely apples apples, extent kind point. Yes, absolutely. situation US way worse. healthcare system going economically kill many, many people affected pandemic already living poverty? think US divided weak never before.
Here Italy situation good, honest. think underestimate economic effects usa already economically divided still open???!!??? STUPID I’m better person them, never let go. Nobody perfect, everyone different issues need work on. I’m trying improve physical condition don’t problems there.



...But it’s them. Ladies treating like since middle school. Didn’t necessarily feel like kissing lady middle school crush friend instead. crush sent friend loyalty test. friend got really mad accused gay cause tried resist moves. 

Things like shape way see society know? Women act harshly politely reject advances. Yes, read need B1 level. citizenship get work permits without citizenship. Less 10% Americans uninsured. It’s huge issue bill automatically crippling someone United States. I'm honestly surprised hear one rest America gets real winter never made logical sense. Public safety laws always definitely inhibit people's free prevent possible harm. inhibiting free preventing driving drunk wrong side road based possibility might hit someone. sacrificing needs many look needs unlucky enough driving road opposite direction. Stop inhibiting autonomy! absurdly poorly thought argument. good chunk country actually voting *against* interests - entirely unaware it. Hi I'm American, listen guy lmao Ok? American give single fuck Europeans think. Worry countries. misinformation. Sweden nearly double cases DK does:

Sweden 	32.5 (14-day cumulative number COVID-19 cases per 100 000)

Denmark 	17.3 (14-day cumulative number COVID-19 cases per 100 Childcare public good free regardless income levels.

Stop trying rob people material support.

Children lot work. Let families goddam help. Jfc. madness never anxious person past five months absolutely done number me. 

Constantly worrying parents sixties underlying conditions. Thinking slightest allergy scratch throat covid. Refusing enter stores even though state mask mandate time. Hell, even got point thinking every little bump minor abnormality body awful cancer. 

I’m way better getting watching cases part world drop, March early July fucking sucked. site showing Past Day (Daily). numbers showing Total/Cumulative. Either house going demolished going spend $$$ putting new floors. whole lot seemingly infinite resources sitting tiny people's wealth accounts. start there. hope self awareness improve one day good sir interesting read, methodological standpoint, feel confident controlled possible confounding variables. 

As one example, several recent hotspots (i.e. Texas Arizona) significant sprawl; also factors involved (i.e. shutdown strategy, mask usage, ideology).

Just analyzing 900 metro areas without controlling variables result ""questionable"" findings. Oh fucks sake knock already.

If ‘Europe’ much better go ahead pick whatever country panacea think move there.

I’d move Ireland like people/culture, even know problems like country. Stop pretending magically Europe figured out. don’t. See Italian &amp; Spanish experiences. sucks, Trump sucks, whole thing sucks. doesn’t mean America it’s people suck too. paw paw beat paw paw expect? listen smartest fields, scientist, go emotions, like ""I want everything go back normal"", act accordingly like everything fine. heard mouthwash kills bacteria that's beneficial us, converts nitrogen nitrates something foods nitric oxide relax blood vessels, something like anyways.. People go sturgis groupnsex coz there's nothing masculine hooked ventilator  Tide Pods thing, right? Maybe get BMI tested (once that’s safe do) instead going height/weight tables. doesn’t sound like really need worry losing weight. Imagine caring Europeans think lmao That's sweet transmission small town which, weeks ago, barely even dozen cases total. Last week hit something like 20 one day, mostly stemming assholes threw wedding 200+ people. Don’t forget - US huge place; it’s basically like 8-10 different cultures countries mashed together. Rural areas US behave like rural areas everywhere else - tend conservative individualistic - urban areas collectivistic. US, might want Google “US regions” get idea this. 

Generally speaking, places worst behavior tend states weakest education systems furthest right leadership. 

For instance, Northeast (including places like New York Boston) looks lot like Europe, cases less flat people behaving respectfully towards one another. Deep South (including Georgia, Louisiana, Florida, Alabama, etc.) quite opposite - lots folks think pray away democratic hoax virus, etc. Perhaps, dear non-US redditor, you’re familiar Florida Man meme. 

To paint USA wide brush like comparing Benelux Baltics, Japan Myanmar. That's absolute nonsense. Everyone *had* coronavirus before, extemely common illness. sure this, healthcare workers using KN95 masks? understanding need actual N95 masks, KN95 good enough hospital use. situation crappy hospital workers using they're better nothing?

This say people burning assholes. goes without saying. genuinely curious status PPE healthcare workers they're using. agree point, also see previous response relates. strawman say nationalism dates back especially world wars, earlier, values society largely reflected vote office spend money nation. decades correct course, haven't. could misinterpreting, think implied. think easier maintain ""bubbles"" everyone locked back March/April. one going anywhere, outside contact everyone minimal. many ppl shopping, paying visits relatives, running errands, patronizing salons/nail/barbershops, even outdoor gym classes.

“We’re extremely thankful continue work together keep production safe everyone CNY,” Vinal said.

Porterfield points cities infrastructure, like Los Angeles New York City, worry larger populations can’t spread easily spikes coronavirus. biggest challenge locally getting people travel Syracuse, it’s “manageable” close enough bigger cities like NYC, Buffalo Toronto.

Porterfield, whose role make sure Hulu films done time budget, said “Plan B” third eight movies shooting Syracuse streaming service.

Hulu looks Syracuse “like Netflix looks like Yonkers multiple productions,” Porterfield said. Yonkers, N.Y., used Netflix popular titles like “Orange New Black,” “The Politician” Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman.”

“I amazed support here,” Porterfield added.

Syracuse also offer production space Oncenter Redhouse Arts Center named Qualified Production Facilities last month. Films TV shows use QPF eligible New York state film tax credit, recently reduced 40% 35% productions Upstate New York 30% 25% NYC; extra 10% film tax credits sweetens incentive productions consider Syracuse.

The Oncenter Redhouse also taken steps ensure healthy safety air purification systems. Oncenter uses ASM Global VenueShield program provide enhanced air circulation filtration reduce risks staff guests, Redhouse partnered HealthWay Family Brands Pulaski Intellipure systems remove virus causes Covid-19.

Having locations qualified production facilities also allows social distancing, accommodate large multiple productions area.

Porterfield thinks there’s also potential New York State Fairgrounds, available 45 weeks year, become qualified production facility. Buildings like new Exposition Center already place would require minor modifications get soundstage quality, said.

“Plan B” also planned shoot “party house” Syracuse area, Porterfield says scenes extras reduced contained little more. Extras may still involved, filming schedules may shift ensure everyone tested negative Covid-19.

“In Covid era... protect (actors) utmost care,” Porterfield explained. “If crew member gets sick, there’s way still shoot. lose actor, don’t person screen. can’t shoot someone else.”

Anything else could misread. conversations beer later It’s way raised. people aren’t going question politics religion, period.  huge manipulation. denier sketch source. posted literally agenda (whether agenda wrong wrong).  Sure, sources infection. Sweden siginficant one, according Norwegian official story sigificant one region. asking government close border again. agree him. worry one thing time Sweden's caseload going levels similar neighbors would good thing everyone.

Idiots get voice and, they're fucking idiots, think opinion equivalent medical experts. Hopefully changes. Take freedom shove it. forget quite bit faithless electors back 2016. Luckly supreme court ruled can't anymore. We'll see works election. all. socializing, spewing germs everywhere, go bathroom, walking patrons workers. would think covering would much situations? Sweden already suffered much much worse Nordic neighbours, worse even relatively poorer, socially gregarious countries like Portugal.

The question much neighbours, countries EU, suffer Sweden exporting cases? OP, huge difference OP located whether ADN BSN. Also, ADN nursing, might need apply nursing home rehab hospitals highly populated areas prefer hiring BSNs nature preserve,

Depending big preserve is, outside open air one safest places, social distance course. Politics solution issue. NZ conservative vs liberal. Canada, political stripes said yes need this. say disagreement, part everybody health officials said, politicians deferred expertise. US dems vs republicans.

(The last tweet see 8/7. still there? link?) Mate im brit lol believe Bible, another flood coming wipe people clearly deserves ‘fate’. 

We stand divided, United hate other. young country, take many shortcuts gain immediate benefits. EU learned hard way, hope faster smarter. American wholeheartedly agree.

Many countrymen care little disheartening embarrasing.

To rest world, self-absorbed assholes. Many us sincerely understand severity lava-pissing angry are. *Casts ballot ""Literally Internet Stranger, 2020.""* dad called state governor’s executive order requiring mask wearing “dangerously authoritarian.”

And I’m like, dude, we’re still midst pandemic killing lot people. Would rather twiddled thumbs? New Zeland able go lockdown eradicate it. South Korea shut clubs ONE spreading event.

Test-trace-isolate fantasy point. Infection wayyyyy large, way many asymptomatic, US citizens way mobile, privacy laws, etc.

Australia thought could test-trace-isolate failed already.

Germany going fail well. Nations build immunity already seeing start infection rise. Denmark, Spain, Norway, etc.

As time goes weather turns Europe going see rapid spread. 

Japan, Germany, China, etc serious trouble next months. lens numbers need viewed. longer trusted. question peanut gallery I've kind lost thread arguing. Generally speaking, proposing solution current situation less regulation? Remember, generally speaking, yes plenty. I've never met single service member actually wears pink camo shit, single one. trump people, less 30% 300m people. good, America. traders anything word ""America"" might ever meant. They've never read constitution, support says, carry small copies pockets. work done here. New Zealander here, usual people posting ""You're isolated, low-population island"" try downplay success leadership citizenry.

Look Republic Ireland. Geographically isolated similar population (5 million). 26k cases 1700 deaths.

Also, people realise many people visit here. tourists, international students overseas workers. Europeans brought humanity two world wars, holocaust, horrific colonialism...

They could also considered “inconsiderate”  say want experience living abroad Yeah. Read title graph....

🤦‍♂️ happens time No, act like I'm commenting article America's response COVID. am. say anything riots. rest world terrified direction go really. much country raised almost entirely war, start going towards fascism stupid populace, things get ugly surely. I’m guessing inclusion Gabbard group. who's blame Europe's 3 million infections 180 thousand deaths? 

Europe really position talk US. European countries still leading worldwide per capita deaths. Ya new reply is:

6B people world 

""Everyone"" European, agree article. kind poop USA thread. productive. Yea point really hate Truml GOP much 60 million Americans remain completely willfully ignorant it. choice Giant Douche Turd Sandwich, it’s old South Park reference it’s relevant ever  interesting historically long shortage nurses, [US importing seems like oversupply. I've since april. sucks. Bad.

My brain swollen today. Bush downplayed 9/11 wouldn’t sense solidarity. Get grip... work outside home. Nobody even says this, stop jerking course created overriding pride/terror ourselves. think mistake cancel every important social event thought working class said couldn’t afford go work that’s wanted go back? appreciate it. wanted money always issue Still bill though. That's true, agree. Mentioning political climate reason abstract, without going details, would perfectly fine.  problem people willing, people cognizant doing, aware guidelines. Unless rules plastered everywhere, silly expect people know rules.

Consider waiter, often even know approaching. People conditioned wearing masks situation even think put mask addressed. Salary, yeah. mean, density cases (cases proportion population) is, even worst affected places Europe, half US. third even smaller. passed peak months ago measures masks testing came much faster here, general, US. knowledge, country Europe anything like kind conspiracy, politicisation, denialism we've seen US, certainly federal fricking governments. can't speak thoroughly every country someone else mentioned, Europe collection independent nation states can't lumped together easily like that. places better others reason. 

Even though people taking seriously more, literally fraction reason people US, really believe proportion people like far smaller - obviously can't compare anecdotal experience. Europe may dealt perfectly, altogether leaps bounds ahead US.  many states like TX Yeah r/conservative sick joke completely agree you! Lombardy insane. many died needlessly overflowing hospitals.

NYC bad, too, better Lombardy.

Houston South Florida got little overcrowded, still better NYC. Sure hell didn’t need coronavirus say us inconsiderate.   doubt even open. UFT fight it. open 2 weeks shut  cardiovascular issues problem, let alone heart attack, yeah. stents, heart. Graduated HS 09, I'm still bunch debt think argument since countries failed contain virus, they'll sort herd immunity eventually begin congregating again, New Zealand would stay isolated. think follows, vaccine really advanced stages 100 candidates. may take really doubt we'll never something. ""You can't stay time!""

But... not?

""People go back work!""

But... why? There's infestation sanctimonious euro-trash Reddit now. love sites. It'd cheaper hire security get sued later. People signed waivers get Disney, one's signing waivers get stores. someone gets Covid store enforce mask mandate surprised see lawsuits cropping up. even lose still costs money fight it, plus bad PR. hire security least try care customer &amp; employee safety. 

Or like Disney draft waivers lol Boy, imagine epitome post, haha! least mentioned Spain Italy got ravaged citizens, go “yeah, botched it, it’s looking better daily.” get worse daily, signs slowing, default conservative “B-b-b-b-but whatabout-!” Kinda embarrassing supposedly leading country free world bad handling pandemic, third population like you, ignore warnings/science, pass buck first chance get, haha!

If makes fragile feelings better, sure, call Europe fragile too, okay slugger? least, took hit “glass jaw” got back up, US busy crying screaming blaming everything else. felt it. live tourist town (Which I'm sure everyone figure googling NE PA Tourism), resorts got permission bypass mask rules regarding covid bring fuck ton money feel like worth fighting clientele. Oh yeah? Well chinchilla could kick chinchillas ass! people supporting didn’t vote. It’s simple that. Biden’s followers went primary bernie’s yang’s didnt Lol good counterargument America fragile diversity strength?  that, see somehow strength.  one older man, wearing “MAGA FIGHT CLUB” shirt: “I’m ready die mission” but: “First all, need get Trump re-elected.”

I can't think anything add that.... Wait, saying Orange County CA tourist appeal Miami?

The Orange County CA averages 50 million tourists per year

The Miami averages 22 million tourists per year? say friendly! us Americans try speak it, usually end getting attacked verbally physically. future see US potential break up. sane states want get right rest world forming blocs aligning foreign powers. state's still sticking outdated ideals wall built around permanently international shit list. could destroy everyone else they've destroying themselves. know covid tbh

but evidence Imagine thinking liking things make weak. life must sad.  politicians spent generations lecturing us cannot material needs met.

We cannot suddenly start without voters going, ""hold up, mean tell us could given us free health care UBI entire time?"" hey NASDAQ hit new highs last week GDP go much countries! /s took pandemic realize this?  fake Yeah thz worst accidental, want able go doctor, serve get Tricare. Everything designed whole purpose blowing world, citizens, called patriotism. predicted well back March Dr. John Campbell. family taking 50mg Vitamin couple months now, better safe. Lets say get entire country tested month. people antibodies lets say whatever fuck want. 


What negative people? retest every months? United States anywhere close Laissez-faire capitalism. Copyrights, trademarks, market subsidies, bail-outs called pro-business actions made various levels government literallly everywhere U.S. economy markedly contrary idea Laissez-faire capitalism. guess, think back beginning lot epidemiologists trained scientists active here.

Now come sub don’t usually find worthwhile wade discussion. People pretty set opinions, reality based otherwise.  Thanks kind stranger! Body check! Knee-drop! Stamp kick. Back attackers. mean thing killing us? Yeah guess fits narrative US total trash. virus endemic many nations around world ever eradicated. Next year first vaccines come out. time get better. Two thirds American adults take vaccine. Immunity inherent acquired become better understood. Eventually Covid becomes another viral pneumonia, one many ills flesh heir to. Nations controlled spread continue struggle preventing importation virus years, masks may become permanent fashion there.

About million Americans, roughly 4 million others around world survived Covid suffering form disability. half permanent. continue occur. Various secondary effects less common incidence continue discovered, named, course treatment defined refined. many, life shortened. Treatment disabilities loss productivity social burden generation. one disability long list, rather one cause ailments like COPD.

It's clear yet deaths fall crisis levels. less medical science behaviorology. become immune endeavour resume activity before. tempts others forget chastened resume risky behavior immune. US local governments develop standards communication necessary discipline prevent healthcare overrun.

Economic impacts last least decade fall background levels. still early days topic. unknown many businesses gone forever. Exactly this.

Which blaming capitalism silly. Taking care efficiently professionally would ideal.

It's stupidity extreme partisanship (I'm ok hurt long PEOPLE hurt more). That’s awesome hear! Hopefully lasts.. full disclosure, Canadian. think need awake issues well, stop pretending like we're perfect. However, areas support diversity counterpart south. notion cultural mosaic vs melting pot, think, somewhat true, larger metropolitan areas, necessarily case metropolitan areas *surprised pikachu* get 5 days vacation year?! That's insane.  Thanks link, aware website! even link another one: 

I've telling people ages study tuition-free parts Germany (even non-EU citizens) link share. Thanks lot! cop let's shoot people without worried they'll shoot back. basically army pussies. fact Disney World open proves Disney give f*ck. nobody planet earth besides chunk people states surprised. Uh person tested multiple times, count multiple cases? vary state? would thought colony formed religious extremists would end denying facts.


What crazy idea. Lol Even 2% depends are. NYC 2 near NY like NJ rising. mayterif time cases spread here. Yes people ""graduating"" wifes class associates complete. continuing program night BSN, still able get full time well paying work right associates done. Thats fair point. Weirdly think might something we're developing. problem drinking culture training wheels - allowed touch stuff, lot cultures even see adults drink often, sudden 17 God forbid 21 unlimited access it, lot people fail check. seems becoming acceptable talk drinking casually, see people drinking judge etc. think we're developing healthier relationship booze, sense. 
 
The counter argument suppose would drinking probably bad ubiquitous society bad thing. Funny, hospital using masks. We're still reusing n95s too. I'm sure know situation do. Piece shit chief. ultimately symptom larger problem. beginning supposed crisis brought everyone together. ended opposite. America whole divided January. guess would man got machine (or multiple) woman ""nagging"" want lose partner. currently leader fascist. Nationalistic, Authoritarian, uses force suppress opposition. That’s literal definition fascism. You’ve embraced don’t even realize. Honestly, Europeans shut already. Due quicker reaction German government, we’ve skirted past horrific numbers, that’s thanks stupendous population. Wearing masks keeping distance work pretty much America - don’t. can’t count many times I’ve seen mask-under-nose no-mask-at-all type here. 

They’re ignorant people everywhere else. Yep ... divided selfish... maybe, inherently so. like born way, intended.

You vocal minority downing silent majority largely decent people. minority that's empowered day. Given platform platform increasingly free consequences thanks usefulness power. voice drowns decent majority, also tires out. Good, honest, somewhat logical people take much nonsense, become silent majority. Either run down, heavily bombarded information longer know think.

Unless want argue silent climate makes someone selfish. Which, given damage apathy already done America... fair, carry on. European higher education pathetic compared US - expect 18, 19 &amp; 20 year olds. Like trying hold back tide. stopping biology. That's frustrating number deaths around 50k. people commenting flu average kills more... COMPLETELY ignoring fact country complete lockdown time couple months since first reported death! plenty Strong Scary masks one buy. grew near one places. Def resting easier living thousand miles away 80% cops support Trump. 😔 point he's both. machinations put someone like Trump power following example. enables enable him; circle power feeds itself. Trump Republicans new sect loyal itself. Depends country job. Germany get 24 days paid vacations.

Always higher skilled positions. shit Dude western nations LOVE shitting America simultaneously pretending shit stink. 

It gets popular Reddit Americans happy talk fucked country is. leads situation Europeans Americans shit talk America, Americans take Europeans word say problems there. something 1) said Europe needs *make sure* decoupling US doesn’t force hands Russia-China bloc. *did not* say *will* force hands Russia-China bloc. necessarily happen, pseudo-Cold War world we’re heading into, it’s feasible enough it’s something think about.

2) Agreed unchecked American power bad world. Unchecked power *any* kind bad world. now, US pharmaceutical industry give Europe access drugs produce, give Europe drugs *for lower price.* assume they’d maliciously withhold COVID vaccine unfounded. failed us 

Its much government's fault people's. government can't barge homes make wear mask gunpoint. people's responsibility follow guidelines issued healthcare professionals organisations. Germany barely size Texas. we? concerning Democrats caring China created spread virus talking point Trump way Republicans ignoring anything negative Russian meddling. guys civil war gets next superpower completely destroy US. likely correct. thought well Coronavirus. Meanwhile working 55-65 hours week (paid first 40, rest paid)

Were salary? hourly sounds illegal? Maybe men wear hang ears, Velkro

Source: these. hasn’t Barbara Ferrer ~~and Donald Trump~~ resigned yet? She’s done absolutely horrible job. Fun fact - per COVID Act Now, employ 94 contact tracers. That's 4,775 less suggest, less 2% what's suggested. Ahhhh Yet, state nobody wears masks, go lunch, go gyms, go bars, go restaurants, things months yet nobody seems getting sick virus. 

Some still act like it’s middle March disease going wipe entire country. know truth: unless person elderly sick, chances getting sick/dying virus practically zero. 

The experts gave us horrible, conflicting information throughout virus. virus big deal led believe. Whenever mention this, somebody always says stupid shit along lines “you going gym could end killing elderly person asymptomatic spread selfish fuck.” Guess what? elderly sick ones shelter, ones going actually harmed virus.

My state 11 million people lost 3500 people SIX MONTHS virus, living normal lives without masks lockdowns FOUR MONTHS. Close 90% deaths elderly. Tell justified keep state 11 million people locked 3500 deaths half year?

You people really want everyone sit home nothing months years, government foots bill pay people work. people absolutely delusional. Life go on. four months now, people telling state “going pay“ state “sacrificing citizens like sheep“, yet are, entire summer fun activities, fine.

I also think really don’t understand difference “testing positive“ actually harmed virus. individuals sports team school test positive doesn’t mean actually sick going harm whatsoever. Again, individuals scared virus stay home. Let rest us live. There’s going apocalypse, society going fall apart, vast majority people exposed virus zero harm. Grow people.

Also, aren’t losers bashing Sweden? China? Iran? Brazil? Mexico? target United States? know why: bash United States gives opportunity feel morally superior intelligent conservative/Trump voters. It’s pathetic. Yes, big fuck-up. trying precise language backfired.

The idea this, knew percentage people virus time low. knew best bang buck actual sick people medical staff wear masks. knew said everyone wear mask, would run masks none would available everyone. knew told absolute truth, ""Yes wear mask, enough available buy them, save heath care workers"" would cause panic. 

So, said masks effective stopping virus unless it. strained logic, technically true time.

I wearing mask public since February. P95 N95 masks left Earthquake kit replenished forest fires. still riding bus work first week March. work home ever since.

At first, one, given large Asian population bus, given second look (also, mask wearing political issue yet). March, number people wearing masks 80%. Slammed! One many signs ignored, unfortunately. might overlap people believe virus hoax, people involved high school football. Herd immunity absent vaccine requires 50-70% populous infected. IFR US 0.5% equates around million deaths. That's failing. US already 200,000+ excess deaths. That's failing. Yeah every civilization meets appropriate crisis point. Well damn dude everyone planet eventually exposed virus. Watch cases show government orders people back lockdown. purpose? get back “zero cases” reopening?

This charade, lockdowns prove damaging virus.   Lol, coward deleting comments. Probably first time, either.

Edit: watched account get wiped one comment time real time. I'm sure they'll back karma farm ASAP jumping new 3-year-old burner. you’re young marry foreigner that’s I’d lol. give option overseas. sounds like actual skills another economy could use us don’t have. little money saved I’m thinking travel try get married overseas we’re ever allowed travel lol. everyone wearing masks social distancing possible.


The US total far tested around fifth population. missed many people even close stopping pandemic isolating found tests. thing is, big part actually Covid understood. I'm Midwest locally, deaths 50 cases per county region total. Everyone believes flu. THAT'S disconnect is. Yes, problem American mentality impacts approach this. But, also physical context. I'm sitting writing this, mile nearest neighbor 12 miles nearest gas station, 22 miles nearest Walmart. So, there's already isolation place protected people, thankfully, now, seems like brainer uninformed locals get kids back school county high school turned hoop-lah nothing. That's big part we're dealing many areas America. like *roll-out* virus actually takes awhile vastness US, tend pretty insular.  fall telling. deterrent, quantity nukes really issue, need one couple destroy country, twenty destroy large parts continent. actually countries remaining 1,150 nuclear heads powerful others... Hahahahahahahahaha future, able work robots basic job skill, like able use computer general literacy (but before).

100 years ago, people need know type get job. 200 years ago, people need literate. Things change, basic job requirements get expansive time. like strove universal literacy universal typing skills, we'll add basic robot technician skills K-12 curriculum True, timed Russian attack differently potentially would changed alot

They lost alot forces battle, brutal weather conditions (IIRC one coldest winters record) turn fucked supply chains well

Hitlers silly pride wanting Stalingrad symbolic victory Forever? Stop damn dramatic I'm elected official one cities county. I've fighting colleagues every step try make things safer, struggle. vote always starts 2 5, one person argue 5. We've pretty successful persuading far understand default toward safety first place. live Bay Area CA tell mate mask compliance general give-a-fuckery very, low. Americans gave - effort spearheaded idiot chief, sure, bipartisan now. cities it’s really problem all. Everyone 40 least speak basic english. Hahahahahahahahaha can't protect loved ones I'm afraid older boys laugh Unfortunately smart enough figure partly fault, problem begin with. Looks like rally Al Q'aren members. replies ""Come near ill cough you"" kids tough shit get tube shoved they're throat breathe No, people screaming while, called ""snowflakes"" told ""pull bootstraps"" ""get better job"". cared average american now. right, measuring contest, rest world looking US horror happening US apathy all. based data. data show infections imported Norway (and Finland) Sweden. Every Nordic country aimed keep spread low possible except Sweden. Sweden sitting middle exporting cases neighbors threatens suppression strategies. 

Elimination happen Sweden sitting kicking cases, no. stopped that, would much possible, suppression (the stated goal Norway, Finland, Denmark) would much easier. Healthcare would great answer too. Arizona’s turnaround quite remarkable. It’s amazing masks stem community spread. kind reflection country Austria went mask mandates. insane even discussion. can't fathom many people get bent shape mask. simple do. since February across board.

But yet today Alabama people still fighting it. makes sense. Maybe I'm closed minded follow tyrannical leader sends slaughter whatever people think, Jesus, mask. What's hard people understand? STAY AWAY PARTYING ""Safe supportive...""

I guess part tongue cheek. Oh, sure. article titled ""Germans astonished"", it'd made whole lot sense.. (But would astonished rest Western Europe ;-) American agrees. 


We flawed. broken nation. Neither I. Thats stereotyping I’ve ever seen it. Even escalators deadly used wrong. Pretty much anything moving machinery death trap. one answer Agreed. boyfriend's grandparents vacation expense resort campground ""camper"" cost $400k. entire campground occupied rich white folks worship Trump wholeheartedly believe Covid either hoax, real non-white people spread it. certainly hillbillies. Losing profession pretty big deal, I'd say! Maybe real snowflakes infections caught along way see you’re changing argument halfway thread? thing endlessly pisses cat's bag now. Even leadership 180 federally locked mandated mask+isolation, huge portion population going resist they've already conditioned way. 

It's going get better anytime soon. literally damn Squidward meme he's looking window SpongeBob Patrick frolicking outside. two Europe. US Squidward. Good close borders. American millennial, always something deeply wrong opinion. earliest memories include 9/11, patriot act, rampant racism. never doubt America messed up. US elites willing sacrifice rest us keep profits going, obvious everyone now. No. communism? Also, I’m total moron like you. manly deep throat tube live? exist outside circles dude.

I personally know anybody owns Harley, still exist stock options.


Your personnel experiences beliefs hardly ever norm entire country it? LOL, tell I'm little today. Thanks patient :) WHo'S gOnNa pAY It? close. Gottlieb right idea, finish train thought

Yes, knowing target country vulnerable viral outbreaks might overcome attacker's reluctance risking blow-back.

But also means one think world's best pandemic preparedness, belief also overcome reluctance launch attack.

Let's play purely hypothetical scenario then: middle trade war, Global Health Security Index ranked allies absolute best pandemic preparedness, organize pandemic exercise, invite best business attend, come feeling even better. Now, trade war adversary, ranked much lower, exercise far know, stable genius orders assassination diplomats election coming up... USA always fragile inconsiderate, COVID-19 pandemic makes blatantly clear. wealth disparity, social unrest, social inequality lack welfare, military might means little average citizen. takes russia put place someone vilifies allies supports dictators.

I wish collectively world put sanctions US deal issues like adults. infections US CONTAINED US. 

What happen number infected go 50m ? 

You think thats containable worldwide? think americans try sneak across. Private charters secondary locations. Bribes rich wealthy.

Heck theres thousands going BC canada guise sudden trip Alaska. divert canadaian areas.

Americans plague bringers point. USA Today’s article:

Phoenix: Public health experts officials state say decline coronavirus testing last month made challenging understand virus implement measures limit spread. Diagnostic tests COVID-19 dropped average 107,000 tests week late June early July 51,400 tests week July 26. course three weeks July, July 12 July 26, weekly testing decreased half, according data dashboard Arizona Department Health Services. Arizona testing level two months ago. state simultaneously improving decline hospitalizations, fewer new cases lower percentage positive results, experts say continued testing important way monitor virus. # Let's save one almost everyone ignoring. Well, it’s actually like five rules.**  must wear face coverings time eating drinking, including limited to:  waiting seated;  reviewing menu ordering;  socializing table waiting food drinks served courses meal complete;  time leave table, use restroom.  Customers must also wear face coverings time servers, bussers, personnel approach added me, rest quote guidelines included article Donald can't bring say anything indicates flaw himself. ends stating things like ""it is"". 

His personality boxes position cannot accept deny scale problem, left saying ""that's life"". Anyone file lawsuit. getting dismissed moment judge reads cover letter, lol.

Dude, get head ass.

And I'm Austria, Europe. give rat's ass US. guys really need overhaul education system, public healthcare mental health institutions believe even quarter shit posted.

The best thing labeled plaintiffs ""unlimited"", lol. Everyone suing, yay! france blow size france? eloquent writing indeed LOL... think tough catch it?! always expect get reminded flag moon. issues show nature government America much due vast majority regular American people. percentage people completely distrust government large percentage number steadily growing. recent riots indication this. Many us desperately hoping system taken rebuilt ground up.  certainly did. God hate country idiots looking up, yes millennial extends thought. Im seeing 26-41 realize people literally things New Zealand right? difficult, may possible continue interact outside world especially virus situation control. I'm retarded. excuse? Thus comment, genius. could told pandemic. Yeah yeah, bail ass WW3 Where's girl's GoFund college? I'm donating. Show bullies retaliation makes stronger not. Read again.

Nobody would say nonsense ""having bad leadership hurtfull country."" doubt thid position. Yeah, German casualties eastern front ~15x higher western. eastern front already going 3 years point, Germany already waning. first time life, I'm also ashamed American know anything changed became clear, 3 decades life honestly believed 2 political parties wanted overarching goals, slightly different approaches best ways achieve them. Suddenly seems obvious one party's goal improve country, party's goal troll opposition.

What want right anything, politically speaking, given difficult choice two highly competent candidates, even ""lose"" win. Americans aren’t different rest us. It’s leadership. Look Brazil. Look UK. type leader results. Americans totally fine sacrificing freedoms areas life politicized. tolerate strip searches airports, knock invasions homes police, etc. triggered said hole, think stupid people get advice hole like him, nothing science hes talking about, brain damage?  Someone said way back around Iraq War America would really feel effects undertaking (such wasting $7T) 10-15 years later, now. top comment friend Sometimes simple better. Cities enforce policy requiring everyone wear mask leave residences. 

There’s nothing figure out, complicated maps needed. Wear mask leave home, unless live country you’re unlikely encounter people don’t live with. Fortunately know ton folks taking virus seriously really left houses except go store months months. child disability can't let get sick we've gone nowhere 6 months. We're going crazy little bit, we've stayed healthy. Report me... report !remind 2 weeks  This. likely that, Swedish response, Danish response failed give adequate information immigrant communities. Sweden, rates went authorities started smarter approach new Swedes. Hopefully Denmark cues taken that, better info given new Danes. said, sad Danes perhaps proactive domain, ought learned Sweden's failures.


 today Ringsted *one* new case, HUGE improvement basically traced infection limited slaughterhouse
 spread infection Ringsted seems contained, says director Danish Agency Patient Safety, Anette Lykke Petri. one new case last 24 hours, spread infection limited specific workplace, namely Danish Crown true there's 'NPI fatigue' going DK. Lots posts r/Denmark showcase this, widely discussed. People start behaving well now, think, front page news. like there's NPI fatigue Sweden (a links below, many came from), [Sweden's cases also increasing so... problem wear mask everywhere go there. Sounds little like Planet Q. posted that.... Every country underestimating deaths. evidence US underestimating countries would almost impossible make determination every country reports differently. fact, comparing one country another pretty much pointless. count ""probable"" COVID deaths, not. count deaths hospitals. count deaths nursing homes. Etc.

It's even pointless compare cases. Case counts pretty much meaningless without knowing % positive cases identified. US testing lot people without symptoms now, cases much higher country testing people symptoms. mean US actually people virus.

Also, hit Europe 2 weeks US we've already gone hump since statistically relevant. It’s reach group - don’t understand what’s motivating them, fail so. could ask you. Yeah, know Cali Florida Texas closed EARLY. Nobody understanding wave. right time splash back northeast. Yeah I'm super keen ""estimates"" like AZ one too.

The confounding factor whether includes surge ICU capacity new beds turn ICU beds (which I'm sure less ideal).

Not complete picture good data nontheless tell never Morroco. desert. Funding isnt issue virtual learning (although could always better). provided every student computer internet 20% students would appear one time given week.

This, too, addressed funding. Pay children attend school. Pay good grades. Assign tutors. Provide alternative flexible education schedules. Pay parents stay home assist children.

Our goal whatever educators, schools, households need successful. They're great, thought Desperado best three, partial retelling El Mariachi. Also Banderas El Mariachi hmmm 28k tests instead hundred thousand......... 

Lower Testing, Lower Numbers!

How people trust government beyond me.  Went school doctor. THIRTEEN years college residency. $300,000 student loans. 

Government cutting amount ER docs get paid medicare.  
No one going ER Covid. Everyone taken reduced hours pay. 
Now hospitals closing one going elective surgery. 
Half pay goes student loans, can't get deferred even taken taxes ""make much"".

The way get student loan debt die.

Doctors residency make government set $45,000/ yr 100 hours week, plus study time 3 7 years.  Getting $15/hr residency would 100% pay increase! Literally started teaching html purpose. Capitalism can't get scot free here. had/have *lot* people saying ""well, people die, death rate really low, worth open go back work economy.""

Also crapton people believe person's worth defined much make, therefore *outraged* poor people get pandemic unemployment normally crap minimum wage jobs. want limit unemployment assistance cover percentage person's annual income.

I'll also mention shitty, shitty for-profit healthcare system stockpiles PPE many extra beds, things needed, that's money wasted. lack significant hazard pay healthcare essential workers. Tying healthcare employment kind backup plan 40 million people unemployment.

And even then, making mistake directly capitalism fact many communist countries agreed dissenters better murdered tolerated implies inherent feature communism. probably correlation, let people worst instincts define whole system.

Sure. Completely unregulated capitalism terrible idea.

Capitalism quite bit like fire.

Every country communists say people burned (even death!), ban fire.

US place people show we've gained much invention fire restrain all. fact, fireplaces illegal.

It's odd quirk country.

Capitalism ideology ffs, description efficient financial system based private ownership. That's value system, people US take such.

Mind boggling stuff..... What's difference ""cancel"" ""not play""? Europeans always known this. Exactly, currently proven cases secondary infection. Anyone says ""fact"" people gotten reinfected without data.

Now, eventually cases reinfection even SARS-Cov-2 generates strong long lasting immune response majority people. Probably, that's law large numbers everyone going generate response virus. right proven cases reinfection everything stated otherwise unverified anecdotes. Nah doin fine Sounds like western european thing. terribly run places. better, accurate reading America treat state country. terribly run states bring rest country down.

45 50 states definitely first world countries regardless. *Half-assed* precautions key though. could've worst behind us top it. dead lose anyway, however. That's really sad part this.

Like, know specialists making millions dollars current system, would doctors better student debt salaries commensurate upper-middle-class professional?

The fact doctors even laid pandemic, aren’t generating enough profit, argument morality current system. suspect system also screwing doctors. weakness purged humanity, maybe virus bad thing all? Probably like 1-2 months. magically spread every student school day 1. F We’ve come low even option? (Didn’t even know real lol) lack empathy sickening worse Covid. Ok it’s “the government”. It’s government. last one set pandemic response team WH. government disbanded it. last government CDC station I’m China, Wuhan itself. government removed them. it’s virus.

Yeah humans places authority church seem greedy pushing supply side Jesus (look up). I'm still confident faith.

I'm really glad hear church willing able accommodate congregation appropriate, nessicary time. Serious (possibly dumb) question. someone like runs browser strictest privacy settings runs Ublock visits site, harm good? Depends profit margin. mention 12k represents estimated deaths. confirmed deaths. 206 confirmed deaths NY. Seeing many documentaries USA biggest polluter planet, start wars steal oil whatever, care climate changes global warming retreat agreements retreat also virus research funding every time selfish care anyone else, could good opinion before.

Now even worse.

Seeing choose president many common person started WWII made wonder care others really want selfish.

Weirdly enough saw days Youtube tv show called ""What would do?"" surprised many good people there.

Now I'm totally confused good bad country.

But virus problem, would allow enter Europe emergency. Public health experts everyday residents said ""always saw America model"" world

Uhhhhh what? Since European sentiment regarding America? article quotes **one columnists** said somehow concludes ""health experts residents"" also shared statement. shitty article mistake look US uniform entity. 

\[proceeds arrogantly look nations uniform entities\] Pretty reductionist take pretty understandable situation.

Liberals seen global reputation deteriorate years people frustrated. Countries we've strong relationships, France Germany, made disappointing statements ability count leadership. can't understand reasonable person could view negative without immediately assuming hate USA I'm sure could do. live near shipyard busy road. quiet lockdown could hear seagulls water. miss 😔 - 24/25 days vacation year (plus another 12 national holidays)

- ""Free"" healthcare, pay taxes nearly everything else included. Get cancer? Money last thought mind moment

- Great social security net. lose job? still get paid months look new one

- Lower criminal rate, much safer living conditions. school shooting Germany Austria makes national news.. months years

- Better food quality, corn syrup everything. Besides drinkable tap water nearly everywhere. Bonus live near mountains, water awesome

- Better air quality

And list goes on..

As software developer bad thing lower wage ceiling. get bit jealous hear people US earn, Austria Germany get average bit average wage work.

So live US, make $100k+ year smart put away accidents healthcare expenses might better off. long get cancer, lol.

Edit: Oh, forgot:

- Much cheaper / free education. working 4 years paying taxes school got literally paid government go university. Around 700€ month 3 years (and could stretched 5+, wanted get back work getting Bachelor interested adding Master it). Even without getting stipend.. around 300€ semester (for ""Fachhochschule"", universities free, usually. changes every then). Incoming americans bitching can't handle criticism. problem population large US, select people also amount millions well.

Doesn't discredit u/PankackeExprationDate said though son's favorite thing well. could rattle statistics many things. Just... take care yourself. Keep searching happiness, please give up.  ""Why recovery slow"" - guy country absolutely recovery Rest Peace.
i knew name familiar heard it. revealed shit health overall US. fat country. Reminder 50% deaths obese people. find figure overweight people you’re ranger, hope took dogs home lived happily ever talking size 2020 France, 1805 Napoleonic France, 2097 post-War Baguette France? Enjoy paying security detail 99% come really wanted reply comment something snarky along lines of:
I’m sure that’s vocal minority, us want see grandmas friends willing takes, it’s bad apples.

But got back bi-monthly grocery store trip can’t. Maybe 50% people wearing masks 75% wearing correctly.
It seems like many people don’t care can’t understand why.

I haven’t seen grandmother mother 4 months.

I don’t understand citizens US got selfish self righteous. makes sad.

When kid proud US strong helped others don’t feel way anymore. see people yelling rights it’s hoax everything make themselves. Sure good people doin they’re told best society whole don’t understand MANY camp.

Maybe it’s naivety youth cynicism 30s look around don’t like see day day out.

I hope changes I’ll part, worry never used to. It’s bug, it’s feature. else oligarchs going keep rule?

Even disregard part it, I’m still ashamed people here. easy informed considerate. many words describe way country acting right now. headline post nicest way putting it. I'm embarrassed call American point. Honestly article stupid, surface claims sending important message: ""ignorant people wearing masks."" know known months many people wearing masks probably insecure, stubborn, inflammatory, ignorant, etc...

We already know that. article reads like author butt hurt manly men testosterone. one writes article like unless harboring shit. think wearing mask makes look weak, weak. coworker mine (I’m teacher Florida) shared school board’s decision go virtual weeks ago Facebook. acted like happy board members taking pandemic seriously (I’m truly grateful). Fast forward week, posted pictures Facebook weekend trip Disney World, frequently post pictures traveling around state. Whether wear mask not, anyone would chose travel around state right beyond help. China India like 650 million dumb people countries. cultures value intelligence, dumb people running countries.

There dumb people everywhere. USA higher social status smart people. “In conclusion, results study show high prevalence hypovitaminosis COVID-19 patients treated RICU. Higher risk mortality found patients severe vitamin deficiency. studies need conducted larger population, demonstrate whether adjunctive treatment vitamin might effective improving disease outcomes reducing mortality risk.“ Really? country charges millions dollars surgery? country routinely lets people die cannot pay medicine? country people actively decide get treatment die financial burden treatment something cannot overcome?

A country get stuck mortgage sized debt graduate? country working 3 min wage jobs survive norm exception?

That’s even scratching surface.

But real kicker? people keep voting politicians uphold systems, politicians actively try make worse 99,99% population.

If didn’t know something deeply wrong US prior pandemic, haven’t paying attention. correct position.

And yet way anything else said support initial claim. 20 vacation days per year? That's 4 work weeks. 

My job pretty good benefits wise US, get 4hrs per pay period (and another 4hrs specifically sick leave). comes like 2.5 weeks year non-sick-related vacation. No, big trucks colorful reflective sunglasses make look weak. I've never one watching Hockey strongly considered time. encourage Americans stay fit eat healthy *and* wear masks? either/or.

You're wrong, though. could really use Michelle Obama right now. mask rainbow colored hearts cus friend handmade them. look badass anyone says otherwise fuck want argue US never prosperous nation earth, don’t reject that. (Though among prosperous).

Annual GDP growth ridiculous measure prosperity, though. people crazy think crazier people barricade doors light cesspool ablaze. would accomplish almost nothing. virus would return. Eve. long, brutally ""hard"" lockdown delays things.

Australia learned hard way.

South Korea's suppression strategy fail soon; cusp now.

Looks like Japan's already has.

Germany see major outbreak weather changes soon. 2014 WVU graduate here. anyone knows anything Motown, parts remember, parts don’t, students going rage regardless what’s going on. massive spread. Partying do. Fair point. I’m not. I’m arguing general specific. great interview NPR around July 4 younger people experiencing greater economic mental health crises generations lowest viral health risk. perceive politics, etc, largely ignored causes important them. rationally saying GFY pandemic measures - answer “you’re terrible person staying home. might kill someone’s grandma.”

It’s insulting importantly it’s totally ineffective. Get hung specific want, what’s happening **totally predictable.** revised message account - explain it’s *their* interest - *your* interest anybody else’s - comply. even know would identify produce PPE anyway.

This seem difficult me. Can't figure American companies produce PPE (3M DuPont example) help scale manufacturing? also thought. Thank you. :) Turns Ozymandias didn’t much right thought. “I think there’s leadership gap.“

🧐😐😂🤣 “I think children dying, would … different situation, quite honestly,” said. 

Since preventable child deaths done anything influence policy country?  Worldmeter data (cases deaths) promising last week. things getting better sort glitch/shoddy factors play? literally going write beat  fuck must Europe leads world death rate considerable margin Try harder fucking moron. 

The comment PRO China, anti American lol America 4% world's population 23% world's covid death's.

There zero metrics European country worse America. understanding whatever data trying read. work “martyr” culture that’s promoted advertising, social media corporate culture. call sick refuse overtime often get basically blackballed jobs even work hard. They’d way rather employees take vacation time dollars rather time frown upon calling sick. That’s experience least.. Oh, I'm well aware. I've got family rural Penn State country basically ones wearing masks cooped house since March. They're also ex-teachers least partly retired early sick dealing anti-science anti-history shit parents district. seriously. whole killing grandma one silliest overused phrases I've seen here. Yes, know seniors carry significantly higher risk death cov NHL return play/playoffs instrumental mental health past two weeks. Thank goodness NHL bubble solid. No, didn't, make even obvious already was. think CIA shown pretty consistently since 60s America pretty fucking fragile inconsiderate... Yeah. exact copy Swedish situation March. note: Let’s blame specific group contracting spreading virus. would silly. We’re together. 

In Sweden, attitude March bit like “it’s contained specific immigrant groups, ok”. turned quite wrong. 

Let’s hope Denmark population/nation dosn’t make mistake. Also worth looking excess deaths CO, looks like Colorado good many. don’t think liked before, tolerated income. Americans always known loud, rude, stupid inconsiderate. problem understanding U.S. typically considered step old USSR. I'm happy hear family's life improved relocating. Probably amount dumbasses living here. They’ve really come woodwork last 4 years. would say yes, going salon likely means 2 people room. age stratification insane. cohort, .03%, get 60, skyrockets.

""Three keep secret two dead.""

That applies situations. people can't trusted.

Those eager form ""bubbles"" types people bound slip up.  Give inch, they'll take mile. Hm. guess I'm sure mean ""social"" context?

in ""hanging friends throwing huge parties"" social context - holy hell, yes are.

in ""we understand cashiers supermarket providing service need deserve basic rights vacation, etc."" context. check. much so. supporting unemployment benefits, welfare, retirement, etc. fairly egalitarian society lower incidence ""entitlement fury"" US far.

huge family gatherings italian/spanish/greek style similar (I honestly never seen French overly social can't comment), probably less comparison. still tradition coffee cake every weekend parents/grandparents possible. Germans large family gatherings sure, family driving force every get-together. Granted.

But really idea context ""social"" is. Making small talk subway queue it, sure! personally appreciate different. don’t want troll us, want rob us blind. crap distraction. want talk “when lose win...” watch money continue flow rich powerful matter happens. guy mad searching comments again

Fragile indeed, always nice see live case study topic article paid word hour ? would think rational Americans used everyone else laughing us badly government botched pandemic response stupid citizens are.

But still hurts. That's wild. 

I thought states (CA, FL, TX), fast tracking anyone medical get boots ground. Yes Xanax prescription definitely increased last four months. Lol many health directors resigned far country? keep politics sub pls?  Sure, are.

And many protesting countries lockdowns.

20,000 people protested Berlin single day last week...I bet news article didnt ask opinion. Grandmas going extinct year. Sorry love Trump like festering bandaid mortal wound, whole country failing power make executive decisions... de-centralized government damn well 1 million people blame state nation.. many politicians lining pockets Sounds like something dude can't bench 350 would say. Reminds Indian fellow knew told one biggest problems India population large, batshit crazy ideology think millions proponents True. overdoses actually risen due quarantines super sad well. friends program two people know personally died overdoses year. meetings went virtual seem enough them. 

I agree. mentally ""it's fault"" terrible. people jails/prisons even violent crimes. 

I actually vegan couldnt agree more. dont hound people eat meat, think people take look documentaries see treat animals. sickening. inhumane often unsanitary leads disease animals humans. week reddit, *""How America denizens disgusting reprobates""*. Next week reddit, *""America sucks think so"".* 

Repeat ad nauseum. I've never biker hangout thought, ""I wish fucking other."" Yep. reddit anti Chinese hard-on uses every opportunity belittle Chinese/Chinese culture. I'm still sure sarcasm. I've seen much worse. they'd lucky get one game done successfully 6B people world

""Everyone"" uncommon insurance, either. Essentially, insurance agency got fight healthcare network. healthcare network dropped insurance try force issue since large provider area. healthcare network tried pulling thing another large insurance, state stepped threatened pull contracts healthcare provider since coverage stoppage would prevent provider seeing state employees. 

I know really who's right either issue, know matter since cannot afford pay pocket, moot point. theory, though, could actually see old family doctor arranged visit, far feasible permanent option. I've already got popcorn ready. can't wait. really hope come cancel it. Would rather fight 1,000,000 coronavirus sized ducks, one duck sized coronavirus? He's talking Bipartisan dick swinging contest Democrats Republicans. Honestly I'm sick ready new blood House, Senate Presidency. dominant parties children last decade hate realisticly vote third parties like Libritarians help try push down. Worst outbreak world corresponds negative news stories.

Not especially shocking.

The population dumb enough let occur first place understand exactly what's occuring why.

Also shocking.

Onlookers/Europeans horrified spectacle.

Still shocking.

How exactly considering unbelievably hard America fucked up? Trump president, duh feel like often times people mistake idea freedom America “I whatever freakin want, fuck everyone else” really (in opinion) “I anything want, considerate everyone else well” let sit decontaminate time. 4 n95’s rotate go out. go times week, time get back beginning, they’ve sitting days Sports done safely absolutely priority. No, save world. us love screaming TV blow stress, important. facing unemployment eviction way millions others are. think mess ends 21 hours day instead 24, I'll take it. mental health priority.

That said college football far favorite. would gladly seen sports cancelled college football could played safely. cannot. huge difference pro players millions bank opt outs encouraged feel best vs college kids crammed dorms, playing football classes meals without union, money, options. College football never chance play year. 100% support decision. let's lump sports together say priority. NBA NHL good securing players putting good product viewers. cannot wait enjoy 2 months Stanley Cup hockey waiting biggest part nightmare tossed home Nov. 3rd. People didn’t know before? like tryna hide don’t count concern, count hypocritical. essentially saying mental health important others’ health, mental physical. 

Agree shutdown highlighting issues likely already there. lie?

He never dismissed masks.

If talking 60 minutes interview. clearly ""right need"" need 600 cases. need.

He also says, ""I problem want wear mask. keep mind people need right now.""

He claim masks work. premise flawed. someone compare 47 countries 1 country?

Europa might shithole. compare countries countries country continent? Smash Mouth odd hill die on. Dooooooo, showed Americans true colors? 
I'm longer proud country. 
Can defect? Colombia same, trust post Facebook video youtube medic trusted opinion medical studies articles, end, distrust science know use critical thinking goes falsehood ignorance

I mean personally send everybody studies Shi Zhengli bat coronavirus decade ago still believe Bill Gates made Covid-19 chips crap.  Contraception cheaper childcare.

Both irrelevant fucking point I'm glad erected huge argument something inferred.  could use Flint, Michigan comparison Good please wake Europe become power right, stop relying socially fragile country didn’t personally like Warren. thought evasive lot answers consistently fell back brothers, words, identity, crutch, opposed critically facing questions criticisms. 

That thing attracted Yang much. was, opinion, best candidate long time. solutions problems every candidate combined, solution detailed plan would funded, short long term benefits plan.

I would’ve preferred Warren Biden, completely lost supported Biden Bernie Super Tuesday. completely walked away progressive agenda order take advantage political opportunity personal gain, can’t support that. 

Biden 2020, Yang 2024, AOC 2030 path forward Democrats IMO. Biden necessary stepping stone horrid situation currently, Yang progressive hell yet still ridiculously appealing moderates left (due absolute disavowal personal attacks vilification, plus logical way explaining listening), AOC young progressive country needs push forefront 21sr century separate players rest campus. lot schools already athletic dorms anyways. Use those. Classes online make sure training facility locked everyone outside football team. 

If you’re campus 1000s others you’re already putting health hands others. doesn’t change that. need shut move on. silly cash grab trying get teams play SEC embarrassing. I'm business owner too.


 also spent weekend Instagram naming shaming businesses sphere blatantly ignoring mask ordnance state. 

A chose clap back. mistake part. talking someone named ""top_kek_top"". Probably assume they're arguing good faith. (:-]

Ftfy  thought purpose sub monitor spread virus join AMERICA BAD circle jerk agree, true find odd people say want move USA. don’t know reading much interviewers question, doubt confused person would want leave. world knows it’s circus there. wish wasn’t case. considering live Canada follow American politics quite closely, know insane America. Money would never make move there. claim religious freedom infringed. see that. They're told can't worship faith, can't large groups, indoors. They're using bad-faith (lol) argument here.

The government decided right inspect kitchens shut restaurants health code violations. shut-down restaurants freedoms restricted? He’s susceptible, he’s somewhere red dot forehead totally fucked. Porton involved shady shit years. However, google reviews worth read:

""It brochure showed. Pleasant albeit locked rooms, friendly staff petting zoo rather strange looking sheep rabbits. indoors get past check insist theres need go outside again.

The house keep fit facilities great lots doctors nurses standby anyone know HAZMAT means? kept seeing HAZCHEM lot... anyway. bar great cocktails left regretting next day.

The canteen isnt great cant suppose. Ill definitely coming back next year. Although seem caught nasty rash somewhere diarrhoea hasnt stopped either."" condensation top with. 

Must snowflakes. assumed reported antibody test. But, much unknown misinformation could anything else? makes mad, honest. work school too. district didn’t want go virtual, school board voted distance learning governor shut schools anyway. staff administration fighting whether work home not. district leaders community members love examples teachers behaving unsafely posting social media. like throw faces...even teachers aren’t actually *our* district. It’s definitely undermining teachers’ arguments keeping schools closed, even it’s teachers acting way! forget podcast listening outside playing dog someone mentioned college football help laugh go short swear ridden tirade dog really expecting US playing college football.

I could definitely see SEC try play futile point, Hell futile protest mask started happen. haven’t major associate outbreaks bars don’t think? It’s almost house parties private gatherings last month well outbreaks health care food processing plants. hope get infected U.S. like alot countries everything succeed man shitty people. Yes, let's pretend Disney normal business barely scraping by. Looking America singular entity like looking Europe single entity, China. lot nuanced that. 

There's lot extremely qualified, hard working, caring people US. CDC, example, best epidemiologists world. may screwed health insurance system, excellent doctors, nurses, hospitals. problem current administration bottleneck holds everyone back. CDC control operation early stages, federal government quickly put boot them. problem is, president extremely influential. Like not, lot people actually listen him. mixed messaging conspiracies confused everyone. 

The best right work local state level. New York great example state unselfishly pulling together work together fight virus. generally good leadership Northeast. there's much done local level. even choice, chance want get it! Things yet bad global perspective (we surpass 15% infections total population), linger much might find virus wait us settle differences. spent day calling assholes would full time job. also bullied school smart till able get AP accelerated classes. us nerds together better. 

My son gifted intelligent Dad me. called high ranking arts school. always straight often lowest average like 97 highest average 100. also incredibly skilled dance lot achievements that. 

However, get called meetings school told son needs ""Be humble"" tells kids group work sessions wrong......when actually wrong. right wrong answer. right answer. wrong answer. apparently braggart told so. 

His teacher legit wrote humble report card. kid braggart one thing, isn't. knows brings table diminish lie make others feel better themselves. Confidence egomania. apparently school teachers seem think so. told crime family ever speak truth fault smarter kids. 

You seen looks teacher's faces. I'm sorry. reasoning adhering schedule? offer sort compromise? 

My daughter still young (almost 1, started quarantine us 6 months), kind ideal time home her. mobile can't talk yet, obviously, content play around living room work, take frequent breaks hang (my job super demanding right now). goes daycare days week (less handful kids sicknesses far) help take stress massive game-changer, know option lot people's situations. America also founded slavery supremacy white men. never left see. use claims free speech spread misinformation hate. is. Show disputed failing country? read reply. Nowhere say failing country. simply stated incorrectly state democracy. worthless rhetoric? Canada annex smart starts, let Confederate states fend themselves. 40% holds disproportionate voting power. 

Our leader even win popular vote. [His opponent received nearly 3 million he's lost swing states put top Electoral College votes. Real work actually matters immigrants overseas factories. Americans actually *do* anything. ""manage"", means fire anyone points we're actually earning keep. That's Dream!

(I'm somewhat kidding; I'm somewhat not. course, good thing— embarrassment.) empathize you. son left today go US Northeast quarantine friend’s family home it’s campus classes. happy it’s good family safer area campus isolated smaller geez, stressful. looks like one it? Go check poorest parts America tell whole place first world. “everyone”? people want come days countries they’re worse are, probably still believe American Dream. Europeans know better better US lot ways. 

This answer Trump’s question “shithole countries.” Except now, we’ve become shithole country ourselves. agree severity.

And range goes incredibly destructive disruptive civilization extinction life earth. serious scientists saying anything cataclysmic, maybe explicitly working fossil fuel companies big issue they've admitted using adjusted data raw data

False, data comes kinds different disciplines. Biologists, geologists, atmospheric researches, astronomers, physicists point patterns coming completely different observational experimental studies. admitted using inaccurate data.

Also false ""Only weakest ninjas show face."" irony missing apostrophe tho... Europeans get away saying lot things foot bill defense. Ah, ok, return previous stance - cares want? get lunch break within 8-4? work 8-4 expected take standard 1 hour lunch (maybe use 15 min break eat silence door closed) otherwise 8-5. I’d argue need things right want get really strong... know guy happened long time Covid Reddit Facebook wonderful examples. redditors claiming America third world country... definition entitled white bullshit Honestly baffles little time US. work UK get 9 weeks+1 day holiday. also get ability book days aren’t holiday, capped 24 per year 4 per month. work full time holiday days fully paid. drugs alone yield erection. also need mental arousal. US coronavirus sub. Hunger latin america Africa, unrest parts europe, India skyrocketing cases, nothing important. 

US politics baby! Yup. US sucks. Definitely worst country Western world. People starting realize it. doe help making America great again? California addressed bug already said numbers looking accurate soon. saw government official local news day apologizing saying “Californians deserve better.” Belgium (although might inflated bit record deaths), UK, Spain, Italy Sweden deaths per person US. Also San Marino Andorra puny populations. label peaceful protest one care. Graduated college 2011, told I'd able house, get married etc. 

My gf waiting finishes residency doctor makes big bucks us buy house.  Half people work Bangalore area India, panicked. Many low food basically living rice small amounts veggies, say hysteria... worry entire country. Undergrad cut anymore. need least Master's degree enjoy working Walmart. South Carolina 1000 cases first time while. Low test day, percent positive went down, hospital numbers went down, ICU/ventilator numbers went down. Hopefully trend continues. Hey youre ventilator
Get covid on, hospital stay
Hey youre conspirator 
Get anti vax way
And sneezes old
Only young tards wont told also one care coronavirus enough read reddit. silent majority read learn. whine mask infringing freedums shocked Trump? past 4 years? me, determined up-play it. doubt covid-19 virus dangerous flu (then again, face flue *every* year). think extreme prolonged isolation/lockdown passes reasonable cost-benefit certainly track treat dangers society theoretical mitigable less societal disruption (e.g. driving). US surpasses Europe comes quality life, according OECD, UN, Economist, Legatum Institute, etc. never perfect balance.

No one ever said would be. able find mate drives “civil unrest” serious issues single.

I know tell you. shown surplus men leads anti-social behavior. close-to-home example, see ""wild"" west mid-to-late 1800s America initial decade two 'settlement' Australia.

Having surplus men bad thing everyone involved. Tell staff. Nothing hurt “globalism” virus. 

The globalists happy see business normal. want open borders frictionless trade. exactly opposite virus done. 

The real “controlling masses” astroturfed effort get people believe isn’t threat economic machine keeps turning. anyone believe super concerned AIDS trying make oblique point concerned covid? 

Well, here's correct comparison: people get accustomed wearing condoms stop spread HIV, serious problem. people get accustomed wearing masks stop spread covid, serious problem.

Was ok ignore HIV go without condom? No. ok ignore covid wear mask? Also no. Nonsense. thought us LONG time ago. lol thats gonna make fragile ones upset, know ones scream someone else fragile snowflake believing virus political hoax cant figure mask. Yes. know COVID God's punishment teh gayz.

/s realize there's waste water water correct? would give headache even go you.

Also climate scientist, realize read post history right? Lol talking killing grandma? isn't...   



No, stuff posting Packers over-the-line. Gran-gran gonna get visit Packer Trump simply listened experts federal government followed recommendations, world shit we're now. We'd look like Europe. dragged feet every step way, lied public, refused wear mask, threatened governors played politics public health. directly responsible tens thousands deaths hundreds thousands infections never would happened he'd taken seriously. Take exact scenario put Pence, Pompeo, cabinet member Oval Office instead Trump we'd much better situation.

I hear saying, really think huge amount blame needs attributed complete asshole top. meant emigrate later vaccine countries relaxed traversing borders. “So don’t delay, act know, supplies running out
Allow you’re alive, six eight years arrive
And follow, may tomorrow
But offer shun, might well walkin’ sun.” 40% cases asymptomatic move once, move 2 years. never did. like never belived covid real long run, rush reopen (or never close all) hurt far more. Why? shutdown, entire world did. countries suffered financially. 

Fast forward US realize that, US shutdown again, country falls MUCH farther behind countries world took seriously, plan, people stuck it. 

Those countries won’t scaling back shutting down. US - anyway. need new country. Take smart ones. Move one side. Take dumb ones. Move other. enslave dumb ones. Oh wait. Sort like rich poor. It’s moot point hasn’t happened yet. Yahoo Sports also reporting Big Ten spokesman disputing vote even happened. compare country continent?

Europe 47 countries. compare America? I.E. step dad getting pushed around boss, person TRAINED, also younger him. SEC unscheduled meeting dual citizenship great many good things Canada, idea USA without US problems ridiculous. can’t beat stupid. funny hear people wearing masks entire gathering *except* eat together. Eating spreads virus particles air mechanical act chewing. ""safe"" visit family friends, eat home. Obviously work eat drink sometime. Part bars, gyms etc. closed Arizona stores like Wal-Mart started making masks mandatory. Arizona, Wal-Mart powerful state government. COVID sucks. good point. school, relatively little college always got A’s B’s. 


Maybe could pay based attendance participation level. post proves point downvotes citing Swedes lol revealed Person Woman Man Camera TV saying GDP *growth* (what show) people would use measure “prosperity.” GDP is. Ah, run ""ideal meaning"" issue. dealing capitalism abstraction, real manifestation capitalism actually *is* *become*. c*apitalist nation*, reality capitalism.

Its great want pedantic discussion capitalism, maybe could economics lecture philosophy round table. reality, system we've given name capitalism self-identify capitalism, actively killing Americans painful, slow death poverty.

Communism ideal, abstract form everyone equitably sharing piece pie dolled according one's skill level contribution. Communism reality terrible autocratic nightmare state seized controlled assets, preformed mass-cullings political ethnic dissidents, created era fear paranoia oppressive government-police state.

The abstract system's ideal impact reality system practice.

Capitalism current form America killing Americans. ^ troll likely, no. need new vaccine, due virus mutating point necessary, it'll due first vaccines adequate protection (this seems unlikely, too). 

Coronaviruses considerably stable terms mutation than, say, flu virus. virus mutated many times now, even comparing two different mutations, they're still similar enough scientists researchers every confidence vaccine cover all. know ot say make feel better, sorry going that. sounds incredibly stressful. sure wife children grateful everything do. majority institutions broken.

Pretty much opposite Reddit hive mind uses it.... circle jerk like minded sheep like brilliantly put simping children LMFAO Lots great choices. vote old racist womanizer pretends he’s conservative, old racist womanizer pretends he’s liberal. Good luck! /s That’s great 65 million non-confirmed cases won’t know they’re immune definitely line vaccine. won’t know immune isn’t we’re probably gonna vaccinating everyone. 1 3 natural immunity, roughly 1 3 people vaccinate already immune, slowing time takes us reach herd immunity. 

Once get vaccine definitely start see light end tunnel. personally think it’ll probably well 2021 start seeing benefits assuming get vaccine end year. Lol, company closed super benefit 20 days vacation year. aimed double competitors offered. Yup. Lawmakers among group risk, people likely vote seeing policies reflect that. work change maybe yes, Europe is, evident Spain Italy Michigan newspaper ...so else new? might get job accounting. really compare Sweden UK though, surely neighbors better comparison? fair, help complete bellend running show. Diving like stone. really hope they've decided test much anymore. true. think eh, maybe see things here? routinely criticized masks downplayed severity...exactly like big fat Orange did. That's college level thinking bro, know college makes gay marxist. dont need story explain...people idiots Besides Oregon, Washington, California, Nevada, Illinois, Michigan idea. Zorro awesome! Nebraska vs. Iowa B1G championship game confirmed!  compare wear face masks concentration camps

Some Americans lived easy lives inconvenience seems like oppression. experience, they're ones constantly call others weak real grievances. yang stayed running 

yangyangganggang going remind said MLS MLB, remembered : Trump lost popular vote 3M votes. essence, Hillary representative “majority” Say* see picture article either. Yup. try tell us greatest country space time. picked summed first world (Germany, France, UK, Spain Italy) countries compare USA. surprised similar population - similar number deaths, USA many cases.

Sources:  moved Northern Europe mostly higher salaries (make 2x made northern Europe) weather. Den svenska filosofin hos politikerna är att lyssna på vetenskapen. Det har man hänvisat till många gånger pandemins inledning. Den grunden tycker jag är vettig. Att lyssna på vetenskapen snarare än att agera populistiskt är vanliga fall klokt 

Problemet är att det inte finns någon vetenskap om ett helt nytt virus. Så ""vi"" gjorde många, många misstag. Den svenska strategin var vänta och se.. vilket är dumt med ett nytt virus som kan drabba väldigt många. Misread ""detonate mine"" charity.

Wear fucking mask. would say Brittle, addition Fragile. military thing Americans take pride anymore. reminds book, 'Strangers land', ethnography academic Louisiana studying blue collar workers. one point author relates story safety officer chemical plant Louisiana tasked ensuring workers wearing face coverings protect chemicals air. shows made fun wearing mask...by men (who otherwise nice, blue collar guys) pot marks faces teeth, telltale sign exposure chemical they've working with.  correct see point. one, however, definitely warranted. hobbies?  get mean. live Sacramento area, people wear masks, uncommon see groups people walking giving crap. I’ve seen numerous big groups teenagers loitering outside businesses tables masks acting like pandemic doesn’t exist, don’t even get started nuts keep protesting lockdown front state capitol.

This isn’t partisan, class, race, gender, age, religion, etc. issue either. see many people different backgrounds collectively caring.

The way pandemic personal financial loss billionaires causes society collapse point money value and/or economic recovery uncertain lifetime. definitely sense I’m getting. it’s gotten malicious, too. said take precautions reduce risk transmitting Covid 70 year old parents. response? “Guess what? parents going die, anyway.” fuck kind answer that? spider man meme would appropriate here. That's people give fuck far likely outside. observations mean become bipartisan. Massive education reform I'd imagine.

Not accessibility, affordability, quality, perhaps teaching kids early age society functions part it.

Alot really important life skills schools either taught glossed (or expected parents teach you) like basic cooking, finances/taxes, law, government, basic communication skills like formal debate critical thinking. experience lower - low middle class public school.

Of course would take even heavily modified right still massive older population drunk freedom extreme individualism. may quick solution. sacrificing working class economy. They're sacrificing working class keep illusion labor necessary. They're sacrificing working class oligarchs continue make even money. They're sacrificing working class work foreign actors want see US damaged much possible.

But economy. cared economy, would 2-month shutdown would more-or-less back normal now. AIDS avoidable dirty. catch Covid breathing Italian study around 3-4 percent infected needed ""critical care"", assume would mean lengthy hospitalization going ventilator. Link below.

 **Probability symptoms critical disease SARS-CoV-2 infection** Saying ""Trump sucks"" quite uncontroversal educated parts Europe. safe uncontroversial topic, like talking weather. Saying cases risky. looking pretty dumb masks bum, shape L foreheads! sure countries

You're definitely sure countries, France included. Like talking seriously France blow size france

What even mean ? talking making crater size France ? hit every part France ? mean anything..

In 2020 capacity around 217 Megaton tnt equivalent around 300 missiles. Makes whatever size blow since treaty non proliferation nuclear weapons 1970.

...

France agreed treaty 1992... even agreed it, mention limiting size France blow size. So? numbers aren’t dropping. hardest hit country Europe (UK) [even re-institute travel ban France numbers rising like Yes. Decades, centuries “fuck you, got mine” ya. Definitely.

The health department (CDPHE) been, far tell, uniquely transparent aggressive getting releasing accurate numbers possible. March April, undercounted deaths tremendously. May went back added large number probable deaths, still hundreds unaccounted for. worrisome, excess deaths jumped last month - undercounting COVID deaths testing everything. there's way get breakdown county, think would needed go farther analysis (if truly COVID deaths, probably certain ultra-conservative counties simply undercounting large factor). Yeah, I'm basically unemployed thanks Covid, mental health great. think go back losing quality life like that. salary worth it. I'll wait tables. Heck practicing Texas Florida right probably going go well think democrats republicans agree De-blasio shit? Need go on?

Anyway congrats found example. win! 

Literally first major outbreak America. Surely could hope people saw shit show New York April could better prepared say Texas, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Arizona etc. etc. 

No one saw coming! impossible predict dude Europe isn’t marvelously better US like Reddit claims, somewhat better. Robot like reply 2016 election 4 years since already yes, correct - Scotland, NI Wales seem avoided worst governments took action. lack coordination English government governments yet another total failure English government's part. definitely 'United Kingdom'. switch careers, still better dying. Maybe can't catch AIDS simply breathing near wrong person? Nah. try argue 16 year olds. really cool hate authority. Oh agree it, humbly commenting eternal annoyingness america bad circlejerk. Sorts controversial think diplomatic answer ""Non-tangible benefits building life outweigh potential compensation difference."" Gen X older millennials, yes Us averaged 50k cases day recently.

Slowly modern liberalism starting push Democrat party kicking screaming left line rest world. slow process sadly hindered people care people using right pronoun rather helping working class. great thing societal stability! sub less news, politics. get it, politics huge part covid, another never-ending stream ""Doesn't America/Trump suck' posts. mean look OP's post find frustrating, views mostly liberal, shit counterproductive achieving liberal goals. Nothing said, even 100% true (regarding packaging, least, wildly base, course), would legitimate reason callout. simply missing forest trees, Greta was, is, calling serious problem humanity's history, ignored morons. Whether getting help entirely irrelevant substance does. Whoever wrote title alive mid-80s Err, US certainly democracy. Republic comes ""res publica"" meaning country matter public. opposed kingdoms empires country matter ruler, e.g. ""le etat c'est moi"".

There various types republics, since US elections democratic (everyone vote ... ideally), US certainly democratic republic.

Now, voting system electoral college shitty, bad democracy, e.g. votes count differently depending state in, change representatives elected democratically. Must revealing Shrek 5 Let's honest, Europeans already considered us inconsiderate. dropped average 107,000 tests week late June early July 51,400 tests week July 26

It's stocks, economy. economy fails without working class spending money. care money velocity spending ability, care bottom line tends investments. Soon enough run people fire cut costs tax breaks given. know this, live care long stocks went fraction point week.  Thats great reason true. overwhelming majority people wearing masks distancing possible. There's really way us reasonably distance are. first thought heading “American men still resisting wearing pants” I've trauma center every day two weeks now. amount people sit right outside main entrance, even entrance next door cancer center, without masks fucking ridiculous. 

It's strongly enforced inside, entrances closed multiple guards others. IR cameras scanning everyone, strict visiting hours, one person time, sanitizer every 50ft, signs everywhere etc

But step 20ft door people sit shoulder shoulder talking mask, walking around phones mask. People getting dropped picked sit 10ft away, masks, like people high risk. We're goddamn hospital maniacs.

There woman kid sitting inside first set doors night, enjoying air-conditioning, masks pulled conversation. one 18 allowed sat filling little entryway unmasked conversation, rest us walk get out.

Then lady grocery store night goddamn mesh mask. See mesh. store signs everywhere,vthey give fuck. obese least 55-60. I'm goddamn sick this. call people out?

2) ashamed insanity, lie (aka liberals) 

[72% Americans supported invasion [1/3 lied words, 25% Americans lying ***to themselves*** never supported Iraq war, did. lying common Democrats (30%) Republicans (20%) 

Only 25% us opposed Iraq war, basically say roughly fourth us sane. Yeeeep! discovered RA early 20s even though it’s mostly control still fucks life. thought young/youngish people deal lifelong chronic illnesses due Rona complications dealing healthcare/disability fuckery goes really depressing me.

You freedom either take Uber ambulance hospital afford, even can't, take Uber hospital, freedom spend money anything want instead paying someone else take ambulance hospital splinter shit.

You freedom gun, jump right hoops, carry legally defend yourself, also freedom go ahead leave safety police choose. That's one personally like ability choose.

So yeah. Even little post lot freedom gets taken granted point expectation became everything going safe easy would handed everything wanted post scarcity utopia. hahahah It’s honestly healthcare. Can’t imagine spending 20 years build savings wiped 1 accident cancer diagnosis. corporate socialism slap face. hope pandemic curtails bad path doubt tons great people tryna make changes needed cynical side says theyre corona-deniers rather theyre broke fuck took gig make money. said, could also corona-deniers want money, actually wonder that, saving samples is. that's great idea We'll sell loss make volume!

Yes, correct. anyone read article? click bait getting reaction looks like written middle schooler. “Deadly virus” yeah right subreddit man added link below. 

It ranks US lowest category score 23.2/100. US ranked Indonesia, Turkey, Mexico, Iran, China. right Russia, Hungary, Brazil. US seems keeping good company. worried masks mess makeup. great thread him.

It shows LA (Louisiana Los Angeles) ""second wave"" second wave entirely areas built low immunity.

LA also great control 2 hard hit parishes (ie ones built immunity) essentially zero second wave even though right next 1 mask order nearly 7 weeks made difference.


Masks HELP number 1 reason places slow population immunity.


Using different metrics come states like Florida anywhere 15-30% population infected.

He estimated Southern States probably 15%+ infected already.

Even Trevor Bedford finally come around stating US South clearly seeing effects form partial herd immunity. transition inevitable, capitalism collapse finally wrung last drop water sponge. Sorry faith species.   Remind Boomers made nursing homes expensive she'll get die kitchen floor. zero generation caring dies. washing, laundry shower routines probably overkill, quarantining brother makes sense me. retested weekend, came back negative well. still symptoms. Rockefeller cronies really number us...the entire education system set support exactly saying here.

""Just enough education make decent worker, enough recognize hard screwing you."" I’ve worked food retail. fields slightly prepared field healthcare absolute ignorance lies within certain patient population referenced. Certainly including allow educated appreciative knowledge help. Speaking solely regarding wearing “badges honor” even unbeknownst themselves. eye opening experience trust me, I’ve seen lot life lol. days walk away shaking head thinking “I tried best”. Ireland testing capacity largely unused May-July total lack people presenting tests strict lockdown. May amongst highest rates testing world. 

The UK seriously upped game recently though probably comparable, better us know it’s everywhere I’m getting jealous friends south appalled what’s going am. Infection Fatality Ratio (IFR) added Table 1 new parameter value disease severity, replacing Symptomatic Case Fatality Ratio Symptomatic Case Hospitalization Ratio. IFR takes account symptomatic asymptomatic cases may therefore directly measurable parameter disease severity COVID-19.

I'm sure understand cdc getting asymptomatic case numbers from?

Is actually better way understand disease?

If look cases outcome, either survival death, 94% lived, 6% died.  bit weird. say look new cases, go talking deaths.

I'm saying drops history causes 2020 summer holiday. I'm saying think drop summer holiday caused sunmer holiday. April drops relevant here. Kinda sounds like played right. Life change symptoms already know COVID?

America's whole society revolves around selfish. Trust me, I'm American. I've buying 3D-printed masks wear regular mask. Got Sub-Zero Bane.

The Flint water crisis much outcome ""crumbling infrastructure"" outcome Republican cost-cutting, corruption, greed, incompetence. plenty places world lead service lines water utilities manage competently corrosion control measures.

Now think Flint great example what's wrong America terms *politics* mods probably delete thoughts topic.  Ehhh. COVID-19 would revealed ignorance prejudices Europe already known decades now. I’m going go limb say think another nationwide/ societal shut admin. States would forced shut down, causing millions go on/back unemployment. Fed govt made clear want states shut therefore would support states financially. States alone cannot afford economical impacts shutting down. don’t support it.

(For clarity, think real full shut needs happen. support it, don’t think unfortunately) got CA elected leaders Never underestimate selfishness  Article misleading, UK currently worse situation Ireland COVID-19. number confirmed cases per 100,000 takes every confirmed case since case 1 back near start year divided population per 100,000. Ireland started extensive testing &amp; contact tracing earlier UK testing Ireland intensive UK thus identifying cases. 

&amp;#x200B;

So Yes Ireland 'confirmed' cases per 100,000 UK also less severe outbreak UK right tested people per capita. situation counties comparable enough moment article makes sound like Ireland worse situation UK currently not.

&amp;#x200B;

NOTE: trying shit UK make look like Ireland great, calling article click bait headline. Every country response. many European countrys bad job. know would shit USA.

All trying say is, Europa country. best acknowledge continent country. even like ""bad flu"" - much sore throat splitting headache - yet 5 months later days barely get breath in.

As Nick, victim statistics. Shit like happens unfortunately, dice rolled wrong way. Maybe got big exposure it. thought 1-800-blackface? yes, one way another Fox writing ""immigrants/thugs"" headlines.  real quote?

It almost seems prophetic. Bush used fake sense unity trick low IQ fools thinking country united behind could illegally declare war Iraq genocide million people cutting taxes rich. Wow!! sincerely hope card valid municipality else Canada next US someone proud geographical location? absolutely nothing impact care 9/11? Tbf response Covid-19 made look way worse electing him. Europeans, particularly continental Europeans, always said United States. event, Covid otherwise, Americans supposedly one of; times all: stupid, lazy, selfish, fat, on.

The United States geared sort event reasons one significant reason welfare system. Americans simply afford got work, clearly places situation around humans virus get around. Unlike Europe, they'll homeless event go work. United States' balance economy society serves much better Europe scenarios one situations simply doesn't. 

That mean they're fragile inconsiderate. And, course, Europeans swanning around careful get way neighbour. They're not; done grudgingly decent chunk population. done they're told it. easy blame US whole, promise trash south doesnt represent us whole. Ya know, shittiness youtube videos, memes, copupoastas made relate scam spam emails calls use bad grammar purpose. 
 
Scammers purposefully leave errors try make emails look sketchy order weed intelligent people. someone dumb enough think email legit, way likely go whole scamming process. ales scammers success rate go even though response rate goes down. American ashamed pandemic handled. know enough anything make decisions level policy made, would hoped leaders would taken seriously. understand leadership this, would thought least would done something denying covid real. go say ""98 percent survival rate"" dont even mention 2 every 100 people. hard believe. many completely avoidable deaths take threat? wonder many ""Karens"" stupid shit. leadership needs set better example. Yeah actually I’m trying engage discussion something. Saying doesn’t matter anyways kinda stops happening. everyone would stop mating might actually change ways.

But money = poon. that's non-starter. point loud people, immediately reminded saying ""Empty vessels make noise"". leads something friend said, 2 ears 1 mouth natures guideline listen least twice much talk.

Also doesn’t mean people “ignoring” diseases like AIDS malaria. see pair middle age people look like husband/wife couple, wife wearing mask, takes everything laugh man's crippling insecurity. mods care restricting criticism man deserves it.

I referring fact (the athletes) financial investment liability university standpoint. Thus, cancelling season. But, students investment liability; thus continuing in-person classes. hand parents rest life? 40/60 still massive difference. 60% state red blue case still 50% people. Look baseball. seems clear players worried getting it. Half Marlins got sick bunch went strip club. Cardinals casino.

I think players go season knowing get sick, wanting get paid more.

And NFL, necessarily irrational. Average player gets ~3 years make money probably going get extra year COVID.

If average person offered $1 million + COVID $150,000 + still maybe COVID, think would take first option. way bragging smart am? Everybody wants see sports back. like everybody wants see economy back everybody wants able go see concert movie again.

The problem still 100-year pandemic event still ravishing us killing nearly 1,000 people day.

If way safely hold college sports colleges would first ones it, sports would bring much-needed revenue.

It's sad state affairs *corporation* offering support entire government. America deeply broken, point seeming majority people even realize bad really is.

I hoped global pandemic would break idiocy enough bring us together, administration thoroughly dedicated disinformation propaganda, maintaining consolidating power cost, can't happen.

Yeah kinda true sadly, hard respect country minute. safely say people's opinion America taken dive past years. Respect government part it, sure, taking measures protect fellow neighbour, government, couldn’t pull bag.

I’ve heard lot people blaming government, nation people believe much freedom power hands, couldn’t part adhere safety measures protect one another? That’s bottom line.

Why anti-mask movements people general “fuck every body else I’ve got mine attitude”. That’s nothing anyone else yourself. 

Choosing respect fellow man taking every precaution possible front mind. that’s what’s happened people continue pay price continue blame everyone else like kids playground scuffle.

Get fucking grip part. 

There countries around world “bad governments” successful covid outcomes. 

Obviously America country center universe.

It’s poor excuse. doesnt.

Yeah I've seen many people like ""there's correlation obesity Covid severity, doctors fAtPhObIc"" seriously pisses off. *is* correlation, know exactly cause yet. know cause sure mean ignore correlation 732K people died far.

I mean specificly, meant ""you"" general person. I'm ranting frustrations building while. clear that, sorry. find baffling many people taking virus seriously knowingly putting *and others* risk safety recommendations (admittedly limited) data currently conveniently fit world view. Obese people ignore fact risk category bad people refuse wear masks imo.

ETA: mention specificly regards measles that's bc think contributing dangerous mindset many people already subject. subreddit horse shit. Can't even say Pmurt's name post gets deleted ""being political."" even talk shit China. gets flagged civility. place people learn considerate school COVID-19: ""Ohhh look, open buffet line"" worst part whole ""myth personal responsibility"" even self-proclaimed progressive/leftists bought hook, line sinker.

You see time sub example: ""If everyone wore masks (and stayed home felt sick) would 100% over. dragging selfish idiots!""

No one mentions fact still ability test enough test results take much long, there's real contact-tracing, there's real legal practical help isolating, many people afraid cost seek medical helo even insured!

These things distinguish America Europe everykne wearing masks eouldn't change damn thing that. fact, many countries got kept outbreaks control without masks. hate time travellers comments section.  Yeah man copy pasting paragraph really took toll there’s actual pandemic government tells us take precautions, it’s there’s pandemic. Think horses, zebras. 

Unless forgot s/. using Trivago hotel data, article/analysis missed people camping instead staying hotels motels.  kind lot. think it, knowing what’s gonna happen can’t stop horrifying. Especially tremendous scale. picked shitty year get sober. right wrong. It’s maddening snake eating tail. Bingo. Yet wearing mask picture. Basically he's saying teachers, children families go fuck themselves. think problems specific US though Europe issues many similar Wow, that's cool! I'll check out. lot Americans get badly America's reputation crashing recently, impact future.

Though, mostly glorious leader incompetence willful blindness Republican party. real kicker? people keep voting politicians uphold systems, politicians actively try make worse 99,99% population.

in middle pandemic, ""left""most candidate we're supposed vote even support single payer healthcare said he'd veto even miraculously passed

it's hopeless country know understand deniers big issue USA.
But understand everyone trying optimistic good news denier wan wear mask thinks vaccines 5G send us hell. literally used whataboutism swap valid point Cali point Orange County noting people doom gloom attitude baseball, turned come true. Again, I'm trying make comparisons two sports. know hard guys comprehend. confirmed Republicans charge especially disaster. like Bush hurricane Katrina. incompetent stupid.   well fair, German resident paying taxes Germany (as must, resident) actually pay taxes US barring special cases (eg rental income property US). yeah, file anyway ROYAL pita.

The bigger problem due FATCA special US investment/taxation laws, can't invest Germany. ""US Person"" (citizen green card holder) cannot get brokerage account buy stocks, can't buy mutual funds, even retirement accounts bar americans participating anything amounts annuity-like investments. Financial institutions want risk reporting errors subsequent fines US investments simply turn US persons away.

When FATCA first beefed around 2011/2012, banks kicking american customers curb reporting nightmare. Thankfully stopped (it's illegal ban people normal bank accounts due nationality) investment blockade remains.

It's joke - important reason ditch US citizenship. absurd obnoxious future financial security risk simply I'm US citizen. [""Dr. Anthony Fauci says chance coronavirus vaccine highly effective ‘not Scientists hoping coronavirus vaccine least 75% effective, 50% 60% effective would acceptable, too, Fauci, director National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, said Q&amp;A Brown University School Public Health. “The chances 98% effective great, means must never abandon public health Food Drug Administration said would authorize coronavirus vaccine long safe least 50% effective. Dr. Stephen Hahn, FDA’s commissioner, said last month vaccine vaccines end getting authorized prove 50% effective, it’s possible U.S. could end vaccine that, average, reduces person’s risk Covid-19 infection 50% effective vaccine would roughly par influenza Yes would need infect 70% herd immunity takes effect. 

This assuming preventative measures taken.

It happens lots preventative measures happened. Lockdowns, social distancing, reduced mass gatherings, mask wearing. 

And despite prevention happening USA still seeing 70,000 confirmed new infections every day.  Edit: seem want link it, click ""Hospital Bed Usage &amp; Availability""

Where seeing drop current hospitalizations? freedom making $7.25 hour, call Uber instead ambulance get hospital, afraid public need conceal carry walking around guns body like it’s 1855.

Really, freedom poverty fear really offer?

The right wear mask? 🙄 less. Criminal negligence really. That‘s exactly difference. example vacation time 6 weeks de facto majority German employees get. Sure different rules different companies, minimum would 4 weeks defined law. Masks. little respect government decades. Respect journalists actual news (versus opinion driven cable news subject 24/7) almost non existent. people inherently suspicious everything told leaders TV talking heads, would us surprised. Yeah. Apparently that's *why* elected him. makes feel better, us feel he's symptom less disease. :( Hooray? Oh cmon introduced world Republican Party followers. 15 people pro basketball team plus handful coaches, trainers, on. 55 people football team plus dozens coaches, trainers, etc... that's different how? lost spouse before? boiled two words: narcissism selfishness. yes know mean pretty much thing. Vote Dump dumbass command November freedom run business, wear gimp mask, actual social contact, gather socially etc. Yes, heathens, communists etc previous excuses dummies like always believe give freedom for. get closer election, pressure announce vaccine approval. approval, quickly, entirely due political pressure. months later, actual science (clinical evidence) might exist.  expect heated debate vaccine announcements, end year.  attribute announcement vaccine result, outside JAMA similar journal, pressure.

Having said that, clear single-dose vaccine easily delivered one takes multiple doses. Many people say ""I vaccinated"", get first dose.  would good statement true. Motley Fool, MarketWatch...none news. gross speculation best nature. I've wanted move EU long time. Way shit show president. Mainly appreciate culture people. Wife can't even move city born in. 

Now? think they'd want U.S. immigrants even loads work experience. sucks. worst us painted rest us like bunch ass backwards cavemen. sad part is, can't blame anyone perception. bet watching news seeing us like seeing sad circus. could posted comment saying entire people infect subject? think? can't wear mask reason go enclosed public spaces. understand reason can't wear mask mean spread coronavirus. love Disturbed's [Greatest lived easy lives inconvenience seems like oppression.

Hit nail head one. family would benefit reading book, bought them. sits unread. family dead. Whether pay delayed tests not, get set number good tests depending capacity provider. difference instead paying large number delayed (and thus irrelevant) tests, paying useful tests, thus saving money. Further, labs delaying fresh samples order test bad samples older sample arrived first, end effect increased capacity since longer wasting capacity bad tests.

It's upside everybody lab owners, really significant downside (since would still operating capacity making nearly much money).

Also, capitalism great finding solutions problems, properly incentivised. want good test results fast, incentivize good test results fast, quantity test results. private companies incentivized grow capacity, possibly using creative methods like gathered required machines lab space universities others sitting mostly idle, minimizing problem production pipeline new machines. remove lot stuff left. run right-wing mods, right-wing president screwing things up. 

So means lot censorship. US tests per capita fewer deaths per capita prominent European countries. 

Sweden basically refused shut basically COVID-19 now. narrative always America sux, matter what. punching bag always hand assistance us. 

This perfect nonsensical propaganda reddit though. must driven home like leaf wind. Used Harley market going plummet end September. Literally every instagram-story see europe full people crowdiing beaching without masks anything.

I know europeans think they're better - anything whole mask-usage seems way way way worse europe. Yawn... Better better worse. Mediocre light-years better terrible. Sweden’s plan seems less disaster UK’s plan,

[""Sweden's plan said Tegnell UK pursuing herd immunity, led disastrous death toll.

For record Sweden's death toll one highest world reason worst neighbours work do: lockdown limit spread. I'm working time, work 8-4. take lunch, always bring lunch eat desk. rarely able leave 4 anymore. *analyzed* 6,000 tests yesterday. know many people got tested yesterday til later week early next week. better visualize going might help imagine terrorist taken hostages killing one time demands executing hostages rate one every minute one every minute half. 24 hours terrorists demands everyone wears mask, keeps distance, washes hands stays home much possible. also want negotiating terrorists though time took read kicked corpse someone's grandpa roof show mean business.

We need get Bruce Willis this. think global shortage medical staff, US shortage.

If every position rank filled capacity, probably work long hours here. would nice government kind guidelines overworking professionals want overworked... Maybe like deserve good life contributing society.

Nah, money enough compensation, right? Also US healthcare system care you, cares dollars. fewer people payroll means savings.

Welcome system. Please don’t downvote person. 3-4 weeks ago, Florida opened hospital census site. found peak, 9000 people currently hospitalized. It’s 7000. DOESNT REFLECT BIAS OKAY?! see mask? thought saw one, inspection decided graying beard.  Well, everyone needs lobbyists. one speaks group, get ignored. lobbyist oil industry, protecting wilderness, clean air, thu auto industry... lots choices. want one, respect they're necessary, particularly groups generate lot money nature (eg pro clean air....) Interesting put responsibility teachers rather federal government. federal government plan? olD pEOplE DiE!!

The thing Americans agree don’t care foreigners think them. sweden suffer finns comes sweden goverments? *Everyone* wants return old lives/habits. problem refusing put work locking temporarily we've drawn caused deaths. could 90% back normal instead we're stuck endless cycle things closing reopening forced close many people needlessly dying hospitals packing dead semi trucks. 

Ignoring scientists infectious disease experts helping us return normal. Reopening things safe helping us return normal. Reopening schools safe help us return normal either. making everything worse.  going die something too. good moving sooner....or good later?

Selfish twat. Mike DeWine, Ohio. American.... took covid Europeans realize that? Sorry smell sarcasm.  lucky input .  Bless heart. Learning German now.
Aspiring Software Engineer.

Any advice/tips? I'd argue need one third party. 

That's meant, sense need least one third party, even better system independents form caucuses based interests alliances rather syndicates like present would take large structural changes 1/3 country pride little want country change.

The part 1/3 actually Russian propaganda.  media makes seems like number people wanting things regress much larger - remember radio, TV, print media owned vanishingly small handful wealthy conservatives.  

It 1/3 US population that's fighting change, much, much smaller number people lots money presently power. generation runs country ones came power 1960s 1970s, they're still clinging it.  going change sooner later, even time old age it.


This decline going decades, reversed one election one administration.  November, Trump loses. four years that, Democrats join him. Smart choice. course one place get along accepting bribes. Conspiracy theorist lol US citizen here. true. Even constitutionalists bucking though, knows could happen November. Things might sparking ignition... think bad now, wait people roof head food hard come by. already have, thanks advice. absolutely like around. Perhaps job markets like am. Yes bad jobs exist, bad mindset keep person looking. plenty jobs largely reasonable. humanity-changing work, wide gap shit job. really brought worst worst woodworks. Turns America isn’t thought America governed highest bidder.

It's simple complicated vote dollar capitalist society.

Buy invest wisely. 

They're looking me. I'd say started dying Vietnam War take account deaths happened. Europe hit earlier knew much virus. US could contained NY major hotspot. US' deaths happened since much better treatments learned prior experience Europe NY, course result lower eventual deaths.

And there's quite lot complaints Sweden saw. Literally one cited epidemiologists alive ok. Happy y'all. Stay safe there! Doubling delicious irony, delightful. 20s isn’t finding forever job. It’s building resume getting experience. quality resume, finding jobs becomes MUCH easier.

can confirm. taking serious

What mean this? would count someone taking seriously? We've also routinely making fun people smarter us. mock intelligence US. defend education... make fun guys open anything. mock women dress ""slutty"" could anything tank top just.. regular shorts depending here.. were.. fucking stupid people. Americans fucking dumb think ""feelings"" opposed critical thinking skills. generation teach kids ANYTHING makes fun kids knowing things failed teach children... alive I'd say definitely lost cold war.  Nice rebuttal mate well done Norway death toll....

Btw fuck country.. well lockdowns.. economic whores... least admit it.. disgusting thing is... sweden brigade doesnt... yuck

Edit: even wont take money you.. farm...sea... animals love life... north... lol  Temperature checks effective TSAs security theatre. patent law made decide soulless job? We’re also attack. Many intelligence reports saying Russia actively working cause chaos country. They’re canning flames sides every opposing viewpoint. They’re working turn conversations hostile confrontations. They’re enabling supporting stupidest amongst us. America alone serious problems anti-intellectualism, racism, poverty, host issues... attack deepening divides making everything much worse. Paired president enabling attacks, it’s wonder we’re bad.  Wtf going American bashing posts? I'm European assure thinking. Getting bound higher skilled positions. depends company offering. give least 24 days, rule higher skilled jobs get days. electrician say really highly skilled job, 30 days. bosses.

I luxury larger guy, easy laugh criticism without feeling unsafe, really pity anyone feels need conform kind horseshit solely peer pressure fear ostracized, worse. 

Anyway, clear United States survives Trump/Republican/plague crisis-trifecta, still *lot* growing do. Nobody gives shit europeans think  would require advanced planning think people Sweden actually put pandemic. least early outbreak, killed elderly hell it. yet guys changed conservatives

lol 

Weren't guys party Reagan opposed Russian influence guy busy shitty NATO trying get back G-7 nobody else want's Russia there? reminds 21 Jump Street movie they're shocked caring cool now. definitely reaction see high school kids today.

My high school experience bunch dumb, angry rednecks maroon Hollister hoodies calling emo kids ""gay"". Yes, far worse. brutally exploiting 99% get handful scraps .1%, that's bad gets.  thoughts too. Saw year tow ago free concert county fair, I'd say even 1000 people attendance. Divided States Snowflakes taught independent, quite interconnected (I ... flip phone... medical school) fortunate STEM / Medical degree allowed build practice, though headache COVID times. lot new graduates finding jobs big medicine conglomos they're essence physician employee, without much agency, another corporate structure. 

I suppose I'm edge Elder Millenial (though not, I'm 1982), always taught work hard, keep quiet, forego needs since 'the future' better, want matter quite much would help rest world keep ticking. wonder that's Gen X thing? second-generation immigrant thing...

Being quiet things feeling overlooked pretty strong feels me. Even that’s bullshit.  would great premise movie. alien invasion, America unify instead squabbled amongst aliens picked us one-by-one. Continue staying healthy friend. much would like go visit family friends, health always number one priority, plan continue staying safe. think that! I'd love simple answer you, even federal regulations books (Code Federal Regulations) 200,000 pages. laws covering practically every aspect lives, gets enormously complex. I'm describing general trend, undemocratic management economy, wealth coalescing major corporations directed government, obviously creates unequal distribution wealth. would lot fewer laws effect, would means even created politicians available corrupted. Eventually think idea ""laws"" would evolve lose fixation negative reinforcement punishment, start see society collectively deciding individuals would conduct individuals agreement. think anything it... they're dumbasses wrong?  Everyone realize Donald Trump Barack Obama united belief Americans die preserve profits healthcare companies.  leadership evil, cruel, corrupt. sides. bad.... fatigue, body aches, slightly sore throat digestive issues mainly.. hot flashes followed chills... im concerned im getting better yet... im really really tired Oh no! deserve that... man, live area almost one wears masks pretends issue. Half think hoax half says great they're wear mask public post endless photos hanging friends family nonstop distancing masks. sound embodiment internet regurgitated lines.  Rant: work retail say ""deep cleaning"" statements kind bs done all. night listen PR announcement we're cleaning valued customer 1st 2nd dealing customers, assure 3rd, I'm on, time clean anything even stores closed. continue normal, big stunt. keep hoping end company lands huge trouble actual inspector drops surprise visit.

It's gradually starting annoy people shift I'm like second 10+ people bother wearing mask goggles, colleague freely coughing sneezing aisle me, without mask. us simple temperature checks accurate actually be? care/grieve around 53 times amount killed relatively recently? probably beyond fixing point. ""its us them"" lol  source. posting lies read conservative media post. It’s getting hard them. Plausible (though inaccurate) bullshit hide behind getting harder scrape situation worsens. lie brazenly fewer fewer meaningless context positive facts cite support “its bad” Totally agree. would suck balls I'd definetely want go i’d rather suffer crippling, life-ruining side effects covid get autism vaccine it

is i’m assuming fucking idiots thinking Look curve. see summer holiday starts. People want money. people money. agree gross country money literally thing keep alive matter all... yeah surprising all. why? schools r opening shuld pick one observe masks new ""soybeans make gay""  LMAO this, mean care country thinks we're handling this? handle however want to, we. I'm start month vacation 40 hour week engineer job. Germany's work/life balance best!! I'm 21 cautious kind mention it. Absolutely agree. I'm going vote one *didn't* fuck entire country grossly mishandling pandemic getting hundreds thousands people killed, see sides bad. much harder bribe many officials. Sure, places still lie least realistic number emerge giving right now. Still, would difficult pull many people afraid lose jobs report numbers. possibility find there. ones seen case study 2 3 spread droplets, would explain spread downwind index patients could blow back infect people upwind them. appear opportunitistic, requiring artificial air circulation loop, prolonged exposure, presumably airborne particles carry less virus larger droplet particles. eager results study. 


I'm pretty sure answer spreads area people like me. work closely spec ed kids (we small class placements regular classroom). work 30-40 classrooms week across 4 schools jk-12. I'm pretty sure super spreader. Morons gonna moron Tell it. CDC recommended everyone wear cloth face covering people rushed buy/make them, wrapped double layer cloth around nose &amp; mouth waited.

Waited science. knew they'd testing could make really good masks.

And homemade masks are...

* Made material lab tested almost N95 filtration
* Designed pass respirator fit test

Plus, Florida, one Covid-19 hot spots, made masks extra layer material. figure three layers went zero almost N95, four layers probably give N99.

Wearing mask eye protection helps feel lot less nervous. Things gotten lot better since business stepped done government not...it's businesses requiring face masks. many people around still wear pull get store.

So knowing PPE lab tested work, certainly makes feel better. imply talking weekly average? referencing overall, obvious. want compared Brazil/India. country way richer, way better. Germany population 80m, Italy 60m, France 60m, Spain 40, Sweden 10. Throw England 60m approaching population US, similar living standards. dealing well better countries.  Mostly sheer protein. Repeating action thousands times get there.  missing point boy: already politicized. way discuss without politics. choose this. ""How'd get corona?"" 

""I wanted see smash mouth"" Pointing something attack dude. Rofl. feel attacked school teacher pointed spelling mistakes? 

She control social media. write speeches, can't even answer basic questions real time. used parents see that's sad. assume mean worth death rates. sure, agree 100%. Utah 1 10,000 death rate. Wyoming like 27,000. really fair lump New York.

Because we're using word ""scaling"" way.

You're using say ""you using B bigger"" I'm using say ""if want bigger need disproportionately use B maybe even C"". congrats idiots  Deaths per capita Florida still pretty low.

Wear mask wear proudly!

It's difficult change culture esp. one focuses male masculinity. 

Funny sad thing is, women make fun men machismo want men 'be masculine', however defined today's societal norms, contradiction itself. think I’m handling better think I’m going fifth year anyway since I’m adding minor like guess I’ll year “make up”. man I'm single mean I'm desperate asshole. want date anyone can't spend couple months inside, I'm upper midwest fuck's sake, every winter. univariate analysis, association blood type peak inflammatory markers (peak WBC, p = 0.25; peak LDH, p = 0.40; peak ESR, p = 0.16; peak CRP, p = 0.14) blood type clinical outcomes severity (admission p = 0.20, ICU admission p = 0.94, intubation p = 0.93, proning intubated p = 0.58, ECMO p = 0.09, death p = 0.49). multivariable analysis, blood type independently associated risk intubation death. Haha that's america sure. shit show Nothing puts man faster dude who's endlessly got something prove masculinity. kinda insecurity always spells trouble bumps road, least fact almost invariably look women - whether say outright not, always comes behavior anyway.

The asshats US refuse acknowledge role fighting pandemic unique US. Look around. never saw animatrix Positivity slowly trending well, sub probably good conspiracy theories well. Big Ten cancelled, think might get NBA. true tyranny country, would afraid even posting here. 

Assuming Reddit would even exist available United States. haven’t seen protests like Nordic countries aren’t recommending face masks either. 

I personally think it’s good seeing this. Democracy work. hopefully pressure agencies governments Nordics Netherlands build create face mask recommendation. It’s warm, juicy, tight! Supposedly. yet “elected” despite actually acquired majority votes. even votes opponent! Hardly legitimate representative sane definition. US right now, 5x likely die coronavirus car accident. MAGA brains reacting complex tools fire. leverage call bluffs they're harder replace confirm.

So, 30-40% so. one thing never ask American it’s change mind initial opinion... That's American. Threaten person exposing stupidity. punish righteous reward evil. nation falling fast. doomed genuinely think America declining rn??? America seen 10x worse what’s happening rn Noooo, sexy! problem population large US, select people also amount millions well. representative entire population, enough population itself. like players/coaches call bluffs regular students. students refuse come class, get kicked out.

Obese physically fit. yeah sure everyone NFL healthy let's go that. Makes everyone feel better suppose Hey hate orlando too. start club thought pretty clear covid Well, idk fragile, definitely inconsiderate. remember perky teen Commando...She'll Back! realize many dying chunking “people die every day, what” “my friend died car accident covid positive said died covid didn’t” (heard like 6 times trouble buying it). might not, absolutely problem multi years policies completely thrown window election specific US president.

Remember: see Trump trend anomaly, systemic broken system. long US can't properly reform election system, way trusting US long term ""stupid"". Covid unique characteristics look for.

-""Happy"" hypoxemia, meaning people low blood oxygen feel short breath.

-Shortness breath &amp; cough despite ""clear"" lung sounds. SARS-CoV-2 damages lining lungs early on, sometimes body even starts react producing mucus. get people complaining feel short breath even though sound fine stethoscope.

- ""Ground glass opacities"" seen chest x-ray. That's pattern usually seen flu kinds pneumonia.

-Evidence blood clotting. Highly elevated d-dimer, alterations blood coagulation panels.

That last one especially really unique Covid. infections cause blood clot like Covid does.

So seeing several things together negative tests flu, RSV, negative bacteria sputum (meaning bacterial pneumonia), history possible Covid exposure, pretty certain dealing Covid. country talking ? really feasible though. location world locked 10 weeks consecutive. Lockdown fatigue real thing people heavily breaking late may early June. 10 weeks come new plan lockdown csnt Impending comeback “all dad hide couple weeks dad dead dying COVID anyway” Welp, optimistic. 163,077 according Johns Hopkins Idk man, dying seems pretty weak me.... NFL would work bubble, series bubbles. NBA killing right now. believe American office workers begin work 8 work 5 5:30, 1/2 hour 1 hour unpaid lunch. generous Europeans noticed Americans since COVID American checking in. 


I literally cannot believe still can’t get shit control. might temporary telogen effluvium, could caused stress, pregnancy, losing weight, perhaps major bodily changes like illness. Maybe miss something pretty sure (my country) American military protection. anything military protects pope!

Not sure mean economical protection, stated barely import anything luxury U.S., however import lot medical stuff us. ""you"" ""most us"" claimed. It’s youth. took subway yesterday people ages ethnicities wearing masks noses chins, subway cars even crowded L shuttle bus.  including multiple obese, middle aged people extremely high personal risk there’s second wave MTA workers uniform. really think it’s lack basic education - average New Yorker doesn’t spend time subreddits like probably never even proper health class. going specials outside think smart start. also works well easily cancelled poor weather. Local governments encourage outdooor patio restaurants...They closing public streets setting tables outside nowhere near six feet apart.

Also...Gavin Newsom. He's one responsible. lock down, temporarily shut, let guard down.

To hell Newsom re-called. TBH immediately think Interview Vampire, could due many times I've watched WWDITS season one. That's I'm saying. drink misery pointless celebration, dont cultural connection. results nihilism.

I never meant countries dont heavily drink, social structure it, really don't. Since February Ah true! Definitely could worse. agree said. one cannot deny excess deaths occurred Karachi Lahore ( that's data found /r/NoNewNormal 

may god help us all

actually send floods problem! Always good ask sources no, 100% right, bad example part.  Man eve mandating masks grade 4+ would go long way toward helping stop spread even seems hard America be. I’m saying said take seriously. I’m putting discussion mortality rate context: artificially low, ability make higher. wonder could still residual affects shutting places hurricane. cant imagine places get started back running full capacity flip switch. Don’t really care Europeans think right now. Point laugh can. remembered.  'unmasking' will. send kids sitter's school starts back up. They're 2 4. wife work (she's teacher) can't care kids work. There's nothing except expose stupid virus. In-laws parents can't help us. can't split-schedule work. There's right answer fucking sucks. I'm sick government bullshit ""You citizens deal it."" fucking absurd. Divided States America. unity this. Every state raw dogging entire thing complete shit show. Federal government completely useless fact counter productive damaging. Still dealing loss taste smell diagnosed Covid May. Doctor doesn’t seemed concerned. I’m losing hope. guess obese too. FPH needs come back US bad, Europe pretty bad well. I'm British Chinese person lived Asia Europe.

Not sure Europe take moral high ground though also hit bad, governments failing protect people. Okay, many conspiracy theorists 'freedumb' people still, loads people going partying, caring anymore. 

would interesting see US media outlets report Asian society views Europe America context. repair buildings destroyed

This terrifying threat. Yes, may die, children grow houses need torn replaced every 100 years went Zorro? oof.  Thanks shooting explainer! incentives bad U.S.

Republicans know (from experience 12 years ago) that, electorally speaking, better taking loss election tanking things badly Democrat takes able fix it. voters reward this. Also thank saying ""MLB"" instead ""the MLB"". 

Huge pet peeve (though get people say it). prove grandfather fought hitler, hitler. I've seen bunch. Even CNN front page. silly narrative push groups affected disproportionately. like writing article whites targeted racial attacks. true insensitive men minorities dying disproportionate numbers. Downvote want. Bunch losers Reddit trying push agenda women always suffering case opposite. Someone posted article saying men dying people comments jumping conclusion men chose mask up. proof this, assumptions blame victims dying. strongly agree that, surely males care seen strong,

the best way would care others

Thats' started societal trend tough men, protecting people

Wearing mask protects women, children men nation

Avoiding masks may harm/kill ones care every definition word, weakness rather lack testing U.S. back then. U.S. magically shielded virus months. Lying coffin looks pretty weak. According Democracy Index, US rated Flawed Democracy. Trump, depending next election, would surprise see slide Hybrid regimes** nations regular electoral frauds, preventing fair free democracies. nations commonly governments apply pressure political opposition, non-independent judiciaries, widespread corruption, harassment pressure placed media, anaemic rule law, pronounced faults flawed democracies realms underdeveloped political culture, low levels participation politics, issues functioning governance. think you’re unrealistically cynical. live meme state Florida 99% people wearing masks. Like you’re plain wrong. 95% people country decent people trying get make living. You’re falsely led media we’re living hellhole.

We definitely got problems need fixing, say people selfish always “fuck you, got mine” doesn’t seem track experiences I’ve lived 8 different states every corner country well middle.

The internet makes selfish idiots seem larger are.

The people fine part, it’s system needs restructuring match people actually want need country function. unfortunately, there’s much great options offered candidates lead change.

Everyday people trying best family. don’t time energy care anything else. can’t afford channel energy anywhere else. Mood.

Also, water wont kill like coronavirus could waiting coronavirus demonstrate ""looking weak"" like?  understand view; however, democracy. would mean everyone United States could vote legislation vote political candidate.

[This decent, albeit elementary read Calling STEM always misleading. really meant one big 4 engineering fields (Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, Civil) computer science. people fine. fields STEM better than, dunno, theatre major, work reward ratio still terrible accountant definitely stable jobs wise. Like, chemistry major studying organic final, nobody tells BS chemists bench chemistry jobs (in words, actually chemistry sales, etc. chemical company) lowest job satisfaction rates entire economy. ~$40k/yr job creativity, little upwards mobility, could honestly done robot fine motor skill constraints. Biology even worse lot (I want say roughly order magnitude, can't remember), actual work labor efficient means fewer jobs. Things change PhD level fields, frank, BS science know enough science actually it, PhD programs tend pretty competitive that.

I say STEM jobs tend recession proof jobs. tend core parts industries make core commodities. Like, 3M going stop making tape there's recession, 3M still needs someone tests whether particular lot correct mechanical properties. honestly understand built one humid, intolerable, shitty places Earth. assume tax reason. went one time part class trip high school, wanted blow brains out. humid heat lines miserable.  know does?

Humans lose hair. taking whatever get. city shortage back March-April, hospitals taking mask donations, N95, KN95, surgical.  Again, helped didnt single handedly. Lets talk US country first place due European colonisation French Spanish helped American revolution shall we? wearing mask fix though. record, hate trump this, I'm totally agreement universal mask usage. said, close universal mask usage still helping. need something else.

The biggest con ever perpetrated working people USA convincing identify powerful wealthy, rather one another. need third party

I'd argue need one third party. need enough break Republican Democratic parties smaller factions - center-rights center-lefts extremes. honestly know enforce nation-wide level. thing could maybe dissolve parties... how? Like...

Seriously. know we're getting situation. would take large structural changes 1/3 country pride little want country change.

I'm ranting. Regardless, seem like good dude want say thanks discussion :) didn’t need Covid discover fact. probably reason say rude discuss much money make Which? “No u”  horrible past years much economic damage done woeful COVID response, never forget Clinton poor email hygiene.

Once dumb questions b/c sensible people (which Americans not) realize play sports middle pandemic. Thanks much. really helped mental state. anxiety roof lately.   know colleges went to, under-achievers basically got fucking forced beat shape college university went to. survive work.

He says, experience, mutations coronaviruses mutations majorly change virus mutate, TEND mutate way beneficial us. 

Our vaccines target protein, unchanged mutations, there’s reason start panic bullshit there’s comparison flu it’s coronavirus

I don’t think speak German fluently enough listen 45+ Minute long podcasts one best researchers topic worldwide.

Edit: here’s first one fighting attention since May. people feel right force others work unsafe conditions.  


One common arguments ""If feel safe, go out. can't force wear mask."" 


But people always ignored workers stores venues even view people. sad anybody pro-America makes automatically pro-Russia pro-China.

It's European leaders necessity decoupling US, irrespectively actual Looking latest decisions @realDonaldTrump someone could even think: friends like needs enemies. frankly, EU grateful.

Oh what, picking up? visited Stockholm last summer 2 weeks, loved it. Obviously get opportunity experience issues, I'm glad visited go now. Welcome America! people good ones get threatened! lot ifs argument here. simply don’t know yet #2 arguments actually correct. No, red-blue divide *is* issue, I've lived 41 years know this.

But top economy huge amount pressure Gavin caved re-opening really little federal support small businesses get. 

There way win either way. Combine massive populations metropolitan areas get COVID numbers have. Obsessed? sub global news articles covid, US news articles. claim article false.

Colorado reports deaths several different ways. daily released numbers, death yesterday 4 last 5 days; we've 14 deaths last week. day death day reported state, numbers often 0 recent days continue rise.

The 7-day running average daily numbers dropped, though - 2.0 right 7.14 bit week sounds worse really is. imagine lot they're better job screening people virus seeking testing. Also, funny media likes jump around numbers report. number new cases ""unimpressive"" they'll focus percent positive tests instead high number vice versa. don’t understand getting at? players want matter considering sport exists them. issues go deeper COVID. liability amateurism issue much COVID issue. schools didn’t worry liability would playing. Yes, say Russian. said Mandarin. telling.

I forgotten ""China Flu"" beatings Asian Americans received result. stop reminding people beware implicit bias Asians. There's probably 10-20 million active cases US right now. see handful people India going make much difference. America*n* *leadership*, mean. Getting downvoted lot exact type morons Canada. It’s like see United States emboldened take dipshit stances make everything political fight yell conspiracies. Albertan it’s horrifying see province go road is. feel place healthcare worker. I'm glad acknowledge Europeans redditors call Americans fat uncultured pigs shit like this. amount time I've seen Europeans call Americans ignorant knowing ins outs countries politics travelling countries (which elitist IMO). 

Then there's whole acknowledging flaws thing. posts time implying Europe sort utopia. remember seeing post basically implying Germany learned lesson WW2 racism anymore. Like shit Germany still issues antisemitism, let alone racism whole. 

Idk, I'm sure average European less good bad person anywhere else. reddit, however, always get feeling look Americans (not America, Americans) believe shot stink. American exactly expected. likely take several pandemics/extreme load/""pressure"" us modernize healthcare system. college late 80's/early 90's. AIDS certainly ""practically ignored"". quite. certainly effective filtration cloth mask, however note 2.5 filters stands 2.5 micron (the size particle.)

N95/KN95 rated filter 95% approximately 0.3 micron particles.

Covid-19 estimated approximately 0.1 - 0.2 size.

That isn’t say PM2.5 mask won’t block /any/ covid particles, keep mind filters rated do, size matters. 😅

Stay safe! ☺️ Like states doing? Americans actually care. I’m angry DNC anyone else, DNC didn’t make impossible Bernie. Yes, made much harder, twice, continued media barrage doesn’t help either, support Bernie youngest voting block would made irrelevant. end day, 15% participated, number 30-50, would’ve blown everyone else water. DNC shit, destructive, push comes shove, Bernie still chance, let constituents dont wage war citizens. China. simply true. New Zealand (very few) positives cases lately. last positive case Aug 5 (which anywhere near 100 days ago).  


Not well, mark 100 days without new cases. Quit making bad faith arguments.  Lmao false. Here's one example dozens. input inaccurate data going end inaccurate results. We’re almost opposite Laissez-Faire every possible way. seems crazy know people saying people gathering others fucking stupid, find thing. know people safe, honestly don’t even know one person taking serious.

I know exactly talking about. People know say stuff like ""Yeah we're *super* serious this. Totally laying low, sheltering-in-place, know?"" they'll tell half dozen things *that fucking day* sheltering place. 

I, hand, actually taking super-fucking-seriously done *anything* outside home since beginning March. There's footnote that, either. ""But went cousin's wedding"" ""but still go golfing every weekend"" ""except, know, getting together dinner every Sunday extended family.""

It's 'n nuclear family, avoiding window lickers. got *extremely lucky* first corporate job city wanted live in.

A whole bunch colleagues pay dues San Francisco first. children, something do. send person school. 2nd wave happen first never ended? Anyone paying attention already knew Europe needs stop pretending like aren’t opening clubs venues way early. live Florida. one gives crap virus tourists come care even less. constantly remind clients insist face-to-face meetings trying limit exposure virus. Canadian, initial response US Trump considering stationing troops Canadian border...this NY absolutely going nuts, like, why?

Then whole PPE disruptions border stuff, Trump threatening 3M masks sent us, tariffs weird economic time (that actually hurt US business owners anything)

Our countries successful partnership long time, like wtf??

Anyway, stay safe man, best family post-War Baguette France?

This made think. word opposite ""history""? Something *will* happen. got acting? thought still lifting weights. prevents 18-22 year olds partying, getting fucked up, sex etc etc etc. aren’t going control that. wait till older coach comes virus dies contracts player gonna let em fuck wife next? continue lose us elections we're completely underwater. 

We're dumb country, man, gotta work got. people comments section need chill little bit. US shown deep rooted flaws, y’all acting like it’s fall Roman Empire. can’t give easily.  Perhaps thought that: book ended office right wing rag literal prophet said 'Nothing ever ends'.  stop endless self-pitying poor-little-millennials posts someday? Every generation shit deal with, we'll get like rest. kind comments staggeringly dumb me, honest. use comment everything? ""Lol debt? Think going college next time!"", ""Lol car accident? Think getting car next time!"", ""You broke leg? Think going outside next time!"" typical way thinking person zero sense life experience empathy, suppose. crazy long people waiting get results - I'm still blown away administration advised stop testing would less cases. 

\*biggest facepalm\* going happen. many idiots much power. Thats see as. He's get, he's us. He's perfect American, fat, stupid, loud, cheap businessman full lies corruption. embodies American spirit fucking embarrassing DARE INSULT FRAGILE AMERICAN EGO! NUKE OBLIVION! LET'S SEE WHO'S FRAGILE THEN! 'MERICAAAAA!!! also believe God hear they're praying church.

My limited understanding *God* among various flavors religion (or she) hears prayers everywhere. Right? First thing thought ""Why reference best movie, 13th warrior?"" 4% world's population 25% covid deaths. death rate excessively high. based current deaths per million. countries slightly higher DPM mostly control US sill 20k new cases UK 816 Belgium 751 look critical patients US 18k UK 67 Belgium 69 US well way worse them. necessarily. 

IMHO election day national holiday, place one requires open 24/7, need give workers least half day order vote. 

Voter suppression massive tactic right, works. left lot work help get people vote, many give people can't afford transportation free rides polls (regardless political affiliation), take care many people. 

The right absolutely want mail-in voting reason. One relatives local politician (D) thought predominantly red county. last election mail-ins permitted due pandemic shows incredible amount voters left voting before. primary incentive vote anyone right out, goes show difference makes everyone vote easily. county too, shown case statewide. 

Then there's issue electoral college, applies nationally, locally. Please, continue excusing absolutely outrageous prices medical costs US. Insurance not, unexcusable believe it, there’s likely far more. I’m Florida I’m close, gone CDC publicly reported data weeks 12-24 state, yep! sho ton excessive deaths data still isn’t fully complete. That’s what’s available state 


There good solution raging pandemic “washing through” population size minimal prevention strategies nationwide. 

The outcomes either way, people get sick die hospital exposure they’re already fragile due disease injury unrelated Covid-19.

Or

Or people get sick die nursing homes don’t staffing equipment care contagious patients that’s live close quarters. 

These really two choices, suck, every ass except actual people sick dying attempting saved. Even making Covid facilities tragic. Many nursing home patients shipped that’s die. Alone. alone ever prior admitted assisted living facilities away family. That’s family even cared first place. 

And add insult injury many nursing home/skilled nursing/assisted living patients lived facilities YEARS. Like, 10+ even 20 years. people live facilities them, patients, “family”, staff. survive past aren’t shipped off, don’t get sick, they’re literally watched “family” members die. 

These fragile vulnerable humans population and....it’s happening them. It’s cruel. shameful. tragic. 

This meaning despair looks like. love Germany want move US badly! never said that. Please, dear God, read article. Yup, graduated 2006, got job within months, employed without gaps since then.

The engineering degree definitely got foot door gotten first two jobs without it.

My pay jumped significantly late 2008 well, good since then. hope able find new church home. church taking necessary precautions minimize risk well continually offering online services need/want it. good churches care congregation health. I’m 30 point life slightest inkling Republicans acting good faith. obvious moment first saw Bush speak trying manipulate given situation suit end, everything always said bad faith. situation different. Maybe teach wearing hazmat suits? lol old you? absolutely ""hysteria"" 80s. Thankfully EVENTUALLY figured transmission easily avoidable careful set specific behaviors. know first, though, hysteria definitely happening. I'd argue hysteria still happens... ever seen people act around somebody find somebody HIV?

Unfortunately, 'Rona transmitted person person much easier.

Maybe talk somebody older first making weird incorrect statements history. I've worse birthdays. Thinking particular political ideology incapable producing reprehensible people dangerous mindset said trade schools answer problems.

Welp I'm skilled laborer I'm fucked too, feel bad. trick spend year living less-than-desirable state gain experience. little bit experience, easily get job anywhere want.

There lots jobs available people four-year nursing degrees. lot nurses experience. mean.. wrong. Like site become politicized. Cant seem escape sub gets 200k subscribers. First though hundreds thousands deaths, shutdown economic fallout bad, this? Europeans look us? able sleep tonight? real world rules politicize fucking pandemic yet are. boy stops politicizing it, rest us able to. blame Nevada. everything right usual model state everyone follow always bring stuff across border kill us. GOP hollowed America since 80s ""[Two Santa strategy enrich 1% send rest us trash heap. I'm surprised omitted Sweden. someone also lives NYC, I’ve gotta say outdoor dining doesn’t feel safe me, servers cannot socially distance. aren’t socially distancing patrons, exactly safe?

And I’m blaming - many servers forced return work can’t get unemployment anymore. 

I also walking around Brooklyn yesterday 99% open restaurants way packed. saw one upwards 50 people sitting outside, table merely 2 inches apart. Restaurants started using 6 feet rule slowly adding tables... unfortunately seems like can’t trust people right thing presented opportunity so.

The friends hang park, still feet away (I try stick 6 feet sometimes it’s like 3-4 feet) masks on. It’s honestly hot lately though.

It also really bums hear “oh went so-and-so’s apartment today” friends thought taking seriously. haven’t indoors another person roommates months seems like people couldn’t give shit. makes want stop caring too, I’m part problem... everyone bucked could opening now, it’s frustrating can’t many people can’t bothered. dog already constantly confused, see noticeable difference. also little matter voting literal madman highest office. It’s downward spiral. irresponsible people behave, disease spreads, governments &amp; organizations shut things down, angrier misfits get hysteria media/abuse government. heal nation extreme individualism I'd amazed competent enough put pants first place idea getting at. Honestly.

Why assume make statement based knowing ""parisians""? Actually known one French person Paris. others country. Never felt particularly social.

and still explanation makes French people extra social compared Germans.  That's really failure imagination though. said thing Lil' Bush, Dubya looks like Otto von Bismarck comparison. next thing Republicans dredge even worse. mean write narcissism w33dwick? engineer, I've always thought Germany might nice place move. I'll check link later. one first countries get hit hard large elderly population.

However, managed contain quite well now.

Every country that's run authoritarian fascist better US. single flight infected...

24/157 single flight tested positive Covid-19 Saturday... new Biblical flood. ~~40 days 40 nights~~ 4,000 days 4,000 nights plague. already rest world viewed us. Powerful corporate propaganda remember parent teacher conference 7th grade teacher absolutely nailed telling “you think choose smart friends both”

It simple stuck because, whether knew not, that’s exactly thinking doubt alone. r/iamverysmart ok Really? Thanks info. personal experience totally different, though. German, probably less experience matter. know one person department 300 people, really bad English skills. international company, probably attract people English skills. family lives China uncle Wuhan University graduate. never got anywhere close happened NYC Wuhan terms deaths infections, despite Wuhan significantly higher population . uncle personally knows one classmate got pretty sick Covid eventually recovered. think they're lying deaths. might underestimated way deaths underestimated everywhere, official numbers factor 2 most. 

The thing Chinese people large used obeying orders, partly fear, partly long-standing cultural demand respect authority playing role society dating back least Confucius. Many people suffered people Wuhan/Hubei especially eventually get angry long locked for, ultimately mask adherence, sanitation, social distancing is/was high whether individuals, businesses, government. There's lot anger China right foreigners keep sneaking way across border starting new outbreaks. China bad place right look foreign. dip chopsticks alcohol, sterilize them, patients? unaware ignorant seen course Canada well; there's hockey practically day. Best way get y'all self isolate. gotta watch Leaf elimination celebration parties now... get reavers? need realize there’s US imagine based film tv vs real US. real US great, certainly hero makes be. It’s villain honesty. agree 100% i’m american kinda paint sniffing? tristate 1/3 Covid deaths America. South Dakota? job market 20-30 depressing. employed 19 hard enough. find job minimum wage ($8.25/hr) turned 21. I'm making almost $17/hr 25. I'm pretty much bare minimum renting somewhat decent apartment cheap area. Like, I'm missing lot furniture I'm debt. gone school moved period. However little offer better jobs I'm kind forced expand job pay.

The fact shitty pension like fucking unicorn days. country part time jobs coming slowly. take maternity leave come back part time, getting carrier path 95% jobs. Especially high educational background.
But 5 weeks vacation lot working agreements 38,5 h/week. depends lot union thought. since sectors lot jobs mean work around 50-60h/week. 
And pay gap still common social jobs underpaid. jobs taken immigrants bad paid. Definitely inconsiderate.

Americans general selfish, regard human lives own. Sure, millions altruistic Americans, part combat virus. takes one idiot. America millions upon millions idiots, many positions authority power, care far wealth human lives. inconsiderate. Oh man happy thing! area live target rich environment content! complain Fox encouraging anti-mask rallies yet sub encouraged protests 10x larger. 50% effective could lend ADE know, calling people call governmental services ""socialism"" someone demonizes immigrants remind employs them? voting interest would cool. even fun magic mushrooms? thought first/third world statuses based country's allegiance cold war.

First world NATO, third world like term bit weird place due constant misuse. you’re risking life see smashmouth deserve get suggestion may. try luck another nation? One acctually values education. yeah, blind sacrifice leaveing friends family. maybe consider moveing abroad 5 years build resume preferd field move back feel like it? 

(I assume guys US) going continually happen schools reopen. good use time energy open schools right US, particularly states stabilized case growth. states like Vermont may able without issues. worked high end, rich, hipster health food store local area sed tell coworkers *real* inconvenience came along citizens would hopeless. Sometimes cheese cut exact 2 oz enough set people off. think prefer open propaganda fearmongering masquerading science. MLB fine, half teams play three straight weeks triple-headers end season. wearing mask, better drink hand! time posted went $405 Yep. pandemic ruined lot respect many people know, friends family alike. see anyone goes around without mask grocery stores etc. zero empathy anyone else simple thing do. Shows assholes are. still go parties/bars, travel obvious hotspots (e.g. Texas/Florida), etc., even moreso. Social cooperation taught, don't. Cleaning classes (like Japan), community service field trips, certain number community service hours required graduate high school, etc.

Oh look. I'm favor socialist indoctrination school. benefit doubt? 

I’m really sure it’s “doubtful” whether US would break previous policy clear, stated, President-independent law decide go rogue denying Iran access COVID vaccine.

Either way though, one specific point. think agree larger picture (that Europe drift superpower sphere influence), though disagree details. There's famous story [Boris Yeltsin visiting American Grocery sunset days Cold War. 

The story goes blown away choice average american shopper had. much convinced trick... staged event put him. came realize real ""Shattered view communism."" ""When saw shelves crammed hundreds, thousands cans, cartons goods every possible sort, first time felt quite frankly sick despair Soviet people,"" Yeltsin wrote. ""That potentially super-rich country brought state poverty! terrible think it.""

Many suggest turning point, Soviet Union recognize plans failed. sign Soviet Union could continue current path.

For me, feels like exactly moment US. ""Emperor clothes"" moment. moment decline laid bare longer possible ignore. display now, falling bridges flooding cities... simply ignoring this... least be. obese, elderly, diabetic. go work, see hundreds people everyday. daughter school. I'm pregnant go doctor. going stay home virus low death rate. 

BTW husband symptoms. .. new church slogan, ""we sending see god directly!"" Frankly, finding number far late due huge lags testing since beginning. Epidemiologists CDC, WHO, John Hopkins, several medical organizations estimated number exposed likely 4 6 times numbers last posted CDC.

Florida counting non-residents infected dying. Texas, according statistics 1% increase Covid deaths 600% increase Pneumonia deaths. think know bad, what's really happening likely much much worse. shocked 4 years constant stupidity people complaining about?

Did Trump, Desantis, Kemp, McConnell ever show would give damn anyone isn’t wealthy white republican? Pretty sure conservative lobbyist two orthogonal things.

I would really surprised awful people sides aisle. think exaggeration say upcoming election determine future America least next generation. definitely extended teetering edge terrible outcome. Explain?

Edit: know words narcissism irony mean? Saw dumbass feed post picture basically said wear mask support child trafficking...  get shout louder, rewarded acting like complete brat public. I've seen many times working retail/food service, I'll use example.

Perfectly nice regular comes every week spends good amount. One dishes cold, politely inform server gets remade. That's end it, he'll back next week polite ever, always tip treat staff well. decency repeat patronage gets nothing tangible pays for. 

Karen comes dishes cold, wants manager. causes scene, offer get food remade gets entire meal, entire check comped free. likely still rude toward staff after, likely never repeat customer (thankfully), there's good chance she'll still leave bad review. 

Customer service ""customer always right"" mindset gotten warped that's turned system rewarding biggest asshole around. corporate settings especially, staff basically held hostage horrible customers want stay employed. imagine translates areas well, damn makes hard faith humanity Big mouthwash 😂 Lmao exactly smooth brain would say Sweden get 25 days minimum (this course full pay, Americans reading). jobs get regulated collective bargaining unions, sector-wide. Germany also states. fact, pandemic response state jurisdiction. Comparatively, federal government way less actual hard legal power anything - without going state emergency - US federal government. President US congress way farther reaching powers issue German federal counterparts. federal government basically got rubberstamp border closings closing state jurisdiction agents enforcing federal officers.

They basically forced state leadership hold regular meetings coordinate states already gone done whatever thought prudent. none federal government made binding, indeed states something different anyways.

So indeed, US state German federal government apples oranges comparison, fact.

Also, people always get hung size? pretty much least relevant fact governmental entitiy is. mad!! dumb-dumb!!""

Whatever say hans lol Colorado? went concert last summer deep red Weld County trying get people sign recall petition claiming anti-Trump.

Anybody says gay Jewish Democrat Governor wore mask Pence showed photo shoot April consistently listened expert opinions ""Trump Boot Licker"" lost fucking minds.  I'm good. Played cards right high school. bought house long ago. Got weapons ready too! ironic office better job handling controlling initially 99% states.

But course, Republican Kentuckians can’t Democrat office something right Midwest done much better job Northeast every single category; infection rate, death rate, etc. sure guys keep jerking much. ""Honey turns we're actually one."" Americans like targeted advertising.

nothing loose need spend huge upfront effort. 
there humans side message.  Im habit lying. Sorry. aren’t getting strategic plan anytime soon i’d bet money that. 90s (but completely started 90s) concerted effort influential Republicans Republican donors create polarizing atmosphere use drive wedge parties political tactic. wanted voters feel like Republican matter fear Democrats would elected. 

Newt Gingrich often credited large part bringing about. He's person spearheaded tactic forcing government shutdowns tool put pressure president's party, he's largely responsible Clinton's impeachment.

On non politician side, conservative radio show hosts like Limbaugh trafficking fear polarization since began, Murdoch explicitly created Fox News vehicle create us-vs-them narrative conservative viewers. last Sunday.. see one guy walk past mask.. rest...well thought headline onion first... wow, nope... can't believe that. Glad woke fuck right high school.  worse? never said anything even remotely close that. 🖕😷🖕

Why care around reckless endanger employees forced exposed enter business mask? idiot asshole? go higher estimates, adjust population, assume COVID-19 goes away pretty soon, current pandemic somewhat less bad two worst influenza pandemics past 75 years. 

So big deal, guess?  attacked joining mob.

 -some baby booner came say proven science. spike proteins makes easier give virus. would research commenting subject. Talk whataboutism- think it’s problem conservative stations promote anti-mask sentiment? I’ll call democrat promoting anti-science anti-mask sentiment, hypocrisy here. willing people agree politically?

And take “whatabout” - protesters general least don’t deny science. say “masks good, stay socially distant (even gatherings).” Fox Facebook gone “Masks bad. Mass gatherings fine (even without distancing)”. 

There shouldn’t politics play, organization promotes anti-mask sentiment anti-science harm public health- Fox undeniably forefront that. personally don’t care organization that’s it, although seems might. Comparing Sweden individual states much accurate. Sweden even top 10. New Jersey rate that's 211% higher Sweden. climbing. Sweden broader definition what's considered Covid death. that's presumably /s comment Assuming get Oxford vaccine approved fall, seeming likely, either Moderna Pfizer vaccine (or best case, both) get approved end year rolled early 2021, seems likely normalcy start return many parts world sometime early spring, infection rate dropping late winter.

Can please describe words ""AI"" you? Please enlighten me, throwing word every post yours, never bring mean it. told you, I'm fulltime software developer, got pretty good grasp topic.

Besides that: pandemics electricity, would explain that?

Examples:

- Third Cholera Pandemic (1852–1860) Death toll 1 million

- Black Death (1346-1353) Death toll 75-200 million

- Plague Justinian (541-542) Death toll 25 million

- Antonine Plague (165 AD) Death toll 5 million

Where 3G, 4G, 5G, electricity AI back then?

Besides that, live Austria work Germany, we're absolutely fine everyone wearing masks keep distance. nah, I'm scared happen months even year, sane government.

Edit: add that. know really might cause larger pandemics? Easier travel. wanted go Europe America 200 years ago board ship.. spend 2 months sea get there. Nowadays sit airplane 8 hours. get around globe day. one extremely obvious reasons disease spreads easily compared back then? Higher denser population. Easier travel. Destroying nature (and habitat wild animals) leads animal human transmission diseases animals migrate urban areas. many better reasons electricity. come pandemic taking lot longer 6 months tho also reckless hell endangers people well every time it. know many hands silverware glassware passes gets you?

Eating right says lot person imo. None good. classmates specifically said science olympiad math olympiad kids school would bully beat dumb kids partying fashion intellectual pursuits.

People act way can't characterized smart. Every idiot read philosophy learn solve even complex equations mean said idiot understand raw memorisation. People see significant others take part demean others based intellectual pursuit, can't really vouch intelligence. can't really vouch mine. I’m one insulting strangers internet. Focus idc think work healthcare, well known first job NEVER one want.... pay dues get with.

That applies field industry.

Lots graduates realize 'book knowledge' mean thing experience apply learned real world situations.

Real life example... accounting major graduate passed CPA exam. need experience granted license state work passing exam means Nothing! One pass CPA exam change career field can't oneself CPA requirements met.

In many fields, unless genius, need work life experience takes time!

Everybody dues pay pay early get with. Along way, get work life experiences. Europe upwards 15% death infection rate vs US’ **~3.2%**. Europe suck fat one give shit about

Damn, Redditors bloodthirsty people... words (fragile inconsiderate) far soft describe what's going US. authorities continue deny everything matter level evidence, every independent medical group statistical study shows data altered, reported, yes manipulated.

 

 

 

 

 whats happening entirely predictable. people power want pretend everything control, believe manipulate data, control narrative. Covid magically go away. spreads infected many people can. Places controlled spread locked severely, opened slowly, worked hard make sure traced every case isolated people. 

We didn't, still haven't. anyone tells cases going down, remember data, data actively manipulated, trust power telling truth without full transparency, asking lied to.

The US ranks 18^th according ""world happiness report"", far ahead Italy, Spain, France, Japan, Portugal, South Korea number ""first world countries"".

This hot take remains ridiculous. Florida thread...the hell? Sad see good news like getting downvotted bots show page one. Really makes wonder certain people hate positive news go doom beliefs.

As marijuana studies, suspect measurable effect. really need journal negative results marijuana. I'm arguing can't contain virus larger populations. I'm saying *it scale* much agree policies NZ can't overlook factors explain they're well.

I'm really confused keep saying scaling work agreeing examples scaling working. 

New Zealand Wuhan deployed extremely similar manners scaled necessary degree. worked effectively places regardless population density scaling works. also said number pressers. `This site currently unavailable visitors European Economic Area work ensure data protected accordance applicable EU laws.` American, agree. heard that. thinking more, fact half population douchey wear mask, government response uncoordinated fucked up, President started (and continued) trade war company supplying PPE ventilators spreading propaganda virus made and/or control.

You understand people's livelihood depends ""the economy""? tends benefit rich atm (practically tautology), mechanism use provide survival? actually important balance economic demands pandemic risks, economic failure massive cost lives - we're striking right balance currently. Everything black white huh buddy. need qualify quantify anything. takes toxic masculinity whole new level.    Best option! Yes, socialists push facade europe great socialist health care

* numbers start trending down. nobody knows why.

you: magic
ars technica: coincidence... headline makes zero sense, implying pandemic increases chances mass shooting? That's great!

unbelievable.  Yes, Typo: Europeans Say COVID-19 ~~Revealed~~ affirms America 'Fragile,' Inconsiderate

This Europeans think since US elected orange blob. pandemic hasn’t laid bare every single dysfunctional system, toxic behaviour, toxic culture corporate greed stranglehold problem America nothing ever going to.

However it’s sadly people actively encourage reinforce problems fix them.

I wonder real idea fucked way! Ugh that's crazy! Spy mediocre kid's film

Well clearly know talking They're still road recovery

What's taking long recovery? Europe fragile, look Spain Italy. lol...... think US stabilized middle east? Nobody asking US world police really interests anyway. Canadian, want say things this.

We share massive border United States - nearly 9000 kilometres worth - vast relationships two countries - economic, cultural, personal.

But America right now....it's like everything could wrong, have. Squandered opportunities, idiotic decisions much society actively trying ignore obvious, everyone - EVERYONE - play part stopping COVID-19. can't done some.

And places America get that. That's one looks COVID case growth states like New York, New Jersey Massachusetts took beating early much better grasp It, whereas many others simply actively trying something it.

We've people like too. eventually reality hit home, vast majority people following rules part.

People United States - PLEASE same. whole world needs get together. virus care politics one damn bit, never will. never know, thus never care, liberal New York conservative Texas. harms kills same.

Every nation developed world, even like Italy Spain Sweden taken awful beating, mostly got hand. We're laughing you. want pity cry you, sympathy hard yourselves, know fix yet it.

And yes, fix it. know can.

But gotta yourselves. can't You. Tom Kirkland 2020 There's absolutely reason dumbass neighbors given opportunity legally endanger lives think COVID-19 scamdemic.

We created society governed rules work unsafe conditions neighbor risk life want protest working conditions, police attack you.

It's exhausting. wearing mask tells want protect ***anyone***. 

And thus, look extremely weak. Seriously wondering, Sweden shit reporting? idiots actually go weekend break thinking government mandated right virus take break well? reporting every day detail? Living nordics pandemic made ashamed home. demand 24/7 reporting accurate statistics ages, travel history, places visited, previous illnesses patients live/death ratios all. Fuck privacy concerns, get stats accurately possible fucking MANDATE serious rules heavy fines. Assholes. aint gonna diskutera shit away like think Sweden. lazy. That’s scary photo, article says yet verified taken. see masks, probably post-Covid, really hope earlier pandemic state lower numbers. recent, god help us all. K, one study. 

I imagine additional studies works. One largest studies date Covid infection fatality rate (IFR CFR). Overall, IFR estimate 0.83% confirmed Covid deaths 1.07% based estimated Covid deaths. IFR higher men rose sharply increasing age. waiting Vince McMahon ressurect football league. might declared essential full national league florida America soooo bad, yet everyone keeps coming here...hrmm something add up. whiney America haters A.)stay repsective countries....or B.)

Beyond inconsiderate large underclass, people savings, economy dependent service jobs retail unhealthy population physically mentally 

Virus helping  think wake call Americans. Americans intensely proud system governance (and unjustifiably so!). systems institutions set ensure government held check, right prevail. Americans trusted that.

But here's dirty little secret people waking to:

Every system have, every institution, is, core, people. people rely right thing, people rely maintain system government, protect ""evil"", keep running. people co-opted replaced sycophants, recourse have?

Europe needs make sure decoupling US doesn’t force hands Russia-China bloc. 

Decoupling US mean getting closer Russians Chinese. People stop making false choice. It’s like Europe paradise US dystopia. 

Of course not. problems everywhere. De-coupling simply means freedom American control influence. nothing paradise/dystopia. 

The bottom line unchecked American power bad world. Take something like Paris climate agreement, Iran nuclear deal. entire world better United States powerful unilaterally decide whatever wants, country able stop it. 

Just think happen US first come covid-19 vaccine, decides sell certain countries. country organization world able stand America. rest world pray American people happen elect someone right thing? pretty stupid strategy. Don’t care Europeans think.

I’m trying point initially said young men specifically hardest hit, even defended point someone else asked details. 

When asked source showing young men specifically effected, sent source says millennials badly effected. Yes that’s true, asking source says young men affected (because assertion). 

Then, several comments later, saying, well it’s actually young men, it’s young people. 

So you’ve gone defending one particular position defending totally different position. 


Or still believe young men affected? one says this... like children bickering burning house get behind that. think, example, someone thought one political party bad actors around this, would certainly examples Karen's probably voted party Washington state Texas. trying understand that's OP asking.

Not accurate Europeans viewed America. We're democracy. We're republic. Many people including U.S. population make mistake time. cannot vote directly president. trailer bound see good ole confederate flag Midwest well - kid starting school needs help speech minor developmental things. balance getting sick vs help daughter needs make sure brain develops normal path. We've opted ""pray get sick"" strat hopes school good job sanitizing/masking (probably can't 4 year olds lol) continue near 100% isolated. sucks forced choose, significant complications sides :/ Exactly. billion rabits world tigers endangered. mean, Trump's even blame. He's literally forcing American public act specific way.

We simply significant number selfish assholes, regardless trump. Trump may exacerbated assholery, still massive pieces shit begin with. Let's start call people pieces shit rather blame Trump pieces shit.

Obviously still blame Trump piece shit. Completely. I've read many articles last months lasting effects pandemic mothers. One reasons wage gap historically existed women almost always ones stop working order raise children, can't catch counterparts take time (often due fact men given opportunities leave, thus forcing women ones it). schools daycares closed, lot women stay home kids again, giving careers. NYT ran article recently how, even situations parents working home, mother still ends bearing brunt childcare, cooking, cleaning. would get cases regions instead. Norwegian tourists go Spain. Government officials returning Brussels, Belgium. Polish guest workers. Perhaps intensity though. 

My point is: Direct feedback Norwegian government instead. It’s decision find balance measures. Swedish government’s. lot restaraunts moving smaller crews limited menues. possible deep-frier making margins needed stay staffed Covid. ' _america remember that_ ' worthless rhetoric. representative democracy, like almost western nations. republic nothing country failing democracy. Bring back sanitariums. OP stutter. Shut fuck ignorant fuck. wonder they'll figure fault along exercising right vote.

Oh, right - self-reflection. friend said things like government forcing people wear masks, government placing sugar tax soda companies, essentially first step government eventually oppressing us. give inch, they’ll take mile. 

Americans see “freedom” inherent good, freedom, better. Some, like friend, think maximum freedom basically force improves society. there’s much nuance, comes “government stop telling do!!” make-it-in-Germany.com/en/
Takes English version agree 100%. see trends eventually bite every EU nation ass sooner later. work UK get 33 days vacation per year day one employment. leave end first year taken many days (pro-rata) pay days many back. 25 years service get extra day, extra 3 manager.

I work large multinational engineering company. Miami Orange County appeal, sure. Miami known tourist hotspot, thanks DJT saying won’t lockdown again, it’s surprising Miami took spike.

Edit: woken wrong. Sorry comparison, hospital Naples, time prepare Naples badly hit, looked like roughly 3/4 weeks later. Preparation key video talks specifically. wrong. Public health experts everyday residents said ""always saw America model"" world

As European, huh? nothing capitalism everything idiocy.

You know would REALLY capitalist? in, want economy blossom? 

GETTING RID FUCKING COVID.

I can't believe short term idiots are. capitalist knows nothing work quite COVID control, half assed opening moronic. neighbors classmates (tons finance) agree pretty much 100%.

Probably biggest single driver opening economy actually many state governments rely 100% consumption taxes (Texas, Florida...). economy moving, 100% screwed.

I'd like point governments, corporations. Chloroquine/hydroxy chloroquine president's recommendation treating COVID patients. political say that, said video dozens times.  Cuz hes rich oligarch thief psuedo intellectual who's looking way cash pandemic, touting basic pandemic information, everyone kisses ass acts like hes god. nothing basic information business interests promoting shit. reason hes news someone really pay attention to. I'm sure didnt pay publicity anything. I'd believe great developed vaccine everyone made free. I'm sure happen though. needs another 10 yachts mansions. Yay rich people. everyone planet eventually exposed virus.

Right, giant, crushing wave. Little bites. Manageable amounts. ability able provide important live-saving measures might merit situation insufficient resources. Nah I'm butthurt enough designate exactly I'm mad at. forgive one time. No, yes. believe Canada smaller contingent racists tend socialist minded comes public policy. However, rules apply: large chunks racists, large chunks uneducated voting interests... Yeah, really awful. factor? Yes. lots kids going back school week weight? Yes. asking questions look smart? Absolutely. 

It’s avoidable death. Secondary schools closed. Utilize middle high school buildings work folks create super distant classrooms kids need childcare age groups can’t care work day. It’s hard.

Have elementary school teachers oversee daycare workers delivering curriculum virtually. Show video, read stories, etc. reads like written someone that's never met woman. agree sentiment, important dramatic.

The US people easily overcome everything that's happening present. We've done again.

There's tendency among every generation citizens believe unlike generation come before, evolving technology, unique experience, etc. true, superficial level.

Thinking way cuts people history US history species.  We've exact problem government before, we've fixed it. question long take much pain involved. Hell yes. super unpopular opinion issue Dems vs Repubs, either. disagreement perceive seems political theater actual animosity. oligarchy. political leaders serve oligarchy. end conserv plans regardless many Dems elect. 

I can't really get details without violating sub rules I'm happy DM points. tripping explain people refuse acknowledge. get one wrong point obvious that's exactly logic behind founding America. There's lots nice words paperwork end day, got vote? Landowners. government serve? money. big mystery. America land propaganda tho, confusion understandable. Congratulations birth baby. I’m glad hear everyone well! Personally, think need wide availability antigen tests: rapid (minutes/couple hours), cheap require equipment speak of.. sensitive PCR done home thus decentralizing testing greatly increasing chances infected people get tested. feel like minority fucking dumbass Americans always seem represent United States.

It's frustrating ,you know, 150 million us usually negative stereotypes representing negative images USA. American confirm bet toilet hates him. worries. Probably - though don’t data support it. less likely women college degrees generally speaking probably less mature well. that’s speculating. Agreed, least retirees tax affairs legal. shell regular basis kinds things, probably need keep more. also reveals Europeans overly obsessed America. Threats students teachers parents?

Or talking completely random people making threats? That's incorrect, suspect purposely misrepresenting user. Yep.  
But bad rEpUbLiCaN pReSiDeNt UK facility called Porton got lot scary viruses chemical weapons Carl Sagan quote, 1995 book ""The Demon Haunted World"" reads:

""I foreboding America children's grandchildren's time -- United States service information economy; nearly manufacturing industries slipped away countries; awesome technological powers hands few, one representing public interest even grasp issues; people lost ability set agendas knowledgeably question authority; when, clutching crystals nervously consulting horoscopes, critical faculties decline, unable distinguish feels good what's true, slide, almost without noticing, back superstition darkness..

The dumbing American evident slow decay substantive content enormously influential media, 30 second sound bites (now 10 seconds less), lowest common denominator programming, credulous presentations pseudoscience superstition, especially kind celebration ignorance think Trump made speech election rally. said world thinks US joke. would one fix that. Good job Donald. Good job. Yay, science guess... Yeah basically thought stated another comment here. Masks + getting healthy solution. Seems obvious, people want stay home gain quarantine 15. However delighted see bikes sold sites back shopping one. people right idea. Interestingly enough, studies shown southerners likely help someone know (their neighbor, friend, family, etc) less likely support something would support someone don’t know (like blanket welfare system). 

It’s different perspective issue. avoid groups whenever possible, minimize amount time spend them.

Not possible.

Can imagine beehive tried enforce lockdown response virus going members? entire colony would dead day. Obviously, humans bees, like bees, humans fundamental need genuine social interaction - emotionally psychologically (by extension, physically), materially (in supply chains, everyone seems take granted whose ripple effects worse virus itself). public health policy relies nearly entire population practicing abstinence normal human contact medievil shit. What's stupid John Bolton's book highlighting Trump's corruption inability perform job hired American people? misinformation, claim case count higher two weeks, said ""Right now"". weekend today (meaning data registered today), Denmark posted **373** cases Sweden **649**. translates **DK: 6.42 per 100k**, **SWE: 6.34 per 100k**. mention Denmark curve seeing consistent increase Sweden relatively stable several weeks. true, foreign relations going deal that. fact is, can't rely single political party power another country make agreements them. faith population support something, powers change, relationship won't.

What we've learned two parties USA can't even come together (either political parties EVEN supporters them) bloody pandemic. can't put aside differences long enough deal this, STILL political issue. that, country possibly agreement you? democrats make agreement, republicans withdraw DEMOCRATS IT!

Fuck, know man, political divide USA needs end, way see ending anytime soon complete fracturing country. I've got friends trades they're anti-mask. roof guys weak fix shingle. None wore masks. 

I get it. Personally, think rules dumb dining restaurants insane highly infectious pandemic.

But going dine out, think take every reasonable precaution protect fellow diners workers getting paid little serve you.

I see things difficult. people struggle much masks? takes one freaking second put one on, one second take &amp; shows respect also saving lives.

How little ""extra"" other??? Thank saying this. People’s lives still value, yes, even fat people fucks sake. sounds like something someone can't clean 350 would say *Every* large country shown fragile.

*Every* country contains lot inconsiderate assholes.

The government supposed ""protect"" us, apparently imbeciles can't that. Hahaha that’s actually pathetic take. 
 
So nobody say anything Chinese without racist, cos it’s “wHiTe PaNiC dOg WhIsTlE”. Absolutely pathetic. 

Just say aloud yourself, really understand you’re trying argue here, utter turkey. This. wedge issues simply distraction keep working class organizing. UBI wage subsidy affected businesses. people would stay home lose jobs. like US staying home treated suggestion.

The Ministry Health public wearing masks masks. They've flipped recent days. lockdown essential businesses supply masks workers. Plus, we're divided multiple levels. Common people blaming other, common people angry government, government disdain common people, branches government unable agree bipartisan issues, corporations either end grabbing whatever can.  non-us countries different? Asking emigration purposes... given cases caused protests

You know that. reported outbreaks protests. mean everyone safe protests one transmitted virus someone else.

You find 60-70% mask usage Sturgis. doubt find even 10% usage Sturgis. Wait I'd like know Europeans saw America ''model'' world, shit country became like america, privitized prisons, insane cops, shit healthcare, guns erywhere I'd leaving immediately. part timeline called ""I-Told-You-So"" period. bulk us calling stupid fucking half-assed, half-baked attempt 'old normal'. 'old normal' can't exist right leadership great deal people can't understand basic human empathy wearing fucking mask chuckleheads. 
Godspeed anyone deal head on, going terrible fall. That's thing, worshipping freedom blindly good.
Freedom everything also mean freedom act like complete savage.
And humans might smart, collective smart commit ton stupidity.

If justice, virus would target selfish immoral folks demonstrate deserve live society contempt others like saying Patrick Stewart, seen poop emoji emoji movie. everyone needs loved one die understand!!! super heros wear masks. masks weak? don’t think all. still good ones, we're pretty terrified, tbh. already knew country fucked, drives home fact even more. Sweden ""nothing"", fact probably large effect infections. nowhere near effect decreasing deaths 15x. Experts herd immunity believe HIT always quite low social distancing measures likely small effects overall HIT/infections/deaths. 


The fact predictions like 90k deaths ridiculous made. reasonable time, though everyone seemed pretend were. One Sweden's top health officials laughed asked 90k prediction. said absurd unscientific, correct. predicted Sweden would suffer roughly double bad flu season deaths, close ended up. made sweeping statement including hospitals, et.al. yes, doctors. I'm angry, disgusted be. Apparently successfully understood disgust directed entire U.S. medical industry, doctors seem singled out. working food well pay bills. COVID fucked plan though. wear mask public? Funny thing is, white middle class families want kids house back schools.

The immigrant poor communities terrified sending kids back, knowing academic issues economic issues, virus already impacting communities far white middle class communities. Obviously Assassins. Lock fatigue silly excuse. There's Netflix, video games, outside parks big enough social distance, nature trails, lost goes on. There's plenty do. People try find reason complain can't crowded bars packed stadiums. ... learn sellable skill live means. could also kept 19 yo home.

Unless kind underplays it. Seems like basketball March. SEC might attempt play don’t see conference getting this. nefarious international actors enter political system corrupt entire governmental infrastructure benefit merely cause chaos

Turnabout fair play, US similar things nations decades. reap sow. No, watching trainwreck happen commenting it. Let's hope lead mouthwashes methanol. lack leadership

Remember Trump kept pushing people back churches Easter? He's thing now, he's bullying children go back school. Trump lives protected bubble frequent testing everyone, time bullying others exposing bodies virus. According speech gave, latest executive orders cut unemployment pay create incentive bully people going back work. could mean die COVID-19! Indeed many thousands die! predict will, certainty, still virus control. control Easter still don't.

Wages essential frontline jobs gone significantly, should, given higher risk death virus. Yes, see minimal hazard pay bonuses first. However, level compensation match level risk, compared compensation similar levels hazards economy, pandemic. Plus, hazard pay bonuses stopped, even though pandemic still rages jobs hazard pay. 

Instead leader respectfully following evidence-based strategy, Trump acts like bully cracking whip. Get back work!!! Get back school!!! Get back church!!! Rules 3 4 bit extra, imo. Hahaha funny. laugh long time. like trying write rebuttles arguments.

Now mention Germany, know that's confederation states too, right? People also comparing countries individual German states, individual Brazilian Mexican states. Comparing countries countries makes sense, want know well government responses been.
If want know badly particular area hit, probably better look city regional level.

But course inside countries makes sense compare US states eachother German states eachother, state governments acted differently.  deaths.

Cases based amount testing. Yeah look new case numbers Spain France. looks like Georgia, Texas, Florida 5 weeks ago. states also patting back gloating great job done. Better alternatives, regulated sensible manner. Luxuries like college $400/semester? No, wait - kinds luxuries *your mom* enjoyed. Fair point, replying peakockpower though, throwing unfounded accusations around.

Ill give hint realm actually intelligent scientists involved real world monitoring: wrong :) Tough time getting sanctioned scientific community. I’ve noticed situations oftentimes *are* overweight. articles don’t mention overweight normalized US many people don’t even consider issue anymore.

Sadly young people act like enjoy summer dont even least protect cases rising again. Government policy makes huge difference. poor lil millennial idiots small brains good advice much Europe, understand it. longer tests take greater risk people venturing results arrive. many people go church say Christians believe it. hear stories people grew Christian households never believed it. Catholic priests molesting kids guaranteed believe preaching. Oh way one guy Luke physician? best saying heard Christian people believe prayer heal anything -- God helps help themselves. Yeah, I’m pretty sure Americans already knew Wait, then? Since communist all??? words, he's going dead soon. RIP, Puss Boots.

Also, dump them, one deserves live someone turns demon you. can't speak Texas anything like MD, testing vary WILDLY depending one get done. know people got results 24 hours, others waited 2 weeks. Result completely fragmented testing system federal management direction.

It's called joke. Det tror jag inte nödvändigtvis heller. Oavsett vilket block som satt regeringen skulle de förmodligen få extrem hård kritik från oppositionen om de gick emot folkhälsomyndigheten. Är ju så systemet är uppbygt här.

Thank you. appreciate addressed response instead throwing blanket statement. see understand perspective. anyone know scream fake news people move next outrage America. Well, let's clear, I, people, say ""capitalism"", referring economic activity unmanaged government, physical terms, force - uncoerced economic behavior. directly excludes almost every example gave. Public health mismanagement, government ""stimulus"", government subsidies, that's ""capitalism"".
