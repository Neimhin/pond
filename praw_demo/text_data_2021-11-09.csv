Interesting definition ""almost"". mean criminal insider trading? I'm gonna wait till booster  sucks. Hope Santa reindeer vaxxed masked up! Another good reason thin herds.   Nah, 6+ months ago vaccines super scarce, almost entirely supply constrained. 

Now they’re pretty much every pharmacy, small percentage population technically qualified booster. 

It’s people don’t want it, don’t think they’re supposed get it, technically aren’t. maybe full hazmat suit think anti-vaxxers nuts freedom speech freedom speech. right say whatever want. Making criminal disagree status quo DANGEROUS. pharmaceutical companies spread misinformation opioid products?  Well, Pfizer. must felt excited feel morally superior someone, once. Besides, really FDA job account that. Yes, ethical give many possible rest world, less ""unnecessary"" booster shots, FDA care that.

If running things, would also stick highly effective, pandemic killing school mandates, bother mandates get \~95% results. 🤷‍♂️   Additional purchased doses delivered April 2022. That’s related EUA BLA, that’s additional doses purchased. 

Pfizer still aiming data end year, it’s looking like sooner since they’re still enrolling. 1-2 months application review data. friend experience Moderna ultimately decided switch Pfizer booster. mild side effects Pfizer. might worth switching.  Florida degree herd immunity spread control several months. probably high seroprevalence many parts Florida vaccination infections.

Of course, huge price pay lives lost get degree immunity.

Also, Florida's worst surges COVID seem late summer. seem seasonal aspect COVID transmission, Florida Gulf Coast seem summer surges. Dude, came swinging start automatically assuming anti mask wasting energy yapping lecturing iamverysmart-esque way ""masks punishment"" never even said that.

Not sure knew this, TSA/travel mask mandate currently set time mid January, initially September. go read statement - I'm saying hope things good enough lift then, vax mandates settling in.

Sorry comment confusing (or misunderstood user comment), response directly comparison made u/CSI_Tech_Dept understood comparing absolute daily death numbers TX CA (which metric similar link user). 

While large states, Texas population significantly smaller makes absolute numbers misleading Maybe it’s both?

Willful ignorance, propaganda huge splash profit politics?  country, don’t think people listen, unfortunately. watched interesting documentary called, think, “Influenza 1918”.

Apparently, thought control, everyone went back previous lifestyles next wave came much, much worse. It’s happy thought. wish media still credible. mixed messages insane. pretty standard compared previous violations, like Raiders. consider Rodger’s violation egregious deliberately misleading causing actual harm team, especially fans families misinformation. people dumb enough take medical advice Joe Rogan, they're dumb enough trust 'critical thinker.' Sounds like histamine response, sometimes sweat get intense itchy skin (non vaccine related). wonder Claritin would help clear prevent happening.  can’t decide whether feel hilarious sad. It’s fucking sad takes get someone vaccinated. …….But saying.. It’s still fucking funny.

Only 2020/2021 see shit. say criminals, people definitely probably dying. got vaccine. I’ve really studied situation friends anti vaxxers. listen opinions carefully honestly definitely stupid people. told situation would get vaccinated. time, done research come different conclusion themselves. reasoning actually valid. don’t argue good friends mutual respect. It’s pretty much impossible counter argument speaking anti vaxxer probably Mensa level intelligence got information daughter head nurse hospital. So, wouldn’t jump conclusion “everyone” anti vaccine necessarily stupid. even know nurse can’t get vaccine immune system doesn’t react properly vaccines. I’m sharing experiences friendly way. I’m boat! Actually, math degree think game theory expert mathematicians exactly problem here. According math, correct giving doses poorer nations made stand. problem math ignores lot messy details. Ever heard joke physicist figured heal sick cow, spherical vacuum? That's exactly happening here. two complications particular ignoring:

1. Every unused dose US going go different country. Sure, will. simple would believe. Many close expiration dates, need refrigeration, issues.
2. Vaccine equity short term issue boosters long term issue. arguing boosters much are, discouraging people getting them. focused people getting vaccinated initially blind damage long term. Essentially scientists promoting antivaxxer talking points sort chess game promote vaccine equity, constantly talking vaccine side effects. Instead, early research pointing boosters efficient terms infection hospitalization, gap unvaccinated vaccinated similar gap vaccinated boosted. look Israel, boosting appears helping hit herd immunity, cases 90%. Essentially, everyone boosted US, pandemic would likely over, like summer Delta hit. Boosting natural, pretty much every vaccine take requires multiple doses months apart, half year ago expectation promoted public COVID vaccine. mean, shout 'fire' crowded people many die stampede illegal. lies lead death. sure difference. 🤔 Vampires. saw documentary called Twilight. Something consider. vaccine scarce, even J&amp;J less effective, still probably saved thousands lives compared Moderna Pfizer. 

Any vaccination better vaccination.   came Colorado Springs Sf Bay Area contract job, nobody wearing masks, following safety protocol I’m used to. got Pfizer shots back March, might even try make appointment booster I’m here. Nothing pandemic fair, lets get quickly possible. Insanely based, one wrong move literal ass seasoned fried got Moderna gave green light got full dose top JJ April...so happy  lot people don’t even think covid issue anymore conflict interest whatsoever...  goes show misinformation radicalization seep areas population.

I'm least surprised footballers get CTE hurt brain function  I'm feeling charitable evening would blame less stupidity gullible falling propaganda put would love see America eat dirt. days feel like stuck fever dream willful ignorance so, yeah. Disappointing. First, vaccines include dose given many months initial dose series. would 3 dose vaccine start wasn’t studied n rolled emergency. Second, vaccine still gives excellent protection pneumonia results serious disease death. virus infects upper airway causes symptoms days non-live virus vaccine yet protect years. Hospital getting overrun elderly vaccines dying sound like issue me. someone slandering company, obligation call it. Rat diapers. US generally barriers everyone arguably qualifies anyway. I'd say wait six months unless area critical spread.   Ron get booster even qualify yet?  get answer 10 minutes pharmacy. like 30 shots per day.

A free life-saving shot people would paid million dollars last year, need second opinion??? takes 15 minutes waiting pharmacist ready. relevant decision making. biggest atrocities often done name “greater good” similar experience. J&amp;J March made feel really miserable day, Moderna booster ten days ago systemic side effects, super itchy arm injection site. even sore, itchy. feel much better things world now! Oh my! Says man whose company pays billions fines damages. Yeah, someone call crazy could die, transmit virus others die, you’re waiting months year answer thst question.   Pre existing conditions YES. also live people immune compromised.  New virus, new disease, new vaccine. scientific process real time. effective vaccine prevent deaths transmission— really think wait see long lasts using it? many would die serious problems infection meantime? wears off, we’ll deal - whether another dose whatever better may developed the.

You flat tire temporary spare available- say I’m going use it’s good 50 miles, I’d rather wait tow truck arrive months? think concerned PR angle justified saying this. could go back forth latter, antivaxxers enjoy interpreting literal threat. preexisting conditions, immunocompromised, obese? boosted, personally follow local mask laws live life. football games. checked vaxxed.

Inertia definitely issue here. Manslaughter term. Current guidance 6 months 2nd shot Pfizer/Moderna.

If 2nd dose June, due December.   argue criminal I've noticed times anti-vaxxer ever legitimate peer-reviewed study source claims. Usually ask got information insult know they're backed corner. respect ones actually try discussion use proper sources, honestly, majority dumb bag rocks lack nuance critical thinking. want claim vaccine harmful ineffective, fine, better back fuck up. Otherwise, spewing useless bullshits end people harmed. asked question thought deserved answer. civil discourse share information factual backed science, everyone wins.  Jfc 89% fully vaccinated adults eligible booster according CNN. Even tiny bit overweight qualifies person, wide variety physical mental health issues. Almost everyone qualified booster Probably wait fully vaccinated. TFA says get voucher. Many nations drastically under-supplied. wants richer nations focus adding worldwide supply rather boostering populations.

I'm baffled can't both. US donated millions doses, billions needed.

I could skip booster tomorrow, intended dose sent overseas anyway. even relatively high-vaxxed area, many unvaxxed vulnerable people around depend waning  DLI fooked expect throw wrist stinging much? people weak pathetic cannot cope mask surgeons wear extended periods? ridiculous fragile people are. prick prick doctor whatever take grain salt. think best case scenario animals effected unable transmit disease.

As yesterday CDC COVID Data Tracker said 282 deaths 0-4 Years age group, 959,829 cases. That’s case-fatality rate 1 death per 3,404 cases; whereas 5-11 Years age group, vaccine authorized, 189 deaths per 2,065,945 cases. case-fatality rate group authorized vaccine 1 death per 10,931 cases. seems cases much likely fatal 0-4 age group. 

Death, course, negative outcome Covid-19. 0-4 age group also appears likely hospitalized. According CDC data available COVID-NET cumulative rate hospitalizations 0-4 age group 95.1 per capita (100,000). 5-11 age group cumulative hospitalization rate 33.6 per capita (100,000). seems children 0-4 years age group much likely hospitalized.

It's like Maïmouna Doucouré. defend wants disgusting movie, unfortunately right nevertheless, end sane person agree needs go prison long time. Anyone else isn’t high risk group sure getting booster? second moderna shot obliterated exactly 6 months ago. Plenty appointments open, I’m sure. Even doctor pretty much said it’s risk tolerance. Idk think.  Preventing death undoubtedly ""most important"". However often used context ""well nothing else see here, move along"". done many last months.  damages, though? They’re making record profits. agree sentiment, fwiw. I'm epidemiologist, think so, caveats. vaccinated, young, healthy American, less said, unless live higher risk people. 

Vaccine mandates probably stay 'forever', like illnesses. may business requirements, like ventilation occupancy, mask mandates become fewer 2022. might still local waves hospital overloading issues (and people die, tragedy close them), probably stop seeing daily COVID news :) Delta’s severity overestimated
Dore said well underestimating effectiveness vaccine, modelling may also overestimated severity Delta think overestimated badly affects risk developing serious disease, overestimated duration stay hospitals. spectrum cases hospital less severe may originally modelling predicted Pfizer vaccine 93% effective reducing overall transmission Delta variant, AstraZeneca 86%. Later data overseas suggested Pfizer AstraZeneca 94% 96% effective reducing original strain … thought Delta would make much likely you’d end hospital, putting vaccination aside,” Dore variable data, it’s straightforward. virulence severity strain thought much greater, marked impact … shorten duration stay (in hospital) cumulative effect.” article garbage, hard stats quoted. I’m relatively confident go looking cases per 100k residents, CA beats Florida. I’d also bet CA lower positivity rate Florida. Well Pfizer, banner year, they’d prove damages, right? think that’s hard establish given extraordinary success moment.

Someone else might sue jerks unnecessary suffering death, don’t think Pfizer standing sue grounds. unsure true, quick Google search see Washington Post says thing. someone's blog mean untrue. much wider audience. tem invermectin, os rebranded reading article feel like whoever gave title either read entire piece trying stir pot.

Anti Vaxers ~~refuse buy product~~ *kill people* criminals   Freedom speech share ones opinion 
“ spreading misinformation” it’s certainly criminal Easy. Murder.

Or maybe manslaughter, frankly different standpoint victim.

Obviously, one going convicted anything, reasonable person would interpret words way, pretty plain point he's making. Spreading misinformation *kills people*. Period.  Absolutely try get Pfizer preferably Moderna booster. significantly greater immunity either booster. first shot Johnson &amp; Johnson? so, yes, go Moderna Pfizer. get 5-6x boost antibodies compared getting J&amp;J boost. 

I’m unicorn. got Moderna, research study got Johnson &amp; Johnson booster July. far, according lead doctor, enough boost avoid symptomatic breakthrough. Time tell long last. Especially libel slander puts life, life, millions lives risk.

Fuck that.

Misinformation killed many thousands U.S. year. I'm okay someone making plain, objectively right statement (from philosophical standpoint legal standpoint). seems main thing cases young people, 18 therefore unvaccinated. Saw article day said 25 percent cases teenagers. Also older people got AZ long time ago waning immunity...and J+J people lead way breakthrough cases.

I suppose reason...but everyone kind hoping cases go 80 percent vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: note boosters starting help bit. saw article posted saying 8 10 breakthrough cases 70. Boosters help. Wtf mean “blindly” trust them? vaccines thoroughly studied administered millions upon millions people. I’m saying agree “criminal” comment, comment absolute bullshit spreads kind needless distrust validated science that’s saving lives. 750,000 dead Americans COVID, isn’t minor issue we’re talking here. People lie safety vaccines absolutely contributing death rate. Doesn’t make criminals, make highest grade assholes imaginable.  like try use politically correct term instead Eskimo still use racial stereotype joke... Okay, let’s better go January real time extended again.

is indistinguishable tone meaning hope things good enough lift then, vax mandates settling in.

Is we’re saying?  Jab stab That's one way make 15 minute wait less boring. Big hug Ted Cruz. Anecdotally, unvaccinated people associate states waiting Novavax given approval. Even now, months recent trials, still shows higher, non waning, efficiency virus one show, also minimal side effects. Many trust mRNA tech, historically never passed trials already showing quick decrease efficiency requires boosters maintain. Pfizer made enough money vaccines, step back, trust science, allow efficient ones step take respective market share.  30 minutes, 5 minutes. Ha definition double 1.5x “Jamie, pull up…” HCA sub today guy developed covid compartment syndrome, chunks legs starting turning black dying. Prople need see photos shit--and photos swiss cheese mess lungs look like post covid.  buzzfeed quiz this??? disinformation weaponized now.

Coming Pfizer, company paid one largest criminal fines history (for lying drugs) bit rich lmao  going 29?  ""The rate today, we're statewide think three-and-a-half times what's considered high incidence level...""

O-hiiiigghhh-o  look Lancet paper see disagree. explanation breakthroughs due waning immunity vaccine escape part delta. I'm reserving opinion matter. Lancet authors lot evidence view,but setlling question still future. appearance delta coincides time lapsed since people vaccinated earler year. data shows lower effectiveness delta slight compared effect waning immunity. (Sighs American.) Yup. infuriating &amp; depressing.  America leads world developing vaccine huge death rate large portion people are, put simply, stupid.   J&amp;J vaccine 6 months ago almost equivalent unvaxxed now? Nah, beauty free speech people legally say dumb shit legally tell off. Medicine relies studies called randomized controlled trials (RCT) ultimate proof whether drug works. Last checked never RCT shows ivermectin prevents death. RCT expensive involved often someone would attempt one easier-to-execute studies suggest medication MIGHT beneficial (examples non-RCT studies include ""open label trials"" ""retrospective studies""). Many medications look promising retrospective open-label study pan RCT thus thought effective - happened hydroxychloroquine ivermectin.

Nah  slander? mean… Made think ""Nice, Ron"" video lol: Ok, sue slander/libel. Ruin them. Use scumbag corporate lawyers good change. I'm ignoring anything, I'm okay risk bring others I'm vaccinated already it. getting booster soon, too. pass covid someone myself, oh well. I've done opinion sufficient, anything much cost reward. Pfizer turned government funding vaccine believe antiviral efforts. talking specifically development efforts. Considering cost bringing drug market approach billion dollars price pretty reasonable. Additionally, stated charging countries others (the US towards top price range). Sorry Ivermectin always stated used anti-viral don’t follow   Korea's cases deaths changed much increase vaccinations, kinda seems strange. Korea Japan handled pandemic well cases deaths plummeted later. must many factors play here. kinda expected see similar drop, must long away. measurements study per capita probably reason Qaaron Steve Rinella good theory this! shouldn’t matter became available. whether people belong “vaccinated” “unvaccinated”. 

I don’t like article doesn’t link source. people like read actual study anx journalistic interpretation compare monoclonal antibodies, one less adverse reactions? prove deaths exaggerated looking excess deaths compared previous pre-COVID year. That’s simple.

That’s estimates underreporting calculated. I’ve seen nothing say country exaggerated deaths. call conflict interests. thing happened second shot. would break rash around neck ears. never allergies kind, super unusual. can’t say 100% certainty vaccine, timing aligns. finally got control 2 months ago, still went ahead got booster 2 weeks ago. I’ll let know reoccurs. wolves get covid?! instead 6 days sick, maybe I'll three. yay me? actually, would great. Thanks info Yeah know city life like.

The places got hit first hard international centers travel tourism, real warning bad going be. cities made attractive visit, attractive visit made conduits initial spread.

You know happened subways pandemic first hit first lockdowns took effect. deserted.

There's also much evidence many people getting elevators subways. much talking those, ventilation pretty good, masks really help. mostly sustained unprotected unventilated exposure workplaces, schools, restaurants parties really spreads it.

Let repost since doubt even took look them:

[Per county per capita county per capita guy probably 5th vaccination appointment lol need find better friends.  coming CEO company fined many many times spreading misinformation drugs, cost lives innocent victims. Drug companies routinely, routinely falsify information bury information sell drugs.

I'm fully vaccinated way, CEO Pfizer accuses others misinformation, bullshit detector goes wild. BMI - you’re american, chances you’re overweight, offense.
Depression anxiety (as others said)
Occupation - say meet clients frequently, travel lot work, starting job service sector. make something vague, common, believable. one truly cares tbh. 

If deny shot, try different location. live selfish country. once, use selfishness behalf others. unethical thing sit around waiting ethics others urgency society align know right. You’re right here, need get booster.  efficacy therapeutics preventatives, vaccines included, almost always lower real world clinical use clinical trials. reason companies faking results. real numbers real people. Companies horror 'getting caught' understandably so. would end company. 

The reason claims derived clinical trials reflect happens street clinic. Companies select experimental volunteers well. sickies allowed. Nobody history severe allegies sit poke. bad reaction would mess whole trial. Few, any, 95yr olds constant coughing due CHF wheeled doors wheelchairs. on. 

The simple reality presented trials *not* real effectiveness. found huge numbers people sorts vaccinated numbers added properly long period time. real world laboratory. 

When number clinical trial magnified media common sense suggests *guess* percentage subtract mind. This, course, guess nature, comfort know always *some* subtraction. opposite, 'addition', extremely rare. 

The big worry world declining effectiveness passage time. Here's [a study discusses amongst factors. treatment way expensive, although don’t know it’s profitable not. seem much anti vaccine sentiment popular flavors religion. ones around seem hate one meets beach, one meets industrial unit one buying pastor jet. last one freely admits religious grounds vaxxed concept required something. 

Iirc catholics, Muslims, jews, major Christian denominations (Mormons, even Jehovas Witnesses). instances (Mormons?) church leadership said fine get it, push back flock. agree you. also consider things antivaxxers believe. statement going convince people vaccines problematic already think so. one $700 course prevents .05 hospitalizations, $14,000 prevent one hospitalization. I'm talking value human life anything like that. simply stating amount money government saving paying treatment vs. paying hospitalization phenomenal. government less corrupt, taxpayers would paying way less paying give everyone gets Covid.  people ignore fact Obese people suffer Covid least 98.2% people catch recover. People sides listen stats want listen to. Ruining child’s life make point, eh? Oh, ""research"" Texas doing...

/s True taking 5th circuit conservative also supreme court conservative. law get blocked result pandemic, one high rate compliance here, outdoor mask mandate Delta. it, though, people still think can't spread outdoors. 

On upside, went Costco pleasantly surprised many people wearing N95s equivalents. older, I'm glad word getting around.  Yeah, one interesting things found politics neuroscience plays it. really interesting depending brain structure connectivity people prone behave certain manners. 

I think would really interesting depth brain imaging people tend think long term outcomes vs. short-term. 

Plus, environmental factors play into? kid know next meal would come would condition people think short term outcomes? found portion obese people structural difference portion brain involves motivational behaviour related physical outcomes. crazy much brain plays beyond ""thinking"". 

 Also, hormones play well? studies showing higher levels testosterone associated increased risk taking Pinnacle short term outcomes. 

Another thing observed seems education big factor comes thinking long term outcomes.

Really would really interesting know aspects play people make decisions. think simple think long term unfortunately. some, almost seems like would trained overtime. 

I know whole covid lock evident made complete sense. wish much harder lockdown save people. always think long term consequence benefit. ate donut would think would effect 80 haha. That's type person am. However, still struggled covid I'm extremely extroverted, make harder personally. literally built porch could talk people walked outside safe distance lol. need social interaction swayed slightly toward short term outcomes. Although, significant extent. 

I guess, seems tend think long term outcomes tend much successful life unless president people want reelect lol anyone find sample size this? mean that’s great end day, OPs point, there’s really way prove that?? prove disprove that? that, pandemic beginning, Georgian Orthodox Church insisting celebrating Easter mass, despite dangerous would been. particualarly foolish Patriarch, Ilia II, late 80's, stand chance got COVID. problem exclusive Georgia; Serbian Orthodox Patriarch also died last year COVID, contracting funeral Montenegrin Orthodox Patriarch, died COVID. pay $700 treatment 600 people (since know going end hospitalized), prevent 35 hospitalizations.

All included average-cost calculations. 5% hospitalization 1% death rate per positive test state (which far healthier younger US average). 

One regimen following positive test results would expected prevent nearly .05 hospitalizations nearly .01 deaths. Using $2m value life (essentially lowest possible justifiable value) that's bit less $20,000 worth lives saved per course.

Getting people deny virus exists get tested always going problem.   Oh interesting heard anything one. Unfortunately 2 April either way wait, quite while. I'm just. tired. gets blocked US loses. temporary think companies proceed setup plans require vaccines instead waiting around. chance Florida underreported cases?

Ummm....... Sad see beloved guy sink low. Should’ve trusted science Joe Rogan. There’s free sites state, questions asked. test last Thursday felt ill Saturday got tested location.   words Charles Dickins, ""If would rather die, better it, decrease surplus population."" seem deep misunderstanding dense, urban life actually like. 

To enter exit home way work, may sharing elevator many households building. get busy subway platform 100 strangers you’ve never seen life despite commute every day life. get subway car another 100 strangers you’ve never seen before, riding close quarters 30 minutes get work take cramped elevator morning rush office building mates squeeze get work time exact start time. work day starts conference rooms meetings much larger companies rural RV manufacturing plant. day ends experience way home. go bars Uber taxi stranger dropped bunch strangers rode closed environment another 100-200 people you’ve never seen life establishment. 

Also, let’s pretend Joe’s Dive Bar number people NYC club weekend. Certain places meat processing facilities rural areas got hit hard because…wait it…a densely populated working environment multigenerational housing people needed live order make ends meet. 

Population density absolutely definitely significant factor spread covid mitigation’s place prior vaccines. see plainly seeing places spikes novel virus first hardest. reason it’s leveling due stubbornness hesitancy take vaccine. US define ""covid-19"" death?

Where live, defined ""dying within 28 days positive test"", obviously creates scepticism certain number people would die anyway. reality, numbers probably cancelled people take 28 days die virus, see definition like would make people uncertain exact figures.  Sirens need vaccines, Same. got J&amp;J recently Pfizer booster.

What I’m curious is: (or less) protected someone simply two doses Pfizer? protected, mixed-and-matched different vaccine types? meant vaccines like MMR, diptheria, tetanus mandated school, required everywhere else. rash around neck. Almost looks like heat rash. Goes away 30-40 min. Raahes hives? making scenarios here? That’s literally what’s happening comments. Great! Good luck you. Yup. There's certainly overlap, whole different thing. I'd call worse.  Hey all. got Pfizer booster last week. originally got J&amp;J bad reaction. sore arm side effect. taking week cardio, started yesterday. I’ve getting rashes working out. Hasn’t happened before. Think worth talking doctor about? Anyone else similar effects?  believe unsure get COVID-19 vaccine... again, many thinking ""yes, worth getting that's rare lasts couple days minor symptoms"".

A lot people assume that's vaccine supposed work.

Most people learn school vaccines make immune giving small amount dead virus, many cases that's correct. lot know coronavirus vaccines used Western countries different mechanism action, ""getting covid-19"" mean thing ""being exposed virus"". fucks Alabama waaaaaay cough them... populated city Dominion sue Rudy Mr. Pillow lying voting machine products, see Pfizer sue someone lying product too. Whatever like! good choices. side effects besides sore arm work (week in) I’ve getting rashes neck. Can’t pin anything shot. go away 40 min, still annoying :/ Dominion sue Rudy Mr. Pillow lying voting machine products, see Pfizer sue someone lying product too. logical fallacy cherry pick aspects medicine (with expertise field) support political religious beliefs. disagreement effectiveness vaccination *actual* medical professionals, debate comes *entirely* charlatans.  mom 61 got moderna booster. said first two fine booster dose kicked butt.  depends area. quit Nextdoor.com awhile back anti mask anti vaccine posts. Yes Monday(yesterday) respond lawsuit side filed respond today. responded, court needs issue ruling. take day, week, month etc. Regardless long take, law blocked able enforced. Hence called injunction nasal spray also separate story; they're testing Astra Zeneca administered nasal spray. Guy works got J&amp;J late spring go hospital little month ago Covid pretty useless 3 weeks testing positive. Made happy (at time) settle Moderna late March.  go get it. questions answered today were:
1. booster full dose? 
2. side effects last shot?
3. arm? article says US govt Monday file. Temporary injunctions don’t last long.  It’s true…there’s huge delay. I’m disappointed parent year old effective controlled trial. people took exactly 3 5 days onset symptoms. everyone going get tested, receive result, start taking med within 3-5 days. hospitalization rate placebo group (over 6%) seemed higher actual average US hospitalization rate (1%-5% test positive). mean still high rate efficacy normal use. may slightly less effective trial.

The trial article said almost exactly did:

""Similar reductions COVID-19-related hospitalization death observed patients treated within five days symptom onset; 1.0% patients received PAXLOVID™ hospitalized Day 28 following randomization (6/607 hospitalized, deaths), compared 6.7% patients received placebo (41/612 hospitalized 10 subsequent deaths), high statistical significance (p&lt;0.0001)""

So 6 people 607 treatment group hospitalized vs. 41/612 placebo group. group 600, 35 hospitalizations prevented. mean prevents 35 every 600 hospitalizations, 600 people get Covid, 41 hospitalized without intervention. pay $700 treatment 600 people (since know going end hospitalized), prevent 35 hospitalizations. Considering cost treating 600, $12,000 spent per hospitalization prevented.

And actually mean totally mystery push back. mean makes logical sense obviously corruption. reasons $700 price tag ""really cheap.""  pull almost measures, cancel FFP2 masks

If vaccine freely available people had, say, months get it, see problem this.  get paid write prescriptions pills aren’t selling 6 cents demand. first dose worse second. Curious 3 go… two shots Pfizer vaccine May/June, thinking taking booster shot week. booster take? Pfizer Moderna? Also bit nervous taking booster… booster experience like?  pharmacist hurts soul agree pharma CEO...but are. Texas party registration. still surprising stat though. guess British Medical journal lying pfizer history lying telling truth. Ill go get help maybe make make sense me. blocked court ruling. said expedite decision seen actual date It’s blocked Monday. Well yeah, vaxxed 100% likely die vaccine unvaxxed. Take that, libs!

I Covid surgery February 2020, July 2020. 

In April year (2021) first Pfizer dose. May second Pfizer dose. September got booster shot (Pfizer 3rd dose) I'd reading vaccine protection starts dropping 3 months- despite CDC saying. 

The 3rd dose worst, certain. chills sweats, arm killing (no arm pain first two), nauseous, terrible headaches. nothing compared actual infection last year though- *nothing*. 3 days felt better, Covid long haul symptoms halved. felt like entirely new person couple weeks improvement. also can't disprove tea Bigfoot yesterday.

That mean Bigfoot anything nutso conspiracy theory. Spread cats, mink deer proof man made?

I mean, proof, logical he's saying.

There dozen reasons made lab. makes claim, better bring hard evidence. one approved vaccines developed America. So, quick question. buddy works walmart. kid exposed covid school family supposed quarantining apparently. wife fully vaccinated, kid able get vaccine yet like 9-10 allowed vaccine given super recently. 

His work wants come despite told quarantine, basis he's fully vaccinated. Looking CDC guidance seems youre vaccinated dont quarantine unless symptomatic, not. 

Does recourse here, legally required report work like normal? dEfInE rAcIsM hurr durr. fucking sub really turned anti vax circle jerk.  Yes. true, regulations softened allow operating ICU beds per assigned staff, current labour shortage eats actual number beds used.

Calling accomplices destruction economy complicit deaths die covid days would good start, IMO.  Oh guarantee hes told better good. also happens enrich company...we lie validate want believe. Irritates long waited issue booster guidance data mRNA booster would safe effective early summer. Shit, say? Actually lends mis &amp; disinformation really moving goal post. Misleading public thinking treatment Parkinson's drugs Pfizer proves spreads it.  So, vaccine donations poorer countries indeed speeding up? reliable studies show **efficacy booster shots older people (65+)?**

The studies find people general. parents 70+ get moderna booster (they previously got 2 pfizer shots) since booster adapted Delta i'm sure give really protection it.

**Second,** using booster adapted Delta variant? kinda feel Pfizer Moderna mainly want get rid original stock first giving us vaccin adapted Delta. tests adapted vaccin back August went silent better believe since they've always said big benifit mRNA vaccins easily adapted new variants. would assume nearly students vaccinated. Going see outbreaks among vaccinated, yet boosted, groups. College students part living normal lives case foreshadows continue happen nationally throughout holidays without expanded vaccinate uptake booster shots. Thankfully, working these: shots kids, vaccine mandates, possible booster eligibility expansion. Covid never going go away. Unless vaccinate every single animal planet too. like flu seasonal strain approximated. There’s “getting this” magical pill that’s going wipe out. That's quite wall text based assumption putting words mouth.

But comparing drunk driving sad almost feel bad 48% percent Americans whose health care financing socialized programs, programs paid tax dollars. Medicare+Medicaid+CHP+Tricare+prisoners+IHS 48% Americans. need get remaining 52% covered universal program get profit waste health care financing system.

We also need military budget greater next 11 nations' budgets combined. money could improve lives Americans instead continuing madness. No, diagnosed prion disease. assume this. kept isolation special facility died remains destroyed carefully prion disease KNOWN. go trouble me, random friend family, made assumption. deer-eating man got prion disease. 

The fact lived deer (and maybe squirrels) state known high levels CWD deer makes *really* look like got deer. Thought gonna drop result stat something.... may right common sense alert conflict interest. ridiculous

A million Americans (and 20+ million around world) fucking died extremely contagious respiratory virus 99% spread unmasked people spending time together indoors, one unvaccinated person another. Taking simple basic precautions response basic common sense, human decency, responsible public policy. “ridiculous”. could sue anti-vaxxers, force produce evidence claim settle everything have. going criminalize ignorance, would charge absurd amounts money education? coming CEO profiting vaccine, course would say that. Anti-vaxxers show systemic issue society, criminalizing behavior fix it. Pfizer attempted take legal action libel slander laws? Bavaria FFP2 masks still mandatory high school large enough portion students vaccinated, soon. middle elementary school gotten chance students fully vaccinated yet, soon.  True Scientists haven’t identified relationship initial inflammatory reaction long-term response leads protection. There’s scientific proof someone obvious side effects vaccine better protected COVID-19. there’s reason exaggerated innate response would make adaptive response better.   many anti-vaxxers want stay ""pure blooded"" 🙄 Good Philippines! Today back normal least. want nothing covid boosters sure. J&amp;J knocked ass 24 hrs high grade fever 8-9 hours felt blah functional another 12 that. Moderna booster gave low grade fever 24 hrs straight another 24 feeling blah fairly non-functional. Left work lunch time went home lay couch. Reaction much severe J&amp;J last long. Reaction slightly milder (we're talking 7/10 instead 9/10) Moderna drug much longer. Took closer 60 hrs start feeling normal again. two key differences UK Germany. One UK around double covid19 deaths per population Germany, so, get UKs situation (immunisation) would need burn another 100.000+ deaths. Second, UK similar vaccination rates cover fewer young people Germany elderly. Therefore better protected overall hospitalisations etc. According Drostens newest podcast. Furthermore wouldnt take UKs current situation (incidence) desirable Germany.
Also according Drosten boosering medium term strategy, long term strategy would vaccinate not-yet-vaccinated.
Oh, finally want add: Nobody controlling shit here. goes one day see people without masks public transport shops. r/woodyandwilcox Got Moderna booster last night injection site sore zero side effects. got Moderna initial first two doses, second dose laid bed day fever etc. booster, nada. Weird? Uganda get infected get injected.  yeah let people say stay spotlight high dry makes bad individual exactly cost millions lives Despite media coverage low vaccination rate 18 year olds, arent biggest issue here.

There 9,2 Mio. germans 0-11 year old yet vaccinated, 4 0-5yo; 2,6 12-17yo unvaccinated 11,9 18-59 unvaccinated 3,5 60+ unvaccinated. Considering burden disease unvaccinated 15,4 18+ issue here.

Endemic's really *level,* category transmission. entirely possible current infection levels become new pattern virus mutates.

I think point time really focus narrowly ICU capacity. there's minimal risk running ICU beds, that's real metric guiding society-wide restrictions.

If risk tolerance lower that, mitigations personally do.

He's regular Atlantic contributor articles generally pretty good; I'm hoping maybe follows introspective piece reaction we're widespread among readers. crime china. Glad keeping vaccination, good. case seems actually ignoring reality, enjoy contrarian degree conversation okay putting people risk necessary. thing guess, choices live potential consequences may bring others. hope everyone around avoid illnesses them.  ignore flu, respond infections, take precautions beforehand mitigate risks much possible.

Don't we? mean, aside staying home sick feel sick, would say mostly ignore flu.

I'm denial camp, but, even getting tested point seems questionably useful. guess information better, but, *will exposed* virus sooner later. Maybe deferring get booster shot, treatments better, ICU capacity better, make sense, sliding scale.

To mind, author's life would exactly never even got tested. would gotten sick, gotten better, and, well, probably that's it. CEO Pfizer allowed Israel vaccinated? Go get it! I’ve Moderna too. I’ve heard mixed things different people, me, side effects weren’t bad booster. felt tired next day kind foggy mentally. day that, felt great. Good luck good protecting others.  thought female hero? Check number 5, believe people believe!!! Eat CWD deer brain sure. Get injection. Give injection?  Aside NoCovid bubble, people care long Covid vaccinated people perfectly fine idea might catch virus. restaurants bars Berlin full late 2019 now. that's good, people returning normal life should.

There ZERO evidence supports claims possible major effects long COVID. poorly researched several studies among available see difference symptoms people virus never also lived lockdowns.  That's criminal, too. Got trivial questions?   criminals -- scare quotes? They're biological terrorists. count lucky legally drive/vote/reproduce.   goal get people infected, be. accepted many people get virus, eventually everyone will.

Vaccination cuts already low long COVID risks half. case, much NoCovid bogeyman real problem. great world leaders. Yeah, do, third us braindead. Yeah I'm 46 overweight exactly 6 months 2nd Moderna Friday. This.

Yeah, that's statistics better source decision-making individual anecdotes. Get ""both sides"" bullshit here. vaccines extremely effective, yet 100% effective.   also manage clinical research one big global independent firms, wouldn’t worried startup aggregating data evidence healthcare organizations. sounds like they’re data collection, they’re analyzing it.  know phizer, saved life vaccine, however mean fiddle laws things control l, stick labs, pills vaccination please Facebook enters chat  vaccine uptake could better, bad 67% fully vaccinated, reason highest numbers infections (for now) manageable numbers hospitalized people quite low numbers deaths. already extra taxes levied drinkers smokers. sugar tax. numbers pre-pandemic deaths use comparison isn’t questioned.  even mean? read article? 

How expect highly contagious disease stop spreading? ""Also...we're done it"". vaccinated, mean protective bubble around. got mine less 6 months. questions asked boxes tick. Full-strength third shot Pfizer. (CVS Pharmacy grocery story, booked online appt ahead time.)  mean. course he'd say that.

Still 0 side effects arm little sore. 0-4 age group lowest per capita cases except recent Delta surge, slightly higher cases 65+ group. course, 65+ vaccinated group country. Maybe that’s mean.

Depends. prefer minimize chances outbreak school, definitely soon. rather ""let 'er rip"" believe virus go away tired want to, well then. heard over, virus ""care"" think. Never has; never will.

Better benchmarks even think shedding masks schools. one idea, keeping mind school spread almost always mirrors community spread: (1) community transmission stays low 3 weeks row increased least week, (2) overwhelming percentage people learn work school fully vaccinated (probably around 90%, thanks Delta), preferably both, consider ditching masks. Again, that's idea; plenty ways approach problem, I'm saying always right. bottom line follow numbers, base decisions tell rather feel things be. course sucks, opponent tough this, dig deep ways beat it, knowing always looking (and exploiting) ways beat you!

One step time, we'll get there. Yeah, bizarre would even issue guidelines like excludes 20% population take local transmission rates account. No, think agree wouldn’t closing current surge even isn’t something I’m - toddler can’t get vaccine I’m still trying avoid infection even knowing I’m unlikely get seriously ill. wish would actually ensure patrons vaccinated though. point wasn’t suggest shut down, many people back normal even rates high, which, vaccinated (and boosted) isn’t necessarily crazy since hopefully cases almost entirely mild - it’d lovely people avoided things could cause spread voluntarily far things understand isn’t case, various reasons different people. also think America obesity problem need start talking effects chances sickness, especially COVID. immunologist tell can’t really count “natural”/unvaccinated immunity.  level resistance far variable vaccination, case Sars cov-19, apparently lasts 10-18 months. right enough time people caught covid waves 1 2 catch spread again.   


The real way end pandemic point vaccination boosters. I'll take point even further. Evolutionary biology continual struggle every gene prevail, necessary cost genes' prevalence; pandemic tiny manifestation struggle. struggle fundamental fabric everything every cell bodies, every reproducing cell, virus, particle, protein, living time. 

As whether new, well, ""Nothing isn't, thinking makes so."" Good news, get Covid. Bad news, herpes. less unvaccinated ones driving wave. breakthroughs, yes. alone account massive number hospitalizations. data 2 days ago state Saxony-Anhalt. states particularly low vaccination rates (Thuringia Bavaria) look much different I'm stop flu comparisons please? 

Comparing *vaccinated breakthrough infections* flu fair, though. mortality rate Plus, us still actually care health safety people unvaxxed choice.

Honestly, *want to* pass virus anyone, think social contract requires act protect obstinately refusing protect themselves, less likely take basic precautions (like masking) themselves.

If someone wants remain unvaccinated, right (and think be), rights extend behavior. right expect others wear masks protection. addition, want protect themselves, wear N95.

[You realize place today likely remain *years* right? Things expected get much actually talking people making semi-permanent changes lives protect relatives refuse protect themselves. makes sense people would push back that.

(Edit, responding two posts once, see second half really directed another user.)  2/3 people got full coverage think reach 70% total all. lots people anti vaxx rather believe magic science.

plus last year time lockdown. don't. restaurants, cinemas, concerts, disco...everything open. everything full. 

due summer initial success vaccine coverage entire country went sort ""it's over, beat COVID!""-mode taking stuff serious anymore

and showing. 

every day they're waiting new lockdown going kill many people...it brutal.  idea point trying make. trying say Pfizer CEO saying ""antivaxxers criminals"" going play literally community trust science government. Purely anecdotal, but... 

Had scare last week. We're hybrid work meeting people office, home. Saw people pouring small meeting room, since job recently turned heat, excessively hot meeting rooms, gonna take call desk. figured... eh, bad optics. 

Long story short, director texts 2 days later says may covid exposure, go home/put mask. Hour later HR emails saying collect stuff go home, exposed. person pre-symptomatic breakthrough case developed cold-like symptoms night. texted since...I sitting RIGHT NEXT THEM. wearing mask, not. 

I'm vaxxed, think ""this it. caught now."" quarantined, got 3 rapid tests (2 days exposure, 5 days exposure, 6 days exposure) well PCR. negative. 

Regardless whether think mask, fact vaxxed, combination, dumb luck... thanking lucky stars. understand it, pill already development something else worked covid. whatever make covid basically gravy.  couldn’t boosters MONTHS AGO. Time stop listening WHO. realize live sort bubble, town immediate surrounding towns, masks still much worn public. go towns over, I’m weird one still wearing masks. feels wrong still wear mask, especially numbers creeping back up. Last week, state, 52% new cases breakthrough cases, feel like one paying attention. I’m loving Covid Foxtrot Remember. lot public health officials, have. Topol, Ding like nobodies pandemic, least average Joe. large online platforms, get called interviews conferences offer theories/advice/opinions. fear fading away pandemic, would take say grain salt.  check box Internet saying qualify, link CDC stuff qualifies.

But yea, one checks qualify. ask way qualify.

For judgemental mob, qualify, unfortunately. qualify two ways. Yeah, robber barons must sit quiet angry hordes forget start “eating rich” part timeline.  flu pandemic Kansas? I‘d argue it’s opposite. „permanent commission vaccinations“ monitoring current research issues recommendations based facts.
Recommendations include risk-benefit evaluation well.

If current data indicates, Biontech safer vaccines 30, it‘s right thing recommend.

Unfortunately lot unvaccinated aren’t really open scientific approach anymore. sure profit firms public interest - similarly health level public. agree known wide spread mistrust jealousy. Assange would say people go get yr jab...But even Trump booed advise public get vaxed. really varies city city. Covid might well here. cares think? Good hear, also want travel December want get Booster week before. would exactly 5 month . need go wild mask deer. volunteer? agree hard watch process. Indeed, every account virus hard read, whether recounted innocent people struck down, misinformed people victimized ""influencers,"" victimizing, malicious politicians, profiteering mask-engrossers. 

A lot us living sunk costs avoiding something that, least year, reasonably considered dreadful mysterious, which, rightly wrongly, caused enormous disruptions socioeconomic fabric entire globe. 

Everyone cares things left lot emotional baggage, varying levels insight it. much learned done last year diminished mystery dread, learning stress leaves deep ruts. going take time, considerable cognitive effort heal--to get risk assessments back line. That's especially true anxious people, reality now, almost everyone profoundly anxious something. aggravated media profit anxiety contention.

I'm boosted, I'm still anxious settings, despite everything rationally know risks. going take retrain myself. Meanwhile, read norovirus flu, want either. fact ranking coronavirus point suggests perception shifting take new situation. 

Once new antiviral medicine cabinet, take that, fluvox, aspirin week get positive test, covid become less factor given paramyxovirus, mind. I'm preparing conspiracy text uncle coming days... ""theory,"" lie. One used persuade people get life-saving vaccine also protects rest us. Fence, meet HungarianMockingjay. He's gonna sit awhile.  yes someone refuses vaccine, sign something medical record pay care get sick. common refrain seems be, ""the pandemic ends healthcare system overwhelmed"" healthcare system always going overwhelmed enough nurses working hospitals? Whenever I've done pickup food places seem full unmasked people dining, think point even people vaccinated, delta, gonna contribute spread.

Sure, support closing indoor dining reduce spread? (I not).

Everyone age 5 eligible vaccine.

Essentially age 18 eligible booster.

Immunocompromised people eligible third shot (which still ~75% effective group) booster 6 months later.

On top that, anti-virals approved substantially reduce risk (by 90%), find infected early enough (within 5 days symptoms).

The mortality rate *for vaccinated* similar flu. Yes, means double normal flu deaths. think need ruin livelihoods closing restaurants, etc. this. way, situation likely *years*. support closures now, likely supporting long, long time. I’m gonna need another booster shot Thanks. Reason asked b/c FDA recently said 0-4 group ""least affected"" covid age group. I've trying post data showing is, best, questionable assertion, somebody thread fighting it: And? sounds like I'm gonna frustrating day work haha realistically, basic principle is, situation peak accelerating, wait"" bring back anti-virus measures, ""the earlier, stricter, better.""

Does mean business restrictions? Lockdowns? Closures?

There political societal that. People *barely* tolerating indoor mask mandates places them, see sentiment flipping embracing strict measures pretty much anywhere country, especially holiday season. 

The writing wall here. need focus vaccinations, understand **will** cases spread, realistic expectations people willing tolerate 2 years this. Yet treated like civil matter. vaccine mandate. option either get vaccine get tested week wear mask. also OSHA policy.  long history OSHA rules companies must adhere want exist.

The option get tested OSHA rule going make hard court keep blocked.

And, companies still use OSHA policy enforce ""mandate"". enforceable federal government company wants anyway. saw earlier year CDC suggested companies (grocery stores, cafes, etc.) require masks unvaccinated. Many companies used suggestion require masks. I'm bad math, brain derped gullible falling propaganda put would love see America eat dirt

So, stupid?  worry US neither pay attention plan I'm bad math, thanks correcting link COVID-NET, also operated CDC, it’s see hospitalizations. goes show I'm great math student Near Silicon Valley, mask wearing still strong. However places like Fresno people look funny wearing mask, since start whole thing. Ah yes I'm bad math, thanks would love live world time surge Cases becomes big deal hospitals filled. Vaccine immunity natural immunity shown decrease hospitalization feel like articles like one used promote two things. Instead used spread fear. Clearly immunity works!   People spend time indoors autumn

Anecdotally, least, disagree. People midwest spend time indoors winter spring, cold.

We starting get unpleasant weather (in MN, least). last couple months beautiful time year, people things outside.

Cases MN rising whole time (steadily increasing since July). Well shots free US, I'm sure negotiated down. pill probably expensive, even insurance. Federal CDC guidance that, guidance. States follow it. generally do, though. agree points. correct saying it. excerpt:

By end day Wednesday, approximately 900,000 elementary-aged children gotten first doses Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, White House official shared NPR advance announcement expected later day. 
 
That represents 3% children aged 5 11. 700,000 appointments scheduled days ahead pharmacies like CVS Walgreens. That's official count, right?

Since apparently needs said: support covid vaccination. kiddos got first shot last Thursday! ❤️💉🙌 Abstract 
BACKGROUND 
Safe, effective vaccines coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) urgently needed children younger 12 years age. 
 
METHODS 
A phase 1, dose-finding study ongoing phase 2–3 randomized trial conducted investigate safety, immunogenicity, efficacy two doses BNT162b2 vaccine administered 21 days apart children 6 months 11 years age. present results 5-to-11-year-old children. phase 2–3 trial, participants randomly assigned 2:1 ratio receive two doses either BNT162b2 vaccine dose level identified open-label phase 1 study placebo. Immune responses 1 month second dose BNT162b2 immunologically bridged 16-to-25-year-olds pivotal trial two 30-μg doses BNT162b2. Vaccine efficacy Covid-19 7 days second dose assessed. 
 
RESULTS 
During phase 1 study, total 48 children 5 11 years age received 10 μg, 20 μg, 30 μg BNT162b2 vaccine (16 children dose level). basis reactogenicity immunogenicity, dose level 10 μg selected study. phase 2–3 trial, total 2268 children randomly assigned receive BNT162b2 vaccine (1517 children) placebo (751 children). data cutoff, median follow-up 2.3 months. 5-to-11-year-olds, age groups, BNT162b2 vaccine favorable safety profile. vaccine-related serious adverse events noted. One month second dose, geometric mean ratio severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing titers 5-to-11-year-olds 16-to-25-year-olds 1.04 (95% confidence interval \[CI\], 0.93 1.18), ratio meeting prespecified immunogenicity success criterion (lower bound two-sided 95% CI, geometric mean ratio point estimate, ≥0.8). Covid-19 onset 7 days second dose reported three recipients BNT162b2 vaccine 16 placebo recipients (vaccine efficacy, 90.7%; 95% CI, 67.7 98.3). 
 
CONCLUSIONS 
A Covid-19 vaccination regimen consisting two 10-μg doses BNT162b2 administered 21 days apart found safe, immunogenic, efficacious children 5 11 years age.

Hey yuck yum ok? started school year required masking outdoors, indoor masking only. open air hallways, though, lot kids unmasked crowded narrow areas. However, we've next transmission schools. low case count overall, highly vaccinated area kids 12 vaccinated rate nearly 90%. vax rate high kids 5-12, could see masks coming January.

That 6200 deaths per million. don’t really get expert virologist take restrictions… mean, understand need say it’s job, nobody want lockdown restrictions, that’s sentiment country. tolerate indoor masking it’s mandated, latest opinion poll covid wasn’t even worries people. 
I always find funny scientists outraged things people like partying… maybe don’t invite parties That’s interesting everyone repo ding differently booster, friend wife bed sick three days Moderna booster said vaccination uptake plateaued parts Europe and, ""at time, there's relaxation public health social measures, cocktail see: fourth wave.""


His warning fall deaf ears US. great shame right outlook early pandemic, lockdowns accepted mask-wearing. ""public"" mostly tired, want ditch masks, refuse sort lockdowns (except...NY done right. remains seen new leadership step act accordingly). 

In Florida recently reopened international tourism. Granted, people vaccinated. Yet: vaccination status? booster? immune problems? 

The real fact even vaccinated individuals spread COVID variants countries arrive spread terrifying. 

So Florida, USA? Nothing, more: We'll expand tourism much possible, create many venues transmission can, offer virus whole new hunting ground unvaccinated poorly vaccinated fodder. 

Our vaccinated seniors still risk, even three shots. I've seen breakthrough cases seniors go bad. aware thousands travelling via cruises, too? took downturn cases sign okay travel. 

Why learned? make spend money appears influential scientists medical personnel's warnings. Lust, greed, avarice, one-upmanship, gluttony - sins American people. trade lives souls rather wear mask public. Social consciousness kicked curb. poke poke percent vaccinated state? That's important factor breakthrough stat. one oldest professions weird? „Look. Antivaxxers cost third yacht year. struggling don’t buy schpiel.“ Oddly enough point reusable. Dude, judge. walk alone outside mask on, wonders allergies. Obviously good, I've crunching 9 months vaccine eligibility would really like pain end denial. given up. whole logic behind mild breakthrough cases might cause spread unvaccinated population cause hospitals overwhelmed again.  Didn’t know mom worked brothel Makes one wonder.. like what, 2/3 Population vaccinated things worse vaccine? make sense?

Either BS vaccine pretty useless comes delta newer mutations general. Dont quite know would worse..

Just looked sure, 55.8 mio. People 67.1% population fully vaccinated.

Soooo.. wtf going on?  Every prediction specific holidays wrong, seems like half predictions specific events wrong. bad predicting virus. feel pretty bad women Stupid question disclaimer:

Are potential issues health insurance get booster “officially” eligible? mean, possibly charged getting vaccine I’m technically allowed to?

I know free never tell fuckery companies may pull great! Watching kids son Sunday, one even cried! son nervous around shots said even hurt. sore arm less 24 hours that's it. took 50 years admit viruses transmitted aerosols. change mind 2021. giving bad advice cleaning distancing entire time. Pretty questionable record ask me. they'd started ventilation masking beginning maybe would better shape. Trying get daughter afternoon. excited get shot. Imagine hunting season vax darts 25 mins show Pokémons could. That's following simple standard business plan anyone, reduce risk. Especially US court system sued could cost millions, even win. agree. think two months two months accurate pattern seasonality. surprised holidays supercharged transmission...

...that said, actually last year cases peaked holidays places so...maybe holiday effect overstated... slipped cvs got booster day started making appointments new age range kids. exactly 6 months since 2nd shot too.They gave me, questions asked (I honestly though going make big song dance managed load chron's disease absolutely immuno-disorder). Feels good. Vaccines ""aRenT EnOugH"" people refusing take them. simple that. NOOOOO everywhere look ""US NEEDS SECOND LOCKDOWN NOW""  got J&amp;J back March Moderna booster. Moderna worse J&amp;J IMO. J&amp;J hit much, much harder done 36 hrs so. Moderna hit hard lasted close 60 hrs cost two days work. sucked. Masks back schools France 41 year old makes question less safe data yet. Despite 60+% vaccinated, odd..

Are numbers describing amount vaccinated/unvaccinated intensive care?  get symptoms vaccine, feeling crappy day injections. got breakthrough infections since immunocompromised. thinking circle immunocompromised. 

Do reduce viral load public, stems play role quickly fight infection. That’s masking makes difference case rates in, example, Japan. Try meet people largest airiest room possible. Try wear glasses eyes vulnerable entry infection. Wash hands frequently, change mask frequently, too. find feeling bit crappy, keep distance immunocompromised people. It’s possible someone Covid isolate within home transmit others, vaccinated time sick reduced reducing chance transmission. I’d recommend get booster six months second shot. 
Using best practices significantly help. exposures suck even vaxxed. got exposed three days supposed run first marathon allowed race even though I'm vaxxed symptoms. sucks. blows life couple days even done everything right. 11yo got first shot Sunday! Well even pan out, J&amp;J one dose vaccine whereas everything else booster get go. would hospitalizations lower booster? I'm guessing totally uneducated opinion probably would decrease boosters.  submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Wow, got good one.

Yes safest everyone locks never leaves house. fewer deaths way, denying it. everyone stops driving car unless trip absolutely essential, fewer car accident deaths. political. There’s insignificant part scientific community feels added benefit booster isn’t big enough justify shots first world countries third world countries still waiting shots. 

We’re already donating ton shots, doubt takes overall pool, especially since we’re using doses intended unvaccinated, don’t know enough vaccine supply chain state certainty. personally happy received booster (though qualified several categories), happy parents wife’s parents received their’s. Ppl like me? Well can't tolerate wearing masks basic measures stop spread accept die breakthrough cases. people fazed happens family though. Yesss! schools never mandated say we've 70 80 cases schools. Continue on, nothing see here. ""here Europe"" quite general somewhat deceptive. plenty EU countries vaccinated 5-11 start.

The conversation started. Doctors divided. Try again. We’re scheduled Friday 6yo. think I’m excited shot mine!

Parents kiddos who’ve already shots, noticeable side effects tolerating better adults? I’ve read accounts lethargy seems it.  tune changes fast can't breath. Mine got Sunday! got booster time felt like died 🥴 One kiddos gets shot next Monday. I’m stoked!  past Saturday, happy well

Now 3 yo ;) Yea serious disconnect issue. necessarily simple anti-vax movement, more-so anti-trust government movement developing decades. We're seeing culmination expressed anti-vax. Sadly, public health suffers result. doctor shouldn’t/wouldn’t write it’s patients best interest. take script pharmacist, doesn’t say it’s for. know, it’s worms. Obviously tech choose many thinks. really benefitting get filled elsewhere legit treatment several valid resources claim MAID/RTD? sure think agree, I’m deeply disinterested participating permanent covid restrictions. 5 yo 0 symptoms taking first! Lol 6 people feel battle left fight masks. even war country.  Exactly. see lots people saying that, apart masks we’re “back normal.” we’re definitely closer normal year ago, true normal come don’t worry exposures rushing get test vaccinated asymptomatic. We’re yet. 

Like, I’m vaccinated boosted (JJ+Moderna), work trip next week can’t risk missing, I’m probably going anywhere picking takeout explicitly required leave Wednesday morning, risk it. run office get materials, I’ll probably stay masked safe. 

It’s absurd we’ve come this. It’s I’m managing time being. I’m destination, though, I’ll grand old time. Especially since it’s NYC strict vaccination requirements. whole state still indoor mask mandate everyone, schools required wear them, friend one state kid school started mask optional switched mandatory due outbreak pretty quickly (this go well small vocal subset parents, we've seen school board meetings). friend asked kid wear one school admitted frequently 'forgetting it' recess take outside (he's five) think wore part day days (she get arms either understood he's five year old), said though everyone wear school 'forgetting recess' started fall everyone wearing them.

On personal note, think soon places, certain point, cases low community vaccine availability children around long enough realistically access vaccine (say 2 months), taking school good idea. I'm thinking sometime holidays seems make sense. Given way virus behaved northern states last year, behaves year, cases start fall back January/February. Hopefully point ramp places still masking requirements happen.  pediatricians office said they’re trying encourage parents look shot elsewhere everyone make appointment office, getting shots arms would take forever.
We’ve one vaccine drive area 200k people, 150 shots. slow drive-by soon daughter class line easily longer 150 doses would allow. friends said process took 2 hours, daughters shots!
I able find appointment Walgreens Friday town counting lucky stars! stance young-ish, vaccine statistically dangerous him, getting COVID.

the 2.3 million estimate India. wow. ""I want research done vaccine!"" also him: ""Please give treatment 10 years less research done effects!"" US ever first lock down? Even height pandemic never prevented traveling leaving home... Agreed. got Pfizer shots lol googled first thing pop  doctors divided argument

lol they're not. Yes! I'm jealous everyone able get it. nearest us hour half way, starting next Wednesday!  way. youngest getting tonight, meaning household full vaxxed people. 20 months waiting, we're delighted part today's million!  think discussion takes remove masks necessary encourage people get vaccinated. People going excited get kids vaccinated nothing changes. again, Chantix give bunch people cancer. trust science, trust guy whose sole purpose funnel money top.  Mine get their's Saturday, I'm pretty pumped. booked booster flu shot too. School spread tends drive community spread rather merely mirror children germ machines. STD screening well, right? good news is, Early November time absolute worst COVID last year.

I don’t understand this. thought early January 2021 peak? (Assuming “national” means “United States.”) Worldwide, charts show late April 2021. missing? last FDA chief leave go right work board Pfizer? problem going away anytime soon. Seems they've got rooted pretty deep.  I’ve never seen succinct example twisted social dynamic we’ve found in, comment. comment alarming shouldn’t primarily vax/antivax argument, point. cognitive dissonance plaguing society inability reconcile looking like downfall. Criminal calls people criminals. News 11. Pat McAfee show every Tuesday. It’s called “Aaron Rogers Tuesday”. Agreed they're tech, right. they're pharmacist, wrong. always pharmacist's discretion fill script not. Selection bias, seeing work pharmacy. That's like saying one ten people schizophrenia that's average census. Guarantee tons people took apple flavored horse dewormer docs wrote script. Kill 'em all.

It's way sure. 10 year old daughter got yesterday. Huzzah! Probably like end January. parents wary averse getting kids vaccinated. want go first. others schedule issues makes hard organize 2 shots. Well year ago ""original"" virus R0 2-3, Delta R0 6-7, Delta spreads way better. 
But bigger issue homogeneous vaccination rate, state Bremen 80% population vaccinated, Saxony 50% (unsurprisingly, Saxony six times many cases Bremen). Hopefully next pandemic become endemic choice. optimistic believe younger people charge would change anything substantial manner.  U da MVP! Thanks! should, won’t. goalposts love even “what kids” “what immunocompromised” panel unanimously voted favor expanded categories. 

The main issue giving everyone, based comments, Biden announced that's wanted felt need assert independence, well virtually data-free myth antivaxxers saying authorizing boosters would deter first shots lying ass. Spoiler: were. Pandemic 3.0 Laugh can! /s Unless schools mandate vaccination, free whatever makes happy.

Personally agree logic whatsoever. US everyone (including kids) advised seasonal flu shot. that's besides point. nearly guarantee child risk all, matter minor, even quarantine school 10 days, giving painless jab, sign up. believe Scott G said earlier week US 3-5K pediatric hospitalizations. Surely make small percentage got infected, yet guarantee kid, sign up. Also we're still infancy understanding long term implications ""long COVID"". doubt whatsoever vaccine long term side effects, can't say virus shown attack organs. Lastly issue spread virus. becoming clear Delta difficult contain. it'll take everyone part greater good society. I'm happy family part.

BTW argument well B solid logic IMHO. Total risk summation underlying risks. choice accept many risks wish, binary state. must nice, must nice, government side. plenty things immunocompromised people risk average person? Uh, yeah is. it’s patient attitudes. part don’t want learn. Providers nurses explain blue face patients trust YouTubers misinformation easier digest there’s much providers nurses do... truth complicated requires real education fully grasp. misinformation directed anyone end people believing misinformation.

I actually agree completely. order people learn lesson, see people rely YouTube die higher rates people not. current system, responsibility outsourced government authority, means people continue idiots still receive good medical care; current crisis exposed shortcomings model, people value dirty work goes actually making sure medicine kill them.

Think way: government add guardrails cliffsides US, actually save lives, people would simply become less careful around cliffs spend time there. reason people's average savings fraction income dwindled since last century -- fewer consequences broke. (Goes major corporations too. they're going bailed every crisis, save money rainy day?)

I think recognized saving idiots fool's errand. Much better let taxpayer spending things minimized, let people learn experience. Unpaywalled;   5 year old got last Friday symptoms / side effects all. ""This article exclusive subscribers.""

Ok, moving on... Younger siblings won’t get seriously ill covid catch kids got Monday. side affects. know shocked hear that!😉 children live adults become seriously ill die Covid. mention children shuffled school home. They're grocery stores, restaurants sorts places expose at-risk adults. mention children immunocompromised right education well. course matters.  don’t think it’s strawman argument infection induced immunity isn’t recognized mask requirements, vaccine requirements enter businesses/bars/restaurants LA/SanFran/NY places - even though produces comparable/better protection vaccination. criteria things “certain threshold protection covid” infection immunity recognized. Otherwise difference virus perspective vaxxed vs infected immunity acquired immunity - determine individual is/is allowed do. still beneficial previous infected get vaccinated, lack recognition infection immunity likely drives anti vax sentiment well. rules simply don’t make sense gives legitimate criticism groups. 10-year-old cried 15 minutes test. said nose hurt badly. never wants again, nervously looking forward first vaccine dose tonight! people wonder want live CA insane rents.

Both possible outcomes, immediately see Mccarthy 2.0 going psycho I'd imagine really spend much time political realm.

Oof yeah that’s rough. I’m big city, ton options fortunately here.

Ah, sorry, yeesh, unfortunately take large percentage unvaccinated people fill ICUs. move somewhere south. Heck part NY almost one wears mask hasn’t months. booked two weeks. 


I drive couple hours Trumpville pick times. Paywalled me. 9 year old daughter got shot Sunday. sore arm next day felt generally tired. even went bed early Monday night! lucky find appointment early roll children's vaccines. school district also sent email plan opening vaccine clinics school campuses.

That's good hear! hopefully common sense prevail too, sucks easily misinformation spreads sticks around small communities. think shoes annoying, that's negligible downside compared stepping rocks whenever go out.

Then take shoes I'm home.

Masks exactly way, except wear mask I'm walking outside myself. still wear shoes I'm hobbit, though, sucks. That’s switched model stay date current research products.

The issue model seem increased trust doctors pharma companies. (As evidenced article started thread.)

With today's system, there's little incentive pharma companies doctors even try explain stuff patients, good system. think people going accept there's price paid increased complexity, price people able think scientifically see great improvement healthcare people able think scientifically. know child like needles (or, accurately, freaks getting needles...what kid likes getting needles?), buy [Emla cream Emla put arm 30 mins get needle. feel anything. Amazing stuff...keep first aid kit wasp stings, splinters, etc. Designed diabetics frequent needle users, minor skin surgery, etc. I..I would like children actually chance get vaccinated tea towel. normal lol ""Annoying"" absolutely even count we're comparing ""brain damage,"" ""lung, kidney, liver, heart and/or organ damage,"" ""death."" Good grief. Yes, kids sick masking, course want stop see antimaskers working make happen. Putting fingers ears going ""la la la, can't hear you!"" actually working toward solution. 100% … feels like people sides forgotten synthesize information think themselves. Cee Dee Lamb got bigger fine jersey untucked. kid got vaxxed yesterday already notice vast improvement 5G reception home! 🤣 smart option wait winter, another large uptick cases. Many schools reinstate month two.

This extremely predictable. COVID obviously seasonal ties weather forces people indoors most, spreading effectively homes. means hot weather south, cold weather north. Mild fall spring like weather likely lead best outcomes regions. 


The initial 2 shot vaccination regime also enough good chunk population. probably effective younger people, ineffective older vulnerable populations naturally weaker immunities. Boosters help people, especially latter. 


And finally, Delta. might well new virus entirely much virulent is. Increased viral particles lead spread, liklely airborne spread. KN95 N95 masks probably much effective cloth masks Delta, ever going worn fraction people. Children infected easily due increases viral load too, vaccines can't react quickly, especially antibody protection wanes. 


Plus, 20% unvaccinated population extremely low natural immunity probably still enough produce one last bad wave. Chances vermont's initial effectiveness keeping COVID cases low backfiring Delta population waning immunity natural protection quickly rip through. Im vaccinated three doses Pfizer, also don’t know living. don’t get questioning use masks hot button issue. Look around, people wearing them, don’t care, concentrate vaccinating, it’s better policy better use resources. Ohio's cases increasing every day month (week week 7-day average). reported cases first time since October 13th (last Wednesday reported \~4,500 new cases). easy us either. pediatrician's office taking appointments end month. So, scheduled CVS. One kids getting today. scheduled tomorrow. earliest could find tried book appointments last week. even get day. Overall, though, I'm glad happening. number cases school district seems higher November previous months. started vaccinating younger groups. still something like 20% unvaxxed even best areas you’ve probably got asymptomatic vaxxed people wandering around without care world. 6y/o got yesterday— side effects school today Fully agree! vaccinated live fear anymore. Time get life. I'm glad still getting vaccinated. would thrown pediatrician told get kids vaccinated. then, like you, would searching new pediatrician. 

Our Dr told us take whatever shot get ASAP. Getting kids protected mattered office. went CVS Monday great! Even toys suckers kids. usually get flu shot. husband teacher good idea. year's flu shot made us feel run down. Last year's didn't. time get one anything make arm little sore. one time react flu shot actual symptoms. guess we'll disagree political position expert panel CDC Director, appointed president US. live city outside Dallas, unmasked faces pretty rare. We're back new normal, life happening mouths covered (usually noses too). Whereas went Mississippi, got made fun wearing mask outside dense crowd. Libel…against inanimate object? kids set get past Sunday, youngest injured needed stitches. pushed back week. Set done Sunday. Yes would.
The pandemic ends everybody humoral immune responds least antibodies.

So two ways:
Vaccinate everyone
Let everyone become infected

Lockdowns measures ending pandemic, rather prolonging save many lives possible meantime.

But probably right this: extremely dangeours let take place right We're boat. Scheduled appointment 2 weeks, see roll goes.  Genuine question. I’m anti vaccine all… doesn’t study warrant caution Would obnoxious ask nurse show vial sure getting pediatric version/dose? also got expanded FDA recall. Unfortunately getting ready start taking it. bribed mine... cold hard cash. Half first shot, rest second. spouse got bonus work getting shot, told kids sharing it. LOL Could tell needle smaller larger flu shot? trying prepare kid hes asking same, better worse flu shot Foreign tourists vaccinated COVID-19 drug approved U.S. Food Drug Administration **World Health Organization** get green light enter United States November, according spokesperson Centers Disease Control Prevention. 
 
The WHOgranted approval three well Oxford-AstraZeneca/Covishield, Sinopharm Sinovac vaccines. 
  seen lot news discussion states rising cases.

Cases appear increasing Arizona, NH, Vermont (they're all-time highs, quite bizarre given lead U.S. vaccination rate), New Mexico, maybe Rhode Island, Colorado (which never really crested Delta wave), Minnesota, Nebraska, Michigan (also never really crested Delta), name few.

What's going here? lot states experienced colder temperatures states. harbinger things come winter? kids (6 &amp; 11) got shots Monday! Sore arms, little tired evening, side effects. I'll honest - reservation getting somewhere pediatricians office pharmacies supermarkets recruited trained pretty much employees give shot. got mine CVS, done floor manager got 3 hours training. know seems like simple thing, would really feel comfortable 5 year old injected pediatrician, nurse 15 years experience injecting medicine kids arm really FDA that's blame here. CDC best make eligibility pool boosters significantly larger FDA intended.  Happy report kid going list. relief knowing better protected school. totally agree you. Parents' attitudes toward masking ton influence kids feel it. Kids follow parents' leads. mine. Mild sore arm, complaints. Per Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) used collect reports adverse events vaccination general public. primarily used identify potential topics investigate regards vaccine reactions. However, event data VAERS often verified often self-reported, assumed adverse events VAERS actually associated cause vaccines, possible estimate frequency adverse events data.

Workers mandatory regular testing regimes currently also provided free kits government. support individuals self-test regularly, distributed six kits household August September, distributing another ten kits October December.

Vending machines!

The US federal government [purchased $1 billion worth rapid ""will increase number at-home tests 200 million per month December"" find anything distributed. CVS?

Other Singapore covid19 infrastructure:

It's impressive list web sites apps, long summarize. One stands useful, easy implement unlikely acceptable US privacy concerns automated reporting system [enforcing quarantine Another web site citizens ""find designated location, day time collect allocation masks.""

**TL;DR**: IMO Singapore excellent job organizing citizens applying tech fight covid19. comparison US inept. Singapore handicapped privacy concerns.

Looks like I’m shopping new pediatrician. I’m Texas might hard find one that’s contaminated Stupid. 100 times yes! support closing indoor dining reduce spread? (I not).

There's little proof measure controls COVID. People catch COVID kitchen dining room school district vaccine clinic works 5-11 got approved, added in. got first dose Monday. quick, easy experience compared getting flu shot Kroger Little Clinic (we waited long time). Yep soon 80% entire population Pennsylvania least one dose vaccine. state went 70% 80% pop. one dose quicker going 60% 70% pop. one dose. Pretty impressive. ""experts"" opinion flawed 

Listen here. There's certain group people consider doctors decades experience virology &amp; immunology ""experts"" quotes, think want group. Similar experience son. even offered son stay home Monday Sunday poke. even arm pain. kid made teflon!

Meanwhile, I'm STRUGGLING got flu shot covid booster yesterday. took chance stay bed today small win. need march doctors past mass graves. hundreds dying every day small country. 11 year old gets first today Autistic I'm proud ready going take like champ.

As often told high school: ‘Right’ mean ‘helpful’! Yeah think they're annoying too. schools lot things annoying, including homework PE.

When factor masks literally prevent people dying really negligible downside . cost/benefit much greater masks say, school dress codes, people generally accept. Done research, can't bothered argument. convinced already there's point wasting time. Byeeee Can't wait available Canada. math checks Get outta logic sound ideas. this, science?  No, that’s fact. it’s not. 

And address second point, way get via herd immunity. guess depends want booster. concern hospitalization may make sense data indicate greatly reduces chance infection age groups. FDA/CDC cared hospitalizations, hence limited approval. personally care getting infected opted get booster even though technically qualify either. 6 9 year olds went first thing Monday. excited. 6 year old tells everyone meets. drives nuts. Israelis made (good) deal first cut Pfizer - would share high quality data world. done so, great length better data quality hoped. yet, countries seem paying attention. astounds me. Lol right, isnt March 2020 CDC FDA data driven, normally fine, except want see bodies getting ahead immunity game. Sometimes data involve fatalities aggressive posture taken regardless much data have. There's ""official"" eligibility beyond 6 months since second dose cutoff. Several categories eligibility extremely vague arguably apply everyone. ""experts"" opinion flawed focusing hospitalizations deaths.. FDA's entire rationale authorizing boosters everyone although say it, care breakthrough cases lead hospilazations death. 

There tons data showing boosters effective Israel, across Europe, even US. Look Israel's daily case numbers plummeted authorizing boosters everyone example, well vaccinated European countries struggling outbreaks. Simply put: Boosters effective could make sure winter entire mess US.  I've got buddy citing Israeli study claims 27x effective immunity natural infection vs vaccine. clue accurate I'm sort medical researcher. poor argument herd immunity anyway metric crap ton people would die get make wonder naturally infected people recovered factor someway public policy. buddy also claims vaccinations destroy natural immunity makes sense I'm pretty sure that's utter crap. far tell legitimate medical reason get vaccinated you’re allergic one vaccine’s ingredients. several vaccines available now, might check see one work you. third doses pretty much ignore covid. didn’t think benefit significant enough justify diverting doses third world countries

This reasoning even stated Philip Krause's statement Lancet. Yet quite ridiculous, deciding safe effective medicine needed prevent treat disease US, instead diverted countries, even mandate FDA approval. good bring pandemic control country? I'm glad quit FDA, though last act position denying boosters general population. It‘s freaking cold russia, poor, better get hospital. would believe, many actually want Covid 19. isn’t.

I've given expert opinion saying (and also calculate mortality rate see true, like Ashish Jha did). given two words, repeatedly. Quite Besides you’re arguing yourself.

How so? I'm arguing vaccines slow spread *very substantially* extremely effective preventing death. R0 delta ~6, need 84% population sterilizing immunity reduce R0 less 1. (Or could 100% population vaccinated 84% effective vaccine spread, anything between). probably possible, given waning immunity.

I arguing much matter. Breakthrough infections suck, probability one killing similar probability flu killing you.

Breakthrough infections big deal need permanently mask prevent them. 

And think owe willfully unvaccinated changes lifestyles protect them, even though wish ill them. Thanks. Yeah, really. Stop going hospital think it’s going make worse. Build regional respiratory centers separate normal hospitals  Statistically children enduring greater risk every time enter vehicle main concern getting maimed covid.

The risk near zero really bad among younger people.

And reddit always goes boomers problem. Part reason glad state pandemic. Pretty much local health departments running vaccine booster clinics (along pharmacies). even started clinics children week, though many school districts themselves. get worried see people found helpful early pandemic start go rails things.

This really brings cost-benefit NPI microscope. deaths hospitalizations pretty much table, much done done previously, flu? new standard public health interventions communicable disease? happened before: understanding public spitting outlawed tuberculosis. cutting board, now?  people dont behave think perfectly reasonable hospital discharge drop churches local GOP headquarters feel get help support need. Great question. previously quoted 0.05% chance he'd complications caught COVID.

Which sounds like anti-vaxx, brainwashing lie.

The reality ""mild"" case COVID getting knocked ass fever 102-104 week, spending next month+ weird after-effects. must admit, CDC literature horrible job relaying reality; symptoms list ""bad flu"" symptoms likely breeds part bosses' lie. relay gravity one-third one-half people get COVID - worst damn, ass-kicking, ""flu"" ever life. 

And moderate/severe much worse.

At least now, he's huge proponent vaccine. whole family getting vaccinated soon; even got flu vaccine first time. COVID knocked anti-vaxx him. boys got morning. wanted go school home playing. symptoms. gargle test canada. Weird guys south still stuck long qtip. don’t give schools?!? Ok, social science parent comment. actual research whether adjustments improve public confidence reduce it. I'm taking everyone 12, sure, many kids would affected long term killed, know what? three, three children none I'm willing risk maiming people avoid annoyed inconvenienced. risk/benefit analysis firmly supports annoyed better dead maimed. People always use ""mask indefinitely"" argument absolutely one talking masking indefinitely. Even Dr. Fauci predicts world mostly back normal Spring 2022. Masking rest school year reasonable. kids phased masks least. Adults ones acting like children tiny piece cloth. got back booster 30 minutes ago. question asked arm wanted shot lol point many damn STUPID zero understanding works, fail understand vaccine cover variants even vaccine does. idiots pushing vaccine already getting date instead pushing keep updating vaccine cover NEW variants , actually bothered read actually UNDERSTAND, said need get NEW vaccines diminishing effectiveness vaccine newer strains. current vaccine pushing may totally worthless next year, need work vaccines NEW strains

hospitals issues cheap supplies staff, Matsu regional 20 patients per nurse covid refused hire staff, built brand new hospital lovely offices lobby gas fireplace beautiful carpet, see many fail see problem carpet hospital.

so many fail understanding. two dose?

And interval extended shots get available 4 year olds ?

I know asking broad question best place get answer felt flu shot lot covid shot. nurse administered flu shot said bigger dose (or could needle?). exact details said something along lines flu 0.5 vs. covid 0.3. 

I also questioned got shot got first dose. kids (6 &amp; 11) received first dose yesterday! 11yo said one best days life. He’s two birthdays without party, haven’t done normal outings like museums eating out, generally restricted things kid would normally outside Pandemic. next big step getting family normal. Hold moment. parent groups Facebook antivax? always lagging behind events. long ago, strongly opposed using booster vaccinations Europe. may way break latest wave. realize already many covid restrictions put place vaccine mandates, masking much more. Almost every industry type COVID regulations, idk talking zero regulations. realize COVID restrictions impacted almost every area normal individuals life right? Even car regulations people still die time car accidents ban cars? guess since wanna ban cars really care people dying. Keep using cars number people dying traffic accidents also increase.

I wonder argument also fly head. Let's see. know Russian government corrupt mishandled whole covid crisis, bullshit happens Eastern Europe. People take seriously game system however can. Earlier week apprehended politician selling green certificates I've heard lot people bragging bought certificates, instead of, know, taking free vaccine. complete shitshow. 

Downvote want, often people deserve government, much different people power.  you, I'd relax definition normal, ready disappointment :)

There new, highly infectious disease exist 2 years ago ... unreasonable expect life \*exactly\* like 2019, especially given huge social change.

For example, surprise masks medical settings stay forever (we probably anyway). yet that's much better covid. That's I'm saying. hate masks too, too, wear glasses, lunch problem often chew gum, simple fix. point problems much less bad covid. that, people could sucked beginning worn damn masks gotten vaccine soon could, probably problem still sure badly now. God! obvious?  I’m sure Pillow money rolling make it. EU orders 2 billion doses Biontech/Pfizer Covid vaccines. Since considered safest point, reason use Moderna 30s latter higher incidence myocarditis among young people. guess would even make sense keep Moderna elderly may better immune response Moderna higher concentration active component. I’ll doubt get downvoted ground wouldn’t let 6 year old get shot. I’v double shot Pfizer isn’t something Im ready let kid have. understand cars driving one highly regulated areas life? Every aspect driving law regulation around it. 

Very poor comparison highly contagious disease many places zero regulations around it.

I get don’t care people die long term disability. We’re still about
250,000 million deaths US according official numbers. Keep get easily.  Well really kinda 74% adult population overweight obese. not, skinniest 26% adults.  virus also mutate worse strands spreads, cause severe long term problems even symptoms initially seem mild.  There's talk they're going approve without asking VRBPAC weigh in. abnormal; minor modifications routinely done without convening outside advisory panel. since 90%+ people eligible one way another anyway, lots people ignoring guidelines anyway, much minor modification. According Nation Geographic (selected arbitrarily google results):

*When worldwide spread disease brought control a*  
*localized area, it’s longer pandemic epidemic, according to*  
*the WHO. COVID-19 persists globally judges be*  
*“expected normal levels,” organization re-designate the* 
 *disease “endemic.”*

So, assuming true, Pandemic still ongoing. fullest extent point here. making claims. guess don’t care avoidable death disability might correct choice inhumane.

I care avoidable death disability. Thats want ban cars roads find another safer way transportation. hope get point making decisions looking avoidable death/injury thing factor making policy decisions. bunch hidden costs measures think get talked enough.   Haha! figured loophole! not…. I’m fully vaccinated support everyone get vaccines fact vaccinated people also spread covid, thats still living restrictions (and they’re getting stricter) soon Iceland almost everyone vaccinated. 5 year old got first one yesterday. requested thigh since there’s meat bone there. Went perfectly! far today leg little sore. little, mean slowing bit.  Think many grandmas saved precious plastic though. also linked infertility issues. (That's covid, ironically)  Christ mansplain vaccine works? fucks sake weak…

And point comment; abundance deaths, lack supplies ill STILL RELEVANT. 

No fuck variants, fuck original vaccine effective Delta, hell point? saying original vaccines trash appears you’re still alive, millions lessor disease based solely vaccine you’re shitting on. technique employed last test terrible, self-administered nobody yell at. 

Tests definitely comfortable least brief. kids got first shots weekend side effects got booster today far none either. (also none first time) Probably upset lost many big money endorsement deals. chances Germany going lockdown . went vaccine bus town saw several people young children getting vaccines.      seen much DC, cases deaths super-low; doing?  does, is. Well, teaching nursing, specifically. regularly see followers, increasingly conspiracy-minded, thinking/assuming he's medical doctor. teared little littles got last night! still don’t get it. December 2020 worse November 2020 US worldwide, wasn’t it? US chart Google looks like ~November 25 (late November) worse November 10 earlier?

I’d love hear good news don’t think I’m pessimistic here, I’m seeing data showing early November 2020 nationwide peak. Maybe nation isn’t US? maybe it’s data besides cases deaths? seem recall analysis determined small percentage unvaccinated (I want say 10%) motivated ability remove mask. number vaccinations increased approved kids. Yeah, notice said ""a lot states."" Cold weather least 7 9.  Nothing 100% risk-free, vaccinated/boosted, risk tiny. I'd worry go. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* always react vaccines, I’m outlier, lol. get flu shot yearly kicks butt day. (Body aches, fever, fatigue.) It’s like milder shorter version 2nd 3rd Pfizer doses did.

My husband got first flu shot *ever* year, felt nothing. |: kids quarantine getting possible. imagine nurses go small town hospital. work big retailer town see hear atrocious behavior there; picture folks act get sick. Precisely. Making decision reason way overstepping intended bounds authority. That’s administrations job decide.

Though honesty that’s ongoing problem pandemic, elevating physicians researchers technical experts field implementing policy way outside expertise.  like impressive? capacity administer millions shots per day week. guess comments sounds like still hard get appointment places, mass vax sites like back getting really high daily totals, still feels low. WTF wrong nonbelievers? 

Carl Sagan provides good saddest lessons history this: we’ve bamboozled long enough, tend reject evidence bamboozle. We’re longer interested finding truth. bamboozle captured us. It’s simply painful acknowledge, even ourselves, we’ve taken.

These people staked health Covid-19 ""fake"". quite literally dying either:

1. Admit wrong may literally die due stupidity
2. Go deeper conspiracy rabbit hole. turn 5. think doctorate nursing, bit misleading. time I'd like make map overlay states average temperature specific month case levels. It'd interesting see there's general tipping point triggers wave. 

As in: ""feels like"" temp X degrees higher, degrees lower, wave trigger, temp two numbers stability/declining cases. there's much confusion can/should get it.

I'm missing point all, I'm simply saying morning zero confusion. easy. people want confused are. Mine signed Monday...cant wait! kid getting Friday school weekend recover. Hopefully it'll nothingburger, want risk missing school. bet vax numbers go lot weekend.  vaccines miracle shield also say worthless either, caught original strain covid,,, local hospital non vaccinated person 2 covid strains time. 

few people understand vaccine works. works strains made tricks immune system thinking caught immune system makes antibodies fight virus vaccine limited results NEW strains NEW flu shots every year, covid vaccine less effectiveness new strains covid, give little time newer strains vaccine little effectiveness, need continue work make NEW vaccines new strains yet happening, mindlessly pushing original vaccine ZERO thought diminishing effectiveness newer strains.

India oxygen fault hospitals keeping necessary equipment... Hell hospital spokane properly maintain oxygen generation equipment broke big trailer liquid oxygen oxygen generation trailer filling parking lot ER, lets say pure oxygen around internal combustion engines really bad idiots spokane drive matter time till someone runs one trailers. 7 y/o got Friday. stopped pharmacy got booster flu vaccine way 5 -12 vaccine clinic show done! side effects, forgotten time got parking lot. got Sunday morning still eating toast. Sunday night mom made chili good coming back up...I got also chills sweats. slept lot Monday gave kids day ( homeschool). lost Halloween candy pounds tho 😂. got ear infection period last 2 weeks hell. inherently, no. wouldn’t say dishonest face value either. better know I’m coming from: I’m vaccinated believe vast majority people vaccinated. proven mostly safe also effective. 

I might misinterpreted main point wrote response though. originally read complete total faith integrity Pfizer. 

I suspect every major drug company instances illegal unethical things. also suspect every one drug maybe* something suspicious happened, probably many dozens, hundreds, others fine. 10 year old got last Saturday. issues! 4 year old 5 next month she’ll probably get birthday. 😊 Daft question could vaccine change way body responds viruses like cold?

Currently suffering something feels like nothing I've before. PCR test negative one point symptoms exactly like bad response astra zenca vaccine times. 

Could vaccine change immune response viruses feel normally would? Moderna recipient

I feel that. booster much much better, still laid around day mild headache 2 days. 

Glad kiddo vaccinated! really missing point. person replying said easy get booster. problem public perception ease eligibility. put simply, hypothetically, one vaccine dose left, whether went healthy child sick adult inside outside country, I’d choose child. think factors you’re really acknowledging. also don’t think said egotistical; maybe bit selfish. Again, thoughts it. Pokemen people? mean vast majority people vaccines keep safe Covid reduced cold?

Or mean immunocompromised people safely take additional precautions needed unique risk profile?

You care people, still realistic precautions necessary actual situation we're in. idea 100% population need undertake extreme precautions order keep small minority safe fallacy. population highly vaccinated (for instance, entire NE United States), constitutes necessary precaution changes, focuses individual collective. 

Using hyperbole shame people unrealistic unnecessary standards helpful, alienates people know better. parents - thank you. 

Seriously. personally hesitation vaccinate myself, totally understand parent wary taking children. 

So again, thank you. Thank trusting science, medicine, people worked provide us. Thank taking yet another step towards getting us mess. Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

Signed,

A tired healthcare worker (clinical research coordinator urgent care) still seen scam think Covid fake worse plot put chemicals/ microchips people think aspect. work utilities wondering they've sidestepped issue long...  Agreed. Normal masks anywhere. even hospitals medical settings. Normal travel abroad without needing get COVID test enter I'm going return US. Normal pro sports team half roster due asymptomatic positive cases. 

Hell, would add normal vaccination mandates enter business thing. I'm okay sticking around longer changes, even want showing vax card eat restaurant 2025. two got Saturday. older one side effects, younger one still dealing stomach issues. 

The kids stepping lot adults failed. ashamed themselves.  5 year slightly sore arm that's first shot. 10 yr old son 6 yr old twin daughters got shots weekend. None felt discomfort actual shot none symptoms. Another 5 weeks family 7 fully vaccinated! Covid shots kids also 2 doses? bullies know classmates vaccinated? What's reason recommending AstraZenica lower risk clots? understand correctly, much overlap highest risk post-vaccine myocarditis highest risk post-vaccine TTP/clots/whatever they're calling them. people wonder want live CA insane rents. Colorado totally list places flee to. longer. Fuck man. can't people follow science. 5 7yo get Saturday. sure tough schedule appointment. Everyone know young kids able get quickly. Yes, last week city implement mandate. vocal holdouts fully vested retirement plan would difficult replace. response likely would ""Fine I'm retired, first I'll take 18 months vacation time I've banked up."" Yes. FDA approved 2 weeks ago, CDC gave final auth last week. never lockdowns countries had, would absolutely consider forcing restaurants businesses close limit capacity form lockdown. favor last year, absolutely support restrictions. 70% (MA). We’re 5th country vaccination rates. exact thing 5yo. That's awesome. town's starting school vaccination sites tomorrow -- far I've heard coordination w/ county health dept, they're allocating shots school based clinics first. Registration limited kids go particular school, extra spots opening days event.

I think opening school site helps underserved families (since families means figure way get one way another), I'm glad took approach.  many examples places dropping restrictions like masks case numbers hit threshold, immediately see another 'spike'.

I appreciate restrictions early onerous businesses, largely gone now. things place like mask mandates, seem pretty minor let's try remove late, rather soon? got flu shot week Pfizer booster September.

I'd rather thousand COVID boosters one flu shot. Holy shit, arm never hurt much shot before. lasted days, fucking hell. worst arm soreness shot life. course vaccines work, Eric Topol believes well.  
But many people would like see daily COVID deaths US drop beneath 1250. cases going encouraging. 

Also, New York stats really great tracking immunity wanes time... new people get vaccinated, less ""waning"" going apparent statistics.  
Studies tracked chance breakthrough infection based time vaccination pretty consistent finding waning. 

Boosters going save literally millions lives.. reason downplay benefit. 5 year old got first Covid shot yesterday. reaction yesterday, reported today arm sore. 

That's it! handled like champ. I'm glad finally available him. 9 yo problem getting one Saturday evening. Overwhelming relief start build form protection since school absolutely nothing mitigate risk. state 70% vaccinated. Cases creeping 52% new cases last week people fully vaccinated. frustrating part people acting likes it’s head winter months. Thank God. NY fell COVID know I'd handle it. issue comes everyone told make extreme changes lives (as article says, strict possible) vast majority vaccinated people really danger.

... specific subset ""everyone"" care people. police police unions cannot use COVID excuse funding, equipment, less oversight.   Local mask mandates despite living state absolutely nothing stop spread. peep local leaders thresholds required lifted. Thanks adding darkness existing darkness. That’s going good we’ll ever get anywhere.  50 astonished 'united front' filled liars, search new jobs. give vaccin group People bigger chance dying give group People chance dying small. sounds egotistical me. 7 year old got yesterday great! symptoms! Sore shoulders thing reported kids. That's fucking fascinating. wonder well ratio excess reported deaths works, proxy full shit government right now. wait. highly unlikely new type booster anytime soon considering ongoing larger trials variant specific boosters time (as far know). remember reading trials Delta specific boosters earlier shown Delta specific booster really efficient regular booster scraped it. 


And hospitalization everything. Long covid real based (limited) experience happened often younger adults (fully vaccinated) vs older ones. kids part number!!! got vaccine Saturday didn’t side effects beyond sore arm. seven year old panic attack getting shot sat got like champ. Poor kid cried tears joy thanked pharmacist profusely. 9 year olds son got 1st shot last Friday. Husband started showing symptoms Sunday night tested positive Monday (**obviously connection vaccine, cannot cause real covid infection**). timing could worse.

We getting son tested today (Wednesday), worried! chance vaccine providing protection yet? speeding another week two least. Kinda expected definitely logistics challenges local providers faced. They're already phase 2/3 trials kids 2-5. mean going soon tired pandemic want family. wait ya know? big many 5 year-olds already. honestly shared! relief halfway.  Yeah live small town ~~~ state I'd surprised even half kids school get vaccinated. Maybe 1/4 they'll probably made fun others. even Covid outbreak school last year parents lost shit kids going miss week school. dont give shit.

-edit-

Reposting comment evidently can't say political 'color' state comment removed bot. fucking joke. mass death livestock, globally, would worst case scenario, far.

Worst case livestock would serve intermediary host new variant means rapidly spreading across livestock human populations. Fantastic! I’m feeling much better daughters shot now. Thanks sharing! Glad hear! Sounds like kiddos tolerating shot like flu shot. eases anxiety significantly. asking consistent sensible message WHO, keep walking. good part.  agree. doctor recommended early booster due immunocompromised state (plus additional comorbidities). Good know! Thanks sharing ❤️ went CVS pharmacy tech started interrogating getting booster. pointed CVS form specifically said actually specify that. pharmacy tech started getting pushy it, told go ask pharmacist. 

I got booster five minutes later. seven eleven year children got Saturday. side effects sore arm. look areas highest numbers ones lowest vaccination rate. course confounding factors numbers necessarily showing causalities rather correlations. Whoohoo!! family set!
It’s day booster arm barely sore. Hopefully means immune system isn’t even phased virus bats like it’s nothing 🤞  14 minutes? affect smaller cats Waiting 6 months actually best practice maximum protection.  great job clipping comments. include hit DELTA strain (Which vaccine less effective against) also say % died vaccine small. part problem spread lies omission altered context comments putting small part change appearance said That's actually expected, clinical trial found frequency side effects halved compared adults. surprised hear half kids getting away symptoms all. Report State pharmacy board. completely inappropriate  Hell yeah! That’s amazing! state in?! wish mine together Oregon vaccine distribution feels reactive. argue pharmacist

You complain. Immediately. totally unacceptable contrary dispensing guidelines Exactly. proved cliched theory ""there's money finding cure"". evil, profitable. (It's business, old cliché goes) meta analysis put month two ago looking comorbidities COVID-19 deaths global scale. main takeaway, overweight want significantly improve odds survival. US majority overweight third country obese. nauseous night Pfizer booster. Glad didn’t last longer that! Yes. 90% county high transmission area. Covid stay yes kids part statistic! got first dose Monday minimal effects, ages 8 11. south east state trying #1 COVID biggest sigh relief! wish form like that. cases CDC/FDA recommends getting vaccinated forms discourage boosters. example, situations family members immunocomprimised people told get vaccinated protect family member. clearly within intent CDC/FDA one options. 

""recommended get booster medical doctor"" form. 6 year old got yesterday, err, maybe day before.

Waiting available CVS whatever lie get 4 year old vaccinated. big enough weight wise. Mine got yesterday! got board games snacks got stay home day. side-effects saw, except sore arm, course, even feel that!

The nurses local health department seemed bit surprised seeing him. again, live rather ""conservative"" area, lot people *especially* masking vaccinating kids.

No masks required school anything (we opt wear regardless), I'm glad kid extra protection since holidays coming up, feeling cases spike schools.

Just want kids safe, all. load whinging. nature. doesn’t give shit tired economy destroyed. it’s thing. adapt it. won’t adapt us.  many 1700 unvaccinated?

If vaccinated, lifeboat. Let others stay freezing water. mean minority people wont get vaxxed? Cause majority paying attention. research posting ignorance? they're calling murder stop treating patients. think gonna hurt say think I'm gonna hurt leave?  researchers doctors think study? Fauci also said back normal Summer 2021. fall 2021. Spring 2022. ""mask off"" dates keep getting punted back. Fauci credibility people talking masking indefinitely. Well, opposed little bit different across Europe compared US. 

As anti-""boomer"" mentality, Bill Maher good segment last week. often disagree completely good point many young people act like everything bad going fault ""boomers"" right everything better. 

In terms actual lifestyle, true big sources problem hard young people affect generations them, hands government (or big companies right thing own) easy change drastically numerous reasons. Young people also turn vote much lower percents elections. may argue, ""it's rotten, bother"" alternative push change besides commenting online? Example: admit wrong simply accuse people trying help secretly vast conspiracy murder you? 6 year old got first dose 0 side effects! Im excited second dose son turn 5 month! I'll 2 year old worry about. logic, masks never come off. come cases go low, go cases go high. lot closer assumptions jumped to, yes.

Strangely, bit hard distinguish response someone wants permanent People like exactly vaccinated family for!!!

Of course *we* want Covid (again), nice side note we're helping community too. Keep kids safe. shot around corner! think certain...parties realized keeping mask mandates covid restrictions matter...are threatening slim majority. multidrug treatment protocol includes ivermectin. study Kory, Marik, et al. makes simple math errors resulted incorrect conclusions.

In reality, mortality much, much, lower patients get drugs received one drug whole 4-drug cocktail. site, says **We currently updating estimates due issue backend infrastructure. hope resolve next weeks.** 1. Get sick.


2. condition gets bad decide go hospital help.


3. Blame hospital making sick??????   I’m sure. Almost everything I’ve read r/covid19 points equal slightly better infection immunity - even variability: agree anti vax probably hop another argument, it’s best implement poor policy give legitimate argument Manhattan best half sign saying good amount time even workers adhere it. Full mask mandates   think confused myocarditis risk. One study showed risk vaccine 16-19 year olds 15 100,000 .02%. risk kids 16 getting myocarditis covid seems .13%

Also, almost known side effects vaccines appear first 6 months. restricted, talked multiple people actively decided get booster trust FDA/CDC tell actually appropriate get one. ""local rules determine things go depends rules are.""

And missing point. governmental localities CANNOT retire fully People losing pensions happen fuck bad enough.

That's irrelevant people question getting fired, rather quitting deadline comes effect. New York require vaccines. Dude cognitive dissonance projection hilariously insane . Honestly can’t wait till study psychological condition . “Politics dictated facts” Covid vaccine 99% effective preventing severe Covid . States lowest vaccine adherence highest hospitalization death rates . absolute facts . Also vaccine administered 200 million Americans , side effects. Honestly denying good thing ? solution pandemic , that’s amazing what’s problem ? great, stay fuck home die care Depending states prioritizing vaccine distribution school districts fastest way get shots kids. know live (Maine) said focusing doses types clinics vs pediatrician offices. people care many protections possible. Plenty people dont want get sick vaccinated wear masks general avoidance close proximity. done? Physically force people dont want vaccine get it? civil war many die million corona victims. Hurdur throw football good shoot good basketball 

Genius things too.

Also many yes men cause money.  I'd go ahead get booster you. underlying condition would make ""not good"" catch Covid are, infact, eligible right without lie (*unless mean less six months, case, yeah, wait couple weeks get thee boosted). There's shortage doses might schedule appointment week two advance rush get kids vaccinated. boosted, yeah, follow common sense guidelines, wear best mask get ahold plane, skip trip feel unwell exposed, otherwise go see family! point risk minimal make it. Things really different year ago, vaccines N95s that. Life's short wait another year fear long mitigate risk. people going hospital?! don’t believe science, definitely shouldn’t going place scientists work… still missing point. I'm going find proof something I'm trying prove.

How possibly take neutral statement like ""local rules determine things go depends rules are."" mean anything else?

People losing pensions happen fuck bad enough. That's everywhere. people get away murder still get paid out. How? I’m using title anyone else’s title validate claims. I’m using data collected statistical analysis presented public.

Oh ran Covid ICU year means know what’s good behalf entire country lol. Get real. Policy dictated facts. emotions little annoyed overwhelming influx patients year.

You know pandemic worried about. obesity rates America. blaming awful year ICU. fault good chunk Americans fat lazy preventable conditions.

Also, wouldn’t doubt good chunk patients hypochondriacs thought going turn flesh eating zombie getting infected. mind powerful thing. kid sore arm needed leave school pain. okay. vaccine drives advertising kids providers first. open public. issue critical staffing shortage.  said Dept Health drives, major hospital due reason. nurse presentation kids school said thing, presentation. Sigh. Biological existence history terrifying pandemics survival fittest. LIES, tis flesh wound…

ya, boggles mind! 75%. That's depressing though assume percent skews higher towards older people. know I'm smarter guy. least field. PhD it. lol ya go thinking logic matters fools. 

lol no...they supposed listen CDC FDA.  can't even guys.  wonder actual physician telling staff. won’t downvote not? want kids life go back normal kids vaccinated quicker happen. Heck haven’t even stepped foot kids school she’s first grade. also wear mask eat lunch desk silence. It’s ridiculous! got 6 year vaccinated today went fine. true infection produces comparable/better protection vaccine. immune responses inconsistent unpredictable. Many mild infection don’t sustained antibody response. infected likely reinfected months - means likely transmit.  


No doesn’t drive anti- vax sentiment. Anti- vax leaders throw everything wall see sticks. this, would different excuse. Still much lower excess deaths per capita Russia. Russia 0.6% population dead this... words, heartbreaking. Excess deaths India seem par Poland rest Eastern Europe - 0.3% 0.4%. VARSS reports low side effects - headache fatigue. December 8th youngest considered fully vaccinated. Although catch covid earlier year, I’m told he’s likely got pretty high immunity combined first shot. still getting second shot 24th though. Can’t wait younger kids get it! 2 6 year old us vaccinated Christmas 2 year old. Hoping get beginning next year🤞 kids home take care cruelty you? Seems like maybe think ahead I've got 5 8 year old got couple days ago! 8 year old sore arm that's it! get daughters Walgreens(got today). pediatrician said wouldn’t January! plan ready? difference be? 6 year old got 2 hours ago!!! fully vaccinated Christmas happy!  Yeah, called sons pediatrician 3rd asking could start scheduling appts didn’t know. 

I got states website appt kiddo 4th. school set clinic next week pediatricians office still making apps yet. You’d think would least timeline place. That's feel. Every time go friends, I've got worry catch bring home elderly parents high risk? We're boosted, brain fucked can't even enjoy going out. know say can't wait go back normal, think us mentally, even pandemic. No.

Respiratory diseases follow extremely predictable patterns, namely always worse winter.

Everyone modicum knowledge tried warn people last year. look happened.  Community spread... OP part community. fewer people community spread respiratory virus, better everyone -- especially cannot vaccinated. 

Also COVID always cakewalk even mild cases, re-boosting immune system reduce chance getting symptomatic case definitely something people interested in. look it. know this. think it’s somewhat strange backlash “anti expert” movement US least. people gone extreme decided anyone PhD MD name automatically qualified everything. 

PhD’s MD’s technical experts field, policy experts, perfectly fine push back advice, long good faith. Hey, welcome back. [even Scroll national picture see big, wild swing cases, hospitalizations deaths barely budged, especially relative prior outbreaks.

Welcome end pandemic. here, made it. Congratulations. exactly children.  depends rules city state.

You’re also free listen choose something else believe in. watched interview Note handful different influenza vaccine manufacturers US, formulas may vary. 

I got Fluarix (GSK) weeks back even sore arm. Zero reaction all.

Yep, profits people work nursing home county Covid numbers staff test twice week. think fair protocol vaccinated unvaccinated. Vaccinated test week test unvaccinated 3-4 times week. Holidays encourage people gather play part, too. virus seasonality. But, seasonality drives behaviors. Temperatures one end push people inside together.  Yes, government always fund research government usually buy treatment.

And know effective going be. I'm sure big placebo group was, figuring roughly half (about 600), looks like medication prevented 35 hospitalizations (7 hospitalizations vs 42 control group). 

So 600 x $700 = $420,000 prevent 35 hospitalizations. That's cost $12,000 per hospitalization prevented, $700. even though hospitalizations $12,000, government paying every single hospitalization. Many yes (via Medicare) all.

I'm saying bad ineffective drug anything like that. curious government agrees pay whatever pharmaceutical company tells pay, without pushback based already given government. federal government upper hand here. else going contracting millions doses? government always plays fast loose taxpayer money, exactly surprise. kind great deal.  lol backstop them? Pharma owns government    tl;dr: study claimed 6.1% mortality rate. hospital notes 1) bad math means 10.5%, 2) study measured mortality rate MATH+ patients counting died study ended, undercounted mortality.

Guess one see of? second Moderna shot knocked butt. could barely leave bed day. booster last week side effect slightly sore arm. got want enjoy socializing holidays less risk. made cotton mask sleeve slip disposable inside it. worried disposable mask thin I'm glad hear better.   I've heard, basically walk say want booster, one questions it. fine; there's shortage. don’t understand didn’t recommend boosters adults 6 months. expect soon. try interpret were, always knew STDs, stop changing name things got jabs community health personal wellbeing. waited offer table sex money. Exactly. convincing fine, wasn’t.  risk hospitalization 15% JJ 9% pfizer moderna, case breakthrough infection. Arent numbers close pre-vaccination risk hospitalization? country gave JJ 40 years old, group risk hospitalization already low. Im young, healthy Im happy JJ help lower chances serious covid, thinking boosters rn. No. don’t need anything except vaccination card id (at least that’s asked got mine). care it’s least 6 months second shot. No. check box saying qualify. one checks. 

Also, likely opening boosters adults soon wouldn’t worry picking one.

They check it’s 6 months though. think Drosten works alone presents findings. assumption false. Drosten talks whole team researched.

People good preventive things. nobody knows prevent. would love politics would listen take action. necessarily lockdown, atleast vaccination mandate. something similar. know.

Even people die, ignorants blame everything else go back victim mindset. time alive. Midwest also colder Southeast. People spend time indoors autumn. point evidence pretty firm transmission outdoors rather low. wave comes going hit colder places harder human behavior. elaborate that? lie about? Never heard get thier shot  (60%) adults say they’ve heard government exaggerating number COVID-19 deaths counting deaths due factors either believe true (38%) aren’t sure true false (22%).

I think list. There's enough ambiguity statement possible connect reasonable concern. certain jurisdictions, UK, anyone dies within set time frame COVID diagnosis likely recorded COVID death overworked hospital doctors review stack medical notes deaths decide cause death. medical professionals suggested lead counting entirely possible component negative excess mortality observed countries relates this.

This different paranoid fantasy government faking pLaNdEmIc something people may heard attach non-zero probability without fallen misinformation. probably insane mishandling whole thing

we bullshit 2 years, vaccines available almost year, STILL cannot decide proper recommendation it, way give idiot Antivaxxers ammo quid pro quo finest. Take jab give jab. question state go get booster, u slip doctor saying what?  Math add up.  proud country long time... /s teacher see children struggling. heart breaking. Please please vaccinate children able. Vaccinate protect them. Make sure wear mask. child suffer like this. Regular LPT: get booster, Nearly 75% people age 20 overweight, according CDC. people high-risk jobs medical conditions added in, epidemiologists estimate least 89% vaccinated adults sufficiently past original vaccinations qualify boosters. 

Also noteworthy, enforcement seems self attestation many places, typical?  disagree. many people US getting boosters FDA CDC restricted them, decision clearly influenced (see two people voted FDA wrote article boosters bad). restriction minimal almost anyone get boosters, massive affect public perception, far fewer people getting boosters would otherwise.

Boosters contribute herd immunity, affect intuitive exponential math behind contagious disease. Even tiny 4% decrease spread easily cut resulting cases, hospitalizations, deaths quarter. such, boosters definitely potential prevent hospitals flooded. kids get afternoon. thrilled part statistic! 🎉 Strange remove 3 weeks vaccination approval elementary aged kids. 

My kids school removed mask mandate outside recess 2 months back seemed appropriate based low outdoor transmission. Fake twisted news. schools dropped it, cited low case counts school. shit 2 hours later got daily covid update 12 students faculty got 24 hours that. June FDA decided wanted least 4-6 months follow data younger age groups, instead 2 months like teens adults. first delay. 

Then late July early August FDA asked Pfizer Moderna expand pediatric trials include kids. second delay. 

Recently Pfizer CEO said needed “efficacy data”; need kids trials get Covid show vaccines prevent cases even severe illness. that’s another delay. 

Personally, factual basis this, it’s opinion; think FDA wants prioritize evaluating anti-viral drugs first, come back younger kids. think we’re put “back burner”. small number individuals originating false claims. instance, claim vaccines contain undeclared, allegedly malicious ingredients, could pretty strong case those.  yeah honor based. fully qualify questions, verify answers thing 10 year old. unfamiliar Fox News numerous people, usually Right, spreading misinformation? heard thousands ignorant people spout nonsense got ""experts"" medical health field training? seen anti-vaxxers physically harassing vaccinated people folks wearing masks? also american, area anything beyond vaccination. worked well us. Sorry seems frustrating you. really ridiculous part chain work probably even check requirements. got booster, clicked box making appointment never got single follow-up question. would disagree vaccines miraculous shield contend startlingly short memory. vaccines off-ramp frankly Delta variant vaccine protection…do remember nightmare India’s plight earlier year? 24/7 burning bodies, oxygen couldn’t breath? imagine Cleveland LA. masking deer then? xd Sure, sure. Let's call hesitant. Helps goal post moving. arguing. curious. FDA approval (which mirrors CDC guidance)? Doesn’t followed? precautions here, while. cases along hospitalizations. deaths still low end. vaccination relatively high. masking ~30 % people. mostly immunocompromised people feel ill. Hmm. FDA/CDC screwed one up, think it. purpose boosters here?

To prevent serious disease? limited eligibility. eligibility broad.

To prevent infection spread? recommend everyone get booster shot.

Instead kind weird hybrid situation. states decide eligibility get even confusion. ""Morally repugnant"". Huh. find lack social consciousness amongst anti-COVID vaxxers much repugnant. disgusting downright filthy. 

I'd love know religious stance. basis give? religion follow? woefully uninformed extent free speech. limits. unconstitutional people required vaccinated go school employment. established early 20th century.   Fuck, I'll another booster. mean like others definition anti vax? There’s goal post moved person vaccine requirements hesitant one saying anything hesitant doesn’t make anti vax nice try though assume fact public health crisis something it, want say anything without knowing sure. say conditions make one possibly eligible, definitely? Whether it’s right wrong people maintain freedom choose put bodies. you’re vaccinated issues. 'not overweight' make 'super skinny'. makes normal weight. That's one problems make issue. many people overweight leading health problems.  Yeah 12-17 available, age 5-11 discussion december IIRC (with much lower dose) Poor baby. don’t want people get booster cause work. Actually vaccines that's essentially US government done.

We know Spain reporting it. read headline thought, great! They're right.

Then read 80% 1 shot, hopes dashed. 

1 shot gives *some* immunity, way guarantees die need hospitalization. happens **2** shots. 

The announcement given early. folks assume there's need complete series, right back soup again. Ugh. Damn guys, calm down. tell OP made mistake 100 times. Looking Georgia governor sued cities mask mandates.  Maybe doctors research writing them.   booked 5yo appt. fed going anywhere, seeing friends. US arrogant. long outbreaks happen Europe see ones US. stupid rhetorical trick fucking racists use move goal post. ridiculous strategy man children use feel oh clever. problem dates keep changing. June/July/August/September, telling us 2-4 group would ""weeks"" 5-11 group.

Now changes hearing 2-6 months.

And time, attempt publicly justify delay (without even acknowledging delay, way) saying 0-4 group ""least affected,"" without providing qualifier explanation ""least affected"" statement demonstrably false least metrics hospitalization death.

Feels like basically lying us try lull us upset 2-4 group delayed apparently several months explanation delay.

To clear 100% support FDA CDC. I'm increasingly frustrated lack information, changed timelines without explanation, and--now--statements appear contradicted data. Yeah everyone quick declare victory COVID. 

I guess things may improve vaccine arrives children. Correct wrong, vaccine 12-18 already yeah? False!! get 30EUR voucher, happens ticket cost show part house. Sex cost more(as always 😁) Well one thing could least wait kids get shots + 2 weeks full vaccine efficacy. Lol bit rich coming , message true.  Get jab clap day. additional interest phenomenon?

Blow-jab  want get passed flu season first, NHS short staffed best times. simply way afford many workers quit covid flu season. It’s funny Aaron blamed staff doctors “miss information”. I’m sure staff doctors relay information him. one get three shots once? (and whole family) get every year minimal side-effects. need 30 minutes Got set Friday. excited. two got theirs. Nevermind, turns I'm wrong that. got super-sick it, made news, die. Cases problem everyone vaccinated. Everyone isnt live becoming sick. Sry hospital staff see way around that. idiots mask experiments worst time. Many parts country rising cases winter, masks mask. would recommended CDC at-home tests (BinaxNow) ... hit name jackpot, huh? 😉 

I hope big push boosters coming. Feels like chance get now. Pretty much. drove 1.5 hours town Podunk pharmacy low vaccination area taking walk-ins. Everything around required appointments booked. didn’t ask insurance, ID, birth certificate. filled 1 form, fudged year birthdate needle went arm felt biggest sense relief I’ve known nearly 2 years. frustrating turned moral panic. clear masking indoor public spaces massive benefits negligible downsides (all hand-wringing effects social development never really got backed data). despite people pushing stop soon possible. They're really restricted though. say work ""high risk"" job whatever checkbox want check form really. NYC things completely normal. time need wear masks subway. Bars packed since June, need vaccinated. Otherwise rules. ain't changing. Well - parents Rite-Aid appointment. work manufacturing legitimate underlying health conditions. pharmacist turned away showed 65. Told already got 2 shots (Pfizer) need another one, I'm giving you. 

We suspect anti-vax. knows. reported Rite-Aid nothing came it. 

My parents drove another pharmacy got boosters day. let know, turn people away apparently. Taking L winnable game, one. NFC North weak division, first round bye much contention may well decided one extra win. usually get injection site soreness later day, side effects. That’s great. haven’t seen vaccine bus city underserved areas. sarcasm wife walked local Safeway pharmacy vax cards days ago said we'd like booster. questions asked, gave us shots. Got flu shot there.  
With first round vaccines felt ethical line misrepresenting eligibility vaccines scarce months, lots at-risk unvaccinated people. there's vax shortage now, at-risk unvaccinated people, and, least area (MD), lines people waiting shot. (We ones went.) see problem lame excuses - none - getting booster. sooner they're vaccinated, less likely Covid spread. see able put past end year. good starter lion, IMO. masks nearly much vaccines. Presumably less people wearing masks, way vaccinated. FINALLY, parents world realized kids assholes, gotta shit.

/s Damn one asked kids handle global pandemic. Oh yeah, forgot- private insurance either :) current Biden administration plan - yes, state governments listen? Definitely not. Illinois walked got one. stamped vax card   Skydiver: managed slow descent, take parachute now, right? Valid. Doesn’t mean people held accountable be.

I don’t know numbers lives lost ruined Purdue lying.

Just take note, govt hold us accountable, companies hold us accountable, comes massive crime… can’t done.

Well vote get rules do. disagree. anything shows medical agencies take vaccine safety etc seriously even approval continue monitor adverse effects. Truth science always evolving nothing ever 100% set done. PA up, MD appears starting small again.

Schools indoors whole time hard buy Indoor gatherings driving spread. kids getting seriously sick, matter test positive? high school kids often younger siblings? Look, get it. high risk setting would use even vaccinated. come on, thing it’s never going anywhere, need ramp agreeing though? Like, people vaccinated covid dangerous them... that's vaccines work fast mutating viruses. I've kids get vaccinated, covid's danger goes dramatically yeah, that's point. approved vaccines 5-11. two months so, mask mandates large go away. Everyone school age chance get vaccinated. Things getting way complicated rely doctor knowing it. changes medical knowledge amount drugs treatments exploded last years. That’s switched model stay date current research products. Colorado half national average deaths, fully indoor weather now. surge time last year too, months country.

The question cases rising here, states huge numbers delta deaths. Nasal Vaccines seem way better limiting Virusspread entry point Covid respiratory tracts. vaccine inhaled part body make much better prevention intramuscular ones currently have. article days ago talking that. Nice, 6 year old next Wednesday. 

I symptoms took Thursday case. anything makes feel confident comes vaccine safety. shows medical agencies around world etc continuing watch rare adverse effects take appropriate action. like approve bother monitoring vaccines anymore. mean every medication/vaccine etc rare side effects always show trials. Nothing ever 100% safe whether benefits outweigh risks. You’re unlikely become infected w covid given vaccine status, get covid, yes, spread covid. look symptoms test needed. Covid always us must learn manage risk without completely isolating ourselves.  11 yo daughter getting first today. kids frickin vaccinated? No, hear say? gotdamn soon. difficult complicated people. Sure, left individual responsibility decide whether risk going doctor worth risk dying without going doctor. doctors pharma companies want patients, they'll find way get patients trust them. doctors used hang degrees outside offices decades ago. days might register neutral third party, like database could purchase subscription. (Or even something like Yelp... cost end-user anything.)

Remember, I'm supporting anyone's right lie. pharma companies lie label, doctors claim X percent success rate operation real rate less X, indeed punished. Let information flow, trust customer use appropriately. that's problem. Man, 5G coverage going roof. Here's example comment one nut bar anti government posted reports horrific stuff people got vax fucking died. vax takes years develop go trails. CDC final report vax showed skipped many things done testing. way.

Conveniently, found OP's comment history last week. based state health director saying weren’t needed.

I wish people would make decisions based what's beneficial rather what's absolutely needed. Thank service helping us we're sick. least do. :) son got Friday last week. sore arm too! I'm happy. gotta keep baby safe now. We're less scared son going school. Since cases getting high thought would sign booster. Seems like everything booked two weeks. Getting March 2021 flashbacks refreshing CVS website.. 

Kind annoying also kind reassuring we'll shitty next 2-4 weeks less clear again. quote me, heard 4 weeks behind 5-11 2 kids - 11 &amp; 6. got shots Monday. Sore arms Monday &amp; Tuesday. Tired went bed early Monday. Otherwise issues. wonder much actually happens. Vaccination [picked Delta started spreading also coincided re-imposing mask mandates vaccinated people. 
Like common talking point, I'm sure much difference really makes. Bro, yeah. real. Many parents can't stand kids. want clarify think way smarter pediatrician! also recommended praying would help daughters anxiety... hind sight maybe time change. SIL doctor state actually taking pandemic seriously 100% behind vaccinating kids I'm going follow lead! Thalidomide Seldane, list medications lethal side effects long. products pulled market. hope someone reads training add point: ""An mRNA vaccine type vaccine uses copy molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) produce immune response.""  believe skeleton key. tranquilizer non-sedative antihistamine developed lab.  copy mRNA spike protein coronavirus.  different medicines. However, hear adverse effects. Today worldwide $3.15B (with B) people fully vaccinated efficacy.  Lumping vaccines' success heap bad outcomes approved drugs past, personally, ""what-about-ism.""  Woohoo getting vaccinated!

Covid usually severe kids, top 10 causes death kids 2020 (it #10). aside, long term affects covid concern - would hate miss opportunity protect kids something like that. I'm happy another layer protection beyond masks now. 10 year old appointment tomorrow afternoon.

Kids hardest control close contact people huge transmission vector. Hopefully curb spread significantly even large proportion refusing get it.  point, must ask, fuck Covid-19 really? dunno. experts recommend boosters everyone, doctors political positions circumvented recommendation essentially making everyone ""high risk."" even given that, I'm still high risk category, still qualify.

The biggest issue consensus among experts boosters. probably hurt, much help? evidence says minimally. full 100% payout retirement plan, put retirement time. Point city state can't. actual real medical reason exception. problem. understanding, though, people planet get it. frankly, anyone called religious reason getting vaxed sit thier basements care.

Given number nut bar anti vaxers making much noise, becomes difficult take anyone real reason seriously. must really hate people making hard you. Fortunately U.S. generous nation, [we've already donated 200 million doses committed hundreds millions more. time. school mandated year far cases. officially dropping Christmas break..the rule beginning get dropped 60 days vaccines become available K-6. Personally I'm ok think reasonable. Fair enough. think we're agreement. facts Chantix spoken cannot denied. COVID vaccines. Free speech cover lies something easily demonstrated false. Free speech make objective reality real. vaccines work advertised, one lowest rates serious side effects, pfizer particular almost zero deaths attributed one serious side effect (endocarditis) prevented aerating needle. 

Making shit something way demonstrably false libel free speech. That’s exactly mine 😂 Real doctors chiropractors?

As shown Peru world worst death rate.

I live ontario half California outdoor masking infrequent required.  stop putting stuff comment said.

COVID-19 vaccine providers cannot turn away individual self-attests eligibility additional dose booster dose. Failure individual “show proof” eligibility may reason provider administer additional booster dose.*""  
So I'm guessing lot places even bothering ask proof, since can't deny failure show any. even argue point? feel bad time kids traumatic perpetuating trauma them. get angry forefront policy decisions says things like ""while failed parenting jobs one supposed time"" must say seems confusing. 

Also describing policy choices like this: ""You repeat “Kids resilient” million times justify policy choices throwing bus, magical incantation makes sentence endlessly true"" seems miss point older people mortal danger kids time. Cui bono? clear masking indoor public spaces massive benefits negligible downsides (all hand-wringing effects social development never really got backed data).

Pretending masks negligible downsides one biggest reasons we're divided masks. 

I wear mask day hate it. kids wear masks day school hate it. yesterday daughter asked throw masks fire covid over.

You wear mask also acknowledge fun.

Also reason data social development would unethical conduct study. would rather get vaccinated get another COVID test. Worst pain I've since falling gravel road mountain 15 metres wearing shorts t. soon stick went nose eyes started crying instantly fucking wiggles around. tasted blood snot mouth hours headache whole day. here! woke chipper ever next day! high school kids, see point. Adults generally wear work restaurants, force 16 year old so. They've plenty opportunity get vaccine, haven't, likely won't. require high schoolers mask forever? 

With elementary school, think masking another months warranted, that, masks come off. chance get vaccinated, yet point, going to. want kid six years wearing mask inside outside school protect children think need protection.

In opinion, end masking, everyone age group chance get vaccinated. time passed high school pass soon elementary school. agree call misinformation actually little research.

the deaths right vaccination STILL investigation, true numbers known yet. claim 100 deaths worldwide guilty misinformation comment spreading lie, people die ASPRIN reactions per year worldwide. look saying calling someone else out. 8 year old got Friday. Got shot leg bit sore next day. second shot lined two weeks later second shot lands right birthday. Best feeling right there. people stay home unless quite sick. People go sniffles time. would bizarre nothing mildly runny nose.  corporations hard AF determine actual culpability without mass arrests. Like, sit look law approximately 80-90% people live society done something deserve prison time. small things big things everyone prison guards?

Link: welcome.  think booster soon would good idea.  it’s not. It’s crazy people *who fully vaccinated good health* still staying indoors walking around masks on. fuck’s sake see people walking around outside alone mask on. It’s comical. spread among vaccinated people vaccinated people getting booster stop spread? really know much Ivermectin thing really care, challenged paragraph:
You can’t proven correct didn’t evidence. guessing, following non-expert advice, gambling.

This shown smarter, knowledgeable, right promote it. Whoopsy doodle kids elementary school mask mandate start year. 3 weeks ago removed it.

As week brought back due outbreak among students staff threatened force back online learning. Instead giving boosters general population sending shots poorer countries people completely unvaccinated. That’s variants keep originating that’s likely spot potentially vaccine resistant variant pop up, ever does. Unless you’re high risk weak immune system don’t need booster protect others. Great! women get 30 minutes gentleman choice too?   *Again  way kansas flu pandemic ended, hits point manageqble longer causing disruptions Healthcare strain let alone mass deaths. matter available all, need population actually actively fight it'll keep mutating spreading. theory passed around years. Anyone suggest that. People also responsibility either believe not. free thinkers.  case fatality ratio hospitalization rates amongst children actually highest 0-4 age group;

I know I've seen source comment can't find now. happen one? way 9% breakthrough infections mRNA vaccines end hospitalized , study pretty questionable bullshit 2 years, vaccines available almost year, STILL cannot decide proper recommendation it, way give idiot Antivaxxers ammo

Because vaccines developed serious time crunch, conduct years-long clinical trial. That's also recommended dosing interval short, made sense context getting ready general distribution. Imagine still phase III trials right now? think anger misguided, kinds things noticed without extended trials. Plus like anti-vaxxers needed literally anything justify position, they'll make shit like magnetism thing.  He's talking people deliberately spreading misinformation. vaccine available several months millions people around world taken it. extremely safe. know you, I'm sick pandemic tired coddling malicious people ignorant folks follow them. late mother struggled depression anxiety life, often read fine print I’m Physician’s Desk Reference come excuse use drug caused [fill blank] .1% non placebo group. don’t think precisely applies, people agenda always find reason reject medication. loss trust science unrelated reality science.  bad actors, many hate US want see Americans divided.  

Guys like Rogan say “I’ve done research” businessmen journalists trained scientists. make money lose money based say. Rogan sided world’s scientific community would cost lot money. would never knowingly lose money.  lot Aaron Rodgers said Rogan.  It’s Rogan hack. Hack means he’s game.  He’s qualified comment science qualified comment speaking Cantonese. Neither us speaks thinks language.  OFC, Rogan lifts weights studies supplements qualify talk medicine. also Chinese friend.  pandemic over? Vaccines widely available, even children, want?  Unfortunately we're facing consequences actions. gone winter much higher immunization rates. might able ride inevitable storm come fall winter. we're deep spring. someone could warned us. Oh, remember, epidemiologists virologists did. Months ago describing happening right now. probably stick medicine cause law skills weak Boss: ""You're required thing.""


Employees: ""*angry noises*""


Boss's eyebrow: "" ^ ""

Employees: ""Okay"" laugh shrug since everyone vaccinated whatever kind spread ended delta variant there's little reason believe happen again.   parents emphatically say mandate clear intentions. obviously make assumption based word five year old lol Jesus Christ dude. I've gotten lot covid tests. sucked first months technology better wiggle tip nose. pain nothing goes quarter inch. know you. Go someplace else need another one. experience typical. I'm sorry you. Cough, headache, fever, loss taste &amp; smell. little 6 months shot #2.  tickets Lion King (purchased ago, naively thinking kids' vaccine would available then) last week daughter myself. added rules either get tested fully vaccinated. dreaded finding testing facility gentler test (you always know going in), daughter said she'd rather wait go another time.

Got full refund, least. live NYC, going later time hard. Oh that's odd. live Manhattan signs nearly every store saying ""no mask service""  missing ""last year"" part. used isolated everyone around would tell they're wrong. days find crazy people online there's mass media dedicated enabling craziness (and making more) Social science thing. want people get vaccinated react certain ways depending factors including messaging, want apply science area well. science!   secondhand anger you. bozo's credentials puts CDC, FDA, WHO, Johns Hopkins, etc?? medical community Texas overwhelmingly vax-positive, think trouble! Mine sore arm required new toy chicken nuggets. numerous bandaids reason. think mean ""Dr"" John. Reasonable, like covid symptoms pretty variable.  says need medical background understand anything vaccines natural immunity.

Careful guy. Sounds like making “claim authority” fallacy. don’t need expert field understand something works. I’ve read research papers, consulted media, use personal experience discuss. legitimate sources. random Facebook source. 7 11 here. symptoms sore arm. got shot Monday afternoon. morning....the sore arms gone.

I can't wait get second dose! 

On side note, really comforting seeing amount people getting kids vaccinated. Gottleib new interviews, mention couple things social media.

He said get spread rate COVID back one US, going take combination getting many new people vaccinated done, although point out, we're hit 81% one shot, there's many people left group. also, he'd put emphasis getting boosters people got vaccinated last winter.

He also says challenges vaccine workplace mandates go courts easy answer issue. crisis demanded swift public health actions, measures came hardships consequences. need prepared careful keeping measures much longer, even want pretend exist, impacts tradeoffs come COVID decision.  people forget masks work? really care façade airports? nice impress travelers. Ah yes ...because spitting wonderful freedom... Yeah, bulgarian friend last time talked like nah dont need vaccine im young healthy. smh wish son old enough, we'll continue playing game life death. Twin 5 year olds got Dose #1 Monday. 🤘  Greater Boston, anti-vaxxers either speak parent groups drowned overwhelming majority. towns near vax rates eligible age groups. Even town live in, ""lower"" rates, least 70%, 90%, depending age group. 

I've hear ""mommy groups crazy ideas"", thing around here, major town parent groups. I'm sorry live area breed distrust misinformation. That's like forever. Let repeat said seem think I'm implying something else: depends rules city state.

It's irrelevant anyway. workers fully vested, that's measures work everywhere they've tried. Also, nobody irreplaceable, that's fact. article makes comparison did.

You don’t know difference R0 Rt already tells know talking about.

And argument believe vaccines don’t work. do. unvaccinated person gets sick, *way serious flu*. true vaccinated person breakthrough. it’s argument all, boggles mind don’t understand that. area busy boosters. went work scheduled appt line formed 10+ deep right got there. company also offering boosters.  like nice nurse says...get COVID flu shots. Let's survive Winter. come going anywhere visiting friends? point see point trying convince people. go grave repeating like religious believer. Poor kid. shot way bad. I'm sorry horrible test experience. I'm glad getting vaccine. Omg, exact us! 5yr old got shot Saturday hoping might sleep little bit Sunday. anything, energetic￼￼ afterwards. mamma mia Yes. see us learning that. Seeing ER physicians get interviewed CNN mass distribution vaccines cringe-worthy - pretty honest idea large scale logistics work. article nothing subject hand.

Our R0 already dropped 1.

You need stop comparisons flu. tying knots, it’s literally discredited argument made 20 months ago. Drop already. 5 10 yr old. got Sunday. like normal. You’re close. kids wear mask then. Emergency mandates emergencies disagree, early vaccination activity given folks strange idea faster-is-better. case, 5 6 months almost certainly better 2 months That’s absolutely horrifying.  ""news"" outlets feeding delusions 24 hours day. father watches Fox OAN day long. thinks coming TV set, he's manipulated. yet put seatbelts every time get car, wierd. front two doses, long after, etc. knows gets treat choosing (ice cream every time) get eat *at* pizza place hits 2 weeks post second shot.

He like them, knows ""it hurts, fast, stops hurting quickly. get ICCCCEEEEE CCCCRRREEEAAAMMM!"" sugar coat it. least after. Makes feel validation feelings. likes tests certainly. Fair enough. certainly see always easy get informed consent. Sometimes doctors make decisions behalf others, imagine regulation ensure power abused.

However, surely there's enormous gap minimal regulation today's system? get rid regulations interfere choice-and-consequence workflow functioning conscious adults, still help lot. dad got shot, died two weeks later.   really even ask why. 6 months second dose Part issue expert panel exceeded mandate reigned in. Vaccine diplomacy important we're asking physicians make determinations, especially context. (rightly) overruled. Yeah court ever rule contracts stipulations someone unvaccinated can’t go party outside work, there’s good chance contract gets tossed it’s unconscionable  son one them! symptoms told us 

""I stronger mommy daddy. move arm time.""

He remembered got ours, cant move arm 2 days. lol. apple handed free air pods jab would beating covid deniers anti vax wack jobs stick. would lines door next town. exactly I'm saying, read beginning comment .

""the vaccine miracle shield 100% even 90% protect prevent spreading virus"" already starting happen US reaction every year. Last year, hardly reaction. Usually feel tired days. year arm soreness ever before. 9 year old one first town get last week. scared bought legos afterwards took like champ. 

No side effects whatsoever. He’s autistic guts antivaxers. “x” pronounced two-consonant sequence (‘ks’), _looks_ like single consonant. is, course, writing system commonly uses two letters stand single sounds (‘sh’, ‘ch’, etc.) three-letter sequence stand sound (‘ugh’ ‘though’).  Mine appointment afternoon! People scream loudest angriest always numerous?!

Do people know this? 7 yo kid got first shot last Saturday. symptoms shot. think intelligent species. we? Like pointed out, corroborates point prescriptions increased, address consumption veterinary formulations all. prove ""why I'm wrong"" slightest. information great many news articles come past months, memes. also address actual prevalence use, talk lots people hospitalized it. Tractor Supply suddenly running ivermectin feels like lot stuff, mg/kg human consumption, pharmacy running out, nonscientific is. scientific article rate. point pandemic global epidemic. over, epidemic “over globally”, definition “over globally” (which probably define). Oh yeah, would've likely died last week vaxxed. health fairly dreadful is. is, covid small inconvenience rather life threatening. 

Although *still* pretty debilitating smell ash still here. hope improve vaccines future years. went clinic Saturday steady stream kids fussing. told people clinic fully booked day.  5 &amp; 10 year old kiddos got vaccinated Monday afternoon event organized school district, though learning home. Neither issue, even sore arm. It’s wild school able get done quickly medical system charge one kid’s “complex care” hasn’t even started scheduling doses, far know. 5 yr old nephew got Monday. said leg little sore, little tired day, he’s fine now. major side effects. Yup, know people work pharmacies hospitals tossing vaccines EVERY DAY. used try get many people inside store/hospital streets, goes straight hazard bin. know ethics murky first world countries hogging vaccines, supply chain going fixed people letting boosters go waste US. Yup, mine hate anticipation getting shot done they're like ""oh.""  think you’d better waiting kid gets little older. two even complain sore arm afterwards. Mine symptoms. 2 youngest got yesterday, felt fine till bedtime, woke feeling great. oldest, 13, side effects 2 shots either. Lucky kids. 2nd shot laid good 12 hours. scary fast people want go back norm bad willingly ignore reality. soon hear ""mandates lifted"" think 'Good, I'm longer *required* wear mask. finally passing"". Instead maintaining practice, drop mask soon feel socially acceptable so.

I live place that's harder touched covid, still comes back around people get laxed. far over. Sadly people still put dates expect end.. ""Covid ends 2022!"" ass... body pain mild fever 5 yr old. stayed home couple days. one sore arm. much YMMV. breakthrough cases skewed old and/or immunocompromized could right. Remdesivir saved life.

Incredibly lucky Remdesivir consistent treatment. daughter got last Sunday. week, school district vaccination clinic booked ten minutes. expanded hours, added another day, got doses, still endless demand. Nearly entire first grade class shots already. I’m really surprised heartened turnout.

Also, single kid I’ve heard side effects besides soreness injection site. 3-time Moderna recipient, I’m jealous. pandemic differ country. countries take serious others, pushing vaccinations, pushing masks, promoting healthy lifestyle(like washing hands) etc… 

Even something simple 2 week lockdowns things get hand greatly help. It’ll always fight reduce spread. Infections come viruses best reducing spread us. J&amp;J two doses start. tried single-dose shot unfortunately failed. Booster pretty rough wife day after. Completely fine afterwards check, agreed. vice versa pharmacist make errors judgement well. WAIT miss?

The vaccine got approved 5-11s USA already? Meanwhile, almost half class five one plans get theirs. I'm state thats 80%+ vaxxed.

I want teach mask anymore, spend majority day begging kids put back on. freaking annoying, eighteenish months, I'm this. Funny say that, also live SV place I've ever heckled wearing mask convenience store Shaver Lake Fresno County. able schedule booster online easily morning. Anybody really wants able get it.  Mine mild fever day generally felt unwell. one side-effects all. Regardless, I’m glad got done. I’m looking forward telling there’s second dose :(     kids, 6, 11, 13. That's kids oldest nephew part number. cannot wait see fully immunized virus. 2 youngest got shots yesterday. relief feel, overwhelming. 5 weeks, little family much protection possible. 

Others screw around, I'll sleep well knowing we've done everything protect others. research? Read issue Science, Nature, Journal Immunology, several journals find studies that. Every study since delta variant shows infected people better immune response vaccination without. 

Infection-induced immunity vs. vaccine-induced immunity straw man. one suggests get infected virus protect virus. question people infected. answer every study, want best protect reinfection especially variant, get vaccinated. Georgian here. Gov. Kemp tool number reasons, mostly favor local public school systems making mask choices. Even sued Atlanta Mayor Bottoms later came agreement allowed City require masks public places ( mandate lifted Mayor week ). free spread lies facts relating public health condition. may criticized, may sanctioned, may sued, extreme cases cause harm may prosecuted. guess would say feel hopeless... masks natural people, going eventual pushback. know Canada terms vaccinating kids, assuming NY remaining restrictions lifted (masks schools, example) time 5-11's get vaccinated. last 72 hr. mayor-elect governor addressed this, said want lift school mask mandates take good sign. Also parents didn’t necessarily want kids first ones door, problem second door. fall category everything buying new tech, going new restaurants.

I don’t want first, 1 million served issues, don’t need wait 6 months either.

Time schedule appointment. u.s 50% vaxxed say u.s. whole wont pay attention. Nothing Fox News.

I doubt anyone surprised. Everyone vaccinated Vermont? Looks like lot people vaccinated Vermont, certainly everyone.  don’t really understand headline. went event, traveled, around bunch people. got covid like cold, vaccinated (which great!). guess agree 10 day quarantine stuff seems outdated seems fairly positive? Luckily 50 percent population vaxxed ""flooding"" means 50% original pandemic easily managed comparitively. misleading fear mongering. 9 year old got ✅. symptom sore arm. 4 year old get it🧐    5 year old niece got proud her! Ugh, yes you’re probably correct. Someone make stop. time Xmas (and maybe Thanksgiving) NYC assume? pretty ballenced approach covid. case many metro regions. DC example. older kids got it, 12 got last week. One kids arm pain lethargy second shot lasted day, that's it. wife also recently got boosters wife issues kind tired day nothing bad. Oh no. level objectification reserved women only, lucky we...  Topol nobody? almost single-handedly took Vioxx. Heads large research institute Scripps. need pandemic.  ideal world, would enough everyone. don’t think means U.S. neglect citizens order prioritize others. opinion. think end January time frame makes sense Daughter got last night. kept home school today case felt poorly. hour early running around house. even sore arm! thankful whole house fully vaccinated!! ignoring part expert panel gave numbers back stance? CDC experts saying, per data, prevent one hospitalization, would need give boosters to:

 * 8,738 people 18-29
 * 3,361 people 30-49
 * 2,051 people 50 64
 * 481 people 65 older

And Pfizer, Moderna's numbers better. abundantly clear recommended 1 age group. 

I'm waiting. expect new booster beginning 2022 specifically targets variants, want required wait got regular booster. Yeah, though might surge holidays people realize it'd good kids get least one shot go Grandma's. bet weekend too. scheduled shots Fridays since got sick mine. Canada law passed earlier year name ""Medical assistance dying"", think generally called ""Right die"" legislature What, like none them?

I'd like see evidence, please  speaking benefit hindsight. April 2020 little clue dynamics virus. OP eligible booster he/she likely need one taking really help anyone.  Probably emoji They'd start go fund totally socialism distilled social media site anything... kid's school set vaccination clinic gym offered every single student appointment. kids get tomorrow morning. keep telling kid. got second shot almost questioned actually gave feel thing...  noticed this, too? Strange! wonder *what* could difference? Plus see vaccinations slow around holidays US flooded vaccines. shortage here. countries, yes, dose u/Corduroy_Bear uses would donated someone need another country, might well use help vulnerable folks life community. doctor shouldn’t/wouldn’t write it’s patients best interest.

While true ideal world, simply always true. Doctors susceptible dumb shit political reasons anyone else. doc lose license advertising Facebook would write vaccine exemption letter anyone messaged $50. polarizing phenomenon even among neutral objective. 

I'm pharmacist, said remains true. Pharmacists check prescribers medical errors exist, among reasons. always discretion, license line, fill fill medication.  Jesus lol. scam. Kids even need vaccines. Ahh ol' jib jab I’ve seen friend group nieces nephews they’ve mild none side effects compared adults six year old! wonder lot anti vax crew US would quiet pay everything own. Ok. run Pfizer. financial interest. think criminal spread antivax propaganda. 

How you? Still gross? usually get mild flu-like symptoms \~12 hours, usually less. I've also actual flu, diagnosed doctor, year lazy get flu shot. actually thought going die coughing hard breathe. scary. I've gotten shot every year since then, want stay far away Covid possible. Wasn’t declared pandemic first place? doubt individual countries get decide over. asked ago peoples' status traveling holidays (specifically around Christmas time) wanted recheck people. end buying plane tickets see parents next month, option refund something happened. certainly feels like things slowly getting better, least states. feeling correct? still feel really anxious flying, due reasons COVID (severe fear flying, health concerns exacerbated flying) ""normal"" times I'd absolutely make flight.

I've hearing friends making trips see family, due international, I'd staying domestic US. feel comfortable flying next month, current state things? I'd going coast coast.

For additional context, parents brother vaxxed + boosted (all eligible). I'm eligible couple weeks got booster, would clear 2 weeks traveling let set in. However, 4 us risks would good got COVID (not directly ""pre-existing"" conditions, example mother clotting disorder careful risk getting it) JFC YES EVERYONE PATIENCE GOLDFISH'S MEMORY

5-11S STARTED GETTING SHOTS WEEK AGO That's true matter - Pfizer vendors covered cases. question part government handles it. 686 people? I'm deeply skeptical. Same, side effects. kid upset get shot even realize told him. Completely agree. vaccins probably go countries people vaccins instead kids get rarely sick. vaccines, infinite liability protection. always Lol...thanks hyperbole. 

First, 'tolerating' masks, whether **necessary** based actual risk profile (not hyperbolic generalized fear). 

The risk factors demographic profiles susceptible breakthrough infections well known point. relatively young healthy, risk dying breakthrough infection low. Low enough overwhelming majority people nothing worry about. 

If immunocompromised elderly, yes take precautions protect yourself. issue comes *everyone* told make extreme changes lives (as article says, strict possible) vast majority vaccinated people really danger.

Perspective important here, banging fear drum over, starts ring hollow. That’s reason boosters though. don’t long term efficacy data, know lot vaccines need three (or even more) doses lasting immunity. we’re seeing waning immunity 6 months, even efficacy preventing severe cases still sufficiently high, don’t know long stay high. Getting boosters proactive step need build lasting immunity we’re back square 1 3-6 months. 

The reason wasn’t easy decision they’re balancing benefit first world countries taking shots away third world countries (or least optics). really needs vaccine passport allows vaccinated people dining/drinking situations. dishonest statement - way suggesting COVID vaccines scientifically proven?  Friday yo!"
