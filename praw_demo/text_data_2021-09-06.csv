0,2021-09-06,"  Thanks, always forget remember 100 lakh. UK! Show us it’s done!

Big oof sons 13 &amp; 15 got vaccines day approved 12+, feeling like crap day after, issues. like India. Delta spreads quickly, result number uninfected people infect also diminishes rapidly

You want issue retraction?  People keep saying 1918 flu worse, conveniently forget oxygen masks vaccines exist back then. Right majority hospitalized patients recover relatively well. Rewind 100 years realize probably 60-70% people end hospital would dead, instead 20-30%. 

Infrastructure drastically worse well, would taken significantly longer find treatments actually worked. Many, people get oxygen today, would end either dead heavy brain damage back then. 

I know covid would drastically worse, bare minimum essentially equivalent. I'm curious -- significantly lower efficacy rate par Pfizer? wouldn’t sweat concrete vivid data. People like Eric Topol, Scott Gottlieb, Ashish Jha etc basically saying “let’s keep eye it, nothing worry time”.

For it’s worth, author article college kid Fordham U typically sports reporting, may meaningless paragraphs like closing:

“The U.S. saw peak mu variant cases mid-July case numbers involving variant declining since, signaling either weakening strain indicating worrisome future.”  investigated found wrongdoing. catch covid tho? 

That’s thing. Delta variant causing lot problems teens, 20’s 30’s. even children. It’s lot worse variant previous ones.

Edit: also, you’re catching “seasonal flu” every year, chances you’re getting cold. flu knock bedridden least day two, without medication. don’t need resident. don’t see digital record another state. However CVS see got shots CVS branches, shots elsewhere youre good go. CVS, Walgreens chain vaccines _there one_ bright side, anyone looking cadavers free parasites gonna hit mother lode. Proper masks easily found US lot people willfully ignorant matter. used wear cloth masks weren’t, wear proper ones (I work person take public transit).  unvaccinated don’t factor efficacy vaccine.

i thought used calculations. say 100 vaccinated 100 unvaccinated, 10 unvaxxed catch covid 1 vaxxed efficacy 9x (90% ish) better right? 14 unvaxxed catch covid 1 vaxxed efficacy would 13x (93% so). misunderstanding?  Even among unvaccinated covid kills less one percent infected (the higher risk older are).

""It kill us all"" touch reality. Mu existed since January 2021 outcompeted delta every single time. article even mentions prevalence declined peaking mid-July delta started really take I've searching study compares Unvaccinated vs Vaccinated Death %s AGE GROUP. lot fo studies vaccines give protection vs severe (deadly) covid cases, can't find anything grouped age. anyone know this? People seen defending saying year, nurses/doctors/staff handle influx. would rather restrictions/learn live it. Testing positive 21 days long covid That's actually great question, Sinovac's vaccine might actually effective Delta.

Brazil also relatively well it. know wahr that’s actually awesome idea honest! It’s big nothingburger. Vaccines work it. Probably along lines beta gamma. Reduced still quite significant, that’s t-cells. Boosters make work even better. 

It can’t compete delta. 

Should keep eye? Sure. far, concerning variant.  12 kids actual person schools now. Also, people get vaccinated get vaccinated. vaccine significantly lessens chance catch it, catch it, lessens likelihood spreading it. basically, mask up. autoimmune disorder (neurosarcoidosis &amp; pulmonary sarcoidosis), meds take (methotrexate &amp; prednisone) make immunocompromised. Therefore primary doctor recommended ASAP, thus 3rd booster shot Friday 9/3 work. Still recovering - body aches arms hurting though got injection left arm.

Hit really bad Saturday night Sunday early afternoon - 14 hours *ugh* feeling better now. Bummer, knew year ago rural hospitals vulnerable pandemic reached areas. Solution always masks transition vaccines, Texas decided neither. matter what, mainstream media source needs ingested understanding pieces created ground using fear anger supports. facts usually along opinions masquerading facts omit data would keep angry afraid. understand that, consume mainstream media. not, better ignoring it. happier and, paradoxically, probably better informed. Remind 3 months got series shots months ago thanks (outside) squirrel friend little sh*t. (Yes we’re still friends lol). weren’t bad, whole lot pokes surrounding bite, one arm leg. 3 next several weeks. Kinda sad took like 9 months get kind data. time know much 3 shot series prevent long-covid rare breakthroughs, might call 2-shot series ""fully vaccinated"" anymore. much priority: 3rd doses prevent infection effectively enough hopefully there's going many breakthrough cases. think bit both. supposed really talk politics plays huge role. One side says safe side says, well that's want us do, aren't.  Yeah. asymptomatic doubled vaxxed tested. Close contacts aren’t either. need symptoms get tested here. 

The unvaccinated don’t factor efficacy vaccine. super sucks restaurant business affected business depends unmasked faces sitting close proximity, would everyone do? elect government look good people (not debate anyone thinks they're that) make decisions matter decide, group people unhappy. really believe gov't force businesses remote restaurants take-out forever? Everyone wants get back normal life ASAP, long virus spreading make concessions. Again, chill.  I’m waiting news wacko holding hospital ‘John Q’ style day now.  90 though. Hell yeah. even events *as still happening* never mind longer period time. worry them. Getting booster available would great, probably higher chance dying car accident way streak dinner dying catching COVID steak dinner. vaccinated, trying live life now. knows many years left (hopefully another 20!), enjoy can. want bit safer, might bad idea wear mask crowded areas.

Your dad's health conditions actually concern COVID risks. Correction: 66% moderate-severe covid, symptomatic covid There's elderly immune compromised people vaxed might end iCU comorbidities    “Don’t go outside” realistic mitigation strategy people. Get vaccinated wear mask indoors crowded public spaces numbers subside bit reasonable. must really common since one case presented symposium. Mu recognized immunity vaccine previous strains past infection, “outcompeting” might issue. Hopefully that’s case. can't write everyone off.

That general-purpose argument doesn’t apply here. I’m merely pointing bottleneck vaccines masks nothing better science.

People aren’t taking horse dewormer COVID instead getting vaccinated studies better. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Hey good luck you, hit 80% everyone 12 years old vaccinated, got rid masks restrictions. 

Then like month later back. 

80% won’t enough done covid. Sorry say. don’t know # actually is, it’s 80% 12 years old. 80% ok delta it’s enough now. Really sucks. 

I’m sorry burst bubble you’ve looking forward forever watching #s go super excited get there. 

I know was. really feels like Mu clickbait scary thing anything especially since article says cases going since July. Fast forward Finland restricting kinds shit covid rates spiking 3... 2... 1... let's try way then. lot stuff cover let's try break ELI5. Coronaviruses known immune evasion. resequence code translating viruses. coronaviruses flu, even vaccine RNA based. testing people getting vaccinated haste bad move. alone create mutants. shot billion, people get vaccinated, likely happen. RNA vaccines amazing technology. coronaviruses diseases great cause adapt quickly new variants pop up. also carries risk. significantly lowered tested people inoculating them. don't. Understandable, already hard enough vaccinate people like without adding steps it.  


For rest, also question vaccinating people midst pandemic. chances virus (or vaccine matter) resequencing everywhere there, another risk. people vaccinated original covid strain, original covid strain die out, giving space less competitions new variants evade immunity created vaccine natural immunity gained covid infection. Best time mass vaccinate people pandemic obviously. Second best time afterwards. risky time middle it, like we're now, driven fear economic collapse. Wisest move would vaccinate people risk og covid strain. (the elderly, people chronic diseases, etc...) wait bit rest. Taking time letting nature thing.  


The vaccine alone give us herd immunity. need natural immunity well. also need treatments. well way giving great promises. Like one example : proper treatment could lower significantly risk long covid lot patients. could protect elderly, could ride pandemic slowly mix tools it. Waiting done mass vaccinate everyone.  


Obviously go way. risky. Immensely risky. create new mutants even worse delta variant. patient, we'd wait year two everything would come back order. That's scientists advocate accept pandemic wiser smarter measures taken governments. keep population panicking dividing everytime change rules society every 2 weeks. we're doing, betting everything vaccine mass vaccination strategy, take huge risk. 
Either soon, either backfire deep shit next ten years we'll again. Learning new variants, making new vaccine, etc...  


A virus living organism. part ecosystem. evolve them. evolve us. can't reproduct properly? find way so, that's driven do. That's viruses do. Replicate best can. said jurassic park, nature always finds way... it'll take advantage opening.  


Coronaviruses polio measles. can't wipe face earth like that. like flu behavior.  


If delta variant ""ThE PaNdEmIc UnVacCiNaTed"" like boldly claim without anything back up, explain what's happening Israel delta variant? 


I'm tired bickering. time work together get this. Physically, emotionally mentally. good health want get vaccinated? Good, chances dying small keep og strain alive, giving competition variants. risk? please take shot. want see die. good health want take shot cause scared, want go back concerts regular life? Perfectly understandable, please get tested do. complicated there's need bite other's faces matters. Could someone explain 

“The U.S. saw peak mu variant cases mid-July case numbers involving variant declining since, signaling either weakening strain indicating worrisome future.”

How decline worrisome given circulating? Aug 2020 relatively baby wave/spike compared Dec'20-Jan'21 Aug/Sept '21.

Not Midwest. Shocked. Shocked tell you. way prevent happening. dragging feet waiting needless data replication, multiple legitimate studies confirm data US

It's ""needless data"" CDC waiting on. worst thing give ineffective booster general population. effective one comes out, leave people got first booster? can't pop random vaccines like candy, especially comes changing immune system. Yeah can't both? Sure, time. Perhaps poor wording part. comparing major spikes chart posted looking data past 18 months, Aug 2020 relatively baby wave/spike compared Dec'20-Jan'21 Aug/Sept '21. met people? though. fair u still catch mask. ""The U.S. saw peak mu variant cases mid-July case numbers involving variant declining since, signaling either weakening strain indicating worrisome future.""

Why would indicative worrisome future declining? imply former?  Good news, vaccine worked! recommendations mask even outside?

Delta different original covid. Look Provincetown. logic giving people transmission fluid. Hey, anything else..., right? pharmacist could easily license revoked state board. Although, unlikely. angry parent sued audit showed pharmacist repeatedly breaking law, probably nothing would happen suspension remedial class Keep masks people great article wish kind thing widely published.

The risk population (age 65+) responsible 80-90% fatalities 75% vaccinated.

The low risk population (below age 40) responsible percent fatalities largely unvaccinated (especially kids).

When add together, end similar amount illness groups. high risk group susceptible vaccinated, low risk group less susceptible vaccinated.

So, seeing higher percentage younger healthier people sick entirely expected shows vaccine working. Rip Google ads next week Saw guy blue medical mask covered cloth mask. guess works. cloth mask probably helps medical mask fit better.  Actually, chiropractors harm good.

Thankfully, dengue death rate low. 80% cases asymptomatic. particular discussion doesn’t take degree virology, it’s basic concepts evolution. company dropped surprise vaxx mandate. think they’ve done lot stupid crap last 18 months, I’m damn proud them. It’s interesting see closeted anti-vaxxers twisting turning, since we’ve “no mask required fully vaccinated“ policy building last two months suddenly people walking around maskless pitching fit vaccine mandate.  Jeez people read article. Yes Mu resistant vaccines. CDC study 72 people [...]

That's *hilariously* small sample size virus [infected 220 million people 72 people 220 million infections means study looked 0.02% infected people.

Besides, studies show people antibodies infected - anywhere 98% 45% (against Delta variant)

Having *some* antibodies better *no* antibodies, easily mean difference death even needing go hospital first place.   Modeling read r/covid19 I'm hoping mask trend rules go away like wearing masks. One reason Ricketts shut dashboard case numbers dropped **because Nebraska counties fewer 20,000 resident**s, said publishing county-level COVID data could violate state federal health privacy laws.

It sounds like typical bs going today. Take rule, ignore contextual numbers make reasonable, apply totally unrelated situation. People generally deluded upset amateur level slight mind.

Well that's horrifying since called Dengue ""break bone fever."" won’t stop either. people already 3 times. vaccine provides better protection prior infection. many variants can’t rely natural immunity. effectiveness *any* infection, including asymptomatic infections, seems waned.

The effectiveness hospitalization death remains essentially same. Yeah basically, sucks pointing fear mongering people returning normal life causes get called covid denier. covid, thankfully I’m young healthy encourage people safe get vaxxed point life return.

(Of course, using capacity effectively would need great administration chains underdeveloped countries, also overhauling ancient regulatory system takes forever approve anything) Also Delta … **there data shows severe**, particularly kids.

Whoopsie. believe numbers believe anything. Try need clearer data specifically ending hospital even fully vaccinated! Honestly seems like letting rip best option vaccinated people healthy require emergency surgeries point. build immunity quicker (think studies saying covid infection stronger immunity vaccines), get point Covid like flu quicker. Since immunity appears wane time, flattening curve give us higher steady state covid infection. Vaccine herd immunity option, lockdowns option, let's let rip.  Lol realize talking natural selection intrahost phase.

The way spreads dictated natural selection. Intrahost virus already body. “These data indicate COVID-19 vaccines offer better protection natural immunity alone”

I’m going argue anymore. stop it. Stop part problem. thought outdoors fine without masks long staying distanced?

Thanks *worthless* monies. :) know few. cold (or maybe even less), couple fully asymptomatic, two hospitalized (but fat). getting though, that's frightening. Like Flu? Common Cold? dozen viruses deal annual basis?

And [here’s one study contradicts found within 30 seconds. haven’t seen you’re content spread misinformation without slightest amount fact checking. Anecdotal accounts heavily skewed towards bad anecdotes. wish people Plague realistic though. Even developing cure game-over scenario, since like half population would refuse poison horse dewormer  flu + flu shot cold though, still bad. kills tens thousands vaccinated people year US only. Look it’s really simple idea really need come mouth expert believe it, ya first interview question talks terms evolution natural selection. Well guys feel free believe whatever believe. I’ve already tried explain it.  think HIPPAHIPPO stuff complete garbage comes reporting virus cases. work floor 20 people, 4 could get sick, yet individual reach tell others 'hey, tested positive'? leaves 16 others wondering was, worked them, etc.. forcing get tested quarantining results in-hand, risk asymptomatic going life. 

No wonder problem US. one knows certain without getting tested quarantining regularly, whenever known 'outbreak' work, school, group setting. protects individuals privacy really makes 0 sense me. Monoclonal antibodies, cases. COVID novel disease, really many choices yet. ivermectin among them. We're still called lazy. 
I think administration understands stress teaching different group kids ever day due quarentine, trying catch ones came back quarentine, trying catch ones behind, talking louder bc masks point throats hurt, trying teach phonics mask, worrying student going die, worrying parent going send sick student school anyway, worrying we're going get sick take home one spread around classroom. 
That's lot little things daily basis.

And badly needs stop. Yeah, lot people hesitant think way. Frankly similar, getting vaccine, ""what if"" made realize anything still something still risk. comparing vaccine could cause vs virus could cause made realize getting vaccine actually lesser risk. side effects, example worst one, blood clots also caused covid. articles April 2020 talking people dying that. correct. shame article presenting information could make mind.

Here's case case review 14 said, studies typically find value IVM, huge value, studies FDA gold standard. im vaccinated. good luck echo chamber math right.

Two flips following potential outcomes

HH 
HT

TT 

Four different outcomes, three least one heads, 75%. three flips percentage changes 87.5%.


Essentially, way least one heads series flip tails. longer series, less chance get tails. chance approaches zero, never fully gets there, pointed out, events independent chance, however small, continue always flip tails.

To jump back covid, chance ""flipping tails"" instance 4999/5000 (the chance getting covid day). 365 days chance (4999/5000)^365= 92.95%. Subtract 100% determine chance catch covid year get ~7%. think real reason job preservation. people professional meeting attendants WFH exposed actually contributing anything. understand problem people stupid research proper dose animal dewormer animals   think unclear.

So, bunch antibodies blood great front line protection infection (where says “symptomatic disease.”) you’re loaded antibodies, they’re already kill virus even notice it. You’re unlikely symptoms. 

T cell B cell immunity one lasts long time, though. think like database immune system keeps things it’s fought before. sees again, pump bunch antibodies fight without getting *very* sick. since antibodies aren’t already there, might take long enough get sniffles first. you’d *symptomatic* disease, *severe* disease. think trying say there. 

Circulating antibodies decrease. everything. kept antibodies level right every infection vaccination, blood would antibody sludge. Memory immunity still great severe disease. unborn... Well Bobby, Americans different special, they're like people. They're Americans. yeah, special rules apply.

Israel declared victory covid vaccination uptake 60% removed NPIs. 6 months later, daily cases new hospitalizations shot way up.

Looking Israel situation, there're 3 school thoughts:

1. Vaccine-induced immunity (against infection disease) always wane we'll need booster every 6 months.
2. Vaccine-induced immunity (against infection) 2-dose regime long lasting time prime (1st dose) boost (2nd dose) must least 4 months, ideally 6 months. However, due urgency situation, middle dose (2nd) used provide immediate temporary immunity. effective boost (now 3rd *final* dose) must done 6 months middle (2nd) dose.
3. Vaccine-induced immunity (against infection) current 2-dose regime enough providing community high vaccine uptake (such Portual.) YOLO live once… hmm also think month cases high, I’m finally year uni taking gap year feeling year also washout well. Hope stay safe ✌️ remember days r/Coronavirus, new variant India media fearmongering, despite Indian redditors Indian physicians saying younger healthier people seem hospitalized ever before. Indeed mate. US donations aren’t source vaccines Uganda. Agreed. hoping though might figure cause able prescribe preventative measure eliminate greatly reduce risk. jailing decent part population

Maybe strict laws place. People would follow care fellow man/woman, want avoid personal punishment. Nobody expecting this. think post-pandemic, South's healthcare system gonna go downward spiral doctors nurses leave, hospitals can't attract enough healthcare workers, leading worse outcomes delta variant never popped up, would situation look like U.S.? would literally go live life even think covid. smart it’s something plan well. Early detection always gives best odds. two kinds people among ones refuse vaccinated. ones absolutely get vaccinated ones scared.

The later ones eventually convinced data later ones think can. started people got vaccine die within 3-6 months. 3 months passed increasing it, believe 2-5 years (and course 3-6 months, people would start dying nobody would vaccinate anymore). doubts ever convinced, constantly moving goalposts. completely ignored shitshow last 2 years millions dead people around world. really ought moving towards 4 day, 32 hour workweek given much productivity gone since “9 5” invented. example you’re calculating odds *next* flip heads tales, say 50/50 result independent previous result. odds never getting tails 1000 *consecutive* flips? Virtually 0.

The thing applies COVID risk. odds getting infected day 1/5000 odds getting infected every day 365 93%

There’s formula determine this: 

(1-p)^n

Where *p* probability getting infected (1/5000) *n* number days. English translation comes day congress struck second President's states emergency declared wave. That's ""don't work anymore"", longer sustainable.  Liberal politics always pro war. two main parties US liberal parties. job America paid sick leave. people cannot afford stay home sick even cold. people can't even get vaccinated state paid sick leave potential vaccine side effects people can't afford miss days work. give perspective article, Vietnam one strictest quarantine rules. someone household contracts/may gotten contact covid, entire NEIGHBORHOOD gets quarantined isolated. honor's system like us, government actually blocks every entrance area security guards every station. additionally, sort valid ""road pass"" (like work medical field example) valid reason road, theyre pretty strict what's considered ""a valid reason"" (someone got fined trying take cat vet since valid enough reason).

Delta Surge Means Good Global Growth Gets

 
The pandemic’s summer resurgence slowing global economic recovery delta variant dogs efforts rev factories, offices schools.

 
Instead entering final months 2021 confident acute phase pandemic over, it’s becoming clear booster shots may needed fading vaccines, workplace re-openings delayed border closures remain. 

 
Data past week captured worldwide weakening infections hit travel spending worsen supply bottlenecks dampening manufacturing trade. Surging gas prices also emerging threat. 

 
In U.S., hiring sharply slowed smallest increase seven months August airport check ins, hotel bookings dining reservations show softer demand. Germany’s key business sentiment gauge deteriorated China’s services sector crumbled August. global measure manufacturing slumped.

 
Activity gauges missed expectations major economies, according Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Citigroup Inc. warned recovery could moderate deepening divergence sectors regions.

 
“The spread delta variant slowing reopening process caused us mark growth globally,” said Robin Brooks, chief economist Institute International Finance Washington, referring revised 5.7% forecast year, 6.2%.

 
That stumble could complicate central banks’ plans pull away crisis support slowing asset purchases raising interest rates. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Aug. 28 warned ongoing slack labor market pandemic continues, Australia’s central bank week expected revisit whether delay taper plans amid worsening outbreak.

 
In Germany, Jens Weidmann, president Bundesbank, also cited risk setback Sept. 1 speech, China’s State Council, equivalent government cabinet, ordered extra support small businesses.

 
The severity slowdown largely depend science.

 
Economies high vaccination rates allowing policy makers resist another round shutdowns, opting instead targeted measures include vaccination requirements public places restaurants. Progress vaccinations means “in likelihood economic impact won’t severe” previous waves, Weidmann said.

 
Governments also greater room maneuver vaccines continue hold morbidity, mortality serious healthcare outcomes, according David Mackie, economist JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. London.

 
Emerging economies mostly struggling gain access jabs developed peers, however. vaccination rate 58% 39 economies defined “advanced” International Monetary Fund, compared 31% rest world -- leans heavily China’s massive vaccine rollout.

“In U.S. European countries, vaccination rates generally higher re-opening continues, growth resilient,” Henry said. “But economies could affected delta-related disruptions elsewhere, instance, factory closures Malaysia.”  
That two-speed recovery developing advanced economies likely deepen, according Alicia Garcia Herrero, chief economist Asia-Pacific Natixis.

Clearly $100 anyone still needs get shot fix Alberta right up. 🤯 fact people bite nails breakthrough cases go drive freeway weaving traffic 15 mph speed limit shows utterly bonkers people's risk assessment is.

I think psychology feeling like one risk ""under control"" (driving) another invisible risk wrecks ability properly make accurate risk judgements.

And oh boy lot dying hill. pathetic keep dying vaccine helps greatly reduce odds dying covid. Thousands conservative dying litteraly nothing refusing admit wrong. Heck, US even turned Trump told get vaccinated recently. That's deep stuck hole dug in.  groups do, so, point stands. Serious question: came horse dewormer stuff? many idiots trying get it? Trump recommend it? Yeah buddy lab assistant (at gene sequencing private company) although he's super hyped mRNA tech, brought one-and-done cancer vaccine pretty...unlikely. 

To help anxiety (M32), I've started schedule yearly bloodtest physical make sure catch anything early can. 4000 people year.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yep. Every poll see, bout ~30% always wrong side issue. incredible consistent ~30% is. One thing that's different coronaviruses influenza different genomes. RNA based, flu 8 separate segments, whereas coronavirus 1. enables flu swap segments flus mix match, greatly increasing chances advantageous mutations making way population. Coronavirus can't that, therefore mutation rate much much lower flu. 

At point, nearly everyone hit least one variant SARS-CoV2, many one. Add vaccines, eventually virus likely less virulent primed immune systems world-wide.  do. literally rule 2 sub. I'm sure problem scientists, think many people stupid. [Plenty say become mild. Sounds like making shit eh? *came* climate change. 
By accounts, well past time make significant change would seen meaningful impact. 
Talking climate change future event ignores already stuck it. 
The time act real meaning resolve late 1990s. Nice one. Thanks, corrected. incredibly unevenly distributed too. like random sampling adults given county going 3/4 vaccinated. 
I live Northeast city great vaccination rate. personally know adult vaccinated. Yet keep reading listening interviews anti-vaxx people South common statement seems ""None family, friends, coworkers vaccinated."" 
A bunch 75 Million remaining adults live big echo chambers. bunch echoes coughs dying people. He's right though. pulling responses ass. There's reason think get less severe. several billion people worldwide access vaccine. Pointing 75M US get shortsighted. coz stupid think really lost people. telling someone covid like heart attacks, strokes car accidents.  hospital capacity things could handled can't be. looked like think that. also, last resort, shop around boutique doc cost anywhere 2-3 hundred dollars. get results quickly it’s cheap. travel couple weeks ago. Tested noon. Got results 9pm. Good luck you. welcome post once/if causal link established, subheader article even states: ""authorities said causal link identified."" reason, post removed. seem case: obviously decent enough fast acting enough immune response fight quickly could become symptomatic.

Another theory got low dose time infection. well theres still age restriction vaccines, well younger people last group allowed get vaccine, would make sense lowest  sure, given we've recently found universal antibody could lead vaccines work every covid sars strain: similar mom's boss. He's ENT doctor trying convince son get vaccinated. kid young, healthy, active physically, lazy moron. Well, son recently caught Delta feeling awful. Like worst ever felt. son finally came senses, called hold anti-vax uncle, told get vax. shit joke!  can’t speak OP. convinced recently vaccinated friends/family members was: 

- getting PTO take vaccine
-FDA Approval
- hearing friends family members ill affects vaccine

However, people never anti-vaxers I’m sure easier convince them. didn’t want first take vaccine hadn’t tried many people. who? 

Says WHO. states call 'Lamb Cola' High five, fellow ~~sacrificial~~ essential worker!   That’s interesting way illustrate knee jerk thought responses one often sees here, I’m stealing it, thx honestly negative impact work relationships. people think utter moron getting shot I'm thinking utter morons getting it. One guy said enough data. pointed fact we've give nearly 5.5 billion shots world wide enough data points him. kills me. asked data would change mind came back ""one study shows safe"". course dismisses every single study that's well real life data many vaxxed vs unvaxxed people ICU. Oh, must American. sad. live seems 2 3 parents dont support mask mandates. didn’t. Denmark 76% entire population least one dose, US hit 75% *of adults* least one dose.

Maybe industry, I’ve heck time tracking anything down. 
We lost people levels roles full WFH gigs, seems geared towards startup type company. Epidemiologists virologists saying COVID could become like flu? ones exactly? _they_ saying exactly? us work healthcare interested.  Yup. biggest treat still far vaccine shortage, anti-vaxxers. Long-term, going people want get vaccinated, that's long way off. Distribution networks post-manufacture probably become limitation anti-vaxxers, especially places violent conflicts.

I’d Thursday cushion (plus weekend don’t know they’ll turnaround time) become mild eventually observed Quebec. bump right lottery announced showed little way increase vaccination appointments. passport announcement certainly did; largely got 18-29 population cohort get past self-imposed objective 75% first dose. group 79% 67% fully vaxxed. 

Overall, imposition vaccine passport non-essential areas society really boosted fully vaccinated coverage 80% everyone 12 older. among best world right now.  One way look resource allocation strategy.  Keeping fully equipped antibody army every pathogen ever run fought expensive probably wasteful.  time let antibodies pathogens seeing environment decay away retaining reserves (T cells, memory B cells).  Antibodies pathogens keep encountering get reinforced.

If run something last saw five years ago, still edge it, might get mild symptoms days rebuilding army fight off.  especially US, Trump denying it. silly blame China. guess racist got racist. fact MIL poorly (she vaccinated). He's anti-vax tell, young lazy.   No. US 63% first dose, 54% fully vaxxed. Denmark 76% first dose, 73% fully vaxxed. Many places give third shot add card ask now. make sign paper saying qualify it, easy enough lie still get record may later need want enter places (as Israel seems like moving towards). saying people still lying first dose though, they're gonna lie, might well counts third shot. “natural consequences” result underfunded education, expensive inaccessible healthcare, marginalization.

These natural consequences result choices.

Awesome see great y'all vaccines! Yep, that's perfect, thank you. Hmm might different state? use insurance either since got school tracked using SSN. pharmacy work uses insurance SSN (for without insurance) totally depends. CVS I’ve always gone PCR tests results 24hours less. places area little longer. sister another city got one done took 4 days get back. I’d call around see place give estimate long it’ll take. look local FB sites people who’ve recently done tell places fastest. you’re saying possibility though.

A possibility, yes. likely? vocal people worth listening issue seem agree. Consider many wildly different variants we've seen far, vaccine developed Wuhan strain (which less contagious strain first detected Europe quickly spread globally) still among effective vaccines ever developed. We've gotten lucky coronavirus mutate escape vaccine-induced immunity much, we're looking protection severe disease. markedly different influenza, every single year. 1.4/100,000, noted subtitle article. Look Cupertino California - 97% 12 vaccinated, everyone masked up. lowest covid rates bay area. hospitals, clinics too. means places understaffed / underserved, well.  people need hear won’t believe part article Jerusalem Post.

Sad true. PRAISE LORD PASS IVERMECTIN! See I’m animal lover I’d probably crying sick shot skunk. I’m major sucker.

I’m glad didn’t get sprayed least, would’ve major ordeal. think I’d almost rather get bitten sprayed I’ve heard smell nearly impossible get out. You’d probably take like 100 showers lol. one get multiple variants? articles considered risk factor, articles say people asthma actually less likely serious problems Covid. Can't post links google it. Literally first sentence article: 

""We found evidence support use ivermectin treating preventing COVID-19 infection, **""but evidence base limited.""**

 conclusion: 

""Our confidence evidence low could include 14 studies participants events, deaths need ventilation. methods differed studies, report everything interested in, quality life. ""

and regards preventing Covid-19:

""We know whether ivermectin leads fewer deaths compared drug""

There information people hear. camp taking Ivermectin, want get bottom it. However, one conclusion draw article since know enough it, beneficial steer clear definitive proof one way another. 

Unfortunately, taking it, article likely embolden study could come definitive conclusion. I’m sure do, need something. job figure stuff out. simply vote whomever think qualified figure out.

That’s case. county Georgia 60% vaccinated. means majority least done right thing gotten vaccinated. hospital still diversion. schools closing.

Actually 2 kids longer school, think CPS going take kids wanting expose deadly virus ignorance finest.

C) OP editorialized title misrepresented said, authors current **very low- low-certainty evidence**, uncertain efficacy safety ivermectin used treat prevent COVID-19. completed studies small **few considered high quality**. Several studies underway may produce clearer answers review updates. Overall, reliable evidence available support use ivermectin treatment prevention COVID-19 outside well-designed randomized trials.

This study conclude, OP wrote: ""Ivermectin useless preventing treating COVID-19"". know /u/DragonSided-D misrepresented authors review.

There nothing review claims Ivermectin useless, study eligible primary analysis saw patients took Ivermectin prevent infection, 0 died virus. I'm even sure anyone study even caught virus hospitalized it.

And there's also issue many Ivermectin study use last ditch effort save nearly-dead patients. far know, claim Ivermectin's efficacy taken soon infection occurs. patient nearly dead, use medicine much. conclusion reported media study showed medicine work. Well, work circumstances, early infection?

FYI - anti-vaxxer never even known anti-vaxxers years ago social media. However, I'm going support fallacious outright false assertions. stupid narrative painting Ivermectin horse dewormer actively used humans around world treat various ailments ridiculous. Horses also eat food eat too, going start making fun people eating apples call horse snacks?

I think evidence efficacy Ivermectin bit shaky. far know, initial spark using medicine treatment covid came vitro study found high concentration medicine stopped viral replication covid. However, dosage needed reach concentration dangerous, although I'm sure they've followed study lower concentrations study effects. personally waiting British ongoing study make final judgment, going lie scientific reviews like OP pretend like evidence medicine ""useless"". this, let take dewormer get! push I'm referring Pennsylvania -  Took see comment like this. 

Objectively speaking, really said know yet, fine since enough data suggest one way another. 

So really good article point want make statement Ivermectin work. go doctor get put list kind hospital system side effect -

I asked specifically said ""pretty hard notice happens, like shock goes arm"" (she experienced feeling time injection).

So, definitive diagnosis would say I'd give credence average joe since guillain barre syndrome going diagnosis process nasty nerve test done they'd shock see well nerves conducting electricity. told pain quite similar that.

Hope helps clarify According Joe himself, didnt get vaccine. Ok, one state then. OP chain specify, hardly ""incorrect"". wish factually Nah, he's definitely vaccinated. lies podcast keep grift going. confusing people say do. Yes happen?????  would cheating though, where's challenge?   would have, delta.

As long antivaxxers continue indulged society, pandemic continue. many hospitals reporting problems could ""easily make beds""?

Are medical professional reletives people informing everyone ""you know, they're writing 'coronavirus' people get *car accidents!*"" too? find difficult believe entire states stupid ring relatives figure incredibly simple issue seem struggling with. Teachers pushed get J&amp;J, least Pennsylvania.  
It specific, much concerted false information (well, two largest turned fabricated), meta analysis would make peer review. We’re getting point whether like not. That’s reality. Best protect severe illness vaccination little ones they’ll built immunity exposure. way out. India's decimal system &amp; US holding Imperial system getting rock anytime soon we?  ""So, saying Ivermectin also cures ED? Wow!"" Love happening, sure think gone reopened covid pass instead without it. maybe change mind cases rise. dont think get vaccinated. said appointment set get J&amp;J week came put handful pregnant women side effects Joe didnt get never scheduled another one after.

Since believes beat Covid healthy I'd believe he's unvaccinated. Increasing number **but severity**. everything protect loved ones -- get booster, weak mask, etc. let Darwin work way get vaccinated. Eventually, one way other, put anymore. CDC among first discredit themselves, confusing early masking recommendations (still cited believed anti-maskers). 


A centralized medical authority, clear consistent \*always truthful\* medical communication, could made difference.  It’s good seeing countries this. Lockdowns/restrictions don’t work anymore cause problems: mental health economy. virus never going away. get vaccinated live life normally again. someone go work every day, hope people office never come back. less traffic, lower utility use, etc.

it's nicer 2/3 people gone. I'm sure lot pleasant too. Unfortunately that's option people. live Los Angeles County school child goes fairly low-income school. Parents cannot afford stay home. families parents working still struggling pay bills. Rent two-bedroom apartment area around $2,000 month, including utilities. People cannot afford lose income.

People made work last year jobs flexible since schools open. example, employer would allow us telecommute schools completely shut down. option person learning, flexibility. Many workplaces like here.

In addition, many children really left behind Tele-learning. I'm talking learning style. many children ended stay home 80 year old non-English speaking grandparents idea use computer. huge struggle young kids (think kindergarteners) navigate virtual learning themselves. Well, everyone knows want start game around Easter virus disappears. ELI5 tell strain have? tests differentiate? possible Delta soon burn US we’ll go back lower case numbers saw earlier summer? feels like wishful thinking seems like many folks getting sick many already vaccinated, delta run options point right?  people sick.

Naturally covid, clear it, day feel ""off"" ""lethargic"" can't dehydrated, hypoglycemic, experience side effect new prescription, something simple slept funny night before...it *must* long covid.

Long covid needs studied based research things seem true:

- Getting vaccinated definitely help prevent long covid.

- Long covid positively correlates severity case covid.

- Long covid mirrors long term impacts severe cases respiratory illness (flu, TB, pneumonia, etc). new vaccines created yes identical one previous ones. program called WIC. helps women tremendously. wife used cost us nothing. wrong. cold 2 years. work pharmacy normally get 10 year. hope masks public stays mandatory least popular. 1.1 million Also helps hardest employer leave protest contains high population unvaccinated. is, tragic.

Stealing another comment- CDC estimates 1.1 million done yeah, pretty significant amount. estimate month old. 

Sauce: know existed, thanks! number Covid-19 patients hospitals across US Labor Day weekend nearly 300% higher time last year, according data Johns Hopkins University. average number deaths 86% higher period last year. 
The surge patients comes highly contagious Delta variant continues spread across US, coincided weekend saw spike travel. According Transportation Security Administration, 3.5 million people travelled across country Friday Saturday Labor Day holiday, despite Centers Disease Control Prevention’s recommendation unvaccinated people refrain traveling.

The people risk people reckless care little danger impose people around them. Isn’t spanish flu still around technically? read gotten much weaker since it’s beginning doesn’t even register significant. Alot kids can't get shot. Trying beat America's body count, see. limited EUA. Moderna intends file half-dose. experimenting delta-spike vaccines probably decent bit better, nobody's talked switching over.  obligatory comment \*reported\* deaths happened several days really helpful vary significantly different reasons. 7-day average figure watch. I'm problem roommate. anti-vaxxer, fucking lazy. I'm concerned he'll eventually get sick I'll end asymptomatic carrier infect others accident. vaccinated though. would one different?

Politicians. I'd assume choices form rolling covid restrictions tied rates community spread letting fly accepting fact probably prolonged periods time people probably receive quality healthcare get sick injured system overload. ahh, get we're saying here.

yes, covid death rate seems 2%, saying big numbers misleading extrapolating scenario every single person gets sick. Oh never happen me, wait whats family / friend died oh shit wrong true frustrating municipalities making ""zero covid"" goal re-opening. 'lose' troglodyte kids pediatrician forefront covid area, tested lot kids coming positive flu. live area Texas 4th hospitalizations. Covid alot kids getting flu. find interesting study Washington Post article based mention study published American Journal Therapeutics:

 ""Ivermectin Prevention Treatment COVID-19 Infection: Systematic Review, Meta-analysis, Trial Sequential Analysis Inform Clinical Guidelines""

Places like India, Mexico, Peru using Ivermectin. India 1.3 billion 11% vaxed 30,000 new cases +290 new deaths almost 42,000 new recovered. heard India could push fear theme, crickets now...

 Uttar Pradesh population 104 million, 235 active cases. ""The Uttar Pradesh government claimed first state introduced large-scale “prophylactic therapeutic” use Ivermectin added drug helped state maintain lower fatality positivity rate compared states.""

People talking Ivermectin like Tide pods. ""Ivermectin well-known medicine approved antiparasitic World Health Organization US Food Drug Administration...it one World Health Organization’s Essential Medicines. total doses ivermectin distributed apparently equaling one-third present world population"".

I'm saying Ivermectin answer constant dismissal media trying make joke ""it's sheep dewormer"" ""it's animals"" makes skeptical. 

Ivermectin around 30 years, patent expired. readily made cheap. vaccines patent, cost significantly more. 



Link study: r/LongHaulersRecovery might assuage fears. stopped lacks manpower.

First, really talking risk symptomatic infection enough symptoms vaccinated person get tested, since based real world data, study people regularly tested.

If 1/5,000 daily risk vaccinated, leads 93% chance dodging symptomatic infection annually, unvaccinated would fare:

|Assumed Efficacy Vaccines Symptomatic Infection|Daily Risk unvaxxed|Annual percentage chance dodging covid (93% vaccinated)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|90%|1/500|48%|
|80%|1/1000|69%|

I'm even sure risk calculated though find interesting. course, even symptomatic breakthrough infection be, else equal, much less severe unvaccinated breakthrough, talking lower odds dodging much worse harm. Actually, think primary problem. Presidential bid problem.

Generally, Republicans vote along party lines, whoever candidate is. assume they're ballot, they'll good.

However, win primaries get ballot. hard-core voters vote primaries. appeal hard-core far-right voters win primaries, try move closer center general election.

Along way, they'll blame opposition problems (a la Abbott blaming green energy, natural gas plants froze) talk much support far right's freedoms forgetting hillbilly farmers love god love congregating church.  good job preventing 75% vaccinated.  told year ago we'd reach 75% vaccinated (of adults), believed all.... There's still big chunk people simply vaccinate, whatever cost. cannot reason people.

It's becoming less less ""optional"" why. Since approved military longer makes optional, that's 2.3 million active service members. universities requiring entrance, jobs requiring condition employment many fire vax status making condition new employment. 

The happens, fewer fewer people get point blank choice. ""You can't make get vaccine!"", employer keep payroll people require new applications greatly reduce options. never made broad claims. said epidemiologists, epidemiologists even epidemiologists, epidemiologists. insinuating little girl Covid locked closet? worry cough probably like flu. school probably uses SSN track records. necessarily mean state would require SSN vaccinate random vaccination site Children ""decide"" part. would gladly get kids vaccinated choice available 2 5.

Epidemic disease growing control specific area, pandemic exponential growth worldwide, endemic means stable rate-of-spread certain area. certain area entire world, entire continent, entire world minus new zealand, key point disease's rate-of-spread longer circulate, another mutation happens become pandemic again.

Again, disease mutations work. world resistance infection, mutation going cause another pandemic. may exponential spread necessarily exponential \*sickness\*.

Your hesitation totally without base -- experts also concerned myo risk. Norway's regulators concluded 12-15 year old get one shot situation better understood.  England's regulators said wait see, shots 12-15 yet.

There's also speculation strenuous exercise one trigger myocarditis symptoms -- I've seen recommendations avoid week 2nd shot.

None mutations far are, there's solid evidence vaccinated people spread it. Catch sure, spread. im confused comments disliked. every country followed principles New Zealand, Taiwan, etc., likely would position today.. cases kept low, (""two weeks stop spread"") could (mostly) eradicated virus, especially everyone got vaccinated expected, well. im saying countries that, collectively, helped other. going realize unless close borders make travel inaccessible, people planet work together, collectively, tackle this? especially delta, variants. True would, spray it, it’ll coat outside, leave inside dry. That’s part electrostatic charge would trap viral particle. Granted, mask heavily used wet breath x would lose defending position- think everyone get vaccinated - but:

I think idea that:

1) don’t think they’ll seriously ill COVID, and

2) serious side effect vaccine (there small number people this, bells palsy like), they’ll feel like themselves. 

That feeling something harmful pretty powerful (even numbers strongly weigh side getting vaccine)   many believe effectively 0-day virus implanted them, say thing there's micro chips anything. ""wait X years, see bunch people start dying developing side effects"". 

The irony, course, see large uptick auto immune general health problems plague large number society coming years, vaccine, going aftermath covid. come NJ, we’re pretty good covid wise wonder aren't? IIRC government ordered whole bunch doses give away free across country. states refuse came Trump administration?

It's fine correct tell everyone get vaxx'd. also futile...you know going happen. Might well tell people learn fly eliminate traffic jams.

Sorry, see could work. is, high enough initial exposure overwhelm initial immune resoponse, get ""sick"". persons defence really kicks beats back COVID, hopefully, without trouble. person could also compromise immune system unaware fact, aware walking around gambling life day. knows, people weird, immune systems binary. continuing say ""vaccinated spread it"" without saying ""vaccinated much less likely spread it"" promoting disinformation. vaccinated first responders means fewer patients infected first responders. Banned masks well lower cancer mortality rates florida least go different one. vast majority asking proof, obviously say immunocompromised, probably good idea story how. Thanks asking! ridiculous understatement headline article uses percents 80s 90s. Majority 80% weren’t trying avoid anti-vaccine nuts attacking them.  Im getting tired... absolutely. it’s completely acceptable understand vaccination equate inability contract and/or spread virus. 

the conversation needs stay accurate science-based. “look vaccinated tested positive” arguments hold ground. understood potential contract virus would continue exist post-vaccine. much fir bring Christlike  (slide 28+) antibody neutralization (an excellent metric protection vs infection) higher third dose vs delta second dose vs wildtype. could easily looking original 95% protection, even higher, infection again.

But without phase 3 trials can't prove it, nobody's running them. we're waiting real world data give us type approximation.

We also seen measurements cellular response, antibodies. data strongly suggests (after vaccination, infection) antibodies main driver infection, cellular response (somewhat) reduces severity infected. improvement cellular response would extremely good, likely give us possibility years decades-long immunity. mean can't even read sources comprehend them. hope getting you?

I trained educating mentally deficient people, sorry. far understand willful ignorance. stance defines identity. sure we're surprised weaponize human beings. We've seen ideology produces terrorists. willfully marching death believe in. peoples minds basically defending core American principles. “Praying it..”
Right need know. Yeah, suggest severity. want quantify little currently 101,000 Covid patients US hospitals, isn’t far peak 131,000 patients January 12th. would thought hospitalization numbers would much lower right considering case numbers even worse last winter 80% people 65 vaccinated. delta likely severe people still unvaccinated makes sense. Interesting. know that! That's good know, thanks mentioning :) Okay, we’ll resist find another line work protecting general population pretty much top priority folks work.

Right? mean, stuff around Gillick competency weakened via Bell vs Tavistock ruling last year, currently mostly overturned another ruling, there's appeal original case going too. fair question given current circumstances. I’d argue quite opposite. Parental consent laws real thing judge going take seriously. Maybe child welfare argument made especially vaccines administered formal FDA approval going get dicey.

Thinking lot waste simply ignorant medicine works. 

The US injected almost 400 million doses 15 million doses wasted. Less 4% waste amazing modern world. 

The developing world much much worse medical waste due intense infrastructure needs.  know boiling them, orange peels definitely edible. hear also contain decent amount nutrients, maybe flavored water actually good you?

If quinine (which thing hydroxychloroquine), harmless additive lot tonic water too. Personally like taste, though lot people think much bitter.

Maybe also try convince take Vitamin D? whole lot people deficient, whether anything COVID, definitely lot good things you. I’d argue it’s likely never perfect first place. It’s large molecule many moving parts constantly bumped various molecules various velocities, angles, positions. work across range temperatures, pressures, pHs. Getting hit UV cosmic rays various wavelengths. it’s functioning step process. seems unlikely first version chance resilient error across entire spectrum situations would find in, microscopic world chaotic. That’s understand well. 

Delta far infectious infecting far people quickly leaving slower viruses host infect. I've *only* one friend die vaccine available- would type get it- passed away asking others mask up. know many gotten though, one ventilator recover, placed ventilation months later. friend/ family pool pro vaccine mask people, luckily recovered Finally! variant named kittens! went back read email got questioning too. says ""300 COVID *cases* within school community."" That's whole county's schools like 12-15 schools elementary, middle, high school. ineffective stopping virus? pro-science folks think smarter anti-virus folks... can't convince dumber half country? put message out, like ""we going treat coronavirus"" get with?  250k doses wasted home state alone. It’s shameful. I’m sorry USA didn’t better plan vials didn’t get used single dose vials didn’t sit shelf expire.  Cool

What primary sources?   IDGAF anymore variant, people gonna stop reporting bullshit like.. get it, really need every headline 24/7 last 2 years? Everyone knows wife antivax conspiracy nut case. She’s recently boiling citrus peels make yummy water additive mmmm. Right? Well see it’s hare brained concoction supposedly producing quinine hydroxychloroquine. Obviously doesn’t this.

Most importantly, restrictions behavior throughout US summer schools back session, entirely expected cases spike.

But exposed virus provides least immunity -- debatable, say less vaccine say more. almost certainly immunity. every time wave goes area, leaves bunch illness also bunch immune people.

The current wave appears cresting without much assistance vaccine, must running ever-smaller population people immunity. makes perfect sense virus fizzle ever-diminishing waves like this. scary might think current situation makes perfect sense foretells end virus spreading control.

I’ve work entire time. Exactly. kids masked entire time we’ve talked importance it. know wear correctly. They’ll even report wearing nose, mouth, etc (without asking). Kids lot it’s modeled them.  notion freedom bizarre me. I'm Aussie, living America 5 years I'm still trying figure freedom exactly. 

The thing figure guns. that's real freedom Americans first world countries don't. 

There also lot freedom businesses trade wish, great expense consumer, cant really considered freedom considering consumers, business owners. 

I get it. think studies past showed much covid still active studies UK US medical supervision. far shown therapeutic use, though shown harm.

I mean, want ask guess ask, doctors (I think) prescribe off-label use they're willing. Good call asking get prescribed someone understands dosing trying yourself, that's fools end hospitals. Considering acceptable number zero - that’s high. Oklahoma reports kind thing lot detail. one state probably good overall fatalities kids rare, breakthrough fatalities even rare. data points age &lt; 18 probably hard even discern trend.

And really fatality rate age 45 low. 

For example see table link shows cumulative mortality rate age 18-24 2.9, age 85+ 2,699.5. overwhelming majority percentage fatalities like 80-90% continue age 65+ health conditions.  Sorry hear that. works same. schools reopening several school districts mask optional it’s chaotic. kid deemed close contact take parent/s schedule almost week immediately.

I love football watching games tv past weekend stadiums almost full capacity gave chills. wish personal responsibility real thing instead words around neck woods. Please take care stay safe. Tell step-sister super careful too. So, Mu 49 US states.  Maskless, packed 45 rallies. 

Maskless Sturgis event. 

Insisting students wear masks. 

Team red inclined wear masks, socially distance, take covid seriously. 

The majority surge occurring south. 

Like, dude, buying selling? Take responsibility. Wake up, sweetie, wake up, get people vaccinated. Well, Yeah. Obviously. that’s nice. 

But trying humorous. think gave temporary court order, though, stopped expired. amazing need judge tell us this. know it’s extremely rare wonder happens teen negative side effect vaccine seriously hurt. know US parents would sue things different UK. *liable* situation without parental consent? government? doctor? teen? Like said know that’s extremely rare I’m curious would happen situation. guess would fall teen likely even though youngster. millions successful vaccines doled out, unlucky teen somewhere going experience based probability. don’t answer better solution. I’m curious would navigate horrible situation. Here’s Israel data think you’re looking doctor want prescribe here, though. patient's family trying use courts force doctor dispense Doctors hospital refused treat Jeffrey Smith month, Julie Smith got temporary order Butler County Common Pleas Judge Gregory Howard. ordered doctors administer drug, order lasted 14 days.   Makes sense, think author article nuanced though. transmission delta greater, likely we'll see offshoot variant it, rather Mu. goal ""program"" always same, replicating virus.

No reason Mu gone rogue secretly developing worse symptoms secret waiting sneak us. spreading rapidly like Delta, failing ""goal""

.  It’s like covid fighting itself,

Human kind putting piss poor fight, covid fighting keep things bit even. coming good folks use pounds, feet Fahrenheit./s  doctor wanting prescribe ivermectin. patient's family wanting doctor prescribe ivermectin.

I'm confused doctor would obligated prescribe medicine someone asked it, though. Mutation finally stopped Spanish Flu  think ""Columbia variant"" delta ""Indian variant"". think Mu transmitting Columbia time Delta found India. Please correct I'm wrong. Yes would viruses evolve. Unfortunately :( vaccinated people ones blame spread. guys walking around like pandemic over, wearing masks, going out, partying. That's 5 shots week going unused pharmacies. Given short shelf-life vaccine, that's inevitable make vaccines available going go unused. I'm glad they're available people get scared finally decide go. world needs 10s billions doses.  maybe vaccinated people stop walking around without masks ""going back normal"" primary factor rapid spread virus. based scientific data, I'm sure there's significant % firefighters got female attention.  used definitely requirement. Maybe back then. nowhere near simple headline makes seem.

The Argentina players might lied immigration forms whether England. Obviously since play there.

Brazil noticed mistake quickly.

For reason 3 days went without much happening, sure say tried get deported Brazil able really wanted to.

Somehow waited game going like 5 minutes stopping it.

Conmebol supposedly agreement every government allow games.

The Brazil government supposedly allowed 4 players continue country health authority people disagreed that.

I clue things true close true outright falsehood, pointing simple everyone thinks. oh yeah, mean way democrat governors nj ny killed 20,000 people nursing homes last year? grow up. people like pinning one side part major problem. everyone responsible covid spread US, republicans liberals. hopefully boosters helping soon.   No, sure call everything cancer, they're different. cancer 'vaccine' vain something like covid. Even COULD, end develop, test, deploy, give hundreds them. That's practical million different reasons.

But we're looking possibility biopsy, looking specific type cancer marker/protein particular cancer particular person, creating vaccine THAT, deploying treatment.

There's guarantees it'll work, possibility types cancers, something that's increasingly researched Moderna, Pfizer, Oxford. LOL. little whiny babies know civil definitely wrong. looked tree part different lineage tree. There's lot. Delta plus variant Delta variants switch lysine asparagine. like looking data look, fascinating look covid development Nextstrain. 

I'm sure would scare people really helps seeing development time. step-sister working 50 hour workweeks Alabama monoclonal antibody infusion center nurse, keep trying get pick one extra shift week, nuts. beyond exhausted.  ""Variants"" anti-vaxxers click bait months would guess that's unlikely volume breath much larger volume air mask face. particles must pass mask trapped. They're pulling National Guard units people can't refuse jobs. Maybe they'll need reinstate draft conscript people work hospitals. Duke University, medical school, set October 1st decline staff vaccinated termination permanent band future employment. offer medical religious exception, requirement routine testing people. like approach. imagine folks religious exception move jobs succumb already. large portion went towards boosters health care workers, least acceptable. Unfortunately Americans able get one, numerous cases corruption shots given people low priority (like hospital worker's friend/family VIPs got third shot 65% population even received single shot yet. 

Originally decent number promised foreigners. time number gotten smaller smaller. top that, foreigners discriminated comes vaccines. Thais could get vaccinated long time many stories foreigner turned away told ""Thai people first, please wait"". English translation came say this. Cloth masks better nothing, point pandemic CDC needs step game. 

The CDC/ASTM new standard source control masks 20% filtration guesstimate seals well (there objective test, somebody looks decided looks good). 

The South Korean standard 94% filtration using paraffin sodium chloride test aerosols, maximum leakage 11% person engaging light physical activity conversation. 

I mean WTF US CDC. know Georgia hospitals slammed. hospitals diversion ICUs beyond capacity. seems like every day there’s news another state running ICU space.

ICUs 96.7% capacity across state. insane. number people ICU higher point last 2 years, look curves lagging COVID cases, majority ICU cases are.  Whatever happened predictability? title goes Jimi imo I'm Georgia even know we've peaked yet. ICUs crowded ever been, they're something like 96 97% occupied now. That's across entire state. People say ""oh, ICUs always busy"" look plot last 2 years busiest. might still going up. Can't speak Nevada, KY's governor tried implement second mask mandate delta surge.

Our state legislature heavily red blocked drastically reduced emergency powers.

It's mess. He's excellent throughout pandemic, hands kind tied. daily updates pretty much begging people mask get vaccinated, that's do. Damn they’re going strategy Japan used right start outbreak, don’t test anybody say you’ve got lower cases cause places dirty Unfortunately, no. Infections multiple strains possible 😕 called ""peanut butter shot"" fucking thick that's feels like. think cocktails antibiotics, I'm positive know drill sgt says time drop trow get MF shot ass cheek.  also much mobile days.

Good god insanity people. vaccines, restrictions, broken health system, even worst case scenario, STILL **vast** majority people absolutely fine covid infection. would absolute tragedy mind-blowing amount deaths (covid unnecessary due health capacity), long-term damage such, **most people get would fine.**

It's disaster us, sure, per-person basis bad disease, infects REALLY easily there's lot us. Let know find it’s contagious  happens older child says want vaccine consent receiving it, parent tells medical person child needs vaccinated? minor vaccinated parent says so? medically treated without consent age? bad, didn’t see now. definitely took said context. work healthcare too. tongue cheek. guys abusive got “sick” - aka mask mandate. know bc I’ve also receiving end community. referring neuro/psych patients bc that’s unfair That's experience people countries without mask usage well though. flu colds. many factors masks involved here. others? in-laws recently breakthrough infections COVID. claiming next three months safe transmitting virus exposed again. science back claim?

They want wear masks around baby (1 month) important. That’s really tough. I’ve classes buildings shut community college person getting covid. don’t thingy tells someone school contracted covid. guess professors know. knew positive cases, told class it. world learning Greek alphabet thanks Americans! “The pledges one thing, desperately need delivery pledges. last week, 89 million doses redistributed high-income countries low- middle-income countries,” Clark told CNBC’s “Capital Connection.”

This simply true. US donated [110 million doses August (and donated millions since then). small number high-income countries (Canada, Korea, Taiwan, Uruguay) 105 million low middle income countries. maybe shave couple million classify borderline countries (e.g. Panama) high income, 20 million. And, again, US donations. EU also donated [18 million 5 billion Covid vaccine doses administered worldwide, nearly 75% administered 10 countries, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Sunday

Winner takes all. Time prioritize vaccinated people qualify vaccine refused get it. unvaccinated go back health care line.

Don't understand end hospital since believe science wrong public health professionals liars. ask random people Facebook advice treating home? don’t know explain it. noticed study like 24/7 significantly keep anything related college courses chapter quizzes. could probably read chapter 1-2x fully grasp everything. thoroughly understand everything read like 2-3x understand it.

However, would blind overlook likelhood touch-spread cases. primary mode, can't dismissed.  even natural infection way effective vaccinations. dont get wrong still get vaccinated, im saying likely wont get covid getting natural infection. also vaccination much better easy counter lawmakers made legally required wear mask indoors, problem law law law.

Then lungs filled like concrete luckily went hospital. stubborn man buried ass. Lesson learned. Donate ones? ones don’t work ones nobody wants? think futile ask folks get vaxed. guarantee friend ended hospital DIED *oh fuck!* moment. 

It's tragic. need common sense, legal actions. 🙄  Fuckin A...I'll take two  bet you’re lot fun parties, huh?  possible eradicate Covid, vaccines not. virus high mutation rate infect animals, possible. Even everyone completely immune, could retreat animal population come back new variant evade antibodies degree. far know, viruses ever completely eradicated vaccine, think 2 them, one smallpox. Pretty much viruses ever caused pandemic still around. Even plague still around (though bacteria, virus). Pandemics never last forever. 

The virus take everyone out. death rate fairly low compared viruses (sitting around 1-2% unvaccinated people, though depends heavily age risk factors). virus incentive become deadlier, matters infect people outcompete strains, there's pressure a) become infectious b) become better evading antibodies, there's pressure become deadlier. happens (such case Delta), byproduct mutations, serves virus purpose even counterproductive depending early infection start feeling like garbage. 

Antibody immunity keeps getting infected, cell immunity keeps getting hospitalized dying. Antibodies cells recognize different parts virus. parts antibodies recognize (like spike protein) far likely mutate parts cells recognize, due pressure become infectious evade antibodies. 

The plan eradicate Covid. possible end world. plan build immunity population whole, transition us pandemic endemic situation. Hospitalization death rates continue dropping (because people vaccinated got Covid get sick, get sick all), virus fewer people infect once, meaning spread rapidly. Seasonal effects stronger point comparable flu, even now.

Creating updated booster shot variant significant immune escape take long took make approve first vaccine, Pfizer etc would switch mRNA sequence new virus. think Pfizer estimated would take couple months. done necessary yet, 3rd booster shot vaccine works fine Delta even people 2 shots significantly less likely get seriously sick die. 

It also unlikely variant evades antibodies entirely. spike protein also binds cells enter wants reproduce. spike protein change much still wants able bind there.

Things could much worse. likely dangerous amount quinine? small amounts it’s used tonic water, apparently higher doses quite dangerous.   Amazing brother...  think important thing weighed data supporting efficacy safety vaccines preventing/minimizing covid 19 ivermectins efficacy treating it. I’m starting think Plague would impossible lose added “Make profitable politicians media figures lie danger virus” option possibly unvaccinated people might inclined follow regulations. good thought

 least Sweden seem case. anecdotal observation part though impression could wrong course.

 impression Sweden many vaccinated people think immune vaccinated. Heard someone example excitingly say felt like cow let pasture spring (we term here, hard translate English). finally could shake hands. Many seem like him, anxious return normal life. Thinking immune.

 Also take account vaccinated people less likely notice infected. Also disregard symptoms might infection since ""it can't covid since vaccinated"".

So argumentation unvaccinated person likely stay home symptom. 

All though would say impossible tell sure course. guess would say big difference vaccinated/unvaccinated following regulations seen Swedish context. put money impression vaccinated swedes cavalier. friend mine transplant list kidney. She’s 25, pandemic made life living hell. shit dialysis hard access now, potentially ER ICU beds available something happen her, big thing essentially needs someone either donate kidney completely someone without covid pass organ donor. way things looking now, it’s getting harder harder find non-covid organ donors.

Nothing since really captured sense overconfidence dread villain goes detective zeros razor sharp deduction.  Aren’t bars open across US though? management cares optics butts seats, rather productivity employee morale. frustrating. 5 6 years? How? 2/3 country vaccinated 1/3 probably already had, get, COVID. Plus, current rate vaccination children get vaccine, predicted 90% fully vaccinated April 2022. think totally wrong. It'll become another thing deal with, like 200 sicknesses like flu cold, within 6 months year most. People vaccinated people natural immunity might get sick day two, that, future, that's it. average age COVID ICU patient still quite high (elders). Old people overall worse vaccine effectiveness outcome compared younger people strong immune responses.

What would suggest feds do? spent billions sponsoring development describe vaccines, distributed administered free. Testing covid free. majority treatment covid (to date, anyway) free. Monoclonal antibodies free. Remdesevir free. Steroids free. offered door-to-door outreach vaccination teams go areas might problems getting shots, told they'd shot. FEMA coming states request FEMA governor would rather state burn.

At point people Texas take responsibility spread disease among themselves? could stay away - would keep virus bay. could wear mask - would help limit spread. could get vaccinated - would lower infection rate hospitalization rate death rate. Three simple, easy things could help themselves, can't bothered yet somehow fed's responsibility come save them.

What suggest feds government people Texas accept? US decided waste doses waiting people don’t want them

America first f others SOP US government Nerve damage seems core lot Long Covid symptoms.

There's nothing sue for, could report pharmacy following state rules, can't file lawsuit win bunch money something zero damages negative consequences.   coronavirus pandemic began Wuhan China, authorities separated 'China' 'Asia outside China' two different categories, maintained now. 118 people China diagnosed covid-positive since pandemic, 7648 Asia outside China.  Exactly, stay. would say unvaccinated kids house? expect successor delta contagious. basically optimised get, one infectious diseases known.

Colombo capital Sri Lanka, make things even confusing. easily confuses people thinking branch Delta. Given much contagious covid flu, fact flu 0 issues traversing globe 1918, consider relevant point.  suddenly imagined Godzilla vs Mothra, lol. doesn’t look like we’re yet, people get naturally infected (unfortunate) 

There several studies showing significant portion population produce antibodies COVID infection they'll never gain immunity get infected again.

Sure one CDC ever stated goal herd immunity vaccination, like vaccines have. achieve simply lowering disease severity.  Again, mentioned above, mean imply long covid merely double vaccinated doesn’t mean let guard.

I hear lot people going around saying, “it’s OK, I’m vaccinated” excuse go maskless. That’s all. Obviously getting asymptomatic mild form could gotten severe one instead point. sure point friend. Here’s what’s happening ranch….. traumatized medical degree virology, let weigh in.  [People infected highly contagious Delta variant twice likely hospitalized infected Alpha variant, according large new British study, published Lancet Infectious Diseases journal Friday, analysis 40,000 coronavirus infections England. adds evidence suggesting Delta may cause severe illness variants Fewer 2 percent infections occurred fully vaccinated people, enough data draw firm conclusions hospitalization risks group specifically, researchers “The main takeaway unvaccinated partially vaccinated population, outbreak Delta lead higher burden hospitals, health care, Alpha outbreak would,” said Anne Presanis, senior statistician University Cambridge one study’s lead Delta variant, first detected India, roughly twice infectious original virus much 60 percent transmissible Alpha variant, first identified new study, researchers analyzed health data people tested positive virus England March 29 May 23, Delta spreading country.

Permanent IQ drop sounds scary someone field. Well better emts respond emts respond. fire unvaccinated ones enough, least many departments, mine included. Also, contractually, can't fire us unvaccinated. (I vaccinated.) shocking (I'm 44) I'm surrounded many morons. going test positive little Covid. mean long covid still infectious.

I've pretty much written entire decade. 2020s generation's 'Great Depression.' grandchildren today's kids learning era history class glad live it, yet traumatized yes, things actually get bad.

But, would hope diagnosis difficult, critical! difference hemorrhage clot extreme treatments well. Illinois, entire COVID pandemic 6 people 20 died COVID: http://www.dph.illinois.gov/covid19/covid19-statistics However, ask people looked statistics, they'd estimate number hundreds thousands times larger. 

While every death tragedy, we're never going zero deaths COVID. important balance risks deaths students falling behind using virtual learning. 

It's hard justify online learning less 10 children 20 died COVID entire pandemic. Shouldn’t already data effect winter Southern Hemisphere? New Zealand they've taken covid-19 extremely seriously guess what? They've far far fewer lockdowns disruptions everyday life America.

New Zealand small island country less 5 million people. less population New York City. hardly meaningful example us, country 330 million. Might tough them. Yes T-Cell immunity forever there, therefore rendering covid mild case days activate stop virus tracks.

Asymptomatic disease?

Mild disease?

Severe disease?

Death? I've trying understand compete aspect good way explaining things, maybe help me. Covid classic highly transmissible, Delta even moreso. also flu, rsv, sorts viruses. virus compete another virus large scale original strain barely present? Delta competed, mitigation tactics would worked original strain?  NY daily news tabloid...  Yes, absolutely.  No, not. trials designed track severe infection, hospitalization death. fact cases symptomatic infection trials attributed initially high T-Cell response. response expected decrease time, hence seeing mild breakthrough infections now. protection infection considered bonus, goal. Sterilizing vaccination rare. Small-pox HPV two vaccines provide guaranteed protection infection illness. someone says can't imagine I'd feel vaccinated anti-vaxxers screaming know that. think majority people sending vaccines less wealthy countries. 

Almost everyone (rightly opinion) upset prospect countries sending doses internationally taking care citizens. 

Now wealthy countries given everyone opportunity vaccinated flooding world vaccines lower mutation risk. articles come I’m gonna sleep. Fuck Yep. Even started wearing little paper ""kn95s"" yardwork made world difference allergies! (definitely cheap knock offs, I'll around anybody)

Everyone thought nuts started buying small packs N95s Jan 2020... probably right whatever. Someone playing pandemic game lives totally confused. Talking area high dengue circulation here, know already already suspected COVID. well, dengue. 

Symptoms dengue parts similar COVID.

Body aches, fever, headache, joint pain, nausea, sweating, tiredness, etc.

You simply COVID without coughing symptoms, that's point. basically end similar symptoms. 

But aunt already dengue years ago, COVID time. said COVID pain infinitely worse dengue. like tetris getting good could take long time. Generations. Meanwhile families workforce become devastated time. need longer lasting efficacy better therapeutics breakthroughs. That's get this. Yeah lucky 90% that's getting long covid (chance 20% vaccines, 10% vaccinated). given reinfected this, resume normal pre-covid activities I'd definitely higher risk long covid getting permanent injury car accident every year. That's bar personally declare Covid over. 0 data suggest help. lab work done showed effect covid concentrations would kill human. similar injecting bleach, yeah kill host covid gone point save human.

That's many cases currently makes up. Nope. folks genuinely believe nonsense they're spouting. 


The supposedly last hurdle clinging ""None vaccines full FDA approval."" 


Now Pfizer's it, ""Gosh, came quickly. QUICKLY. trust approval."" 


They consistently moved goal posts getting vaccinated, boils ""I wanna, can't make me,"" saying loud going convince anyone else. instead, try raise doubts others. 


I'm far past point caring folks well being. point, I'm okay antivax folks dying. found out. not. decline mentioned ""mid-July"" (who writes like that?) proof Delta surged 93% infections August 3rd. Yesterday 98.1-99.8% infections (the range margin error since DNA sequence every single person infected). mu variant even CDC Variant tracker list Wow!!! I'm happy envious time. Sadly people understand New Zealand size single state United States would rank appx 25th population state. *is* something pointy sticking article 100% fear mongering. reason decline mu variant due increase prevalence Delta variant seen would worrisome sudden Delta variant started declining distribution (cases percent cases). instance Delta, 98.1-99.8% cases US, rapidly became replaced another variant, might indicate worrisome future maybe would mean new variant stronger way (more contagious, resistant, etc.) Since article mentioned decline there, ""mid-July"" would add beginning August, CDC stated Delta variant accounted 93% Covid cases, basically replaced variants far dominant. means Mu variant every variant, time ""mid-July"" would gone significantly percentage due Delta, since accounts &lt;0.3% cases (it's even line CDC Variant page see other). That's say evolve next big strain, possible like winning lottery, Delta future evolutions real scientists watching closely. new deadly version might circulating already, smart money evolved evolve Delta. feel like Fauci getting bad rap right bc conservative/center right media painting kind bafoon following research trends. covid first emerged believed masks work. research continued stream in, found did. talking heads either morons or, likely, deceiving viewers bc working greater good everyone means self sacrifice self interests virus gonna wipe republican base next 20 years Truth. introduction them, beyond seeing video ""Postmodern MTV"" Matt Pinfield.

Aka possibly unvaccinated people might inclined follow regulations. good thought

Well, opposite, since point vaccinated want return normal life. activities less risk them, might inclined them. I'm certainly less careful vaccinated.

I find really hard tell effect dominates. short answer no, data new variants, studying data incredibly difficult. data shows cold air, especially nasal lung tissue makes easier infection reproduction Covid coronaviruses, data showing spreads easily indoors, especially close quarters poor ventilation. biggest problem limited data new variants, studying phenomenon complex, can't infect humans produce control group.

Here's I'm glad see Brazil seems quite high uptake rates, numbers puzzling. get uptake rates 100% almost adult age groups, highest almost 120%?

If highly contagious mostly done like 1 year world population immunity either infection vaccines? Spanish flu also ended pandemic within like 2 years - without vaccine is. office opened August completely optional. busiest days probably 10% office come in. people work sit near vaccinated wear masks away desk someone comes desk. people come back mandatory know take company make mandatory. office county probably moved ""red"" status week.

Taking youngest children equation, means 88 per cent Portuguese population fully vaccinated. Last week, DN questioned Directorate-General Health whether goal group immunity meant entire population, eligible vaccine. reply received.


Vaccination slows down
The vaccination task force confirms plans vaccinate children age 12. group immunity, basis total number inhabitants country, 10 347 983, according 2021 Census, explains source task force. Last week, 274,000 people fully vaccinated. Sunday, 7.6 million inhabitants Continent two doses vaccine (in case Pfizer, Moderna AstraZeneca) one (Jonhson). must added 300 thousand total vaccinees Azores Madeira, is, nearly eight million Word Data.
If take account took least one dose, increases 87.69% situation 98% eligible population.

In last two weeks slowdown vaccination process, led dismantling Covid Vaccination Centres. exception weekends, period reinforcement inoculation youngest. Last weekend 151 thousand users vaccinated, 110 thousand young people 12 17 years old finished process. Next weekend turn second large group ages.

In 50 64 age group, percentage fully vaccinated users 92 per cent. reaches 99% aged 65 over, according latest vaccination report DGS

Numbers tend stabilise
The virologist Pedro Simas stresses Government decided goal 85% population fully vaccinated achieve group immunity, agreeing moved general opening. argues end masks streets happened July, 60% vaccinated reached, following example UK Israel did.

""They criticised, pandemic risk already disappeared. Portugal entered endemic phase covid-19, number new daily cases drop much further. 60% population vaccinated, moment risk groups vaccinated, serious consequences disease decrease exponentially. good coronavirus circulates among vaccinated population, since increases immunity"", explains scientist Institute Molecular Medicine.""  underestimate stupidity republicans. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

It’s horrible little machine makes hurting people, that’s does. Sometimes makes errors it’s that, sometimes errors make better that, things get worse.

People weird habit trying put rules awful little self replication machine, kind anthropomorphize it. Somebody said fifteen minutes contact, people adopted fourteen minute rules workplace interactions. People decided surgical masks kind panacea, people wearing giving thought actually avoiding walking cloud virus. People decided bars restaurants need stay open it’s impossible give money stay closed, wacky situations people wear mask door seat instantly take leave hour crowded room. 

This openly insane, stems almost religious belief virus small, evil guy follow certain rules, you’re safe long follow rules designed thwart awful little man that’s trying kill you.

The asprin comparison poor one. 

But millions people used ivermectin. saved many lives, especially countries parasites bigger problem. 

Ivermectin FDA-approved antiparasitic agent. 

In 2018, 420th commonly prescribed medication United States, one hundred thousand prescriptions.

It World Health Organization's List Essential stops people acting like fucking morons use phrase often

It doesn't. 

Anyone go Wikipedia find info listed above. (Along paragraph evidence helps covid.)

Even morons know lying, confirming they've sure along.

And goes double media they're even sure lying along. infinite rona least honest populace vaccination alone answer &amp; npi's necessary. Plus section ppl wanting get tested, need testing &amp; needs dirt's cheap &amp; available home.

We need serious conversation going proceed going forward goals going be. approach get vaccine &amp; 110% activity level make 2020 going work. There's going nuance &amp; npi's necessary, especially community spread high, feel like things kinda need ebb &amp; flow based community cases better understanding disease (yea know sad still saying point).

I feel like we're barreling towards winter &amp; ""solution"" pound booster booster booster &amp; that's going end this. better car accident point.

You might able make comparison car accident different people behaved whole pandemic.

Wear seat belt = Get vaccinated

Don't tailgate = Maintain social distance

Stop red light = Follow lockdown 

For example possible unsafe drivers cause problems safe drivers crashing driving red light, folks refused get vaccinated cause problems rest society follow rules. Born Kings. nightclubs 2 weeks, 2 months ago. case numbers still haven’t fully recovered :( another Texan, exactly want us do, part reason ridiculous abortion law.

It's working though, also going leave. get 1 life live. thing feel bit better Niner stadium requiring vaccinations and/or negative Covid tests fans. even then… Yeesh would know one whiff??? that's true, i'm sorry that. said equating There's cows people. Ah good ole Texas gives 0 fucks anyone lives unless filthy rich potential donor actively destroy health care system, thereby causing bed shortage.

Sorry, there's world difference two. key math use simple numbers figure complex ones.

say 100 people, 70 vaxxed 30 unvaxxed (to match percentages) said cases also 70/30 can't use since let's say there's 10 total covid cases 7/3 split. 

that would mean 70 vaxxed leads 3 infections 30 unvaxxed leads 7 infections, something like 4% rate vaxxed 25% rate unvaxxed (which know wrong numbers proportion right least close) something like 6x improvement vaxxed folks, assuming percentages accurate  time know difference. learned it, took PCR couple days later. 100% want guy going work spreading everyone without sure I'm negative. really think could time, delta, I'm happy proven wrong. Id rather give someone covid eat mealy peach. body reacts specific strain! ""It never happened Western medicine,"" Dr. Ken Souza, Chief Physician Executive St. Luke's Hospital Fear mongering article tbh is. lot people read article 'Superhuman' referenced later referenced ""Hybrid"". capable mounting ""superhuman"" ""hybrid"" immune People ""hybrid"" exposure virus.

""Imagine entire segment population gets winded walking stairs, permanent heart/organ damage""

Okay, I've imagined average american. what?

Hashtag social commentary.  partner doubled vaxxed started things eating restaurants indoors going movie theaters Delta. However, hit, we're back almost pre-vaccine levels carefulness I'm wondering be. keep seeing posts friends social media hanging friends, traveling, going vacation, etc I'm wondering we're overly cautious. 

For example, really wanted watch Shang Chi, rather go theater, drove 50 miles go watch Drive In. 

Are careful?   untouchable court? law precedent would possibly inform reddit bad idea leave misinformation unbanned? I've never pissitive test 😎 even read, understand, quoted? 

The author saying based quote said Ivermectin used horse dewormer also used treat humans. also said might prove completely useless COVID article says science still reliable. said people idiots care science. combative anything, mob mentality.

You check response question regarding Idaho move crisis standards care: read COVID-19 sub. 

This variant likely get outcompeted Delta near future Delta appears contagious. FYI superhuman immunity mean get COVID, actually exact opposite, people got COVID combination vaccination really good protection second infection. Hopefully boosters achieve similar results near future without requiring infection. Call cynic but: think somebody trying pump pharmaceutical company makes ivermectin hydroxychloroquine.

Also tell fucking amazing speech text spell hydroxychloroquine? mean wow. Yeah read study. still clear consensus even medical / scientific community trials available ( including one showing positive results one posted) limitations/ flaws (check comments peers trial posted).

This recent article nature show situation certainly could've.

This better mean unvaxxed people get kicked first, somehow know people stupid. stupid using excuse okay legal know believe comes deplatforming people disagree federal government can't mandate it. State governments could imagine arguments would be. School districts also it. likely patchwork. Good news available anyone wants get it. can't worry much people refuse get it, made decision deal consequences. Accept things become lot easier.  parrot misinformation dangerous unproven theories, I'm sorry, deserve platform. support closing subreddits like that. 

Nothing accidental that. ""Blatantly wrong"" case means people going information independently checked reproduced favor information that, cannot reproduced, independently debunked. Reddit community largely agrees this.

In 1960s protests women, civil rights, LGBT, enviroment, peace, etc. Many directly protested group produced distributed false information(ie. KKK)If reddit existed back exact protest would occur. 

Do seriously want people advocate something blatantly wrong people injured/die trusted them? know people advocating harm community centre would want stay would protest presence? Yeah probably good idea list approved mRNA vaccinations 0 don’t count last months approval work major healthcare corporation. pulled everyone back office May allowing work home unless local governments make them.

My job 100% able remote. one person team fully remote even times. productivity actually better remote. 

But nope, everyone must work site ... Because.... Reasons?  Stadium UT packed well Lockdowns lot invasive washing hands. wreak havoc people's mental health, ruin children's educations governments propping economies enormous amounts stimulus money, subsidies funding, global economy would suffered complete meltdown. That's sustainable more. coworker mine kidney failure prior history kidney issues. doctors think covid months ago may played role. believe talking people already COVID vaccinated.

The interesting question people naturally completely immune COVID? 

Some speculated previous exposure coronaviruses may key would love know answer is. Rapid tests accurate, especially symptoms. assume positive PCR test comes back.  virus spread itself, people spreading Sweden decides there's enough people vaccinated many cases hospitalization worried (and saying case, decide analyze situation take decision) remove restrictions even another part planet virus still problematic. saying depends local circumstances planetary thing societies situations different. Anyways hope ends well. Gotcha. wonder Moderna others hold regard.

Sadly, can't help feel like matter time resistant variant pops up... rethoric anti-vaxxers anti-maskers use?

No. well established schools major sources respiratory infections. Thinking SARS-CoV-2 would somehow different simply delusional. guy saying NAB titer marker watch T-cells severe disease immunity? thank many hospitals reporting problems could ""easily make beds""?

Fear mongering. given day ICUs operating 80-90% capacity. metric ultimately meaningless. need create beds arises following:

1. Call staff currently off-duty.
2. Re-allocate staff one area hospital (of lower criticality) ICU.

The biggest difference ICU versus normal bed ratio patients nurses, usually going 7~9:1 2-3:1. need double/triple nurses. 

So what's story here? metric ICU beds, number variable given demand beds. 0 COVID patients, hospital shrink number ICUs accommodate.  appropriate metric ""staffing utilization"" then? medical professional reletives people informing everyone ""you know, they're writing 'coronavirus' people get car accidents!"" too? find difficult believe entire states stupid ring relatives figure incredibly simple issue seem struggling with.

Well depends issue here... hospitals ones dramatizing lack beds, local/national media outlets. reason generate fear form control. Scare people mask up, get vaccinated, etc. valid tactic, pointing inherently wrong.

I love early ""ventilator utilization"" running scorecard till hospitals realized driving fatalities... oops. Live learn guess. idiot told know ivermectin?

Is used deworm horses? Yes. knock combative bullshit. Calling horse dewormer cheap trick delegitimize make certain group people look stupid. 

I think people overdosing product bought Tractor Supply don’t need help looking stupid. 

[70% recent calls Mississippi poison control related people ingesting livestock meds. reason think Texas law Supreme Court ruled last week going work. Sure sue damages? Cause they're children adult bodies goal pump ivermectin say miracle drug. dumb enough take due ongoing research it, I've fully vaccinated probably get booster. 

However, weird war around Ivermectin like someone mentioned ITT elsewhere people taking sides sides science. Try one: getting point whether like not.

Umm... data Israel show 90% reduction infections (asymptomatic testing) following two doses Pfizer. So, no, vaccinated, absolutely could skate away never infected. Chills... irony  Bread games. need keep peeps sedated one way another. truth 14 studies generally showed positive results Ivermectin

There nothing article support conclusion. here. stopped wearing mask work back June vaccinated, lasted couple weeks went back masks due constant stuffy noses. think I’ll make masks permanent thing doesn’t really bother me. Don’t know they’re killing supporters. What’s endgame this? live FL, used desantis’s antics, like u gain point banning masks? base already stans you, instead killing maybe subtly try help them…

Whatever scheme things doesn’t matter, maybe enough Florida votes blue 2022 24 don’t deal batshit crazy governor. superhuman dude 😎 disease appear respect political borders. 

The question is, restrictions caused positive results, happens stop? No, really wasn't. context important. one principal said ""we pushing get J/J"" enough? better. option ""unvaccinated emt emt"".

We can't adequately staff ambulances EMTs have, number unless union

Yup. Fetid foetus country live would lose money call sick??? Yep, least US, main narrative messaged public. Hence hate directed unvaxx many local region subs. Lol. it’s someones prerogative take fools task trying disprove claim you’re supposed unbiased possible. 

All I’m saying one study showed signs anti-viral effects, researchers working it. conclusion could well could beneficial dosing required convey anti-viral property dangerous toxic human consumption. 

Also, citing low confidence study evidence laughable. There’s reason researchers calculate confidence levels. Viruses don’t try hurt people, goal reproduce.  best virus would spread means, respiratory, species earth would susceptible virus would harm host.  fact I’m sure viruses floating around, since don’t cause problems don’t know them.  

50% humans average intelligence, anther 10% aren’t much smarter.  remaining 40% half brainwashed either political religious dogma since birth aren’t capable even handed rational thought.  Leaving 20% population capable ingestion data arriving reasoned logical conclusions.   

The 80% need “story” follow, call religious, like will, form human control works really, really well, group think, herd mentality, etc.  

The story, 80%, needs make feel like “on winning team”, exerting free will, told exactly do.  Since 80% don’t understand what’s happening story OK approximation what’s necessary, makes worse case it’s created 20% don’t understand 80% think, feel, react, behave.  gaps story filled 80% looks like mythology.  80% creating story follow. fall bullshit? presumably they'll eventually ban everyone fell bullshit disagree with, people would able lift ignorance gone surrounded people already agree didn't. also one top 10 oldest populations, might play part. people that. smart. take medicine designed animals. However, used that. also used humans. Calling horse dewormer cheap trick delegitimize make certain group people look stupid. everyone curious drug running local feed store everyone curious drug wants drink bleach  Yeah: certainly lot big challenge simply mass-manufacturing vaccines (which huge challenge). Vaccines require distribution network, storage, people administer shots. 600k shots going help elites without strong systems prioritizing risk. sold wealthy neighboring areas. Unless get rid shortages everywhere, that's going problem. places going harder reach others, due things like war, corruption distrust vaccines.   hospitals overwhelmed surge unvaccinated rather ""sympathy"". Unless wish adopt proper unvaccinated triage enough staff beds hidden away somewhere handle it, Delta outpace hospital beds percentage unvaxxed - I'm province close 70% full vaccination rate total population.

This happens even areas high-ish vaccination rates - restrictions lift, cases look good, go exponential.

With said, five years imprisonment leaving house draconian, article Vietnam Sweden. Contact tracing works cases, America ramp states trace outbreak first occurred. New Zealand always gotten ahead things committing resources, America not.

Makw democratic voters leave, assume.  11 daily deaths nothing terms national population election next year..... spending 260millions this..... madness. Many raised believe freedom power measured ability act selfishly hurt others without consequence yourself.

God bless people do!!! read doesn’t reliably protect 6 months? consider “reliable” protection? even pessimistic research vaccinated people half likely contract COVID compared unvaccinated people, research showing 65-85% efficacy Pfizer 6-8 months. I’d call reliable protection, even ignoring super high degree protection severe disease. fair, headline ""fake"" left people facebook promoting drug stopping covid-19 ""fake"" right. 

Science saying inconclusive thus far. enough evidence. equally incorrect say help ""Useless"" Covid. still researching it. People using fight covid choosing experimental... surely safe dosed correctly. people using might even help science help make case one way other. No, they’re changing dosing boosters. feeling comfortable resuming activities. Like know comes place privilege, that’s got vaccinated, still mask required such, it’s shaken core perception nature people don’t see recover treat baseline respect Err, boosters initial shot? know front line people received booster since got 2nd shot January. 

We 2 billion people fully vaccinated less 1 yr across world. I'd say initial rollout pretty good. ever successful initial rollout vaccine history humanity 30% Earth's population fully vaccinated within 1 yr? within 2 yrs virus becoming problem? ""2 3 parents say triad thing really working them"" One went hospital old great health. others pretty rough time hospitalizations thankfully.

I posted feel. sucks watch people I'm close still fall ill Covid even though they've fully vaccinated.  link research paper. follow local health authority guidelines.

You’re tremendously unlikely get seriously ill due vaccination. However, still reduce community transmission number people choose vaccinate (due living really fucked media ecosystem). it’s main purpose used anti-parasite livestock? know something don’t? hopefully legally true... comes prescription. Sure might give ""opinion"" want hear. cool prescribing drugs want take. saying can't happen normal condition. 

This drug safe people prescribed decades. legitimate. typically used alternate (not common) approach treating parasites. missing scientific conclusion work similarly covid virus. likely best avoid said conclusion exist, ""dangerous"" prescribed experimental treatment here. Might likely expensive uncovered insurance though. would hope least looking patient charts making sure clashes issues drug person otherwise. great news hear. hope end tunnel right thing. work tech company southern california. went home March 2020 havent back since. numbers metrics higher ever working remote. 

Last heard 4th July return. come gone still discussion hard date. welcome soft return, gone days maintenance done home. absolutely love working remote.. plans returning Correct One detail I'm still unclear ... patient antibody test done, tell COVID infection and/or vaccination ?  think Moderna currently shown effective Delta, possibly due higher dose given. Yup. Surge surge. Waning vaccine effectiveness constantly chasing tail. Super! Israel point platued stayed there. Ive seen information happened. track reach herd immunity long time ago never made it. 57.5% fully vaccinated, Canada 66.8%.

There surge cases sure vaccine available everyone 16 long time now. absolutely zero sympathy anyone knowingly puts people risk getting vaccine. can't let hold entire country hostage. Emotionally totally board idea. However, think dangerous slippery slope put on. far reach extend prioritizing healthcare smoked, drank soda, eaten fatty foods, driven without seat belt etc etc etc. One newspaper articles said preparing take ventilator. Yes Israel good enough display what's come? thing struggle decision daily. Hoping get back community spread slows/ he's vaccinated. mechanism. world now. disease rise fall, always there. Please call vaccine (Even technically accurate). immediately creates fear reject based book cover.

Immunotherapy probably better way put (Just keep stigma it).

It's shame think like this, see need distinguish particular technology rather broadly calling vaccine. One absolute smartest, compassionate people know went nursing order serve support people, I’ve met many good nurses. I’ve also met bad ones. Like profession, it’s mixed bag. It’s profession it’s especially harmful people selfish jerks. Thank you! says updated April, assume changed? 2 kiddos elementary school. 2nd grade Kindergarten. youngest last week came bedroom puking everywhere, herself, floor, bathroom.. called sick school.

We tested day, results came back Friday negative still cough runny nose. 

Meanwhile, eldest fine went school. 

We made long family 4 without getting sick all. first sign cold get tested seemed like. 

Our school mask mandates staff students parents pick drop dont bother time. one enforcing either. Portugal gets ahead lot things. Also drug policies. Amazing!    I'm tired doctor holding good animal drugs. approval ratings utterly tanked (currently 41% approval falling), he's re-election next year, thinks COVID safety protocols unpopular really are. sorry dear. **Zoloft**it helped hard times depression moments , bought[Zoloft ](http://globalpharmshop.com) Seems like could scary staff too.

Lol WFH mafia downvoting this. People allowed like working person you’re healthy 50ish, probably are. dont extreme circumstances, go live life. vaccine likely never mandated students. Less half US 12-17 year olds even received single vaccine dose date, rate even lower younger ones even approved. political hold public education hostage coerce parents vaccinate children.

COVID school rest career. you. Wild. seriously started hearing (constantly now) like.. month ago. 

In defense first 6ish months year great didn’t pay much attention anything outside mi casa mi hija. loop felt weird rubbish calmed fuck down. 

Dear Spanish speakers, I’m probably sorry forgive 🙏 It’s matter feeling angry experience unfortunate turn events would require care, good chance care compromised peoples’ bad choices. That’s ok. right people agree infallible eventually ban misinformation misinformation bad happens. american israeli governments planned allowed 9/11 happen dangerous ""unproven"" conspiracy theory, assume agree ought discussed mainstream  Yes, I'm getting tired kind equivalency. celebrate without constant stream attempted shame. 2022

No Vax

No ICU basically like rationing care. learned nursing school, lot us never thought we'd actually real life.  Well, working inside truck trailer sat sun day (and hot day that), nope. Unfortunately, masks difficult wear properly already helmet plus safety glasses deal top physically demanding job. So, almost everyone wears nose unfortunately especially summer.

Most time, there's enough ventilation distance make reasonably safe, time unfortunate exception.  Tell relative actually phase 4 testing. Chances are, won’t even know exists. does, we’re there. never seen examined patient Guilty, guess. it’s silly say say “only X% Americans vaccinated” considerable portion literally *can’t be*. It’s glib view suggests vaccine hesitancy much worse is. 

That’s manipulation—this literally data reported CDC. ""if party hard enough, virus gone"" This. 
As much school might hate annoying schedule, elementary school kid meeting parking lot lunch every day going on. eaten indoors restaurant since March 2020.....to kids every day pretend incredibly high risk scenario bit much along with. 

I realize many parents choice accept given various work situations feel them. hard. real problem putting kids situation begin with. Schools around even lunchtime precautions last year kids needed ever.  I’m NC county-run drive-thru testing sites closed Labor Day.  thought even last year rough estimates showing 50% population essentially asymptomatic. guess question whether means body mounts sufficient enough immune response prevent getting actually sick kind immunity based genetic factors it? also alpha-variant info though. understand many people spend year half ferrying seriously ill possibly dying people hospital still think big deal. Surely point every EMT taken least patients age younger. matter time made vaccine mandatory, pseudo mandatory requiring green pass everything, talking right extending use workplaces.

RNA dramatically lower “shelf life”, chemically speaking, DNA. It’s basically flailing around guts. Whether you’re infectious little RNA, need shedding complete virion particles. It’s mix propaganda (misinformation) culture, though don’t understand propaganda originates from. mean, people still think Earth flat guess I’ll never understand human stupidity begin with. Also anti-vaxxers don’t exist US, many countries France large anti-vax movements. love picture crops poster read ""masks ass""  Thanks! Would able narrow gave specifics?

At height fight COVID (around start month), fatigue, chills, body aches, distortion taste smell, cough. Now, fatigue, chills, body aches completely gone, cough almost gone, sense taste 40% original capabilities sense smell 5% original capabilities.  someone expects believe antiparasitic medicine good treating virus standards proof go quite bit. One person YouTube count enough give fucks it. Moderna supposedly provided almost 3x antibodies Pfizer. I'm waiting family TN get COVID. legit never cared mock care. inevitable because, let's honest, they're also vaccinated. Thanks, that’s helpful. know that’s Moderna? I’ve heard maybe higher doses helping combat delta variant more, sure that’s due perhaps longer efficacy not.  tested 

interesting, roomate ones super immunity seems. Payall  Influenza kills average 12,000 - 61,000 United States year. COVID killed 500,000+ 2020. see difference?

We need focus reducing numbers prevent collapse health system first foremost. severe infections controlled, it’s time really focus developing advanced therapeutics better vaccines. article suggests need weigh health risks health risks live deciding travel vaccinated person. Also look infection rates going.

It’s common sense people apply anyway.

I don’t see spreading fear. course do. Anybody says otherwise considering anything less 100% effectiveness ""ineffective."" Hi everyone. 

I looking information regarding eye issues following least 1 dose Moderna. particular, foggy obscured vision.

My mother possible adverse reaction first dose tried searching similar cases internet found much. already notified relevant authorities.

Thanks advance.  They're smart  Mild symptoms two, symptoms teen? ventilator? Yep still many 50, 60 70 years old people want get vaccineted Italy 30 years race get vaccine themself. it’s actually weird, half house covid got tested together roommate even thought ate dinner night results came back i’ve tested negative twice since waiting third rn helpful, imo. Upside: attend 1st week events. Downside: miss weeks school shut due massive outbreak. Full text copy/pasted comments. want even thorough, ask calprotectine test. measures inflammation colon, detect chronic diseases, polyps, etc. Age definitely high enough immune system isn’t functioning well. article seems unspoken asterisk applies under-75-year-olds. Sorry suffering family experiencing. ones around bite immunoglobulin! got like nineteen those. Fucking rabid skunk bit four times, surrounded bite ring shots. 

Fucking asshole got head cut off, least. ouch. Yeah, far seems Delta variant, pretty much long one person house hold gets stick.. entire house count. late - we've given disease ample opportunity mutate, goalposts moved. Italy 81% population least dose 72% fully vaxed opposite problem.

Older people around 50 70 years old home pretty consistent no-vax share population young population 30 years running get vaccine soon possible. someone adhd, biggest struggles task initiation (getting work mode), task switching (easily getting pulled work mode. get car drive work helps switch work-me, dedicated cubicle (which hate), helps keep switching work mode. 

Also, there’s inherent dopamine hit changing scenery. 

I basically work home office see fit, job always essential, workplace flexible. One thing I’ve learned don’t struggle major projects home. take extra half hour get wheels turning, it’s challenging project, means high dopamine reward, get locked pretty easily. Handling emails, paperwork, reports, etc home nightmare me.

So usually go morning, knock admin stuff, come home eat lunch work whatever project plate, works pretty well, productivity easily double last summer I’m *less* exhausted I’m trying drag brain around like angry toddler doesn’t want clean room. MERS would tracked found out. fucking around one. decade ago, felt like 90 years old. Every joint swole up, could barely stand. 

I’m dead though! Oh no. sincerely hope next ill students. know pray numbers low kids staff stay healthy possible. hard time right now. callous, lazy, stupid got tricked TV. actually says 1:10,000 responsible communities. Roughly equivalent unlikely daily risk - like car accident  Except Dan “Grandma needs die economy live” Patrick would take over. disgusting sounds, Texas better Abbott Patrick removed well. think repurpose places like ICE detention centers private prisons hospitals unvaccinated covid patients. allowed interfere regular non-covid medical care.  anywhere near 98% though. brother wife part group reaching milestone. Took forever convince them. Underrated comment. Yes NY hasn’t even started school yet I’m sure it’s relevant. States mask mandates going heavily influence number hospitalizations. It’s useful lump together different circumstances come average. [See post higher percentage population vaccinated, higher proportion cases among vaccinated.

It bit counter-intuitive, fraction cases vaccinated indicate effectiveness vaccine. hear Dr Fauci YT vid disregard it?

It's venue -- presenter. Dr Hansen board certified pulmonary specialist full time covid critical care physician. discrediting merely discredits you.

And fact express Reddit throw stones others truly laughable. autoimmune disease. would (science) miracle. Sorry, I'm States.  


Why first responders vaccinated? first line get them? figured people, would ones would desperately wanna get shot. think among unvaccinated. got wife avoided getting first time. kids live state something people supposed anyway. it’s definitely completely rational thing. slips young people suddenly they’re office like “well diabetes now, never before”. Well Deborah it’s haven’t seen doctor 7 years. way check actually need booster? antigen test get info?

For example, say COVID (Asymptomatic) without realizing post getting two Pfizer doses? ""What's really causing issue damned wind turbines."" question keeps coming up. Everyone friend family circle age 15 85 pretty much went back normal moment vaccinated, around Memorial Day. We've visiting other, traveling, going out, etc. current wave cases news vaccinated protected cause concern. know it’s hard see. remember though “no one ever getting sick” never goal vaccines. goal reduce severity symptoms turn reduce amount people going hospital dying. Remember, plenty people get flu shot still get flu, shot helps keep symptoms minimal. 

So, story people know success story shows vaccine it’s job. one went hospital may died without vaccinated.

No. course, much distancing last month, would instead partying summer.

depends are. noticed differences life life 2019, except masks specific settings. true. Budesonide Reduces Risk Emergency Department Evaluation Hospitalization Early COVID-19“ So, completely.

Sorry, statements square. sure anyone really knows. Everyone blames delta variant current wave correlation causation. US, almost every area country minimal restrictions summer schools opening. surely major factor spread. much variant much behavior? really way separate two issues. Could one, other, both. hope COVID enjoyed long weekend well. problem United States isn’t old people though.

They may problem, [82.1% 65+ getting fully they're exactly example follow countries... Wise beyond years. Always.

I played rom one Tiny Toon games months back could. I'm 32. Lol stop 5 years? Let's give death sentence! Good job, TX. #1 terrible things. could eradicated, percentage humanity embraced like Texas Florida. stay. state that?  father leads belgian evangelical church. It´s crazy different. see vaccines answer God blessed scientists power.

An anti vaxxer even asked speak welcome. ever successful initial rollout vaccine history humanity 30% Earth's population fully vaccinated within 1 yr release? within 2 yrs virus infecting humans? 

IMO, 30% world fully vaccinated, even partially (over 5 billion doses globally) 10 months great accomplishment, celebrate that. That’s shocking seems like bit information widely known, would lot kids parents taking covid seriously.

Bold assume parents using information make decisions. high. infections symptoms low Yeah boosting effect isn’t drastically different one way another, sign half well! booster US going identical third dose, know yet? mean anecdotal situation family gathering 30 people total inside outside vaccinated, cases. hope outcome better. Sometimes it’s hard hold onto perspective like that. Appreciate taking time write   Microbiome Vitamin little novel viral infection asthma is, KN-95’s I’ve wearing office legitimately give horrendous headaches end day. can’t stand em. US, believe me. country decent education, many people small towns believe this. feel like alien hear something like ""I've heard 50% people work held spoons arm vaccine"". know extremely strong herd mentality, superstition, I'm social affect believe nonsense. think need learn skills critical thinking, basic physics. lmao think enough people would would move needle significant amount? mean logical also See New Strands emerge time Yeah… could turn fucking bear live life behind masks six feet apart. 

What interesting see data emerges long Covid vaccinated people. Hopefully shows sort immunity actually get helps prevent ‘long Covid’ experience.  ignorant comparison. waves don’t care solar cycle. better comparison would peaks troughs whether highs higher lows lower experience, unvaccinated people know straight anti-vax. merely juuuuust enough reservations bother inconvenience scheduling two appointments getting super drowsy    shit argument keep hearing. 

COVID already super contagious. They’ve nailed reproduction trait - even mass restrictions still spreads. doesn’t need evolve become less deadly. It’s already spreading. 

They also don’t consciousness. don’t “choose allow life”. need spread. lockdowns? fully vaccinated, went Tampa Bay Rays game Saturday. 

Wanted get tested good measure find anything available. Spent hours driving clinic clinic, either full reservation only. state verification site look record. already know I'm vaccinated want mess unfreezing credit check multiple people r/CoronavirusIllinois said wrong. wouldn’t able track state ID number? Great article.  think I'm one mind wearing mask. guess lot woodworking finishing -- use much bulkier heavy duty masks -- makes wearing n95 movie theater grocery store unremarkable. totally forget on. can't imagine I'll ever stop wearing mask places loads people. mean -- aside getting Covid -- like getting colds either. Win-win. Plus, Delta much transmissible pushed herd immunity 70% 85-90%. No. I’ll take vaccines I’m done mask mandates. thought thing, RA. Unfortunately appears opposite [Rogue Antibodies Involved almost 1/5 Covid it’s antibodies specific autoimmune disorder, people predisposed producing autoantibodies seem fair worse Covid. thing makes feel *a little* better areas density spread covid easier vaccinated. Like it’s like farmer earl gonna give covid corn next entire subway train. Yeah, ideal. let kids go school households someone ill.

I got flu years ago (2009, H1N1) useless two weeks. wished anyone. I'm looking forward apparently inevitable case COVID despite vaccination. Still good enough nothing firm commitment date re-opening. I've one ""reach brain"" test - fun get it. tough part driving home eyes watering. FDA could follow recommendation American Academy Pediatrics approve based original cohort alone. ordered expanded cohort added months long delay. benefit outweigh harm delay.  cite source claim ""forcing everyone vaccines result less vaccine protection""? comment literally framing 100% infection rate, 2% death rate. I'm seeing 7-day average 18 deaths Michigan, population 9.987mm people. Cities 100k would losing 20k people, even 0% vaccination rate. 


Again, understand he's trying say, way he's saying muddies waters.  connection horrible. Even house dont signal everywhere. wifi 5G.  Consider though. small rural areas may spread comes living spaces, options shopping, praying, congregating, etc much fewer. location basically become super spreader hub many people unmasked unvaccinated. difference moderna applied booster authorization 50 micrograms mRNA, half dose original. It’s likely move lessen side effects double available inventory also considering 100 microgram again.

As someone got rocked second dose, I'm glad looking shrinking it. sure he's control. US ""united"" NSW could say naaa fuck land Sidney cant go anywhere... Mine definitely was, see shot dates claims history year. Good. Ugh. get it, I'm wildly pro-vax means really prevent covid spreading mutating way initially hoped.  wonder, CDC vaccine cards come play? I'm assuming states bothering filling in/recording them? reunion tax neverending stop date?
Regarding another tax one would happy. think anyone world would happy tax, highly probable.
 due covid, natural disasters faced.   American Academy Pediatrics said FDA based approval original cohort, expanded cohort delayed 4+ months. could follow expanded cohort track rare, almost always mild heart inflammation issue post-market analysis.

Given covid hammering kids hard now, clearly vastly dangerous vaccine, agree APA, FDA making serious unjustified mistake delaying way next year, especially given resumption person schooling.

Antivaxxers cannot appeased delay. Seems happening San Francisco, 73% residents fully vaccinated. Cases doubling every 2 weeks couple months mostly among ~20% unvaccinated adults, burning community since hit wall vaccinated declined 2/3 since peak. may still see outbreaks schools, soon kids 5–12 vaccinated pandemic largely (unless variant escapes  submission removed either repost, clickbait low quality submission. Please review sub's rules, particularly rules 3, 5, 6.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Exactly. Reading made really, really sad. hope people start change minds getting vaccinated. crisis like this, we’re supposed come together… hate raising children world like this. grew Alabama lived Texas ten years… joke “Well, least Mississippi” now. Now, get pregnant Texas, you’re almost forced kid likely catch covid. feel like woke Russia something.   good point. friend hospital weeks eventually died, 5 friends finally got vaxed! 

They believed immune systems strong, changed minds saw quickly downward spiral towards death occur healthy individual covid. we’re terrified Delta don’t want wait around Government twiddles things “will won’t they?” approach countries already moving ahead. Thanks, good point. ""It's like flu""

I guess millions people get flu shots every year curb impact year's flu strain fuck then. coworker told weekend ""even doctors TV experts saying vaccine stop getting COVID."" said, ""but prevents getting *very* ill."" looked walked away. looked walked away. 

She's 76. wear mask never stopped, goes eat restaurants multiple times week.

One coworkers, adored, died COVID last year. Another hospital months. seems recovering returning work.

We're retail employer never going require vaccination term employment. hard enough find workers is. would probably lead losing half employees. (The lazy half, mostly, big loss far I'm concerned one asked me.) Yup. 

You must healthcare civilized country.... understanding people previously infected Covid *some* immunity Delta. Ditto fully vaccinated. Obviously people who've recovered Delta strong immunity Delta.

So point, Delta run suitable hosts everyone form immunity.

But close point? one knows. lack testing data collection makes pretty much impossible anything guess Delta wave end.  MIL?   think people may thought would like several previous disease/virus scares, things like SARS, Bird Flu etc. Stuff visible serious impacts western countries people got worked (relatively speaking) nothing. Even swine flu crapload cases (like 60 million) anywhere near level fatalities. 60 million less 300,000 hospitalisations 12,469 deaths reported. 

So think lot people naively thought might similar those. Big news story, scary little bit, gone within year. test positive PCR still vaccine succeed keeping safe less infectious. virus gets foothold nose vaccine-stimulated immune system mounts response stops virus ever causing symptoms infecting anyone else, that's vaccine working, PCR still able tell virus replicating nose take right time. I'm SE Idaho 30% county vaccinated....Between school back State Fair going would guess hit crisis care end month. bright side maybe help fix real estate market. Booster shots every 8 months, happening

This essentially flu works pretty well. quite terrifying people forgot social distancing im talking people invade space rather people wondering whybyou walking away someone gets close Yeah know widely mentioned, tbh. original point (I think lol I've lost track) still effective treatment early course infection, keep sick person hospital. patient sick enough hospitalized think budesonide nearly effective. would real game-changer find treatment effective intervention someone already sick ICU. That's 86% effectiveness hospitalization fully vaxxed, 23% partially vaxxed, anyone wondering. Interesting fully vaxxed 90% cases; how's work? keep civil? Since virus parasites, less deadly infectious type always natural selection goes. Parasites *wish anything hosts death*. deadly would gain smaller life span.
That is, long term. wrong, deadly mutations, may spread cause harm, likely never overcome variants. General Health anxiety probably big factor. It’s hard find doctors willing answer questions vaccines. I’ve found smart people like doctors scientists trouble communicating people don’t think way. I’m get second shot it’s taken months find physicians willing explain things way understood. 

99% time answer variation “there low risks. Risk involved everything do. Stop worrying it”. January March 2020 told countries shut flights commerce China, worry person person transmission people wear masks.

This pandemic need be. made it. .. Nice!  also 20% population even elligible vaccines covid (kids)

Closer 15% thankfully, roughly 48 million Americans 12 under. Probably good ol' Darwinism eventually virus runs immune compromised people kill strongest adapt it. imagine kids vaccinated things might start easing up. Still might good idea wear mask winter months go crowded stores. Depends much treatment options improve maybe? supposed do—lie?  Yes ok. I’ve seen friends UK/US posting photos stores masks sight, also partying/festivals big crowds it’s still banned.
Here still outrageous walk place without mask.... Bars empty fuck man know go consider ""packed"", totally like before, I've seen people entering bars measure distance tables (and people got kicked well close - spoiler: close all) literally listening least comprehending people saying.. ONE thread said virus alive trying compete others.  random replication errors causing mutations allow compete variants allow become prevalent. CFR Covid March-May 2020 pretty much confirms this. Nothing little horse supplement can't fix. Lmao  Well fact self-reflect recognize may lazy says lot you. probably recognize things need/should vs lazy even figure should/need completely blind what’s going on. Maybe lazy isn’t right word. Ignorant? Apathetic? sure would better. worry downvotes, people smart. mean widespread knowledge vaccine prevent spread Covid yet people continue think 100% vaccination rate = Covid gone. Logic lost people live tribe. 


ps im vaccinated think everyone else make right choice get vaccinated. Honestly, people America still getting first second doses, especially since FDA approval recent. said that, shortage extended waiting period awhile now. they're killing innocent ppl virus instead getting free vaccine, needs punishment. understandable theyre immune compromised they're able get vaccine, there's excuse.  story, paywall: [Texas Pediatric COVID Hospitalizations Hit Record High nutshell, we’d see fabric country ripping apart even harder now. 

Due Delta variant, We’d probably back worse version days several thousand people died every day. Would evolve mild? would evolve vulnerable dead?

As see major selection pressure virus evolve symptoms spreads, infects 6 people, happily kill host whatever. it’s clearly it’s declining words: shortage supply. shortage supply chains. Don’t get wrong, “the best time plant tree” applies. thank know know that, conspiracy guys think world governments pushing agenda.

I've even seen posts predict vaccine side effects cause mass die-off years Power want get world population way No. Unfortunately they've given go ahead extremely reckless leadership. kind harsh restrictions winter fuming.  Hell viral infection 11 triggered type one diabetes it’s abnormal Lead Paragraphs:

At end last year, may recall hearing news reports number COVID-19 cases United States topped 20 million. number came truly sobering news, also likely underestimate. Many cases went undetected due limited testing early year large number infections produced mild symptoms. 
 
Now, recent article published Nature offers more-comprehensive estimate puts true number infections end 2020 100 million \[1\]. That’s equal third U.S. population 328 million. revised number shows rapidly novel coronavirus spread country last year. also brings home timely vaccines been—and continue 2021—to protect nation’s health time pandemic. actually said 6-8 months. Covid changed world. I've science geek (enthusiast) life. Biology strong point ten years ago asked friendly biology forum way process evolution affect human lives short period time. got ten answers within hour: microorganisms, micro pathogens. obviously agreed admitted ignorance. are, living global scale. 

I think way, despite millions people getting sick millions dying, wake call nature. We've gone HIV/AIDS SARS MERS Ebola, bird flus, swine flus among others able convince things happen others. Two people knew died Covid close family 1, 2, 3 ... six young people got sick it. sick, ended hospital one hit close home. Heck probably beginning. tests available time know sure. sure antibody tests would conclusive almost two years later. 

Life return normal new normal. Booster shots accounting new variants wearing masks flare ups. ease spreading evolution works. eventually vaccinate children variant, random mutation, evolve affect children. lethality may byproduct evolution works, longer infection lasts, spreads, further, wider variant spreads, better bad us longer infection affects respiratory system people die. ""Immune escape!"" ""Immune escape possible"" thing practice. 

Yes, goes unsaid matter. 

The fact remains highly-vaccinated populations risks COVID remain far lower. Vaccines remain HIGHLY effective face delta, lambda, endemic strains. 

Messaging ""immune escape"" without context adds fuel fire anti-vaxxers. I’m sure it’s fine completely gone  Oh good grief. There's least legs theory.

A vax'd person give antivax Covid many vaccinated people relaxed Covid probably be.

The total disregard ""if unvax'd people took jab likely end hospital"" part something special though. that's still 75,000 750,000 American deaths. minimum 2.5x average flu season somewhere around 25x (and virus already killed 650,000+ Americans.)

That downright scary given much done limit this, compared flu much usually done (some vaccination nearly rate, masking, etc...) u ever worked service industry job even known anyone lmao? even bringing mu? shrank almost 0 Yeah that's one positive, unfortunately got bad bailed, would much better off. Probably current gen, quite likely next. Living ground scuffling available resources.
Yeah think advance civilization, one thing covid climate change taught me. think acting 1990s fucked us wait till see acting 2020s us.

It's never late reduce pain. can't lie people though. Eventually people start noticing inconsistencies/catching lies end filling gaps themselves, usually insane conspiracy theories. makes things worse. 

And would case? Valid points, point viruses mutating attempt escape immunity like many seem think. random mutations allow outcompete others make dominate.  Bona Bifana! maybe anti-psychotics... Clinical trials starting next year, we're lucky. take years use general public. lack urgency treatments we're supposed accept endemic covid astounding.  busy trying play nice CCP hope getting useful timely information well much needed access data … 20 months later CCP still misdirecting offended. 
I blame don’t blame WHO. know fact discussion Wuhan pneumonia active wechat early November groups started getting shut down. I’m Texas took child pediatrician last week. pediatrician said she’s seeing around third kids covid irregular EKGs cannot get doctor’s authorization play sports. 

It seems like bit information widely known, would lot kids parents taking covid seriously.  Time hold China accountable. ultimately responsible releasing world. tried cover failed see -- evolutionary pressure evolve way right (as evolutionary pressure covid become less severe).

Covid often spread pre-symptomatically/asymptomatically decouples disease severity evolutionary pressures contagiousness. still people think works. usually demand ivermectin sold out. Thank much insights! know bad. sad. one ridiculous narratives ""Big Pharma"" want use ivermectin because... reasons.

This despite fact Ivermectin manufactured distributed big pharma, publicly traded corporation generates $50 billion year revenue.

These people stupid. even close 75m vulnerable given past infection  can't buy human version counter, prescription only

If effective, doctors prescribe it? better come STDI/LTDI can’t work immunocompromised. stay, eh?

So what? What's endgame? What's social plan long-run?

We can't live half-in half-out forever gotta start planning long run living it. What's plan look like? highly-vaccinated locales start living normally, going decide hold maybe next year simmering everywhere low levels?

We can't say endemic expect people respond with, ""so what's next?"" treatments then? *Illegal alien turbines!* Oh hell, never-mind...my condolences :( Could still vietnamese propaganda? parents get positive uplifting information situation VN. However, knowing country big HCMC cities are, difficult see incredibly hard citizens matter hard government tries, feed whole city locked one gets leave home? People may starving. I'll die happy staring space advertisement Amazon Prime. Knowing Jeff Bezos there, smiling me. Merck, makes it, specifically said use COVID... even close 75m, given huge chunk people gotten COVID already. Recent studies showing previous infection antibodies potentially holding even better un-boostered pfizer Yes, may case flu even generating long covid similar rates covid itself. (Personally find less believable since would expect type severe outcome scale disease severity itself, covid deadlier flu).

However, adult average catches flu twice decade. often catching covid antibodies wane time covid strains continue super contagious?

You say entirely evaded response, also say unknown-- gotta put right context. immune escape seen across multiple variants far vaccines hold well.

Long run vaccines make huge difference social health responses this. said Delta variant makes 99% cases U.S. Mu variant mutations ""indicate might evade protection certain antibodies.""

So, like monoclonal antibodies?  Problem 25% still like 70 million, enough allow keep mutating point 75% nearly protected anymore. reached heard immunity? they're anticipating supply issues, hope elderly/at risk/frontline first instead letting nonmedical factors influence timing recommendation. 8 months elderly/at risk justified all, they'll lose credibility change later since they've still failed cite evidence besides calling 90% overall average hospitalizations (you expect young healthy driving up) ""only hint decreased effectiveness"" mentioning several data sources worse numbers justify 8. can't give reddit says influenza segmented genome creating new strains primarily re-assortment different human animal strains verifiable fact.

It's also fact viruses vaccinate people remained completely stable targets decades. expect easier times ahead though. I'm epidemiologist, think every variant becomes prevalent bad delta. Still, possible COVID could evolve deadly, possible could really become ""just flu"". Time tell. Either way, get breaks COVID low transmission rate comes waves. 


Also, thanks do. Really, societal downside people ""sneaking"" 3rd dose right throwing statistics. 

That could certainly change ""throwing away unused doeses"" environment, FDA found downside booster process. quite likely individuals are, whole, gaining increased immunity COVID, reducing chances spread take hospital resources serious breakthrough case. Turns previous bleach injections prevented hydroxychloroquine working. Sometimes older people fall, break hip, get surgery, recover spend years meaningful life.

People crippled killed lack medical care. fair.  think root commitment fringe thinking, saying “the quickest way top turn whole world upside down”
Going medical school disputing findings study hard, spending afternoon YouTube deciding you’re smarter medical communities easy, provides emotional reward “feeling” smart. wrong. think vaccinating even 100% US would prevent mutation billions globally vaccines long time? variant traced US origin?

That also ignoring vaccination little prevent infection first place. Vaccines great prevent severe illness, given still infected carry similar viral load unvaccinated person, mutations certainly still occur. 

That's ALSO ignoring animal vectors COVID well.

COVID never going away, never stop mutating. Real world effectiveness shows several different US based data sets highly reputable sources (including one cited CDC themselves), addition Israel, showing 70-90% effectiveness severe disease end July. 

*That alone* justifies booster least elderly high risk 5-6 months. want wait 100% sure everyone else instead 99%, ehh, sufficient data know making elderly risk wait 8 instead 5 mistake. part care? Maybe. people get vaccinated, definitely. 

The Anti-Vax rhetoric really fails treatment. Let naysay vaccines understand it. Yet demand treat monoclonal antibody IV, also idea wtf it. NEED INJECTED STRAIGHT ME!!!!

Selfish fucks, go get vaccinated already. Youch. Pretty big drop. entire world stopped covid notice. Sad.   good reporting. hospitals south way least three months.

Novavax (protein subunit) did, showed solid results, also never gotten working factory going. Oh yeah. I’m sure person eating words. don’t think anyone anticipated Pfizer’s drop soon.  I'm going try optimistic.

I'm predicting current spike begin falling slowly. Looking 7-day moving average new cases NY Times COVID tracker, looks like number cases levelling nationwide; likely start trending downwards slowly delta wave eases south works way vaccinated northern states. Also, [on website estimated ""effective reproduction number"" trending downwards almost every state, great sign.

Thinking herd immunity standpoint, long way go, US good amount overall immunity. US 40 million confirmed COVID cases, I've seen estimates actual US COVID cases ranging [2.5 times [*six* times higher (which seems unrealistically high CDC estimated end May [there 120.2 million cases well current delta wave. somewhere 30-50% US population likely infected. Along 53% population fully vaccinated, would mean 68% 78% population immunity. still enough, number get 80% sooner rather later kids get vaccinated, vaccine mandates enforced, people get infected acquire natural immunity.

And know still possibility reinfection and/or breakthrough infections; COVID never truly eliminated become endemic. also case spikes future, particularly around holidays - probably see another considerable spike cases Thanksgiving New Years, though bad current spike. think get spring 2022, approach 80-90% population level immunity, see huge outbreaks US. matter vaccinating rest world. Obviously there's potential new variant, I've read extremely unlikely variant able significantly evade protection vaccines/natural immunity, also remain virulent enough out-compete Delta. &lt;3 I'm hugging internet.

Evidence CDC points shows effectiveness hospitalization average 90%... that's high estimate Mayo Clinic public trackers showing lower. *That alone* justifies booster. like ivermectin look 90% feel justifies booster especially elderly high risk.  “vaccinated less likely spread it” saying “vaccinated spread it.”

No, isn't. second statement used Vaccine Truthers say vaccine effect transmissibility. That's blatantly false, stop saying that.

Last week, highly vaccinated State 60% TOTAL population vaccinated half remainder previously infected, 83% new cases unvaccinated. That's high real world reduction transmissibility.

The article goes reinforce point strongly without real doubt. no, I'm saying vaccines effective  Yes, military hospitals usually work at. used work one heard go New York outbreak bad there. federal government basically said, “if everything correctly, we’ll cover issues arise foreseeable”

This admitting trial enough cover cases vaccines manufacturer don’t believe safety enough go ahead without legal waiver.  likely,in US, corporations would sponsor government would dispose unproductive.

I’m doctor, don’t know worse. Maybe it’s ok kids get infected, continue person learning. don’t really know… People's hyperfocus anecdotal outlier incidents opposed taking whole scope picture really testament powerful anxiety/fear is, especially prevalent (understandably so) pandemic.  feel like getting point sub could train AI write titles news articles would super close real ones.  puzzlement our's. fact last Brazilian general populational census 2010; 2020 census cancelled. 

So, population columns page linked estimates, revealed conservative, causing strange vaccine intakes. Would someone please save googling tell became thing? It’s like heard name one day next day fucking everywhere. 

I know hydroxychlorine thing (which understating doesn’t appear beneficial treating COVID actually high enough risk producing harmful side effects?), it’s pretty wild witness med blowing fuck seemingly nowhere. Especially way has-with many loud right-minded folk going fucking nuts it. 

It concerns I’m seeing slow increase posts (from places like fb posted Reddit) claiming hospitals actually worsening symptoms of/ killing COVID patients current therapeutic regimen. also killing patients refusing approve vitamins zinc infusions along ivermectin. It’s just, yet again, placing even undue bullshit health care professionals staff.  school, worn- except lunch… kids sitting right next other. still cases. students sitting right next simply isn’t enough room keep desks even 1 foot apart. 🙁 Along scientifically proven monoclonal antibody. It’s treating ED viagra ivermectin. One drug works, scientific basis use. think death rate unvaccinated 50 year old england gets covid 2%, i'm sure tell you. would make covid essentially extinction level older folks (which isn't).

on graph : highest death rate 1.22% 2%/5.6% listed

then portion reference article says : ""It's worth emphasising that, say, dataset comprehensive, may representative population.So I'd wary reading much comparative ratios here, trying calculate effectiveness figure them.""

you'll also note graphs combine vaccinated people together regardless single double. article notes ""Interestingly, look over-50s, turns around 54% admitted indeed double-jabbed, 29% admitted vaccination."" would course change graph mentioned.

so said, one closely reading. gather normally vaccinated. None people story got severe disease, vaccines job. Zero covid pipe dream it’s fine vaccines don’t provide sterilizing immunity time.

IMO, vaccinated don’t children immunodeficient people home it’s never go back normalcy. ""Earlier week, consensus estimate August figure, due released Friday morning, seven hundred twenty thousand, according Dow Jones. actual number came two hundred thirty-five thousand—less third consensus prediction. Even allowing sampling error factors make month-to-month figures bounce around, big forecasting error, seems evident Delta variant blame it.

From February July, total employment covid-sensitive leisure-and-hospitality industry increased three hundred fifty thousand per month. August, hiring stopped dead: industry added zero jobs net. Although businesses associated arts, entertainment (gambling), recreation added thirty-six thousand jobs, gain offset loss forty-two thousand jobs restaurants bars. convincing explanation that, number covid cases rose sharply, people stopped going out, owners restaurants bars reassessed staffing needs. theory consistent OpenTable data restaurant reservations, show significant dip since July. Something similar appears happened retail industry, recent spending figures—for July—also came weaker expected. jobs report showed retailers shed twenty-nine thousand jobs last month, drop concentrated food beverage stores.

The upshot depressingly clear. Despite hopes earlier year mass vaccination would finally break link pandemic economy, hasn’t happened—not yet, least. According Labor Department’s monthly survey households, part employment report, number people saying unable work employer closed lost business rose 5.2 million July 5.6 million August. Yet another sure sign Delta variant biting: rate participation labor force among women aged twenty over, fell sharply early months pandemic rebounding somewhat, slipped last month.

The good news? “There isn’t any,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote circular clients weekend. “September likely weak too, we’re becoming nervous prospects decent revival October, given behavior lags cases, cases yet peak.” pessimism could turn justified, isn’t universal. “The August employment report reminiscent April payrolls, employment slowed sharply, rebound within next two months,” Aneta Markowska Thomas Simons, two economists investment bank Jefferies, wrote another analysis Friday. “If anything, one likely followed even quicker/sharper rebound given likely influx labor supply September.” "" shit worked would know it, enough people visited tractor supply medical supplies. vitro terminology that’s used describe working is, correct I’m wrong, vitro terminology saying MU might escape efficacy. is? Horse dewormer isn’t effective outside vitro Mu going problem shows resistance vitro vaccination efficacy. one smarter please explain. Thanks needed anxiety nightmares Based devs updating game become even realistic. Yeah, 5 million people they've taken covid-19 seriously. think covid-19 can't spread population 5 million?

Even past week managed avoid uncontrolled outbreak Delta variant taking mitigation actions. two weeks rapidly rising cases, they're rapidly declining thanks ""taking pandemic seriously"".

Sure, sounds like restrictions, nothing compared mass death rolling shutdowns America has. Short bursts serious counter-measures far effective mess non-measures America has.

I've heard every excuse America's strategy can't like countries kept covid-19 deaths down, comes America wanted take easy way problem easy solution. +1 gum. Works like charm. may seem silly bit fidget spinner stress ball help quitting too. Keep hands occupied. Could be, two things consider: 1) covid though spread super-spreaders, would explain unlucky dinner party might bad time; 2) tend hear outliers like that, people get infected.

Literally friends things would consider wildly unsafe pandemic (indoor dining, indoor bars) one caught covid since March 2020 (and passed husband son). Maybe change Delta fall...

*edit: spelling  basically problem looking whole population saying risk 1 x--it account fact activities carry extremely low risk others carry extremely high risk.

(Since CDC made stupid decision include unvaccinated cases hospitalized, almost unvaccinated people.) comes 1 \~2000 odds per day. higher vaccinated New York Times claim vaccinated people need worry Covid-19 seems like stretch me.  I'm afraid have. Online work, bring in. 
No distancing, cleaning time.
Recipe disaster  Keep mind also J&amp;J vaccine shit Delta. vaccinated people much higher risk. J&amp;J people need booster right now.  last week, taken ambulance hospital middle night. Three first responders showed house - one police officer, two EMTs. None masked. entire ride hospital, EMTs masked EMT back ambulance sneezing complaining allergies. ER 6 - 7 hours, worried possible exposure. spouse fully vaccinated, child young vaccinated. arrived home, stayed masked slept separately spouse. day 4, got tested (PCR). received negative result, thank goodness.

My spouse careful throughout pandemic, upset first responders waltzed without mask. lot stress confusion (I sort hypersensitivity reaction, fainted hit head way down), wherewithal make sure masked.

It absolutely ridiculous first responders mandated vaccinated wear mask. doctor: theory high percentage fully vaccinated booster effective delta beyond. 

without vaccine mandates never return times, also 20% population even elligible vaccines covid (kids). vaccinations requirement school, one see things going towards normality.

""hey please get vaccine"" longer works people right thing fully vaccinated. Also think insurance. Transferring availible bed likely network much higher deductible. survivors going paying rest lives. lying federal forms winner me. sign things true. Even unreasonable assumption. ""hospitals past breaking point"" idea media fear mongering. Logic would dictate even percentage people choose get vaccinated overall hospital admissions would still reduced. 

Even so, whole business ICU beds silly well since need beds they'll make them. 

Think it, everyone unvaccinated uninfected point. Given rate pandemic good portion may naturally derived immunity.

The whole point response defuse idea people unvaccinated issue. They're not. choose get that's them. natural immunity thing, tracked. It’s horrible little machine makes hurting people, that’s does. Sometimes makes errors it’s that, sometimes errors make better that, things get worse.

Such great way phrase it. I'm going restate problem next time I'm stuck talking denier relatives. decided bars restaurants need stay open it’s impossible give money stay closed, wacky situations people wear mask door seat instantly take leave hour crowded room.

This drives nuts. Restaurants require walk wearing mask, let take seated. guaranteed fail. PCP told get 3rd shot, would attest whatever want attest to.

Why would let victim bureaucracy? get behind national message work together

It even national thing. fact people saw best solution:

1. potentially saves getting damaging illness
1. contributing public health
1. potential risks still much much much lower Covid's.
1. free charge

Even selfish person alive benefits you. fact, even people trying skip ahead vaccines first. There's really reason get vaccinated. Portugal anything beyond reasonable. I'd say anything considered extraordinary, except sense nobody else it. Politicians, priests, old people, young people, everyone went ""the vaccine clearly way go want suffer less"", went it. know priests pushed vaccine parishes saw humane thing do. God believe would giving doctors vaccines test them. 

Like, there's political issues selfish altruistic incompatible, isn't. Unless value winning moral lottery 0.0001% chance right actually something consensus. Even right one vaccine gives zombie-autism, everyone else taking it, really want one around take care everything?

There frame mind getting vaccine makes sense. maddening common (can even call common?) sense became rare thing Portugal, places, reasonable country. 

Despite faults, fucking love country's pragmatism.   think would value stop looking pandemic could instead look currently is.  55, 83, 84. Definitely variables course, age help, people still need taking lot precautions even fully vaccinated. surprising hit 3 badly did, say least. think parents heads buried sand think school precautions. I’d argue risk least doubled since last spring. Delta, double amount students, pandemic fatigue, mask fatigue, room sharing, full schedules, community spread, etc. 

There’s definitely argument made online learning failed lot students last year. Hopefully haven’t swung pendulum opposite extreme fail desire normalcy situation ground still seems anything normal.   kind useless statistic. risk strongly depends many active cases community, cases always growing shrinking--you can't treat constant like one way think one-in-10,000 daily chance: would  
take three months combined risk reach 1  
percent  It’s classified “interesting” mutations. suppose bit hyperbolic regards concern vs sea thousands variants, point remains; concerning variant interest concern, cannot compete delta. aren’t lying awake night worrying beta gamma, don’t need either. snapped fingers achieved complete vaccine coverage right moment access regular boosters, life could get almost completely back normal immediately.  
I mostly agree saying tone seems imply vaccination sort ""takes edge off"" pandemic actually super effective, especially *everyone* gets it. good breakthrough cases, great breakthrough hospitalizations, even better breakthrough deaths. held almost well Delta variant. 
Of course nobody predict future, mutation rate be, effect vaccine efficacy. look highly-vaccinated counties fared one major mutation looking pretty optimistic. said. taken vent!

As I. Portugal, France, Ireland, Iceland, Malta, Denmark, UK, Spain, Norway, Belgium, Netherlands, Finland Sweden higher Italy. boosters officially recommended/available general public yet. want get one need lie say first dose. think problem lies better studies strongly support vaccines masks vaccine alternatives, including ivermectin.

The logic someone actively protest vaccine, many cases also masks mask mandates, instead turning treatment whose initial studies find ineffective best, difficult lot people wrap head around. Appreciate venue clearly stated PCR test suffice entry.  really confused Israeli vaccine adoption - strong start stopped 60% vaccinated. 40% population 12? What's going there?  scary thing is, work science field &amp; heard similar things….

Doing number mental health, needless say. It’s hard know believe. know, facetious. one Orwellian things think make population think pandemic going away measuring it. ""The patient recovered enough come ventilator plaintiffs claiming victory.""

This said. taken vent! least change comment reflect that. ""little flu"" /s Understood, thanks. event Sunday - I'll get test taken Friday morning hopes comes back time. reasonable think mid-day Sunday? nothing covid though. h  would lie shot ? literally getting vaccine anyways point Sounds like want argue. interested. think like ""*Hold spike protein, I'm going in!*"" I’m big supporter vaccines 1 5,000 odds don’t seem right me. many examples breakthrough infections I’ve hearing about. 11 14 vaccinated people get infected, odds trillions really 1 5,000 individual person.  like religion. believe parts (religious text flag rules case) want believe ignore parts want ignore. vaccines.

Their covid-zero policy seems effective. Even WaPost clickbait titles. ""the Sturgis rally tells us X delta variant."" hospital systems. light-years better Florida Texas rural Idaho. least #1 something besides one worst senators history. Way go TN!

My empathy folks left 6 months ago. Consequences bad decisions suck hey, right die young. advocating cull. “natural consequences” result underfunded education, expensive inaccessible healthcare, marginalization. There’s nothing “natural” it. Saying people idiots deserve die abhorrent morally bankrupt.  vaccine extremely helpful. 

I’m saying shouldn’t treat magic covid shield (unlike CDC saying masks vaccinated).

Hospitals full. need lower strain. Oh yeah, best skunk. 

The poor Animal Control guy shot got sprayed, real loser it. clean truck get uniform dry cleaned, etc. I’m sure leave boots outside months. 

I didn’t get sprayed, contact left reeking. funniest part nurse friend another department hospital, made ER say hi follow smell find me.

I also like ignored truly remarkable feat fully vaccinating 30% world year. Fortunately wife page, hopefully get too. Unvaccinated people allowed house matter are. finally convinced them?  saying don’t actually mean want people dead move important things? 

Oh no, absolutely do.

There's difference wanting people die due natural consequences idiocy advocating cull.   True, there's denying Thank you,  That's entire population. eligible around 75-80%. Almost everyone double vaccinated pzifer, rules whatsoever since months, delta managed make cases half unvaccinated, deaths unvaccinated people, full vaccinated population vaccinated really like common cold even less.

we monitor Portugal (and Spain too) compare cases hospitalizations vs Israel. It'd interesting see high uptake 2-dose regime fair Delta. facts wrong.

That going endemic obvious last summer.  saw MU automatically thought Marvel Universe  Welcome reality True. main thing they're looking boosters high-risk people (began recently) developments infections/hospitalizations next months. already know there's seasonal factor last year's winter wave began October-November, peaking December. get 1 January still seen major increase hospitalizations think we're close goal able live long-term virus without causing major issues (at least unless new much problematic variant suddenly appears). I'm sure research study, study reported Delta increase risk hospitalization vaccinated.

""We found similarly increased risk hospitalisation associated delta variant (risk ratio 2·83 [95% CI 2·02–3·98]; appendix p 2). analysis included 44 patients admitted hospital delta variant, four (9%) admitted 14 days first vaccination. **The risk hospitalisation significantly increased among non-vaccinated people among tested positive within 14 days first vaccine dose (appendix p 2)**. consider two study findings comparable (because underlying populations similar COVID-19 vaccine coverage rollout doses one two, despite Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 vaccine comprising approximately 3% administered vaccine doses June 23, 2021, Denmark, lower England). addition, minor differences analyses regression method adjustment factors."" tempting feel way people, want remind people evil. Instead, environment (this includes news, social media, entertainment, etc.) significantly skew individual perceptions reality.

Just people capable of/do commit acts perceived evil make evil. Given positive high esteem environment, people would act benevolently interest greater good.

If makes feel better, natural selection chosen collaboration empathy evolutionarily advantageous. Old archaeological evidence healed broken femur bone one example otherwise crippled human receiving months/years care humans everyone could survive reproduce. 

Negativity bias also plays outsized role making world seem worse actually is. give up. certainly giving up. currently trying build grow social polling platform gives everyone equal voice away toxic echo chambers.

There lot good happening world instigated driven optimistic people. might aware it. far Mu freedoms tho *cries Sinovac*

I wish data go on. anyone build tips new meta? story kind suggests opposite, though. Like, even careful, get eventually. solution would never go gym bar again, seeing Covid never go away, even vaccinated people infectious - can't even take mask drinking, all, Delta able infect within seconds takes someone walk past. training N95 masks sucks. Hard. battle one another sense, it’s competition see one gets eat other’s lunch, lunch human organs. neighbor ass kicked week two he’s full moderna vaxxed. tests keep coming back negative tho pretty fucking nice. breaks used clean kitchen, prep dinner, laundry, mow grass. clock rest day actually free!

Masks work. care strains. It’s much harder infect someone already caught another strain. Story discredited It’s big nothingburger.

This *exactly* people saying Delta June… get it. work field, see see, still come refusing vaccine. nuts, honestly.  Restaurants (indoor dining), concerts (I miss them!!), unnecessary airtravel use mass transit, bars (meh, barely ever drink) avoid going grocery stores weekends except early morning. I've 2 doses Moderna second still kicked ass days. might people's response higher dose vaccine.   Vaccination sufficient Delta. measures needed manage Maybe. Delta already burning parts country. Mu get around existing antibodies, could gain traction areas think that's biggest gripe. Going irritate least requiring masks communal areas since number known/vocal anti-vaxxers office. schools starting Northeast. Doesn’t bode well estimation. worst part majority people idea even talking about. BS!!!! don’t know that. Teenagers handle Covid well. vaccine supposed prevent ending hospital supposedly. apparently time even people vaccinated get infected unless get booster shot every then. seems concern articles I'm reading. lot people assume second shot need good rest lives. FSU said something like it’s “concern right now.” take possibly could worry future.   Whenever group people called heroes, automatically assume underpaid, overworked, underappreciated. I'm annoyed saw packed football stadiums weekend yet elementary kids may still quarantine exposure school. School restricted place point. We're pretending control schools rest society going like normal.  fact US wasted (at least) 15 million doses give rats ass freaking baffling me, comparison Mexico wasted 66 thousand vaccines today that's disgrace here. even want imagine many combined US + Europe thrown out. I'm place. I'm simply repeating paying attention. put simply:

Aug 2021 worse Aug 2020 children, yes. 

August 2021 worst ever children - no, *at least according chart originally posted.* RNs know 4 year degrees (BSN) know quite few. fact hospital system won’t even hire nurses 2 year degrees.  doesn’t appear contagious Delta? strains’ given position Greek alphabet arbitrary, doesn’t necessarily mean it’s worse earlier named variant.

Thats people here. One another person gotcha answers  heartbreaking considering number children forced see parents (actually seeing all) go hospital weeks months, much less dying never coming back all. parents refuse get vaccinated. butter shot ass

You said there’s zero data you’re arguing it. ;)

Here two studies: COVID-19 cases, emergency department visits, hospital admissions increased June August 2021 among persons aged 0-17 years. Emergency department visits hospital admissions 2-week period August 2021 higher states lower population vaccination coverage lower states higher vaccination **Community vaccination, coordination testing strategies prevention measures, critical protecting pediatric populations SARS-CoV-2 infection severe Weekly COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates among children adolescents rose nearly five-fold late June–mid-August 2021, coinciding increased circulation highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant. proportions hospitalized children adolescents severe disease similar period Delta predominance. Hospitalization rates 10 times higher among unvaccinated among fully vaccinated **Preventive measures reduce transmission severe outcomes children adolescents critical, including vaccination, universal masking schools, masking persons aged ≥2 years indoor public spaces child care centers.**

And here’s prior article: **Increased transmission delta coronavirus variant coincided higher hospitalization rates among age 18, according pair studies published Centers Disease Control Prevention late June mid-August, weekly COVID-19–associated hospitalization rates among children adolescents increased nearly five-fold, according one studies examined data 14 However, ""proportions hospitalized children adolescents severe disease similar period Delta predominance,"" study said, indicating highly transmissible variant seem cause severe disease children previous ""Although seeing cases children overall cases, studies demonstrated increased disease severity children,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said press briefing Thursday.

Delta: even final form exhausting. obviously want things bad. Keep staying inside even booster offer 100% protection nothing will. Think virus computer program dedicated one purpose, ability upgrade better execute one purpose indefinitely. thing virus requires complete upgrades publish next variant time.

The fact span 6 months we've heard lambda, delta, mu speaks greater concern getting vast majority vaccinated setting mask mandates globally completed successfully. even though mu already decline well could created deadlier efficient variant gaining steam across board.

Most people think deadly strain say ebola worst thing happen, not. Highly lethal diseases like burn killing hosts fast. Whereas disease like covid overwhelmingly causes chronic issues afflicted, flies radar extended period time showing symptoms immediately. Imagine entire segment population gets winded walking stairs, permanent heart/organ damage result contracting variant. understanding (not super educated take word) vaccinated people still transmit virus levels similar unvaccinated. Though understanding that's much less likely thing happen thought read vaccine children gets approved get turning 5 year? 4 year old turning 5 May. hoping could get shot January. Maybe didn’t read hoping?!? pretty much it’ll MU, delta ultimate variant squasher seems far.

Since unlikely variant would spontaneously emerge multiple times, likely spreading naturally presence Delta.

I'm suggesting outcompete Delta, information support that, Delta going squash Mu way others, Mu probably would able spread much establish foothold. It’s big number honestly impressive. 

For example, China already vaccinated 2 billion doses (200 crores). 

India needs better. Yeah wish would allow least things like true, that’s good point Soft, make email.  Ooooh. required get meningitis booster enroll private college. Maybe that’s reason sure elementary school. Ah well. Thanks info!  Omg you’re right, someone’s bound snap Doctors nurses getting burned quitting. aren’t new students coming replace students leaving too. Kentucky places offering $30 per hour nurses still can’t get people come work. It’s worth lot them. we're technical, handful people clinical trials who'd gotten it.

Do source this? able find anything coronaviruses general capability. several mechanisms suppress body's innate immune response, tend virulent/pathogenic common rest, also question vaccinating people midst pandemic. chances virus (or vaccine matter) resequencing itself

My emphasis. even vaccine alone give us herd immunity

Yes, vaccinate enough. can't 20-30% population refusing it. Herd immunity mean 0 infections/cases, means cases, ones happen less severe, outbreaks highly localized clusters struggle proper treatment could lower significantly risk long covid lot patients

Absolutely. believe we're harm good result COVID countermeasures? Maybe. remains seen, stricter countermeasure less justified, stronger chances. We're essentially trading unknown COVID unknowns economics, psychology, sociology.

And also believe officials making decisions ""popular"" opinion rather actual science. never scientific justification outdoor dining ban prevent people leaving home all. true playgrounds parks wrapped police tape last summer. activities science would suggest safe, got stuck politicians scaring shit everyone justify meaningless policies. frankly trust politicians thought necessary decide whether leaving house ""safe enough"" justify right, especially can't bothered follow rules themselves. - one - ever give right go outside again, fines damned.

OC, said, still mixing transmissibility severity. linked study analysis found percentage COVID-19 hospitalizations resulting ICU admission remained near 20% since Delta became predominant SARS-CoV-2 variant. **A study children adolescents hospitalized COVID-19 March 2020–July 2021 found proportion patients admitted ICU pre-Delta period (March 1, 2020–June 19, 2021) Delta-predominant period (June 20–July 31, 2021) differ (26.5% 23.2%, respectively) (9). study found median length stay 3 days pre-Delta period 2 days Delta-predominant period among hospitalized patients aged 0–17 years COVID-19 (9).**

Yes, kids COVID Delta highly infectious. That's good I'm certainly saying worried that. point saying ""Delta infectious children"" ""Delta severe children"" two different things. first agree - second yet proven, I've said, evidence exists case.

Obviously, could change, now, Delta, there's reason believe case. we’re headed holiday season, vaccines going losing effectiveness time people acting way different year compared last. Wooo things going get bad. sure glad plussed hospital capabilities trillions spent didn’t give bunch grants businesses didn’t need first place. Thank sharing this, outrageous asks people country put you. 

What % people seeing covid ER vaccinated? “That potential to” evade prior immunity USA fun way journalists get clicks without actually data.

There’s almost one outside cities Nevada. majority state unoccupied.

The big issue Nevada healthcare system absolute garbage. It’s fragmented fuck, lots shitty facilities, huge doctor nurse shortages decade. anything goes wrong entire healthcare system crumbles. I’m honestly impressed it’s held long. already lot burnout medical professionals too. stepping stone, they’d get experience get fuck out, could move nearly anywhere else get paid better less work.

And liberal leaning people moving Vegas, entire state founded libertarian ideals. Even someone votes blue, ideal pretty strong. Lots lots “you can’t tell do” bullshit.

The education system Nevada also completely horrific. Completely bottom barrel. It’s improved little last 5 year, floating 47th-50th country education. amazing schools, there’s also lot 25-35 year old that’s graduated Vegas barely literate.

That's true. becomes true assume small chance infection. without vaccinating kids, elimination seem likely chance going small.

""That's hear now. Turn TV, 'Covid, Covid, Covid Covid Covid.' plane goes down, 500 people dead, talk it. 'Covid Covid Covid Covid.' way, November 4th, hear anymore"". I'll preface saying - everyone get vaccinated.

Masks least concern. I'm opposed mandates principle they're obvious path least harm. Nobody's getting arrested masks, though getting removed whatever locations noncompliance. ultimately good things I'm really concerned mask mandates go away.

Indoor (and later outdoor dining) completely banned local area vast majority last year. Real estate expensive asset/liability many businesses large chunks essentially made useless. that's businesses forced closed executive order - know is. Luckily seem newly happening, we're going dealing fallout quite while. doubt we'll return point covid would call again, many people seem think simple tool incredibly widespread (and totally understood) impact.

For companies like Google, Facebook, etc, decision WFH might private decision - also companies told to. businesses pandemic not. plenty people saying government keep things closed longer (because private businesses stay remote). Luckily happened, I'm concerned government consider it. There's also something said like businesses deciding things either, that's different argument entirely.

New York City absolutely vaccine passport requirement. Excelsior Pass may mandated (since show proof well), requirement check vaccination status there. San Francisco similar rules. Private businesses responsible enforcing rules, regardless whether want agree it. policies ones I'm concerned with.

For duration pandemic (especially we're stretching medical resources - there's flexibility emergencies like this) I'm *entirely* opposed sort thing, I'm generally future norm. I'm hopeful (but skeptical) be. I'd really like conversation avoid many problems next time face novel viral pandemic.  Can’t affect insurance though? least that’s remember people saying back people lying preexisting conditions.  true? happens mutates something makes delta variant look like mild cold? irresponsible 
I bet statistics outbreaks severely reported

As long fo one aware severity currently studied, mixing vaccines. Since they’re vaccinated, certainly check biggest (by mile) box  risk myocarditis actually much higher covid vaccine. There's also articles recently people worked lot immediately vaccine risk.

Of course, talk doctor people online, overall safer vaccine covid itself.  \*always\* fence-sitters polarised debate. can't write everyone off. every US state. Teenagers well aware viruses do, capable making informed decision getting vaccine. able charged adult murder 13 state need parental permission vaccine. reasonable person still questions that, issue effective different kinds masks means policy - cloth masks wind preventing tiny fraction spread, time ask tiny reduction worth drawbacks long term mask mandates, need strengthen mask mandates require n95/provide n95s citizens low/no cost via federal/state governments hopping Moderna would available soon mom 8 months right now. :/ long Pfizer vaccine effective ? cognitive dissonance crowd amazes me. neighbor fire fighter, wife refusing vaccine. house nextdoor COVID two members household died home within 36 hours 3-4 weeks ago.

I’m saying it’s hyperbolic suggest anything short KN95 isn’t giving anyone “fighting chance”. still meaningful protection worth wearing (and worth mandating).

Stop count! really bright lights? Actually, hard know whether crowded hospitals simply contagious people researchers adjusted age factors known affect disease severity, found Delta caused infection, overall risk hospitalized two times high.

This important research, something already know. delta contagious, likely lead severe symptoms requiring medical attention hospital. people stock photo wearing surgical masks KN95 masks.

ICYMI: G7 matter WW2 terms survival yes long term effects may plague children rest lives. Chile approved Sinovac kids 6 years old fairly divided vote, 5 voted it, 2 voted 12+ year olds 1 vote expanding eligibility. 

I know people love overreact covid kids get eligibility everywhere else fairly difficult choice, UK denying vaccines healthy 16 year olds proves even more. Sure kids still get infected, extremely rare serious covid case even rarer extremely rare vaccine side effects, case, benefits outweigh risks. One Sinovac's largest benefits shot fewest side effects btw. several days fever, chills, horrible fatigue diarrhea. are, suggest hitting /r/COVID19. I've seen asked several times before. IIRC probability definitely lower unvaccinated, know one would call ""low"". Lots people know important publicise otherwise plenty teenagers want get vaccine think can't parents say no.

I'm looking another job, anyway, fingers crossed.  per 100,000 vaxxed 100,000 unvaxxed. texas florida donate ivermectin? laboratory show ivermectin slow reproduction COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) virus ***but effects would need major doses humans.*** Medical regulators approved ivermectin COVID-19. used part well-designed studies (called randomized controlled trials) evaluating potential effects. Yet off-label use litmus test unmatched! Sounds like civilised argument! overturned?? understand, mean actually yell fire crowded building? fuck wrong Americans?

I mean... start one? personal opinion... sucks think may affecting children, society absolutely need thinking it. Even purely selfish.

Not sure millenial, imagine future millennials, retirement due collapse social security, need take care generation generation simultaneously number conditions. 

This could potentially disaster 20 years... could nothing. Either way, probably deserves consideration caution. would count people one shot? count kids? virus doesn’t care kid, afaik one shot doesn’t anything Well one said intermectin DOESNT prevent ED. Therefore must work! /s

Seriously mindset numb nuts evidence date 26 May 2021.

That 3.5 months ago. update soon, either way data points.  handful pregnant women side effects Joe didnt get 

TIL joe rogan pregnant woman. No. won’t know data submitted. Pfizer said data 11-5 maybe submitted mid September approval weeks later won’t know exact timeline it’s submitted Thank you. comment article say post says does. wish people would stop that.  *laughs family 3 fully vaccinated, teen tested positive Thursday husband mildly symptomatic awaiting results* Yes, article we're commenting without read. President Niinistö Head State, PM Marin Head Goverment Sounds like got booster without even looking it, lol. issue Delta evades current vaccines, requires higher level pre-existing antibodies fight off. That's Pfizer booster 3rd dose vaccine, update required.   Well let's get mandates place It's... medicine parisitic infections.. world would work virus based infection? Like adjusting diet get back healthy BMI ranges? No. likely submit 5-11 yo cohort first. Watch that. plan go younger ages soon after.    That's people pushing idea breakthroughs case sniffles we're inevitably going get covid deal. People want believe vaccinated that's case. agree you, need better lasting immunity get this. also need focus vaccines studies regarding long term efficacy mixing vaccines. one thing taught incompatible media scientific data process studied. ""Mights, mays believes"" get dropped definitives headline punches gets clicks. I'm saying ""all MSM liars"" said usually find truth sift around bit, wish responsible. Unfortunately, thanks politics becoming tribal core part one's identity, viewing admitting made mistake learning mistake due viewing sign weakness wisdom, people need hear hear heed it.  could.

/s Probably keep going Istanbul Constantinople. we're pragmatists realize finger pointing world stop us personally deal covid eventually. younger someone is, easier deal with. every one us going come contact covid. Hiding delays inevitable. 

Also forgot ""maintain healthy weight supplement vitamin to."" Weird personal responsibility measures forgot.....  everywhere like US; province fortunate low COVID19 numbers due location, multiple lockdowns, cautious restrictions, strong tracking tracing, border shutdowns, high adherance vaccination mask mandates.

 want point what's happening America doesnt happen elsewhere people follow health guidelines, get vaccinated get lucky live somewhere people give damn make close $100/hr right nurse (on contract) Indiana, pleasure not-TX. Fuck TX. 

Also shitload bedside nurses left profession *waves hands around.*

Fuck around, find out. know. summary laboratory show ivermectin slow reproduction COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) virus **but effects would need major doses humans**. Medical regulators approved ivermectin COVID-19. used part well-designed studies (called randomized controlled trials) evaluating potential effects. 

So far positive results test 100x recommended human dosage levels expect much. That'd nice. they're still better neighbours lower vax rates. That's lot people (at least US) lived completely different reality last year rest us. still reality, making history happened since Dec 2019. Oh right, get it. Yeah seems vaccines best keeping hospital. wonderful thing think hopeful more. Unless MU antibody resistant spreads easier Delta. BBC podcast weeks ago one researchers said need data conclusions drawn now. critical thinker conclude either direction. say work, better claim work.

Also, Oxford University currently running trial Ivermectin. Misleading headline. Quoting conclusion here:

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Authors' conclusions:

Based current low- low-certainty evidence, uncertain efficacy safety ivermectin used treat prevent COVID-19. completed studies small considered high quality. Several studies underway may produce clearer answers review updates. Overall, reliable evidence available support use ivermectin treatment prevention COVID-19 outside well-designed randomized trials.

\-----------------------------------------------------------------

Back comments -- truth 14 studies generally showed positive results Ivermectin none studies sufficient size quality considered proof. Read conclusion see he's really complaining studies, drug. yes...I reviewed 14 studies question. agree conclusions, take away message gotcha title. nothing say abuse veterinary drugs -- that's ridiculous.   rate infection unvaccinated 5x,

Do source this? woah, knew parasites viruses two separate things I'm Argentina myself, assure wishful thinking, least here. government may eager embrace vaccination, media generating lot doubt around Russian Chinese vaccines (our common vaccines along AstraZeneca's), leading lot scepticism, conspiranoia likes. Unfortunately things different front, main difference that, best understanding, Delta variant yet fully made way over. We'll see things fare does.  Might well call plumber see thinks! Thank posting really hope everyone reads it. risks vaccinated people completely blown proportion everyone freaking reason. wonder get pinned stickied something. Disinformation* case read man’s actions linked eight illnesses one death covid-19. (Vietnam ) least one part American anxiety seem become disconnected facts recent weeks: effectiveness vaccines.

I love point. irony people letting virus dominate lives vaccinated. people suck assessing risk ruled 100% emotions stemming subjective belief systems. Let’s hope trend seen highly vaccinated countries like Singapore it’s something that’s unique Nordic environment.  say ""eligible people"" right headline. heard much progress regarding intranasal vaccines. frustrating. believe ChAdOx1 one even moving human trials last heard.   understand safety profile extensively researched. speaking regards it’s use Covid 19. 

That data lacking  Kid’s high school band field trip State Fair. go back school Wednesday masks. foresee ending well. 😐 back office instant state allowed it...June 2020. Couldn’t agree more. hope there’s exodus medical personnel Texas. - far- basically non existent

Not true, concerning bit offensive, disregard them. Vaccination never meant 100% proof anything. tool. RTFA. quarantining spreading rural village lockdown directly resulted 1 death multiple others getting infected top lying travel history. getting vaccinated different issue, story.   MARCHING HAND HAAAAAND 🤦‍♂️ lot pharmacies asking you’re immunocompromised individual receive third shot.

I fully vaccinated February Pfizer. went Walgreen’s 14th receive booster. fill waiver saying receiving third shot ensure check marked box saying immunocompromised. 

Unethical? Sure. time, I’d rather shot go arm trash. covid fully vaxxed get he's feeling pretty sick? Damn, that's bad luck. Crazy see comments, title “useless” read actual article. 

Really shows narrative trying pushed. 

My point isn’t legitimize Ivermectin. would foolish use lack data scientific evidence. post disingenuous.

I really hope people set aside biases studies like this. discredits Science people find excuse discredit it. need scientists participate that. Googled it... wonder they’ll healing crystals next double counting here. Germany, France Italy G7 EU Yeah. Human dosages probably work least calibrated humans horses need dewormed.  census outdated data also account people states vaccinated there. happened whole country imbalance vaccination numbers people crossing state lines vaccinated. couple friends mine SP wedding ended vaccinated there, example. 

Expect richer states cities share load neighbors. Also reserves doctors nurses right? Every pandemic ends enough population either become immune dies, basically virus runs people infect. Vaccines exposure two ways get immunity, vaccine obviously safer. people can't take they'll get exposed. contagious delta variant is, pretty sure find unvaccinated soon enough.

Then reach certain level immunity virus fizzles new people infect. People still get infrequently enough immunity can't spread waves like now. called ""endemic"" end game.   Ehhh that’s cool, got Wargreymon fight! Can’t Mega Digimon! believe it. One coworkers got clvid last year, seems retain information well use to. 'If you’re severely disabled result vaccination certain diseases, could get one-off tax-free payment £120,000. called Vaccine Damage Payment.'  needed read right bed. couldn’t people wear damn masks mean long antivaxxers exist inevitable, I'd rather get nightmare finally end That's hilariously small sample size virus infected 220 million people worldwide. 72 people 220 million infections means study looked 0.02% infected people.

That's mentioned references studies much larger sample sizes. Read. All. The. Besides, there1 are2 quite3 few4 studies show people antibodies infected - anywhere 98% 45% (against Delta variant)

Which agrees nonseroconversion rates 5% 85% studies. Since something like 98% sequenced infections U.S. delta, 45% pretty big deal -- means 55% people infected Delta immune antibodies better antibodies

And entire point people COVID end *no* antibodies. exact % across entire population yet determined, something like 55% we'll never reach natural herd immunity. It’s cuz wouldn’t situation weren’t unvaccinated fuckbags. pandemic unvaccinated now. fight Mu-two that's case, come detected 49 U.S. states already? issue though? unvaccinated pass on, great rest world. would like ride, please it’s personal freedoms infringing on!!

/s case article written college student sports writer, credibility really existent, states MU decline since Delta spread fast Probably ready done Covid looks like it’ll gone soon (hi June) comes roaring back another round. don’t laugh cry. kids go back school week MN apparently bored Covid I’d like believe make delta life go back normal finally.  “worked” Wuhan, would think Americans might understand national government doesn’t exactly control provinces, now, given problems. state updates every day, even holidays. gradually slowed twice week July, even we’re nearing daily records still aren’t weekends  thought Lambda one developed Peru? both?   US also donated 120 million. like they're throwing out. lot logistics, like countries approved Moderna, need find taker doses expire, countries want J&amp;J, ect. majority wasted doses, however, coming already opened vials need used matter hours opened. There's way reseal ship keeping sterile. Chinese zombies don’t walk hop around actually. Delta man, Delta man, Delta man hates Lambda man. fight, Delta wins. Delta man. thousands Americans go around public without mask, pandemic over. guess think they're double vaxxed somehow can't catch and/or spread virus. So, Colombians go many places US...also reason Mu exists lack measures n actual gov Colombia  *No, MU*   ""mu"" ultimate Zen riddle? Get Zen masters post haste!  Forget Lambda, looking forward world disagreeing pronounce Iota. guess Pi look forward to. getting infected big deal. getting hospitalized. vaccine chances immune system handle fine despite infection. far it’s proven effective OG strain variants unless I’m mistaken ?  please stop calling ""the jab."" thoughts exactly Effective what?

That's question matters. probably early tell Since bs start getting peddled everywhere. absolutely intended prevent infection stop proliferation. Yes breakthroughs happen, goal certainly get low possible. work people students various medical fields. Apparently there's large amount instructors EMT nursing fields quitting avoid vaccination. yet, despite that, disease know far less contagious covid still managed make rounds. read article comment.

They worried treated akin Sudafed. Imagine needed treat cows horses.  Topkek really hard know many breakthroughs since decided track hospitalized breakthroughs. Anecdotal accounts charts though. I'm sure know anyone point know someone breakthrough infection. need real data still want mild covid many long term affects come it.

Let's get boosters. China done things right response covid course it’s sensible fast tracking vaccines kids. 1918 people commercial air travel, interstate highway system, lower starting population, lower population density, shorter commuter times urban workers, domestic manufacturing... dr gave Rx wife take hospital ass. didn’t rights practice hospital really put bind. sue attorneys fees. thing find interesting dengue hemorrhagic covid causes blood clotting.

I idea... curious. ...did actually read link see NIH page ivermectin ran it? approved FDA treatment viral  
  insufficient evidence COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel (the Panel) recommend either use ivermectin treatment COVID-19. Results adequately powered, well-designed, well-conducted clinical trials needed provide specific, evidence-based guidance role ivermectin treatment shown inhibit replication SARS-CoV-2 cell cultures.13 However, pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic studies suggest achieving plasma concentrations necessary antiviral efficacy detected vitro would require administration doses 100-fold higher approved use FDA issued warning April 2020 ivermectin intended use animals used treat COVID-19 humans. studies incomplete information significant methodological limitations, make difficult exclude common causes studies significant limitations, Panel cannot draw definitive conclusions clinical efficacy ivermectin treatment COVID-19.

So, based actually reading page, effective cell culture doses required get effect human body 100x higher approved for.

That sound much like vaccine useful. Promising, absolutely! yet. used dream one day ""rich enough"" move IE Orange County.

Not anymore. Pandemic taught two kinds stupid: (1) poor, uneducated know better (2) arrogant people means better.

Naturally, one palatable days. Well happened 100 years ago Spanish flu link: Ivermectin approved FDA treatment viral infection. “good” news delta infectious people likely Christmas.

the ""good news"" everyone could die Delta, die Delta. 

yay?  spoke pharmacist knows personal level recommending friends go Moderna route booster. Pfizer sucky state SC waiting. neurologist internal med dr said soon possible snag one one seems giving area unless fit strict category. didn’t read article (let alone study isn’t link to) also factor point behavioral differences vaccinated aren’t.

Btw, 1521 Americans died covid-19 day. week, nearly 3 times many Americans died covid-19 killed terrorists 9-11-2001.

In New Zealand they've taken covid-19 extremely seriously guess what? They've far far fewer lockdowns disruptions everyday life America.

I'm sick tired people saying ignoring global pandemic somehow going produce best results. 11 year old caught COVID school. Fortunately 5 year old, wife, tested negative symptoms manageable, however 10 days really made significant progress yet. stuffy nose, congestion, sore throat. given kid versions Tylenol, cough cold medicine, allergy medicine. also make sure drinks plenty liquids eating regularly too.

My question anything else help recovery long might least mostly better? Mu? see going Latin alphabet rapidly.

Lets use Roman Numerals next. vaccines designed produce antibodies. job pretty well 18 months virus figuring us out. It’s Mu I’m worried about, it’s highly contagious MuTwo I’m worried about. Canada, back office tomorrow full time since March 2020.

I feeling corporate sick paying office space, zero reason need return office.

Atleast ""everyone fully vaccinated Oct disciplinary actions taken"" well mask mandate.

Here Brazil learned hard way. Back 2017, state dengue vaccination campaign first vaccine approved. discovered after, bad idea. give vaccine people serological test proving already dengue. 

Or endemic areas, 70% people already got dengue (and data basically unknown, really apply much) Scanning recent comments found half written one thought deleted posting. idea got multiple upvotes. It’s even complete sentence. Provincetown didn’t necessarily prove vaccinated people spread virus. think need human challenge trials this.

“signaling either weakening strain indicating worrisome future.” Agreed. I'd like joining gym feel safe there, aerosols. Seems like parents made binary decision already. frustrates many people appear making risk calculation lame worthless things. took kid Disney safe made decision experience worth year home, calculated choice. going make choice go Golden Corral? Idk man, doesn’t seem worth it.

But someone says well Golden Corral stay business? say that’s job consumer don’t think it’s good value judgement part.  link posted shows NIH currently wanna say one way other. really sure goal there. whole medical community right now, essentially, ""Nothing far proven Ivermectin effective, know people trying self dose getting hurt, please stop taking it."" 3 courses rabies shot recently. fine damaging wallet. cheap! Nope, says gym pretty empty went, wore time there. Regardless, can’t say wasn’t there, that’s said thought must either gym bar.

Yeah, blame fruits. I'm pulling Omicron variant. I'm going get Covid again, want able say, ""I got Omicron!"" cool. end saying, ""I got Mu!"" I'll never live down. Seems second youngest overall. Sebastian Kurz Austria younger. couple studies numbers make bit nervous, though.  one seriously looked data said Delta.

The relative prevalence Mu decreasing globally areas originated (South America). simply spreading lot less Delta is. Whether Mu less infectious Delta vaccines work better it, hard say. Probably bit both.  found interesting, quite reassuring “The asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic spread could happen, haven’t seen among vaccinated people frequency.” really looks like it! don’t think read genetic hallmarks able escape previous immunity   I’m thinking continuous production new variants leads wave wave global covid infections. individual variant low mortality leaves another portion populace long covid preexisting condition making susceptible next round.

if viruses constantly evolve would basically go extinct soon population went developed immunity. viruses come go waves, population develops immunity wave subsides different variant virus comes back cycle repeats Mu already declining parts world.  Pretty sure lack fully vaccinated people long gap 2 doses AstraZeneca. 

2nd doses picked drastically city almost 100% population got first dose. anti-vaxxers unavoidable, unnecessary problem, unfortunate reality almost 8 billion humans planet never going able vaccinate everyone time avoid variants, even 100% population wanted vaccine children could it, currently cannot

remember delta arose India. even US country fully eradicated COVID variants would inevitably reintroduced rest world anyway. COVID, especially variants, contagious keep country permanent hermit kingdom style closed borders, even we're seeing island nations successfully kept alpha getting compromised delta soon. got mine bc I’m medical field. Annnnnnddd mention T-cell immunity.
So worry it. media done people lol… even doctors think that’s extreme. society could get large enough number people participate behaving properly, wouldn’t even matter rest did. too! funny, I've seeing Cochrane analysis pop everywhere since July, always see posted headline.

The difference is, every time see posted people actually read abstract see says, come comments copy/paste it.

I to, got terribly interesting conversation individual studies.

Every time someone links article says debunks ivermectin, almost every time there's paragraph article talks positive signal needs research.

Unfortunately we're bizzaro world right people would tolerate vaccine well, want ivermectin cause misinfo peer pressure. 

Like data still coming ivermectin, data vaccine works blunt severity virus provide strong prophylaxis. covid rampant India restrictions Sweden? sure got mean. think depends % fully vaccinated, know go logic make sense me. Nobody burnt purpose. felt like end pandemic, cases low. cases back up, work new information. CDC isn’t playing around shits giggles, even back predicted fall surge back mandates.

Right now, mandates protect children immunocompromised, anti Vaxxers. kids get vaccine, lot parents like get life back normal Damn read herpes lol amazing see people literally see hospitals full go.....nope good. 

I really need logic one laid out. bud light victory fridges People actually taking horse dewormer. people idiots. There’s goddamn vaccine. Coming Sheffield Lake (suburb Cleveland) couldnt hit anymore spot Apparently need move Portugal. seem like actually care one another! 👍🏽❤🙏🏽 wish could...😔  Sure, that’s makes game instead history, there’s conclusion. can’t natural conclusion pattern branching. paradigm describe, long hosting companies, banks, social media companies agree someone needs disappear face earth, arrange that. that's bad Also trying jump shit range 5-85% fucking wild. What’s numbers? first instinct seeing can’t really draw meaningful conclusions whether seroconversion occurring not. 2021: explain biological virus using computer virus analogy  Hmm yeah (by relative population) worse Australia even hit 70% first dose country yet. This. thought need make September, clear date, kids bound catch :( ""it may be..."" headline ""let's make headline click baity"".

So let's read article see explains virus changed avoid T-cell immunity.... dreamed moment. fully vaccinated I'm bit afraid, interesting see people behave this, Stockholm bars/restaurants (let alone clubs) packed hell pandemic. nearly two years can't imagine coming back importantly think personally I'd afraid there. Mountain Goat Dew Sure, everyone's different. threads tend get dominated 'they let everyone work home' voices. work people found out. jobs - techs engineers tried taking equipment home last year. ok like month, eventually needed real workbenches lab space. Management tell come back, made sense.

I figure lot employers designate positions WFH, hybrid, site on, people choose accordingly. COVID killed cops line duty causes combined 2020.  Fucking vegans...

/s (for sensitive folks) I'm mistaken, mu competes delta, variant COVID Classic. It'll worrying get variant delta, we're probably headed for. mandatory pfizer vaccine (fully approved) 12 older could mandated today state wished. thats grades 7-12 6th graders. half k-12. brainer, isn’t politics lack self-motivation required remote work.

As I've posted below, quality life amount work get done increased working home. 

I'm curious statement can't relate. elaborate more? thought someone lacks motivation, going lack office well. accountability? need micromanagers making sure working? sound like great employee. Perhaps motivation chatting coworkers get energy up? sounds like extroverts. actually tell self-motivation work hiring them? could possibly call ""no new normal"" hate group?  guess, I’d imagine they’re concerned would show it’s concentrated Republican dominant counties thus exposing effectiveness vaccine. turned martyrs point. sucks go them. Look, comments making historical comparisons keep getting removed. ""just following orders"" ""everyone else it"" really justifications. never been. Anyone access Fox access NBC, ABC, CBS. Anyone access internet access anything. They're helplessly shoveled full misinformation. choosing seek preferring facts. reasons this, yes, reasons remove culpability. Every drug works interacting part biological machinery. drugs interact many completely separate biological processes (which basically every drug extensive list possible side effects). 

I sure Ivermectin particular studied / hyped up, completely possible antiparasitic drug also effective virus - like one drug might beneficial effect designed for, range side effects intended. young people want get lives back track, age group wanted vaccines most, even crashing government websites.  Disney mandated vaccines October 22nd. feel like majority people live work Disney capacity Yeah, sound scary, get many clicks.  accidentally deplatform someone turns idiot find listening taking person seriously whole time Masks absolutely prevent spread covid combatting obesity. There's question that. YNWA ship Guantanamo travel you’re vaccinated. articles want keep spreading fear. virus widespread you’re safer home traveling &amp; (Delta specifically) probably never go away. won’t let life revolve around anti virus/vaxxed people. fuck wrong Americans?

A propaganda machine working overtime worst interest Americans (possibly/probably foreign control) largely ignorant uneducated population believe anything they're told said propaganda machine. he’s early 50s high blood pressure believe. luckily second go around seems lot less severe probably thanks vaccine well antibody treatments xs  Hey, see Castle lit Christmas lights?

I symptoms. feel fine. vaccinated J&amp;J, although keep reading around J&amp;J shot great first place. 

So I'm either dodging several bullets right now. J&amp;J vaccine better people saying. maybe superhuman immunity COVID. How's Bolsanaro's hiccups? Portugal's anti-vaxx community pretty minimal, legitimately get ridiculed vaccines.

Even skeptical people get vaccinated, despite unsure long-term side-effects. 

When vaccinations opened teens, registration websites actually went much traffic. bring going raw risk factors, obesity children would far away lead ""how protect children sever covid"" conversation. requires accountability, something people especially politicians avoid. 

So instead focus also-rans like vaccines exist yet masks......finger pointing  Hell kids listening TMBG every day Disney JR! Librarian, came back last July open public ever since. Thankfully I'm CT scary (also whole staff vaxxed) still wild ride dealing public. Overall, reliable evidence available support use ivermectin treatment prevention COVID-19 outside well-designed randomized trials.

To clear, author thinks viable treatment COVID. Mind ask age he's especially vulnerable (autoimmune disorder)? terrifying. definitely liquid oxygen, that's diverted hospitals debating conspiracy theorists facts

this dumb thing think. theories conspiracies world? live SW visit Northern times year. scared everyone - vaccinated health issues accidents. gets priority? It’s sick think think — live get care based vaccine status? Brb. Buying big gulp now. Prolly get tested it’s negative go Thank goodness someone else read past damn headline. People need calm sides thing.

Go get fucking vaxxed, Ivermectin alternative. also don’t ignore potential treatment- study properly save fucking lives.

You want pick sides come support Liverpool football club me.

P.S. Let's see long comment survives. Reddit mods deleting comments even citing research papers much confidence. wanna get parents let me, idk do, im Iowa im 16  freedom, private companies decide uses platform, guaranteed right use everyone else's property

but that's silly tired thing say. would complaining together reddit decided take subreddit related psilocybin people's safety something that's dumb issue simple Seems like best way figure vote for...whoever bashing late...

Personally, also appreciate house that's made wood, wiping ass, deck, fence, floors, cabinets, tables, chairs.... etc, etc.

Anyways... appreciate risk. time start recognizing people truly essential never thanked.

I would love educated missing something too. think shifting burdens proof.

An inconclusive result change default presumption. claiming invermectin effective establish claim first ""useless"" tag removed it.

For example, proponents Santeria, ritualistic witchcraft get claim magical chant cure COVID rely fact studies exist *dis*proving effectiveness ritual. default position chant useless. aunt, always votes republican line, reaction shared (because nothing complaining nobody look medication hatred Trump):

""They know that."" vaccines history vaccines worked though... 100% effective vaccine.  mean, specifically said TINY tunes. guess MIGHT giants certain perspective, show they're children. Definitely giants. seen interview howard stern? disliked well, opinion changed interview Thanks.  mental state quality life gone since working home. control environment people barging loudly talking outside cubicle. Plus there's stressful commute. 

I'm surprised people problems much control environment home. work management sit workspace looks like.

I'm little afraid going back realizing much less able focus feeling exhausted end day. go back, may look somewhere else offers remote work permanently. look comments wondering would find someone actually read study. pretty clear know works not. do, might cure, might make things worse. one knows. Nay that's sure. problem United States isn’t old people though. It’s young people refusing get vaccinated.

How Portugal managed convince young people get shot important takeaway this. Friday largest RCT completed date published peer review (N=476). abstract published previously. 

“Conclusion Relevance Among adults mild COVID-19, 5-day course ivermectin, compared placebo, significantly improve time resolution symptoms. findings support use ivermectin treatment mild COVID-19, although larger trials may needed understand effects ivermectin clinically relevant  Wow, except person asking question ONE wearing mask room. wish surprised. Absolutely insane. people nuts.   study referencing specifically focused delta variant. Vaccines actually *significantly effective* ancestral strain variants incorrect say “you likely won’t get Covid getting natural infection”.

And worse claim, significant breakthrough groups, also found far effective immunity combination natural *and* vaccination single dose. One could guess political mindset right? point think union fold vaccine FDA approved require vaccinations. officers walk, giving nice benefit packages retirement well overtime money. think city call bluff hold hiring fair offering on-site civil service exams. one delaying biospy, that's valid concern. However, worried diagnosed tumor next months need biospy on, catastrophizing. think Chile right now. Check out. says bottom article. Denmark high vaccination rate currently 76%. Well, Abbott get paralyzed large branch fell him, brain damage possible. (fully vaccinated) living life it’s fullest point since last dose. Yes breakthrough infections happen, I’m much willing risk mild case shutting vaccine  go hospital? ICU? taking space hospital capacity? thing, EVERYONE get covids, vaccinated, tiny percentage even show symptoms. So, would post this? I'm not. I'm saying banning subreddits works reducing speech subs spread. banned porn subs, reduce spread porn. That's necessarily moral judgement though. I'm trying find travel information come US I've able find US citizens go Oh gee.. would refer medicine horse it, statement human consumption horse medicine?..

Ivermectin prescribed differently humans, people overdosing experiencing sorts (real) side-effects taking animal dewormer.  feel like we’re going circles. Delta might pass soon people freak another variant? Media making Mu dangerous it’s literally concern 😐 I'd terrified shit lived since liver disease, prone bunch life threatening things especially bleeding death u cannot clot easily.

Everytime hear news hospitals overwhelmed I'm reminded last yr December internal bleeding, covid still going strong husband took ER go alone, wait long bed trying close eyes..
Luckily got bed eventually get transfusions, waiting bed room risks day 2 long pulled thru, considered risk anymore another day 2 regular room.

It awful hold ER bed 2 full days didnt need anymore someone else needed extra days, scary I'm sitting lobby trying die was

It's explained much idiots take vaccine still mind boggles me. Especially ppl rather take untested horse dewormer fkin tested vaccine pretty exciting read considering March 2020 fully vaccinated Moderna April 2021. Pretty small sample size though… Goddammit I’m going google lol 😬 I, too, hope one day sadness disappear scientists figure turn unicorn farts clean energy. We’ll natural selection general miserable Impressive af tbh someone vaccinated got delta, I’m hoping it’s true reverse.  Seems fitting Portuguese left Portugal. know others talk  fact checking debunking overrated mostly thing independent source. one things makes obvious former CEO current chairman board Reuters currently board Pfizer. people made move Reuters executive Pfizer executive mid 2020 blatantly conflict interest feels like insult. one easiest things world rich people subvert independent fact checkers.

if saying protestors dominant paradigm time 1960s would've posted reddit, fully agree. protesters allowed post reddit, majority fellow citizens would've agreed interest ""keeping peace."" would've dumb. republican white house 60s, protestors would've extra fucked area, parents vocal anti-mask school.

I think wanting told parent kids, even good everyone else. They're insecure parenting skills. video German, English subtitles explaines recent scientific publication cancer discovery: understand, really sick? hospital? not...vaccines work. defanged virus. someone ask could breath respirator mask. said breathe much easier times recovering pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, chemical exposure inflammation. imagine going Covid would easier that. anything say that. Oh great.
Here bloody go again!

This Australia calling; wake us Zeta’s finished ravaging lands.   33% Americans Americans can't nice things. Unfortunately, Australia still beginning first wave, rates right probably pretty low compared weeks / months. makes hard meaningfully compare countries virus almost endemic stage.

That mean Australia doomed though - keep pace vaccinations stay ahead virus, hopefully true catastrophe, certainty things get worse right now.   hear lamda! Denmark children 15 years older decide body. Nah. pay anything all. work public school, working person part, live apartment three roommates contracted virus point. ever tested positive different tests done weekly basis. vaccinated Moderna. time felt sick since beginning pandemic 48 hours receiving doses vaccine. 

I also exercise gym person wearing mask. awesome ventilation. bit nervous heading back building hoping receive booster soon.

I telling since jump extremely lucky. Moderna king right now. far know 82% adult population 1 dose 72% 2 doses, something like this. I’m healthcare setting. place work requires negative test 14 days exposure symptoms negative test 14 days fever get symptoms. case wasnt office work missed, little non-work social interactions came day. co-workers, either. chatting barista pro wrestling, librarians books checked out, like. kept part time supermarket job still micro-interactions key part keeping social/emotional energy check Basically, doctor said, yeah, vaccine might still get COVID, instead say: severe case point lungs permanently scarred/damaged, and/or end vent worse - instead case like mention, might lose sense smell week, feel kind gross.

He mentioned vaccinated patient sorts underlying conditions (diabetes, obesity, old age) recently case similar bad cold, said without vaccine could've easily killed least landed ER oxygen. data collected vaccinated folks getting sick vaccines seem work better? Obviously vaccinated plus I'm curious. got moderna father got JJ ended getting sick covid (not hospital sick damn near sickest would want actually considering going hospital) think got it?  pay copay sort deductible? honest nearly liberal democracies issue. South American otoh kicking butt. live farm. use ivermectin control worms horses, goats, cattle. earth would anyone think it’s useful Covid-19 virus? It’s level drinking bleach, many stupid people doesn’t surprise all. got vaccine, feel fine. cheering? distinction - animal version vs. human - needs bold ! tired explaining difference ppl. 33% citizens showing regressive preferences seems ongoing theme US. Probably. young healthy odds getting covid low. bad case covid really low. Death almost unheard young, healthy vaccinated.

That said - something movie theaters turn off. main way covid spreads inside unmasked people long period time. restaurants, people tend shuffle might lot people - overlap time people little. movie theater - could hanging maskless people 3+ hours, inside.

I've done lot stuff, including traveling FL peak goto parks (booked lowest case point wasnt going toss $3k+) yet gone back theater.

I feel best thing REALLY want theater experience movies, wait week two release go weekday - ideally day show - might people inside. Outside covid also makes movies lot enjoyable anyways.

HÀ NỘI — Prime Minister Phạm Minh Chính Tuesday asked defence ministry 10 northern localities prepared provide support Hà Nội's COVID-19 prevention control efforts.

In response proposal allow people two jabs COVID-19 vaccine travel work like normal, minister health Nguyễn Thanh Long said ministry studying pilot project southern localities. 
 
However, still implemented compliance social distancing regulations, said, emphasising fully vaccinated still infected SARS-CoV-2 virus pass others. 
 
Deputy Minister Health Nguyễn Trường Sơn said fully vaccinated, even infected COVID-19, would milder symptoms lower rate becoming seriously ill. 
 
The death rate among people two doses COVID-19 vaccine would also lower among vaccinated given one jab. 
 
However, person received two injections could still infected SARS-CoV-2 could still infect others. ""The injections mean free travel follow recommendations pandemic prevention control themselves, families community"", Sơn said. 
 
Đặng Quang Tấn, Director Department Preventive Medicine, Ministry Health, added Ministry Health currently guidelines reducing quarantine period people entering country received full doses COVID-19 vaccine tested negative SARS-CoV-2. 
 
“Particularly received two doses COVID-19 vaccine country, due complicated pandemic situation, mean risk getting virus. Therefore, people negligent still need comply regulations pandemic prevention control, well comply 5K message,” Tấn said. 
 
In fact, number countries high rate COVID-19 vaccine coverage opened borders, opening, number cases increased daily. Therefore, countries have, again, tightened pandemic prevention measures extended social distancing periods. 
 
Regarding supply vaccines, Minister Long said expected end 2021, Việt Nam would 90 million doses COVID-19 vaccine. particular, larger amounts vaccines originally expected would arrive September (more 20 million doses). 
 
In immediate future, Ministry Health requires five localities, including HCM City, Hà Nội, Bình Dương, Long Đồng Nai complete first dose COVID-19 vaccine residents September 15. 
 
Regarding vaccines children, Ministry Health actively worked supply companies specific injection schedule.

Oddly enough, hospitalizations never stop. What’s vaccination rate Sweden? Places like Canada agave shown even 80% level, delta contagious enough wreak havoc unvaccinated fast enough hospitals verge overwhelmed lost friend coronavirus earlier. Im really saddened one nicest people ever met college.

May ask, developing cure virus? Vaccine mandate mandatory masks worked great wife's school. teachers also blasting hepa filters rooms well. Kids catching covid outside school (Why going Florida right now, people?!)... far spread classmates. wife's classroom first case bit two weeks ago everyone waited ""close contact"" peers catch it. Negative tests around. way every classroom far.   short... live Texas guess Abbott Desantis think playing long con convert new supporters replace people stupidity killed blaming Biden instead taking personal responsibility. Seems brand them. I’ve back since June Quick question informed. one vaccinated, gets breakthrough infection Delta, ones susceptibility variant one recovers infection? true. I'm CA, valley mask mandates went back starting past Saturday. county sheriff one take serious though since beginning pandemic. thought “meh yeah I’m ok this” conservative tbh stop consuming news frequently. traumatizes mindset.

I really need follow advice lol still telecommute flexibility employer gave 2020-2021 gone. schedule flexibility could request inbound customer phone calls day remote learning kids. vaccines came said kids need back school child care. Delta kids 12 changed minds. can't manage job (insurance liability claims adjuster) remote learning learning two special needs kids work giving flexibility school. really options right now. ""2 3 parents believe masks mandatory operating rooms"" Everything said seems like happened local school district. They've opened 3 weeks, mask mandates, virus quickly started burning schools, reports started come students/their parents hospitalized, people started get concerned, usual ""kids affected"" narrative quieted considerably. saw picture 4th grader's class Friday 75% masks, school started 1 2 students class wore mask. conservative response lol anxiety stems fact hospitals full “elective” procedures canceled (idk need tumor biopsy don’t want shit delayed) non-Covid related care compromised. article seems claim vaccine efficacy infection 90% July late August Seattle area. basing 90% 0.9 vaccinated vs 9 unvaccinated risk per 10k line. know methodology data looked numerous recent studies, including one CDC MMWR, show much lower efficacy Delta. \~66%. ""actual"" number closer 2.7 consider numbers?  try francesinhas bacalhau? Perhaps bifanas ou sardinhas? Shhhhh, please.

I'm trying best deny possibility.  Yes, antibodies natural infection different antibodies vaccine tests tell difference. immediate threat US long people continue moving current trends vaccinations upwards.

So we’re fucked? There’s evidence become less lethal. generally happens diseases spread effectively host alive, one spreads fine host mild symptoms. There’s evolutionary reason get less lethal, it’s possible getting covid couple times immune systems get better handling it, guarantees either. didn’t delete comments

I never said anything anti vaccine. point survivors anti bodies - strong vaccine surviving covid still immunity present 

Not fault guys can’t read make assumptions instead Florida gonna Florida. US, don’t mandatory vacation requirements. 1) ""immunity"" means strong likelihood dying re-infection.  Vaccinated people antibodies still spread it.

2) Kids 12 vaccinated born time.

Except me, is. Apparently I'm superhuman. I'll fighting zombies next year. Except livestock Icon study showed endgame (no matter level destruction), cases eventually decline , they'll say 'See! lockdowns masks nothing '. That's main objective. I've meaning visit Northern Idaho. That, plus farther north Canadian Rockies. beautiful county, think I'll wait stop killing other. endemic already. However, mutates going slowly become less lethal... individual mutation, statistically overall.  Vaccine variants developed protect given year's variants COVID, like flu vaccines take now.

It take rest life unless die 2-3 years.  We'll year half everyone would/could get vaccinated obey containment measures.  Twice people don't. study showed otherwise, needs study r/noshitsherlock 

I'm sure people fine upstanding members community keep walk around anywhere unmasked infecting anyone, deliberately otherwise.


# SARCASM long typically take one's sense smell return? caught COVID almost 2 weeks ago still little sense smell (and somewhat distorted sense taste).

I don’t want cast active dispersion vaccines least Pfizer’s sequence took knew worked put spike protein middle, didn’t time throughly study different optimizations UTRs. think picked design said ok phase 1 trials.

Minority yes, unevenly distributed (ie issue using averages). plenty counties 50%. Plenty 25%. That's Delta ""kick starts"" infection huge (relative) number copies itself. 

Technically, single virus copy infect person although that's likely diseases.  replicates itself, generating hundreds copies generate hundreds each, on.  smaller initial infection, time patient symptoms develop slower symptoms come on.

Delta infects gigantic number particles expelled upper respiratory tract people infected, instead starting e.g. 10 virus copies, start ~2000.  means everything happens faster, variant infectious increased viral load air. Sweet, I'm superhuman! Still want goat Coke though. 


Super immunity! Put unvaccinated ones parking lot. I'm sure they'll appreciate edginess. article seems like already gave ivermectin, second judgment kind late. So... pandemic unvaccinated then?

I also young children cannot vaccinated. catch it, change fact people unvaccinated driving pandemic. people choice actively put risk people charge. Many hospitals downgrade someone make room another person obtained ICU bed.

Triage often dictates gets access next *free* bed.

I reference Texan veteran gall bladder killed him, (I think Tenassean) doctor call personal favours find ICU bed car accident patient severe head trauma, succeeded ICU bed *just* freed due patient dying.

So... agree doctors *should* turfing patients make room others appropriate, also see happening desperate parent trying take matters hands.  Explain getting idea. Yea immune system could catch it, goes anything. Vaccines prepare body subset variants detected via modeling. post said give antibodies mu. antibodies mu, body prepared it. antibodies nothing. case, vaccine provide protection variant sorry, you’re advocating culling (to you) undesirable herd? sounds pretty eugenicist. Especially note people coerced positions f*ke n*ws. Instead wanting vulnerable people exploited get killed deadlier variant, advocating better healthcare accessible, education good quality, on. canceled trip see friend TX hospitals overwhelmed. vaccinated planned hang house together, even go anywhere, thought even getting car accident way hospital beds open due Covid-19 surge made reconsider.  Yup.... farmland. hope know that's minority here. covid infection followed two mrna vacs 2 months apart? mean 12 states addition NY CT?? Schools: administration going file lawsuits districts requiring masks civil rights grounds.

Federal workers: administration going eliminate rule lets federal workers get tested instead getting vaccinated, set hard deadline agencies come compliance.

Private companies: administration going encourage private companies require employees vaccinated deadline. I'm almost 5 months post vax, anything indoors unmasked boosters available. outdoor dining, though go late mornings afternoons crowds. I'm planning trip beach, oceanfront ventilated suite avoiding crowds. 

Covid still mess pretty bad even vaccinated, makes sense try minimize risk. still ton stuff even maintaining measure safety. may sound obvious, hinges adults, top levels administration individual parents.

My kids' school district remote-only March 2020 Fall 2020. Everybody, including kids district, hated it. summer, administration put together really robust set COVID protocols sent parents described ""treatise"" - 100+ page PDF included references studies best ventilation practices, reasonable desk distances, hallway traffic movement, daily symptom &amp; temperature reporting system (with random in-class checks well), and, course, full-time masking. really think clear health kids top priority.

But importantly, *parents* bought in. informal survey parents knew talked to, heard maybe one two parents complain strict protocols place, overwhelming majority instead expressing gratitude kids could go back school time many districts still remote-only. sense got kids school ultimate goal, collective responsibility make happen. Also, degree work thoughtfulness administration exhibited created sense trust parents.

From Fall 2020 winter break 2020, district 1/2 day in-school, 1/2 day school, lunch taking place home. Starting January 2021, went full-time in-school looked back.

The results? outbreaks traced back school. IIRC, every positive case detected last year traced back non-school sources (family attending wedding, vacation, etc.). course, can't say certainty *no* cases spread school. overall, think say protocols worked.

It *can* done. Kids *can* safely attend school midst airborne pandemic. everybody buy in, realize many parts country getting level cooperation simply impossible. that's tragic. Rednecks going take it. Might well give away. I’m making accusations but, unless provided proof, anyone say they’re vaccinated. Sadly frustratingly, even California know ppl admit lying vax status. don’t provide proof besides word, say Vaxxed. something consider. Pay-walls suck variants like Delta, reinfection quite possible viral load people develop respiratory tract.

Delta sort like fire hose spraying viral copies compared large syringe spraying virus (the alpha variant).  infects many copies itself, Delta gets ""head start"" infecting rest body.

If person vaccinated, likely get serious case COVID immune system destroy virus. happen instantly, though, they'll get short term infection. COVID works, means vaccinated people get temporarily infected spread virus while, body kills off.

If spread another vaccinated person, thing again. spread unvaccinated person, then....  Serious question: Employee forced take risk inconvenience Employee B's problems? know. like watching freight train hit someone, backing again. problem older relatives there.   country one time single hospital announced would vaccinating anyone 18+ lack demand (While normal range time 30+)

Needless say, around 10,000 young people showed one hour line shot. Thanks much reply! sent back land, find airline brave enought fly 

NZ AU borders closed years, luckey might allow international travel 2023, likely later. 

Who want go would initiate lockdown find ONE caese.  5 years murder? Seems bit light  Guess Rupert Murdoch needs gain market share there. Personally find example AZ vaccine pretty reassuring. rare side effect identified quickly action taken. side effects Pfizer even rare I’m confident identified appropriate data. becomes harder harder co convince ever growing vocal minority children subjected another year this. really millions kids going developmentally behind peers, really winning situation here. Either continue using precautions worry stunting cognitive development, risk children getting sick/bringing sicknesses back family. Portugal problems outbreaks earlier 2029 vaccination available? believe something like 990K recovered, almost 10% population. add people antibodies, also help. Apple test next iPhone Portugal.
With 5G chips, cell service phenomenal. fair though, people looking way relate statistics everyday life. However, large, statistics far abstract that. expect plenty people would happy believe statistic X number dinner parties 10 fewer people ended transmitting covid. sort information available. think much case hyperfocus people simply grasping straws have. humanity needs. Brains function less efficiently. There's decent chance Pfizer shot would provided more/longer protection longer initial interval. pretty much known 3-4 weeks first two shots basically bare minimum, probably best option speed testing rollout, still working initial slower Covid variants, would probably still providing sterilizing least mostly asymptomatic coverage. Delta fast outraces B cells spinning antibodies. me, natural antibodies better man-made antibodies.""

Ugh decimal system

It's pretty easy. 

1 crore = 10,000,000 = 10 million 

1 lakh = 100,000 = 100 thousand

1 million = 10,00,000 = 10 lakhs. 

Even get confused rearrange decimals head get answer. traveled Coeur d’Alene less month ago. (We didn’t go inside anywhere, wore masks outside). honestly don’t remember seeing single mask anyone outside family town.

At one point daughter’s mask got super wet lake trouble it, hopped shops buy one.

So yeah, surprised.  wonder I’m type 1 diabetic, immune system strong wants kill cells actually need, might fall category. worries, Iowa next. Governor's office - crickets. CDC tracking breakthroughs, various counties still are.

Also, article cites research states vaccinated persons 1/5th chance infection unvaccinated persons (and that's also analogous county's data), would hard estimate total number breakthrough infections based number cases vaccination rate population.

In fact, numbers could estimate total number breakthrough cases equal following:

(Vaccination Rate \* Total Cases) / (5 - 4 \* Vaccination Rate)

For example, population 6,000 cases 50% vaccination rate would 1,000 breakthrough infections 5,000 unvaccinated infections. population 2,250 cases 80% vaccination rate also 1,000 breakthrough infections. population 21,0000 cases 20% vaccination rate also 1,000 breakthrough infections.

Now, estimation require general assumption vaccination rate homogenous, cannot assume US whole, it'll help looking municipality. I’m fully vaxxed April 15 I’m getting booster weeks. Planning October 1st cause weekend recover two weeks set wedding 17th dont even wanna risk going pretty much to.

It insane say ‘this rock found proven useless covid’. waste time. 

Go away. sounds like pretty terrible/hopeless odds me!

Wait till hear guy bulletproof vest, still died. Hiroshima. Poor man. Bulletproof vest 70% population immunity going wave (per study Texas) 2-5% catching week high-case areas (a likely number achieve hospital saturation), cannot go many weeks.

But parts country completely suppressed surge, though areas may higher 70% large spring waves last year higher vaccination rates. Fwiw, it’s really 25% population unwilling prevent spread get vaccinated. Almost 75% 18+ US vaccinated  fetus mask mandate would acceptable.   beyond petty mad power...they'll use deaths propoganda attack Biden's presidency democrats general. US needs sending hundreds millions, thousands, doses overseas. right thing morally also way address risk worse strain developing elsewhere, exactly happened Delta. say wasn't.  depends what, original strain, conserved new strain. since ""receptors signaling"" class, think also external feature, too, since that's part virus exposed floating antibodies.

One reasons H1N1 horrible believed (not experts, though) external parts virus came bird flu, internal parts made super infectious came normal human flu time. pig caught both, suddenly genes allowed virus replicate humans, outer surface avian flu human immune systems never seen before, allowing unchecked spread.

With COVID, reason much emphasis placed antibodies spike protein, spike protein believed required virus enter human cell infect it. virus mutates different spike protein antibodies longer recognize, likely also able easily infect human cell. likely spike protein genes conserved strains. y’all wearing masks chance? curious. lot breakthrough anxiety. Thanks!  hate living state. makes sense. I’m USA, bigger event mask requirements, vaccine requirements, negative test requirements.

The vaccinated, getting sick, showing symptoms getting unvaxxed sick

How things worked vaccines unvaccinated, getting sick, showing symptoms getting unvaxxed sick

Plus ample evidence vaccines dramatically reduce infection spread. elderly people get sick enough spread little, mean they're spreading vaccinated. absolutely 0 legs theory.

The closest could get agreeing theory would ""We removed mask mandates prematurely vaccines 100% effective"". Except that, general, people vaccinated favor masking. unvaccinated pushing remove mask mandates die quickly effectively. power em. Oooof. felt bad dog, I’m sure could tell scaring way understand. quarantine thing issue dogs vaccinated dad’s farm, different state live different requirements. nasty phone calls paperwork vet visits, added stress. 

The skunk itself: woke family member screaming something skunk. past I’ve lived houses nearby skunk families, usually want cat food see run away. wasn’t bothered, shoo’ed away picked dog food bowls remove temptation. went outside fifteen minutes later, damned fucking thing come back hiding pounce position tires car. saw me, ran bit foot twice, back ran back bit foot twice more. think screaming scared away, got dressed told family member needed go ER*now*. remember clutching broom car, carried hit case ran again. called animal control emailed neighborhood way hospital. 

The animal control officer said went around neighbors, looking skunk sightings. doubled back house, found damned thing outside **my** door, trying get bite *again*. fucker wanted me, family members neighbors dogs… wanted kill **me**. felt like horror movie villain whose killed already die. 

At least, even still scary feeling still knew incredibly funny story. didn’t come fake small talk months!  Respect you!   Yes take away wealth, regardless gonna end queuing A&amp;E hours. Disagree. FDA achieved right balance safety public health. First, wrong start assumption data Israel hold here. vaccine, major differences biology. Second, *did* start seeing data replicated here, little behind expected relative pace vaccination programs. Given went full Phase 1/2/3 trials postmarket data, vaccine safety unquestionable. 

They moved first confirmation following Israel's path. wait starts become disaster. they're dragging feet much waiting evidence ought required. July vaccine effectiveness hospitalization 80% seniors study giving highest numbers. Waiting months came unjustified.

Biden right hold feet fire, bring 5-6 months. 8 seniors absurd. kinda suspect FDA considering nonmedical factors including adhering 2 month moratorium (we're starting right ends) interrupting planned exports developing world. think reach 90% without changing minds. bigger problem apathy; especially among young, lowest vaccination rate, lowest death rate. 

In countries particularly high vaccination rates, serious carrots sticks get people vax. Here, life essentially returned normal, young people really incentive ""life returning normal"" take time deal getting shot dealing side effects. Yet ""leader"" opposed masks spends time trying prevent anyone mitigating spread. Shame Abbott. clearly don’t Republicans… dont think need worry much happening, seems pretty control right now, even week schools went back. Seems weathered storm Same.

In short, yes.  rate Ireland impressive. Ireland leading among countries speak language America, done best countering firehose antivax misinformation emanating there. rate low, likely part due restrictions. 

It's like saying ""I'm dry despite rain, therefore need umbrella anymore since I'm dry.""  frequent boosters? live NJ. Jersey city good vaccination rate. even hour away, areas filled antivaxxers. Hell, hate Jersey city sub (literally almost gentrifiers complain loud noises night think city “scary”) little shocked many people vaccine mandates. Someone literally said “I research chose get it” - I’m sorry, didn’t know doctor that’s closely watched development vaccine. find entirely shocking awful. I'm high school teacher Los Angeles entire district 650K students 8K adults, total 1,659 infections one ""school cluster"" 6 students infected. benchmark tests beginning year showed 3k students positive school started allowed start showed negative test result. mask test everyone weekly. hard. I’ve known people done so. They’re terrified Delta waiting around. updated hour, state Michigan 2.12% death rate. many states similar rates. give ideas.

Oh, wait, do.  gonna force vaccines boosters yearly basis. reason vaccines work first place healthy amount population vaccinated, allowing common variants allowed spread targeted vaccines. Flu vaccines working reliant segment population vaccinated. Otherwise vaccines quickly nothing vaccine resistant strains full reign spread everywhere.

Forcing everyone vaccines result less vaccine protection. more. dad brother it, experiencing mild cold-like symptoms since they’re fully vaccinated. vaccines work! It’s going take long time asses data, suspect vitamin levels microbiome health largest contributors. important factors can’t seen directly comparing two infections similar age physical health underlying conditions. patent Ivermectin expired, made cheaply. vaccines tho patent. Pharma make much vaccine. 

I'm pushing Ivermectin, reasonable say ""Big Pharma"" would rather sell vaccine. asked release patent declined 🤷🏿‍♂️ evenly distributed though. chance what? cat bag end 2019. say didn’t respond terribly, don’t see wouldn’t ended eventually battling COVID mutations realistic scenario. false. get infected, viral loads generally reach level, vaccines absolutely reducing infections. Effectiveness gone substantially since Delta many people reaching 5-6 months, still considerably effective infection.

Further, preliminary data shows booster reduce breakthrough infections 86%, putting effectiveness back near pre-delta levels.

This dangerous misinformation. leaving next day realizing good salaries 

/s America always adopt nothing approach  Hey boss, I'd like take last week September off. 

""Oops, see message. already schedule. Find someone cover shit luck"" like on/off switch. prevent worse scenarios already baked cake. lot people reported feeling better getting vaccine maybe regular boosters help offset that. many states stupid so. live Ohio well first round we’re shitting now. don’t think ever get 80%. can’t get 80%+ Americans agree baseball all-American sport, JFK assassinated, landed moon etc. way get much barring increased ostracizing employer mandates. could easily sort things. lot common cold viruses affect sense taste/smell. thi supposed surprising? spanish flu too, live it, like flu   lol, “thinking long term” “do literal nothing”? Bruh can’t stay inside month?! Spent time New Mexico recently, everyone mask everywhere, Santa Fe near 80% vaccinated etc.

Came back Texas sort shock, even though knew expect. Would go grocery store people masks work there. write much FB? give Yeah, that's scientists told us governments promoted way. saying lockdowns are/were bad ideas, pointing many politicians used form promoting good image instead telling people truth. wasn’t correcting all, btw. responding comparison game. Delta, moment. know much Mu point (but expect even Mu).

Talking generally, regardless current stains even yet unknown future ones even generally Covid, way things unfold viruses vast majority local mutations random noise consequential. Occasionally, mutations may reduce effectiveness later generations, may make effective. effective, many things, like spread lethality. 

Mathematically, expect viruses high spread low lethality win time. nuts people fine, kills many.

It's nuts people willing bet life positive outcome.

A co-worker work closely informed everyone tested positive morning. 

The company mandated quick antigen tests every 3 days, failed morning, went got PCR test, confirmed positive.

The company also mandated vaccination (and masks). Everyone office vaccinated, included. Still precautions place.

I passed antigen test morning, think I'll another tomorrow even though required. That’s said first second shots, well shedding masks vaccinated earlier summer. fair. Right that’s clearly said *societal* end. miss that? actual vaccine course still around.  Sooo??? said ittt???? Almost new data coming line Israel's. outlier longer true. it'd still around mutating, create body mutations spread throughout ending right back square one. There's reason flu vaccine never ended flu. Getting everyone vaccinated help prevent spread, gives mutations free reign entire planet. hold gun point?    off, know endemic means? I'm sure based used there. means become normal disease exists population regular basis, like flu.

You dont seem know actually. Endemic means localized outbreaks, example certain countries areas, pandemic means ENTIRE WORLD, even several countries pandemic already. ask again, ""just"" became endemic, makes sense. circulate, another mutation happens become pandemic again. think little little, keep increasing vaccination rates. Someone knew high school (in late thirties) recently died COVID. family big antivaxxers, they've starting posting bunch Facebook questioning beliefs. people feel impacts, convinced get vaccine. Every thing read lately FDA CDC boosters reminds trolley problem. FDA says need evidence boosters, despite 2 million people Israel already received boosters, seems completely comfortable significant numbers fully vaccinated people infected next several months, without data impact that. Even reduction risk vaccination, long covid spread involving vaccinated individuals, seem taking pretty big risk without data support decision (or indecision). But, least months better data health impacts people breakthrough infections even hospitals overwhelmed people sick unable care patients. Then, pretend consequence fault, virus, ignore role delay approving boosters waiting perfect data problem. So, seems like one FDA CDC would pull lever, instead choosing ""do nothing"" option, matter many people could've saved. Oh, definitely agree need look way return semblance normality - I'll give one UK specific example absolutely nuts. friend (45m) double-jabbed, got COVID moment pretty bad shape. lives half kid, still going work every day (doctors surgery) kid's still going school. That's current ""guidance"". think also important note difference length human trials. see willingness among people take something like ivermectin proven safe decades something new. basically saying beginning.

If think number true, please blame author. comment read. real ratio, idea. That's I'm trying find something. common sense wins. know Portugal way smaller US, sheesh imagine least 90% US got vaccinated already. We'd seeing different situation right now, likely.

Imagine spoiled country us 16 opportunity get vaccinated many still chose to, yet countries begging get vaccinated. SMH. like unused vaccines go countries need either. Instead, go waste. surprising, way north guess even pandemic, idiots still protesting outside hospital.

Think read like 12% kids 12-17 vaccinated too, insane. doesn't. Delta good spreading without losing lethality, last year assume opposite virus becomes virulent, it'll go lethality eventually like common cold.

Well.... Assumption mother F-ups   think agreement here. Vaccinations way always been. problem reality large portion world never get vaccines, virus always live capacity continue mutate. Thankfully seen dramatic shifts efficacy far, I'm hopeful currently enough protect us long time. truly wish world could get together speed things up, seems every country playing ear point. Came say this! Don’t get wrong, people dumb, JFC fail simple messaging point - embarrassing herd immunity cases dropping, would much easier handle new strains abroad.

Forget studies support it; simple fact prevention always better treatment fact. Even ~~bleach~~ ~~hydroxychlorquine~~ ~~megavitamin doses~~ ~~essential oils~~ ivermectin turned wonder drug got rid covid coming it, better option catch first place requires vaccinated wearing mask.   treatments haven’t gone process scientific expert review distrust

(And yes, get topics paywall; sites need revenue, something important COVID update NEVER obstructed common knowledge database!). Way cherry pick context, genius. even read initial comment? one arguing won’t evolve. That’s viruses do. 

But sound like moronic Facebook antivaxxers you’re arguing favor flu virus like COVID. It’s not. said it’s not. mutation (holy shit, virus mutates? Thanks that), COVID flu similar. five weeks unvaccinated start arriving ICU real numbers. hence 21 day quarantine.... break law.... crime right? 100.0% cases sequenced recent interval US see works them.

I think we're already seeing real-time. good. jury still eating human feces cure too. good studies confirmed efficacy, soon good studies finally give us definitive answers. Feces safe thing eat. proven beneficial human health thousands years. particularly impressive Denmark considering children can't get yet. 
I know age cutoff getting vaccine is, according Wikipedia Denmark ~17% age 0-14. safe say large chunk 24% unvaccinated allowed get yet! I’m huge animal lover too! weird horrible experience around. felt bad skunk, also furious it. dog big fluffy black tail white tip, six months stopped jumping skin wagged! fight get shots right away, fight animal control take quarantine dogs. also profoundly grateful ER care profoundly grateful animal control getting skunk, could get family neighbors. just… lot. 

The funniest part: neighbor retired psychiatrist, saw cute stuffed skunk toy bought joke. idea struggling startle response, gave thing fixed it. curious mutating way often flu then? Bcz way ppl infected? guy told told people crossing border Florida bringing Rona.


I mentioned Florida land border Mexico, said boats cuba wheres 1st world USA great nation.... motorcycle rallies, spring break beach goers, etc  Americans get ridiculed anti-vaxx too. Anti-vaxxers remarkably resistant ridicule. again, anti-vaxxers generate plenty ridicule everyone else themselves. want run president, sticking libs look good people outside states, living hell they're creating rules sole guiding point ethics? Yikes! vietnam dealt sars , dont' fuck around can't buy human version counter, prescription only.

So pro-vaccine people ridiculing horse memes scream slanted news designed pro-vaccine agenda.  draw conclusion. literally says “in best case” meaning best case keeps dangerous. Hmm. I’m sure I’m board idea. 

I see several problems. 

1. strategic point view, keeping people rich countries getting sniffles poor countries wait life saving first doses isn’t morally reprehensible, it’s increasing odds variants popping poor countries. even though don’t *think* it’s possible new variant completely evade immunity, seems like asking trouble. 

2. doses ask people take, genuinely hesitant turn away. It’s one thing once, entirely another every six months. part flu shot compliance kinda dismal. People think, rationally not, keep it, doesn’t work. 

3. People getting third doses reporting unpleasant side effects similar initial series. Yes, that’s dangerous situation, it’s going damage compliance again. want fourth round feeling like hit garbage truck avoid minor illness? clear, three doses, talking minor illness. 

So worth making everyone else wait another round, undermining confidence it? I’m convinced. Thank Portugal MUCH less intelligent country!  8 months likely based pushing third dose december population, making supply easy taking away first doses countries (though countries inexplicably continue give second doses first, even bigger issue).

With vaccines longer interval doses always gives better result. downside vulnerable waiting.  mean, yeah, course. told rules. Don’t follow pay price. really hard.  work big construction company Bama (think Federal work). 200+ people office. COVID May well exist. WFH (lol still using zoom office). vaccine mandates. negative ICU beds weeks it’s getting worse.

Even workers don’t traditionally dangerous jobs putting risk simply driving work ICU situation. mention serious situations like heart attacks, strokes, cancers etc. isn’t fair,, it’s stressful fuck. Governor Ivey scared anything productive/helpful. Businesses care bottom line.

Oh and, got email weekend management saying won’t mandating vaccines. I’m quitting soon. South cough cough&lt; ...again! say needs time killed someone recklessness, 7 people may light change medical problems agree 100%. think right track. Also parts agree ""scientists explain well enough"", example: vaccine evading variant, deadlier variant subjects REALLY badly explained.  FDA would never approve Mountain Dew human use People giving rules seems effect unfortunately. Vaccines good, things like masks public transport still compulsory. Insufficient data.  wonder continue play medical system. poor health providers killing themselves. neighbor did. told would go away weeks last year march came home. 

I ask every time see thats working him. true can't say 100% that's dose. many factors, discussed below. 

Both vaccines mRNA. saRNA vaccines trials though. 

Both Moderna Pfizer vaccines encode modified version spike gene locks produced spike protein activated (post-cleavage) position. allows body focus antibody production dangerous form protein thus ock infection readily. encode protein sequence aspects different.

I admit know anything top head UTRs particular mRNA vaccines. went read bit.

[This review really good breaking vaccines similar/different, although technically heavy mostly focused potentially improve vaccines. 

From article, same:
mRNA coding mRNA encodes S-2P protein [5,6] differ spike protein reference SARS-CoV-2 genome (NC_045512) two amino acids, i.e., amino acids KV sites 986 987 replaced PP stabilize resulting spike protein prefusion state train host immune system recognize virus entry host cell [7,8].

&amp;nbsp;


From article, differences are:
1) Codon optimization (what codons used encode certain amino two strategies exemplified codon optimization involving GAR codons encoding Glu (Table 3). SARS-CoV-2 reference genome (NC_045512) 34 GAA codons 14 GAG codons spike protein gene. Moderna’s mRNA-1273 taken fundamentalist strategy replaced GAA codons GAG. contrast, Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT-162b2 took liberal strategy, left 14 GAA codons unchanged (Table 3). Moderna consistently applied fundamentalist strategy codon families mRNA-1273, whereas Pfizer/BioNTech consistently used liberal strategy codon optimization BNT-162b2. systematic evaluation two codon optimization strategies translation efficiency.

&amp;nbsp;
A possible (but way scientifically examined via experiment) explanation dose differences:
2) Sequence secondary structure 5' (upstream) untranslated region known secondary structure 5′-UTR mRNA-1273 (Figure 2C) would hamper cap-dependent scanning start codon result less efficient translation. However, 5′-UTR BNT162b2 derived 5′-UTR human α-globin gene (Figure 2) appear superior mRNA-1273 aspect. mentioned before, mRNA-1273 also problem codon optimization (e.g., excessive use CGG optimal codon). factors might jointly impact negatively translation efficiency mRNA-1273 contribute requirement high dosage Moderna vaccine (100 μg/dose) relative Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine (30 μg/dose). mRNA translated efficiently, needed produce amount encoded spike protein. [...]
The 5′-UTR Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine mRNA incorporates 5′-UTR human α-globin gene (Figure 2A), makes sense α-globin mRNAs translated efficiently. 

&amp;nbsp;
3) Stop codon: stop sequence used tell ribosome stop using mRNA make fact, multiple lines evidence suggest much difference termination efficiency accuracy among three stop codons. Pfizer/BioNTech’s BNT162b2 mRNA features two consecutive UGA stop codons. Moderna’s mRNA-1273 uses three different stop codons UGAUAAUAG. optimal arrangement? [...]
One caveat reasoning involves replacement U N1-methylpseudouridine (Ψ) two vaccine mRNAs. alleviate host cells attack exogeneous vaccine mRNA foreign RNA [13,58], uridines mRNA vaccines replaced Ψ [2,14]. Therefore, stop signals ΨGAΨGA instead UGAUGA Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine, ΨGAΨAAΨAG instead UGAUAAUAG Moderna’s vaccine.

&amp;nbsp;
4) 3' (downstream) UTR mRNA-1273 “pasted” 110-nt 3′-UTR human α-globin gene (HBA1) last stop codon poly(A) tail.The design 3′-UTR Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA vaccine combination SELEX borrowing nature.


It's really hard tell what, these, responsible differences addition despite dose. 

There probably many studies next decade looking tiny tweaks vaccine affect efficacy data point. saying birds sky secretly gov. surveillance cameras?! Hitchcock, \*ss!! happening every state USA right now. Everyone can’t staff beds. It’s disaster tbh Lol. attitude useless offering nothing negativity. hope feel culpable promoting vaccine hesitancy due crap messaging. Also preDelta well.

(jaunty accordion) people walking around maskless pitching fit vaccine mandate.

Sounds like lot coworkers liars.... 

If vax'ed already, gripe mandate? (Unless vaxxed, course) That's exactly feel. know probably going catch school absolutely right. Stopping spread vaccinations masks essential effective. Even vaccine prevent people contracting, still lessons symptoms virus turn uses spread itself. Someone coughing lungs going spread hell lot virus someone sniffle wearing mask. I'm familiar publication, anyone know jpost is? I've seen lot headlines implying vaccines dangerous and/or work, far right rag?  presume means Netherlands? Arguably, main mistake politicians Netherlands made early young people fully vaccinated. first opened beginning July, slightly 30% country's total population fully vaccinated almost nobody 30 years fully vaccinated. means deaths never reached particularly high levels (most high-risk fully vaccinated), cases could still increase high levels. also around time Delta took over. Although knew coming, everybody still adjust infectious variant get much protection first vaccine shot (rather fully vaccinated).

As today, 12-20 years 20-30 years around 70% fully vaccinated Denmark, older age groups much higher, overall entire population 70%. should, hopefully, provide level protection last couple weeks infection-levels slowly falling.

I suspect politicians Netherlands got quite scare near-vertical climb infections July. Consequently, new opening nightlife probably slow cautious. still can't believe vaccines ready least age 5 September.  except order came beginning year...

Can someone help understand outrage allowing dying man try experimental treatment doctor prescribed him?

I don’t think would it, well I’m vaccinated probably wouldn’t ever get point, hard time getting angry someone else wanting try it. doesn’t hurt anyone else, it? thing that’s off. can’t say certain vaccines mask didn’t work. current landscape obviously didn’t work that’s 40% US population refused participate.

So, ah, I've burned read study, wondering long monitored subjects antibodies? 

What heard family medical field another problem covid antibodies even develop infection, remain couple months. would become vulnerable again, even strain first infected before, limiting possibility herd immunity. vaccine, course, way become continuously immune (at least strains far.) Call sick, diabetes much added stress literally killing yourself. boat, double-vaccinated Dr. told last week get booster pharmacy give one unless attest immune issues, don't. know lie, lie. So, stuck limbo Dr. says need vaccinated can't get it.

As far efficacy goes, looking like 30% current cases 15% ICU admissions vaccinated folks. much much worse 2 months loses effectiveness. delusional think going go away vaccine made efforts increase ventilation key buildings (i.e. schools). nuts. Mutations aren’t copyrighted, don’t stop existing possibility without creator. variant scary new feature immediately dies out, means iteration feature didn’t thrive time. There’s nothing stopping dominant variant coming scary feature. We’re talking evolution here, every new iteration thing mutation it, mutations end helpful, thing absolutely happen later.

Basically, isn’t “thank god doesn’t know more,” “oh shit that.” Correct except first order wasn’t reversed. first one temporary order expired 14 days. always going back court seek permanent decision. kids older (but old enough vaccinate) much choice. Remote schooling option state year, I'm qualified homeschool.

We're crossing fingers point. feel lucky live district can, expect we'll end sick anyway. I'm putting blame squarely FDA dragging feet. Well that's one way get three half day work week...




Umm, soon? Well put words. “rules” arbitrary ridiculous. get vaccinated think right yourself. 

All arbitrary guidelines many nuances can’t depend others think right thing. world around cannot close down. 

The guideline globally true get vaccinated. 

The arbitrary guidelines:

Wear 1 mask, wear 2 masks, wear face covering 

Stay 6 feet apart you’re inside, outside, ventilated area, non ventilated area

15 minutes magic number exposure

Big box stores could open others couldn’t 

Wear mask walk bathroom restaurant. 

Etc., etc 

Some people see arbitrary nature rules subsequently don’t trust them. reasonable thing protect yourself. Yeah, Finland 82.3% 12+ received 1st jabs, matter time till get 2nd ones. think toggle switch Trump Bolsonaro type option game.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  people get vaccinated wear masks. Yep, outright refusal cooperate international efforts, travel restricted, etc...  know, people trust FDA approved drug, I'm sure they're going trust peer reviewed studies. 

Because know makes sense science? Memes. think biggest advantage homeschooling virtual right stability. next several months in-person school going mess quarantines, shutdowns, eventually getting sick anyways. really good solution right now, varying degrees bad option. Oh good, hoping covid add covid. makes governor look bad would rather keep failures private. People laser focused efficacy, need also keep eye likelihood hospitalized whatever vaccinated, full stop.

Efficacy tells whether get vaccinated not. overall likelihood tells vaccinated people faring right now. important. Oh boy. Hopefully comes back negative! hope ok. Good luck 🤞 old they. Like, I'm sorry situation, but, many variables. Moderna Pfizer first, J&amp;J little behind.

[Here's source straight recommending booster finalized yet. TLDR, 8 months first shot likely.  84. think say it’ll sort like yearly flu likely around many many years would say underwear serves similar purpose masks actually, probably equally important. kind harmful bacteria transmitted fecal matter, underwear prevents diseases spreading every time somebody farts.  Like masks, probably fine somebody without underwear outdoors, office crowded indoor space, underwear extremely important safety precaution. COVID debuts new Mu variant! know older couple got vaxed time, got antibody tested. plenty, almost none. bodies produced different reactions two. He's getting booster. Also, let's discount overall health Alabamians whole. Without Covid, state national leader diabetes, obesity, heart disease.  Sorry, I’m pretty sure it’s local school board governors left making pandemic young. he's hospital max oxygen

Age? Articles I’ve seen state vent setting decreased 100% 50% would mean he’s still it. almost like they've conditioned past 5 years consider news like ""fake."" Check Gavi Vaccine Alliance, great nonprofit specializes this!

Was super happy findraise past weekend. 😀 I’m sure that’s exactly case… that’s exactly situation hoped we’d returning to, right? thought could gather normally vaccinated people again, turns out, can’t…

I’m saying, 1 5,000 odds doesn’t really mesh dinner party story. I’m looking path back normal. Maybe take time. hide numbers dead people. lack zoning bizarre. get, predictably, weird combination businesses dwellings intermingled. It’s kind shitshow, IMHO. on-brand Texas guess. third parent ICU?  Cancelled trip see family seen 1.5 years due increasing numbers. destination state also appears poorly handling Delta... Maybe next year... mi, mu. prediction: biden right thing start mandating vaccine, hogs march streets right die covid infect others covid. due respect, sestbelts always save people injury, bother wearing them? 
 
/s People either believe virus real accept risks try best follow rules like wearing masks social distancing, believe virus real go business like would normally. one believes virus follows society's rules like rational actor. rules minimize risk. wear mask sanitize want avoid getting covid, know can't completely avoid risk getting it. 

In perfect world would completely shut society one would move interact month, virus would new hosts go to. people still need move around, get groceries, go hospital, maintain infrastructure, people inevitably need interact situations. 

With businesses, perfect world would shut consequence, reality either need supported taxpayer dollars open appropriate mitigations risk. I'd love live society freely give money issues, that's possible. - ‘Rogan said took “all kinds meds,” including monoclonal antibodies, ivermectin, Z-Pak prednisone. also got NAD drip vitamin drip three days row.’

Yeah, probably livestock dewormer beat COVID. great physical condition treatments receiving probably nothing it.

I know joking there’s going million idiots saying thing sincerely. idea unvaccinated going die silly.

Good thing next nobody actually saying this, issue crowding hospitals past breaking point.

Is thought everyone getting along? ""Oh no, every single one going fucking *die!*""? Even blackpilled never argued that, contributing giant fucking problem that's ramifications everyone. Ugh, I'm sorry hear that. Wishing family uneventful speedy recovery! 

Were kids masked outside playing? I'm judging, curious spouse (both fully vaccinated) kid (too young vaccinated) always masked we're around people park playground. We're pretty much always people masks every time, I've gotten weird looks. Ummm think humanity cares origins take whatever steps necessary prevent happening again.

I thinking military intervention though 🤨 good brain! always uses best words!  accurate. frustrated high school teacher here. many years covid vaccine mandated students??? 


I small children home (two fever induced seizures sometimes) cannot vaccinated, meanwhile roughly 70% high school student body unvaccinated...just student last week come school symptomatic infected two students class. done... probably indoors, enclosed space, proper ventilation/fan system place, thus cycling never ending dosage high viral load virus amongst throughout night. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Even "" /s "" makes sense. might good general idea, article says ""with Nebraska state mu variant case detected."" Oh cool! Less 1% population get vaccinated! Hoorah! Mission Accomplished!

Maybe add couple zeros number want actually something. Whoa, could seen coming I've never even hesitated wearing mine. Indeed. like ivermectin. OP's title misinformation. Maybe are, america enjoying life right fair, devs add option COVID blew up.  issue work home works well *everyone* working home. work well people working home others not. everyone remote, experience meetings collaboration same. people person meeting room, experience becomes differential. can't see whiteboard, get pre-phone bridge small talk, able see body language quite way (even video on). 

That differential experience drive people office, even prefer working status quo model. I've already seen brief glimmer reopening early summer: got dragged office fly back across country couple times others meeting person. Delta 'fortunately' put much back ice. 

This excludes jobs truly independent contributor roles little collaboration, outside jobs require retention onshore regulatory reasons, types individual contributors roles want get back onsite *pronto* avoid bean counters deciding role done remotely, done remotely well India Philippines. high risk bias trials, variation outcome measurement, relatively low compliance interventions studies hamper drawing firm conclusions choice vast majority folks comment brought Manscape new Lawn Mower 4.0. Man really missing brain cells. Must suck go life like that. ... people want fight Covid? 

The money spigots full blast ever since Covid starting properly effecting economy. People tested things sun, testing horse de-wormer might actually effect based hearsay pretty damn cheap. depends distance. never know someone appear beside you. Anyway, I'm talking videos I've seen people walking around together pandemic, masks. Groups people close close groups. telling sketchy link redditors like spam ivermectin contains false information? Sounds like wet dream American vampire ""healthcare"" system: massive cohorts people chronic illnesses likely require kinds medications lifetime. They're correct; they're using different measurements effectively illustrating statistics manipulated push narrative.

Depending whether count kids people one shot, numbers look really different. Read Oklahoma’s data. choose bit else 50% vaccinated state give incredible data every week vaccination status COVID cases: August:

4.87% cases fully vaccinated individuals
6.7% hospitalizations fully vaccinated individuals
There 74 total deaths fully vaccinated individuals since start pandemic. August 22-28 alone, total 189 deaths entire population Oklahoma (they don’t give good date breakdown vaccinated deaths). 

Why suggest give hope? Well, real world data vaccines work. approximately 50/50 population split vaccinated unvaccinated, people vaccinated population tend higher risk. despite that, cases, hospitalizations, fatalities vaccinated group small. That’s incredible makes clear you’re vaccinated risk significantly lower unvaccinated. Obviously really, unless quite old. can’t wrap mind around news story weeks ago— dinner party epidemiologist Johns Hopkins. 14 vaccinated friends presumably one homes &amp; 11 became infected. sounds like pretty terrible/hopeless odds me!  thing perfect physical world. high-precision industries high quality output requirements, achieve perfection throwing duds. 

In virus replication mechanism, there's real cost benefit detecting discarding/disabling duds. toss world like rest. way hell would send kids school insanity going on. It’s avoiding Mississippi reading Reddit thread. [Cochrane also nice review story kind suggests opposite, though. Like, even careful, get eventually.

There's big difference ""you'll eventually exposed virus"" ""you'll eventually get covid-19"". Even vaccinated people, lot depends initial viral load.

In midst surge, much likely exposed high viral load, many, many people covid-19 walking around May June.

So even accept covid endemic, still strong argument taking extra precautions midst surge (like one happening US currently) relaxing precautions surge over. 

Even covid becomes endemic, likely surges become less severe time population level immunity, whether vaccines previous exposure (or both). mention, unlucky enough develop severe illness, much better access medical care outside surge. Ask experts care about. Cases hospitalizations? Cases don’t matter vaxxed people testing positive symptoms. yea long covid bad that’s also rare vaxxed. Covid isn’t going anywhere. It’ll kee mutating reinfected multiple times out. body builds resistance time due vax re-infections, severity disease continue drop number people.

Dont tell speak smug arse. Fox News land, COVID barely thing.   Lol comment wiping whole (albeit dumber) populations people  Pretty much remaining restrictions lifted end September including large events. government time intend use covid passports rule needed.  know 7 people. Six likely Alpha due timing vaccine wasn’t available. Unfortunately, one passed away still struggle Long Covid. friend got ventilator couple weeks ago currently physical therapy oxygen 24/7. really understand want?

A source claim coronaviruses ""resequence code"". Also source claim better treatment methods means less long covid. Even restricts much mutate, still mutate

Yes...the ability mutate never question real ""duh"" statement. Coronaviruses still mutate far less many common viruses. 70-80% supposed enough said. anymore? Allow serious doubts this

It's almost like Delta far contagious OG strain, drastically increased contagiousness comes increased bar herd immunity. Surely even grasp much, yes? giving document explains interpret numbers, thing written bold colors well... That's going cut  
Enjoy, also, gander:  Remember Fauci, literally 4 days ago, said immediate threat US? Thats weird take. many ways it. reinvent wheel?  good idea good idea. unfortunately people need hear information either A) hear B) believe hear Yeah think little extreme. Also good amount Americans literally can't vaccinated health complications. imprisoned homes eternity? rational thinking. also vaccinated.  Wife vaccinated still got kids returned school. So, completely. Obesity also affects everyone (that indulges fast food survives).

Long-covid also affects everyone ... gets Covid symptoms it.

When say one, clearly pointing people authority. cared, fast food would illegal. no-rotation crops growth acceleration via artificial means.

Same long-covid. people cared, vaccinations mask use would mandatory times, even open spaces since Covid airborne virus. Also, masks would provided gov.

My personal stance is: visit unvaccinated relatives, always wear mask outside home, go people gather en masse possible (order online vs shopping), work home possible etc. enforcing one since position authority.

Our stance Reddit impact realities around us.  got tired delay return approached dates kept setting, last time emailed everyone said ""keep working notice.""  assume it'll February so. go back it'll three days office, two days optional remote.  Variants pop different regions provided covid measures enforced.

For instance virus running rampant Florida acting cauldron new worse variant develop keep infecting people spreading. Something similar happen Mississippi well.     time holiday season :) received second Pfizer vaccine beginning April (so 5 months me). county currently offering 3rd booster dose anyone wants it. 

I keep reading mixed messages whether wait full 8 months get 3rd booster shot. anyone provide information best course action would be?  correct. variants making news come countries.  Decimal system invented India. Indian numbers decimal system. different names place values. far people getting worldwide. yet variant US particularly concerning. don’t see could say late. got j&amp;j back march, got 1 dose pfizer aug, side effects either time (20M) one things drives crazy anti-vaxxer friends. look mortality statistics two possible outcomes death full recovery. certainly two possible outcomes. matter much insist possible children may suffer long-term consequences infection, statistics absolutely clear vaccinated lowers risk, always come back nonsense ""We trust immune systems."" want know NZ plans reopen beginning 2022 see prime minister's comments here: current lockdown approach likely around forever, higher vaccination rates continued improvements testing, isolating, contact tracing frequency scope limited. added importance lockdowns right everyone chance vaccinated, happens compromise think people NZ ok with. There's lot misinformation thrown MRNA vaccines, specifically Pfizer, based one report Israel goes grain everything reported everywhere else.

Here Canada, pretty much everyone MRNA vaccine majority Pfizer, efficacy staggering. doubled dosed, Covid19 essentially stops real problem. Yes still get it, 10 times less likely unvaccinated, serious symptoms hospitalization become rare. UK rather high vaccination rate, current outbreak causing substantial increase hospitalization death. see cases deaths hospitalizations  anyone think going go away? thing happened seems contagious partially evades immune vaccine responses. No, it’s shot. go ahead get it’s indicated you.   Many states bad time summer dropped restrictions March. Delta took things started heating again. may able say exactly things would like without Delta, pretty clear arrival much-more-contagious variant played big role bad things gotten. someone help dilemma? wedding coming fall southeast cases unvaccinated rates high. vaccinated two unvaccinated children home. know confirmed unvaccinated people going there. need worry unvaccinated people vaccinated people? I'm struggling understand unvaccinated person presents higher level danger since active case carries similar viral loads. I'm wedding I'm leaning towards skipping point. Look sites covering - Newsweek, Fox News, NY Daily News. clickbait/alarmist sites.

As said, already peaked July. variant non-issue.  vaccinated, need isolate test weekend ""out about"" unless start show symptoms.  What's wrong conservative media pundits? take year what? pandemic need bad.”

Pretty much sums up. Epic fail. hope get ahead this. I'm going die inside every time hear someone say Moo. lol Different places going different risk tolerance policy, naturally. consider many people immune, vaccination infection. number pretty high UK. gathering together isn’t going produce lot spread, aren’t lot targets. 

On hand, there’s Australia, handled early mitigation like champ, low infection rates, little behind vaccine rollout. means people immune, lot targets. wouldn’t good idea go stand big crowd Australia yet. need immunity that’s safe. I'm reading CDC going approve 3rd/booster shots Moderna/Pfizer late September, Walgreens actually scheduling 3rd booster shoots website right now. reason wait, qualify 3rd booster shot (immunocompromised) right now?

It debatable booster shots needed general population, hand helpful immunocompromised. meet criteria set CDC, wait get booster. per capita covid case/hospitalization data US last week so? Yeah, morality self inflicted damage someone unvaccinated aside, assume two patients, vitals, time infection, one vaccinated one not, fairly different prognoses. Em, Italy 81.2% adults one dose. 4% ahead Germany. Spain 88%. ten countries ahead Italy. specific person. mean said ""illustrating."" Neither viewpoints wrong. want talk risk want know many unvaxxed people still regardless age. want talk compliance number meaningful. certainly didnt mean imply intentionally trying manipulate data. lies, damned lies statistics, lol. cheers.  issue globally well mutations? majority world vaccinated wont keep mutating? needs someone come along start spreading it. sue kids getting sick?  2. think meant antibody test antigen test. Antigen tests, tests virus particles, useful active infections. 

1. debatable boosters needed general population. 

3. way check see need booster. time, correlation antibody levels vaccine immune response/immunity. respect change antibody levels time outright levels person. data yet wary anyone claims interpret data. say Well... know that. 

... like it. hope mention 2.6 million people received boosters (or 3rd doses) Israel suggest health authorities learn impact infection rates country. all, last time suggested might learn something massive amount data accumulated Israel, consider adjusting dosing intervals, 2 senior officials FDA quit. important reminder go proper channels, know like Moderna 3rd dose request currently limbo. Might need check numbers again. 75% US adults gotten least one dose... make good point. thing I'd contend virus' origin concerned with. Bats, traded wet markets Wuhan, extremely filthy animals. They're filthy live equally unclean conditions best immune systems planet. Covid hit humanity hard thus far. might mere irritation Covids normal host yielded fairly destructive results jumping humans. thank you! good suggestion consider next time I'm scheduling check :) Children young elderly. Can’t agree more! hear time, kill someone family, effect attitudes.  Sounds like great plan stop spread.

Biden making speech week Covid response; cut FL peninsula 2 weeks non-essential air &amp; rail travel. Watch cases plummet.

I make recommendation Floridian. sort vaccine prevent spread.

Half people decided get vaccinated. Let's see works them. Someone shared earlier week Reddit:

12 Foot Ladder site - removes paywalls, . literally said, quote:
“At point time, I’m actively rooting covid. hope gets deadlier infections. sooner wipes people out, sooner move on…”
Are saying don’t actually mean want people dead move important things? literally said. 

Education healthcare access tried. US, healthcare extremely inaccessible breed sense people get tough without doctors. Education isn’t simple telling people get vaccinated why, starts ensuring children access good education resources ensuring early understand certain things, like vaccines, good. You’re going flip 40 year old antivaxxer decades conservative reactionary rhetoric. Bem dito. wish best. 

Can update know? think valuable information. Everybody, including uni, looks themselves. categorically untrue. Unless post source, please delete comment. wife claims vent settings improved hospital saying improvement. Either way, he's still vent. There's meme actually belongs Eastern Europe maps posted r/europe usually similar, mainly economic terms. ghana donate vaccines Every step we've taken making sure happen. we're solidly ""you lead horse water"" territory here. antivaxxer dies result deserves it. studies optimistic. numbers saw double blind study 6% immunocompromised people, effect immunocompetent, mortality endpoint.  Removing since also posted banned intentionally circumventing automod spamming articles repeatedly.  even read it? That's patients life-threatening illness get access drugs clinical trials reason ineligible for. eligible investigational drug least passed phase 1. Alright. suppose possible. saying wrong catching surviving MERS without anyone wiser would be...statistically improbably multiple reasons, really knows?  FWIW, downplay danger COVID anyway. really think linear path ever increasing virulence/deadliness COVID. COVID interested replicating itself, damage causes human body side-effect immune response, goal. 

There might variants highly contagious, virulence closer flu common cold. somewhat common predication hear experts. 

Of course might get something like H1N1 (Spanish flu) instead disease particularly dangerous senior citizens, instead particularly dangerous younger people.  get totally topic, cardio better losing gut. Part mode infection. Covid flu respiratory diseases, start replicating respiratory tract, obviously first place viruses air find. Measles it’s replicating tissues, time really get started, memory cells already it. 

There’s also mutation rate. Flu champ that. Flu mutates fast it’s basically whole new set viruses every year. kind mutations make drastic immune system doesn’t recognize next flu. Measles barely mutates all. Covid middle. mutate some, slowly, gets far away immune system recognizes, stop working all, spike protein also uses get cells. chances good current vaccines work every possible mutation, might different enough slow recognition, still close enough will. 

One cool things Covid vaccines predicted several possible mutations put antigens synthetic spike, it’s much wider coverage you’d get one variant. even though it’s hard get sterilizing immunity respiratory virus via blood borne immunity, they’re still pretty dang cool innovative, working better would expected. Yeah I’m trying help convey data isn’t nearly depressing glib it’s reported. seem stuck around 50% months there’s considerable progress. I’ve given tracking data point various media outlets prefer go straight CDC. 

I suspect become fully vaccinated, even don’t studies shown really decent efficacy one shot (80-90%, think I’ve read). margin it’s great news. still don’t know goats soda supposed mean.  thought everyone least knew ""Birdhouse soul"" Look places like San Mateo County, CA, 90%+ 12+ population vaccinated see there's HUGE difference rates get vaccination rates high.

I wish media would stop focusing solely Israel look pockets world high vaccination see rates look there. county (San Mateo) last wave smallish terribly impactful. never saw return full hospitals places saw. Gee, wonder why? research Keep mind Israel much larger relative youth population European nations, accounts (but all) lower total vaccinated percent. link article American Academy Pediatrics links several different recent studies thst helps. I'll reading later things medicine

I’m pretty sure Abbott’s end game this? don’t understand. stuck around 60% vaccinated last heard.  Unfortunately I'm nearly knowledgeable; repeating common wisdom based data + myriad anecdotes topic shared around here. I'm sure anybody knows, though, peoples' sense smell returns faster others, never goes away first place. Covid seems pretty chaotic illness. thought vampires? war triage. Mass casualty exercise nation. Day 5 daughters already quarantine. Someone class tested positive close contact. Runny nose sore throat. 
There distance learning option year. I’m frustrated. 
And idiots town think kids shouldn’t wear masks 😖 Oh wouldn’t test cos shorstaffed minority.. Saudi Arabia. dismissed completely even though X-ray tech astounded lungs looked. asked heavy smoker. non-smoker plus lived fresher air region Saudi Arabia south high mountains (Khamis Mushait). didn’t think test me. coughing nonstop 2mos, seriously thought end me. difficulty breathing got sick leaves, that’s all. testing. thing Covid never lethality, rather ability overrun local health care systems. year half ... time time time ... cannot believe many Americans failed internalize lesson. clear u/tapthatsap rich / developed country. seem still believe lockdowns answer. 2 years pandemic. 

In hindsight, countries followed policies ASEAN countries, managed get cases 0, opportunity there. Unfortunately, never going happen West. Governments could enact strict measures Asia, populations refused comply even light lockdowns.

Further, poorer countries simply control capability enforce lockdowns. Think Brazil, Colombia, Africa, etc. So, contact tracing + lockdown method worked countries like Australia, NZ, Taiwan, Korea, etc., never viable global scale.

These countries enjoyed pleasant 1year+ ancestral strain &amp; first variants spread voraciously across North/South America, Europe Middle East. However, contact tracing + lockdown method failing Delta. Delta spreads quickly easily contained.

Many countries controlled even effectively eliminated original strains facing outbreaks. realizing new strategy order. extreme cost (mentally, financially, otherwise) containment strategy longer justifies potential benefit. 

Previously, goal target 0 cases. longer achievable. such, point lockdown? seems delay inevitable. possible goal lockdown target vaccination level reached. start reopen, knowing cases increase. Australia targeting similar goal lockdowns.

My point lockdowns contact tracing completely ineffective Delta. cannot expect population lock months years indefinitely. reality vaccinated individuals, Delta simply ""risky"" enough justify lockdowns. 

It's also important realize strategies implemented locally eventually fail implemented globally. Borders cannot remain closed forever, global trade cannot take pause long periods time without major financial implications.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  ECMO always sounded like absolute nightmare fuel. yet US closed borders EU COVID. “What happens when” kicks thought process immediately presumption hypothetical. shouldn’t carry hypotheticals they’re definitives. That’s baseless unscientific speculation you’re carrying around reason, cause amygdala spike anxiety. want write zombie movies might good, that’s it. Thanks. COVID ward RN, absolutely doubt I'll least one patient week saying said flu now.  manage overcome influence anti-public health messaging social media? seems almost insurmountable U.S. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article I'm concerned long covid student says... Great journalism. Baaja Blast look statistics, uniform decrease lower age goes. political ideology explain it, vast majority people 80, example, gotten vaccine. point, personal fear ones safety overrules politics. Actually accordingly family members who’ve quarantine zones multiple times, government provide financial support quarantine zone. guy got sentenced lying whereabouts covid contact need turn kid stone, everyone cry revive kid, Mew2 take variants live island. aren’t capable rational people don’t trust mainstream science, “rogue” treatments hold stronger appeal.  VT alum watching apartment... we're danger Ouch, that’s whole lot shots. I’m glad one bite.

Poor skunk, too. Rabies miserable death it’s probably best euthanized. US hit similar rate first doses. Hoping hit 75%+ full vax rate move lives. Also curious see Denmark progresses winter, here's hoping surge negligible. Yes, basically want make sure PCR test. turnaround time depend facility go to. find local subreddits good resource get tests approximate turnaround time.  Oh yay! speech! fix EVERYTHING! Thank much!!!! lot places, restrictions gone, never came back. Kentucky, masking requirements schools medical facilities, aside we're 100% normal limitations self-imposed. It’s evading vaccine immune response yet. Delta outputs way virus per infected person, viral load 300 times higher. booster shot. 

What you’re saying possibility though. enacted Florida Texas instance? thought places worse shape. makes decision?  willing quarantine 21 days go another state? get by? 

If asymptomatic gave someone asymptomatic, would cool 5 years prison know it?  What? also said "" Boosters available yet."" earth talking horrible initial rollout globally boosters even globally approved?

Basically, read saying ""booster shots available, however, initial rollout initial vaccine horrible, high hopes booster roll out""

That's countered initial rollout good, opinion. Seems like booster conversation fractioning doctors/scientists battling frontlines public health perspective.

Many point data point high risk/immunocompromised individuals receive others point everyone get them.

Seems like Israel data cherrypicked everyone's biases. really look data, seems like severe disease prevented every major country highly vaxxed. (UK/France/Portugal/Spain/Iceland/Denmark/Finland/Israel/Canada/US etc.)  know shit wild Texas live hit monthly limit Houston Chronicle articles. Whereas disease like covid overwhelmingly causes chronic issues afflicted, flies radar extended period time showing symptoms immediately.

It always pissed people talked COVID lived died, since death unlikely, big deal. probably COVID outcomes would make people *wish* died. traveled Walla Walla Spokane via Lewiston CdA last October. people saw (besides myself) trip wearing masks elderly people college students around U campus Moscow maybe two people parking lot grocery store Post Falls -- people entering store ignoring big signs said ""Kootenai County requires masks indoors"". Nobody wearing going restroom buildings rest stop US-95. dude gave burger Zip's drive-through window wearing one. never happy get Spokane life.

So sounds like nothing changed last year.

Interestingly, ~90% people saw southeastern WA (Dayton, Pomeroy, Clarkston) wearing masks grocery stores gas station mini-marts signs requiring masks. Pretty sure nobody *wanted* wear masks either, willing break law it. want 13 years old vaccinated. data countries suggests safe, definitely benefit children themselves, protecting vulnerable, vaccinate children. 

The school started. child still wearing masks, well children teachers, back almost normal, need distance, wear mask. 

All data long covid nerve damage result covid coming recently, really scared child. many people acting/saying covid like flu children England. hope turn true, sake children. received third shot Pfizer couple weeks ago. hoping would get 6G, I'll satisfied 5G... fact children mostly unvaccinated makes Delta appear significant them. Yeah, I'm going go ahead trust article spells wean ""ween""... Also, know, weaning vent means changing settings. still vent extubated. comment wrong delete lest continue spread misinformation.

Let's see does. Doubt someone who's vented since August 1st meaningful recovery. I'm going predict death within next week discharge vegetable garden, trach/vented/gtubed. Yes. expected similar situation like Im glad wrong.  experts accepted mutations inevitable Covid going endemic rest lives. simply another one diseases live with, like flu common cold. Unfortunately Covid much deadlier right due novel virus, take long time species becomes adapted it.

So learn live it. First things first, means vaccines approved children 12, schools stay open parents go back work. Depending frequency mutations vulnerability individual, regular boosters every year so. Expansion hospital services better anticipate Covid surges. Improved treatments get sick. Life get back something close normal eventually. even medical experts know happen future COVID never like flu. flu season. COVID year around won’t change, even becomes less deadly/severe. Abbot really best let voters die Covid, huh? 20's, every single one friends vaccinated, well others around around age. 


My family/parents vaccinated though. 


Its way around think, older people republican often get vaccine less often Since weekend, number people hospitalized gone 95,000 92,000. Lowest since August 22nd.   Yeah, might. It’s worth keeping eye trials going nasal vaccines. think you’re right we’ll past worst time they’re ready. Please help me. test mu variant? thought fda eliminated main covid test inaccuracy. even testing covid days let alone variants? Debbie downer, wouldn’t jumping statistic fast. tons people getting boosters saying first dose. don’t know many Im sure it’s insignificant portion. I’ll wait see many get 2 doses start believing real vaccination increase.  Unless one better getting vaccine immunity, gets free reign rest us. Antivaxxers covid deniers everywhere: see told flu.

Have learned saying shit like fuels fire makes people take seriously? US citizens first. Sorry, don’t pay Biden prioritize interests. ten countries ahead Italy.

Not Europe dude. talking situation Europe. 81.2% adults one dose

I checked wrong source bad. still 81.2% instead 82% big problem. certain period time. Problem idiots think immunity, lasts forever. Everyone, including previously infected, need boosters. somebody went Missouri University, variant confusing me.  Thank you. 8-months kept seeing Fauci recommend. 

I US, county low vaccination rate (around 33%), whatever reason, easy get vaccine booster want one. elderly parents co-workers got today, second back January. 

I'm leaning towards waiting months, thanks advice. wonder focused studies healthcare workers looking natural immunity.

I'm nurse whole department it, 1 became ill point needed hospital survived fine. symptom loss taste smell, completely fine.

I've exposed many things throughout years would make sense minor symptoms. kids also positive symptoms including 4 month old. patient got COVID died pretty quickly... problems it. strange virus. failure looks  difference moderna applied booster authorization 50 micrograms mRNA, half dose original. It’s likely move lessen side effects double available inventory also considering 100 microgram again.

If got moderna original regimen, qualify third dose immunocompromised provisions eua, however reason wait; receive full 100 microgram dose third dose, half dose. Fda cdc consider third dose part primary series, really “booster” would want get dosage before. again, thank thoughtful explanation, ID field? Also would nasal spray vaccine bring us closer sterilizing immunity? Seems time roll out, endemic stage COVID. blame 50% countries world exactly same. 1. I'm deleting anything say-so.

2. Ralph Lorigo, attorney representing Smith, said lawsuit way. said Jeffrey Smith obtained 13-days’ worth ivermectin, hospital since told Julie Smith they’re ready begin ween ventilator. Since Mu started Columbia 39% cases 13% neighboring Ecuador seems like insignificant variant compared Delta. Glad see Daniel Dale staying busy heard would switch Constellations. watch Andromeda Strain! video showed test results coming back positive?

Did even open article?   This. chance missed it. mercy COVID mutates.  I'm glad we're making progress, I'm sure many universities jobs requiring vaccine helps lot. know case, hope school vaccine mandates become thing kids get vaccinated best luck people getting sick ordinary non-covid reasons still need go hospital. Yeah they're hiding it. Governor allow cities less 20k people report numbers looks like ""big city"" aka Democrat problem. Ah thanks clarifying, misunderstood. Cheers! Fauci resign immediately ... Well thats long, covid never over. Infinity x 2 feel like there's middle ground ""hide house"" ""fuck go football games 100k people!"" sure post apologies appropriate place.

I plan attending event weekend requires negative PCR test within 72 hours (whether vaccinated not). question - kind test need ask for? understanding PCR test takes 4-5+ days come back. 'rapid' PCR test thing?  would one thing people organic foods, exercise, natural living, etc people ingesting kinds chemicals bodies via lifestyle choices, end taking dozen prescription drugs seem trust anything stop reason vaccines bad unfortunately, I've given people acting rationally. always conspiracy... I’m glad someone said it. never gonna like flu ""Covid-19 evolved 'Total Organ Failure' without spending points."" made guess. second half film, find right wrong are. possible infected one variant virus time.

The potential danger scenario someone infected Delta Mu time Delta might pick vaccine-avoiding genes Mu become vaccine resistant well remaining highly contagious. process called Antigenic Shift happens Influenza viruses time. people suggesting though, ignoring real cost deaths, hospitalizations, long term symptoms get natural immunity. 
I've pointed respectfully pointed I've pointed real world data showing efficacy vaccinations, immunized either natural infection, vaccinations, best bet get vaccine wanna avoid lessen chances short term symptoms possible hospitalization long term symptoms, I've accused trying mislead people garbage information 'right' get vaccinated use therapies we're getting data about.
There's much respectful, people going look facts get alarmist everything waste breath, especially I'm accused trying mislead people. jumped believe everything even little data, I've always waited proper studies information healthcare professionals taking measure. I'm big pharma shill, I'm much aware big pharma is, real world data shows efficacy vaccines common sense shows can't rely natural infection immunity way counteract virus. Extremely contagious mild virus harm much, highly lethal diseases incapacitates hosts spread further.

It's part reason Ebola devastated globe. transmissible time.  people undiagnosed diseases cause primary immune deficiencies. wonder he's one them? Covid twice, including one vaccination, I'd contacting specialist. Ok, say confidence virologist it’s amount matters. saying UTR’s/replication factors don’t contribute respective efficiencies? construct? thought one approved mRNA vaccines saRNA (maybe moderna’s?). Im familiar concepts don’t kind intuition relative effect sizes/importance possible variations mRNA constructs. example use exact sequence antigenic targets?

I’ve searched around media saturated heavily-diluted content (fit public consumption course, without technical details). Yes, unvaccinated person poses higher infection risk reasons, namely:

They likely become infected therefore infectious.

Though peak viral loads (which may may indicator infectiousness) MAY similar vaccinated unvaccinated, vaccinated viral loads drop much quicker, limiting potential window infectiousness. saying it'll mutate like flu - he's saying it'll evolve like past flu pandemics (become endemic generally mild). fantastic news! know folks one shot far, please remind complete series.

Based Virginia data, partially vaccinated folks seem protection cases, COVID progresses, seems provide marginal benefits Per 100K|Hospital. Per 100K|Death Per 100K|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Fully|357|16|3|
|Partially|1,326|86.23|30.3|
|Unvaccinated|3,279|111.5|33.49| Bars packed since like many months xD I've partying tonnes even without vaccine.

How afraid, particularly full vaccination? Like holy shit grow pair. name birthday, generally good enough identify lot people. Plus ask insurance info (my insurance got billed vaccine). 

Most states track immunization status (not COVID) share healthcare provider. I’m I’m saying international community slow, volume infections high virus got foothold dozens mutations reducing ability vaccinate effectively mean, they'll run resources die stands. It’s unclear, everyone population degree immunity, likely become rare. example, recent research already looks pretty likely vaccinated people less risk long Covid. certainly deadly hospitals full.

We're number cases things awful last winter. vaccine people threw towel would unprecedented loss life world. Totally feel one.

A large number people still staying home cautious scared long covid stuff actual disease (America good country long covid prevents holding job). well said.

Like much face life there's risk factor, reward. focus generally lowering risk maintaining degree reward.

Driving risky, drive slow safe car.

 I'm able willing avoid risk. Unfortunately 25% population ignore risk drive brazenly/drunk/in shitty cars. Please disregard previous comments. mean upset man COVID stuff. read post history seem going things. hope well hope stay healthy. Wishing best yours. vaccines work well them. got spoiled 95% figure OG coronavirus. 

You’re downplaying effectiveness vaccines. still administering doses wait unvaxxed ones die improve quota? Thankfully shouldn’t hard get kids vaccinated who’s parents care them. hope get level people legitimately can’t get vaccinated safe.  Well I'm FL so... even need give state ID first thing first. literally lowest priority thing. decided schools stay open parents go work, totally fine kids unvaccinated. Question - possible pandemic shorter past pandemics connected globe is? Someone fly Singapore NYC time, infect someone way Johannesburg. 1918, took week take train across America, people weren’t 1% connected are. probably took Spanish Flu significantly longer touch corners globe.  sample collection date, there's often big delay sample collection returns. notice ""most recent interval"" really small sample size (though n=296 certainly enough get accurate picture), problematically could sample single lab single part country others reported yet.

In interval (mid august), mu 63/32,064 = 0.2% sequenced cases. interval (july-aug), 384/74,096 = 0.5%. relative prevalence certainly dropping (delta's relative prevalence grew 2.5x 2-week interval), absolute prevalence (number mu case counts) may given cases risen substantially timeframe. Denmark also. 74% fully vaccinated, lifted restrictions US reached 75% least one shot vaccination among adults. near half. people hear calling ""the jab"" definitely certain group. Republican, ""mah freedom,"" vaccine poison, etc types. become negative colloquial term vaccine. Please don’t lump us here. don’t care either mu delta escape vectors Maybe convince antivaxers ivermectin conspiracy sterilize them. cant manage need take homeopathic ivermectin work. Mu circulating since least January Columbia. far, displaced variant terms transmissiblity. think good prepared, everything far suggests type variant displaces Delta Delta Columbia's neighboring countries, primarily mix Lambda still lot learn regarding immunization escape, appears evasive laboratory setting, necessarily translate much ground. Remember P1 South Africa, cases started climbing US Spring along Alpha? never really got hold either. Delta makes really hard get hold. vaccines used US target spike, natural infection targets induces antibodies n protein actually inside virus. difference testing antibodies protein testing antibodies n protein.  Vaccination rates high (90% +) ages 50+ risk groups. 

But pretty much implied children unvaccinated hit hard winter season. Estimates hovers around 700.000 cases half unvaccinated population. 7 day rolling avg first doses US took hit labor day weekend, Saturday Tuesday went 416,672 366,220

Hopefully holiday lulls rebound back 400k  anyone read comments article itself? Smh. Q strong within them.  IT, never worked home. Office 5 days week. year’s mask mandate step far her, despite CDC don’t trust government, don’t trust CDC,” 

Don't trust what? Either saying thinks wrong masks working, case, what? slightly inconvenienced help stop spread COVID-19 work? horror.

Alternatively thinks CDC actively lying masks nefarious purpose? exactly even be? would benefit elaborate secret plot get people wear masks reason? Back work? work Trader Joe’s Arizona. didn’t miss single day pandemic. one people rest world quarantined, life didn’t change much all. damage one important senses. Thanks encouragement. Covid three times? healthcare? wife's internist ID folks nearly worried it. 

Plus, key: escape 100% even get ill likely severe vaccinated. Double plus: start developing new vaccines year keep up. like learned make boosters. People chemo, people auto-immune disorders, older frail people immune compromised. September, hopefully. know one person gotten already Minnesota. Let's WFH life! Okay?  I'm keeping fingers crossed. kids school going mask optional, governor mandated (thank goodness). know last year cases school transmission district, year half remote last year can't anymore, total enrollment ever before, kids excluded exposure. can't come school there's positive test. Last year taking precautions went well decided take none year. coming later due surge? would happened Bergamo last year (I Italian). Yes probably way that, least Elon Musk millionaire way leave planet  Things always find equilibrium long run. Treatments improve netting fewer hospitalizations deaths. Vaccination rates gradually tick people move next conspiracy. healthcare field continue expand grow. morbid sounds- eventually enough COVID deniers either die come senses hospitalization. likely long covid become rarity possibly less severe long term effects? Yeah they've concerned optics really bad it. stopping pandemic. know someone (so four shots total). … read article. flu still that. nearly everyone – like Covid – happens. also, proven people catch one varient? 

We're sure delta took 'slots' someone'd covid sickness. may alpha able spread general masking practices, delta is. keep mutating even majority world vaccinated. like going give up. hope figure way evade vaccines burns out. Otherwise we're going endless vaccine cycle, fine, flu. That's real question. There's reports outbreaks universities vaccine mandates. combination make lot sense. also (beginning Aug) - stopped Coeur d’Alene gas roadtrip. walked mini mart mask on, (obviously unmasked) gentleman behind counter asked going rob him. sort joking, unpleasant undertone happy there. yeah - surprised. I’ll get mine one year OG shot, sure. Don’t care get one sooner. I'll ask parents get back ya... Agreed there. many people think over. Winter big reality check some!   despite half country fully-vaxxed

Except ICUs filing VAST majority unvaccinated people. ones vaccinated mostly immuno-compromised REALLY need us build heard immunity. 

This pandemic unvaccinated, full stop. need start penalizing fat people overweight creates greater viral load get infected. Let's start turning away hospitals unvaxxed, overweight anyone else self harming! going happen majority countries. Covid thrives freedom makes feel better (er... ""better"" might best word), Covid cases make way ICU pretty abysmal survival rate. 
I know compares common reasons sent ICU, though.  people vaccinated natural immunity? lot confusion thread centers around “more mild” means. think posts trying get disease may stay get worse, effect population much milder thanks immunity (esp T-cell).   It’s disingenuous post. vaccines work well known variants. Saying “well hopeless” bullshit. every American got vaccinated tomorrow, hospitalization death rate would drop completely acceptable numbers.  know Ted Nugent pedo thought pooped pants lot war understanding one antibody test currently market tell difference right now. clear way detect difference seems one test currently can. rednecks thought thing intentionally targeted them

Don't already think that? Sure, say following rules Vietnamese quarantine infected someone. equally culpable? get it, manslaughter versus homicide, care intent. fascinating people simply saying ""that's rules!"" that's end ethics here. 

Vietnam good number people live grey economy-- hard imagine people trying skirt things may lose livelihoods otherwise. suppose gotta crack eggs/skulls make omelette. admitted hospital, doctors hospital decide medications receive there. matter list maintenance medications chronic illness treated something new new prescription. hospital doctors think necessary time hospital, get it. Delicious food drink, great weather 98% vaccination rate? 

I'm moving there.

PS hell borders. Portuguese came stayed country hundred years without permission. I'm collecting debt. lmao. Sadly, target audience story never see this. Bull fucking shit, situation Saigon fucking clusterfuck huge proportions.

It's bordering unrest hard strict lockdown affecting local populace, terrible decisions lack support leading food rationing neighborhood food sharing. clarify -- variant SA recently tracked Mu. good examples Mu Lambda outcompeted Delta, SA variant seen small numbers, confidence interval still completely allows exponentially growing respect Delta whole time. 

It's likely, threat C.1.2 really can't ruled data time, unlike Lambda Mu 

That said, hard rule low-sample count variant data, confidence intervals much larger actual signal yes, think everyone well aware stance.

It's health care tho, going still stuck overwhelmed hospitals unless someone allow unvaccinated die instead triaging based likeliness survive short term.  people downvoting asking pretty reasonable question? must either brain damaged, evil.

We know leg stand on...

...with policies.  need hear accounts people like help us epistemic crisis. goes beyond Covid course. past would agreed you. someone pointed me, assholes making children take stuff well.  actually requirement, schools imply get kids vaccinated good.

(Source: charge writing letters home parents lie could mislead. )  Sheesh. poor people. 

I feel like we’re closing timeline. love name Mandate mandate mandate Negative. We’re ordered back 3 days per week starting tomorrow. Free versus 300k ICU cost life long health issues.

Good luck beliefs. republicans start getting covid start wanting universal healthcare -2 bars still open, yes? people know even know option. get word resources like convince people viable avenue pursue? asking people get myocarditis vaccine likely worse case virus.

I know there's answer question. Myocarditis pretty dang rare people?

It seem common young men cases, maybe?

I've personally wondered people develop myocarditis intense workouts/sports/whatever. group develop seem group likely participating sports. simple, imagine someone would already figured out, though.

Edit clarity  Covid-19 watch Loki something new variants Yeah thats people said delta variant...on sub Right, said evidence. 

You claimed none. Fair enough haha True story. worked daycare. first year there, every damn stomach bug respiratory virus came way. Agreed, know anyone took J&amp;J shot, care enough look further. gives people starting point look they're interested.  correct answer trial data never apples apples. J&amp;J clinical trials done Alpha Beta spreading rampant basically. mRNA trials done mostly D1-whatever-G. problem is, lot unvaccinated people sick hospitals don’t believe it’s covid matter nurses doctors tell Last heard variant interest. friends vaccinated. One exposed coworkers 4 days Saturday job vaccinated employees. it’s unclear exposed. “Under new guidelines, six people allowed gather capital area include least two vaccinated people daytime four 6 p.m.”

Sorry, sounds like watching Monty Python write rules. 

Otherwise, I’m blown away low death tool is. sad statement. first thought said ""Canada vaccine"" happy moment would protect zoo animals ahead anti-vaxxer changes mind it’s late.  Sorry, go outside groceries! walks keep sane fwiw Actually talking variants almost soon virus discovered. worried infectious deadly variant. pinpoint definitely radar. Could be. Western media machine also history blaming waves Chile Seychelles Chinese vaccines. Chile wave several months ago blamed Chinese vaccine. Chile fine... Crickets. Israel biggest wave yet one questioning Pfizer. anyone remember reported Sinopharm trial participant died? Oh one got placebo yet international news reason. going mutate fast ever burn out. We’re going need stop leaning crutch figure something expand hospitals. 2
Years waiting go away it’s worse ever. wonder rest life going spent talking “normal” instead something it? Texass Governor CHEERS!!!!! also work it’s hit miss. people commit work remote (instant replies, always jumping meetings, available beyond business hours, exceeding targets, finishing projects early). Others auto-away multiple times throughout day, take hour reply, duck meetings, miss deadlines. Yet also middle, probably putting amount effort regardless. 

I didn’t mind office but, I’m 7 months pregnant, full-time WFH god-send sure. even work 5-day weeks anymore, though still work 40-hour weeks. work Monday Thursday, 10-hour days. okay remote, add hour commute end it'll hell. helps ease mind little, kids very, little risk SARS opposite, kids risk adults, far scarier. Anybody else read think: ""wtf....why world, why"" one else think 16% kinda lot vaccinated hospitalized crowd? it’s complex that. Evading existing antibodies doesn’t necessarily mean still entirely useless. Thus, quite plausible even *some* people natural vaccine induced immunity get infected Mu, render symptoms nonexistent mild, least manageable enough whole new wave threatens health care systems. even likely happen kids US countries finally get fully vaxxed.

It doesn’t look like we’re yet, people get naturally infected (unfortunate) vaccinated (fortunate) variants actually get us closer endemic phase. people clue they're talking about. everyone thinks vaccine gonna magically end covid, i'm afraid we're stuck mess least another 5 6 years Yea, vaccines. states U.S. basically screwed :/  ""At least"" 7 months. even ""possibly"" waning effectiveness, still effective. Well got scabies, may help. alright, made mistake mixing shit ton kid/teen lol  sure India’s much much higher.

Why ? Well, natural selection part evolution least. bring much misery would fascinating study. heard least half dozen stories parents taking kids get vaccinated questions asked identity proof needed. Friend friend kid turns 12 December got vaccinated anyway. recommending anything sure happen. happened vaccinations I'd really surprised turn people away reason. Preventing infection first place best way prevent long covid period. Even low level infections cause ""long covid"" point concern especially population x% get vaccinated. 

I'm saying avoiding boosters even 2nd shots altogether best* preventing spread overall even minimizing negatives whole. 

However, realistically situation group ready access vaccines boosters would protect better even low level infections, probably, group B get vaxxed commit sacrifice potential health future sake group C ready access vaccines. 

You're going hard pressed find group willingly force plan. 

My opinion immoral unethical pursue booster program. think however willingly unvaccinated placing unprecedented strain leading desire booster shot first place need pay MUCH higher price currently are. Especially regards cost care, societal support, care needs rationed first cut off. 

But that's opinion, I'm one making decisions I'll mitigate risk best much life/circle. English translation That’s probably unfounded. Want send link I’ll look base claim? things could called preventative treatments"" big nothingburger

its kind stupidity worries me. nobody knows vaccine work dont enough data folks looking alternate sources info still choosing poorly I'd sympathy. set watch headline particular news outlet (literally chryon) appearing FB see regurgitated people refuse look beyond circle double down. fine choose gather info, feel sympathy I'm told I'm idiot sharing sources. 

Don't underestimate people willing flout public safety hurt politicians they've told dislike. Meanwhile I've home year half trying live world fellow Americans feel responsibility keep safe healthy.  ""oh, one thing...""  Yep awesome wish people understood data better. number breakthrough cases tiny percentage vaccinated population, like 0.01% 0.1%.  Bars, schools, businesses, everything. Wide open, masks, virtual instruction many school districts (because last week state wouldn’t agree fund virtual instruction year all). It’s anxiety inducing teacher right utterly insane. don’t worry much thankfully vaccinated, worry continued spread among elementary age students can’t vaccinated. I’m afraid don’t fully know impact kids yet, since last year spread amongst kids greatly mitigated masks stringent Covid protocol schools. spreading like wildfire among students I’m scared students. Yes population say 100k, 65k vaccinated. 1500 cases, 400 among vaccinated (""breakthrough cases""). 27% new cases among vaccinated, breakthrough rate 0.6%.

Also... fatalities occurred high risk group age 65+ health conditions. ~75%+ vaccinated. fatalities younger people. them, especially kids, unvaccinated.

So makes sense reported illnesses, balanced two groups, high risk people far vaccinated. Damn good data mean may testing positive PCR test even though you’re longer infectious? Colombo version

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* We're 76% fully vaccinated hit 80% little ago?

Also, deaths extremely low ICU bad either. Cases spike governments need get used that. anyone know effective N95 contracting COVID? immunocompromised family members, return life normal, want evaluate much extra protection I’m getting better mask I’d feel awful got sick. also double vaxxed. read article, covid patients suffering. affects patients, including suffering health conditions accidents need hospital bed. One patients died veteran survived multiple deployments Afghanistan, died gallstones get helicopter ride hospital Houston. capacity. 

This now. Vaccinated not, life danger thanks Covidiots. RemindMe! 90 days many things overblown now... like US mandates covid shots military now... remember boot camp got something like 17 shots (including infamous peanut butter shot ass cheek) #18 taking things far? 

People rebelling things always done whatever reason, frankly pissing wind. there's federal law prohibits this, point. states amount much entirety UK population anyway stupid comparison, sensationalise preemptive announcement even decided yet. thanks playing variant carries higher risk, still susceptible(anti-vax, anti-mask) create higher risk themselves? Same. I’ve trying get daughter vaccine studies awhile desperate attempt get immunity. would rather take chances vaccine virus.  anyone strong argument denying usage IVM beneficial either (or both) following scenarios? 


1) Patient already vaccinated 
2) Patient vaccinated refuses types treatment 


Potential benefits: 
\- People stop buying type livestock overdosing 
\- Due safety profile IVM significant risk involved. Since currently studied clinical trials, there's least chance effective (even efficacy low). use argument people wear masks claim masks work. cost/risk low (next none majority population) potential benefit (even reduces chance transmission something low 5%) sufficient reason wear one. dilemma right now, want get vaccinated afraid myocarditis risk, dad diabetic get protection me. always wanted vaccine turn take it, hesitate. Also school starts week there's that. 

(M15)  I'm downvoted crappy news people want hear. People Minnesota New Jersey want shit over--I get it. look highly vaccinated areas see delta does. special. 

And could wrong course. Lol. get paid work outpatient cardiac rehab job working COVID ICU. got mediocre yearly raise couple measly bonuses approximately $500 combined. taken one abundance travel contracts emailed texted could made astronomically more. Unfortunately, contracts enticed experienced staff away. us families stuck around, new grads trickled in, noone's pay increased enough outweigh horrors we've endured COVID. incentive stay nothing money.  State busy focusing telling women bodies focussing virus killing it’s people. 

Give everyone freedom chose vaccines masks take away freedom woman’s choice body. 

Some backwards ass bullshit. Thanks service. hope get Texas soon thousands follow coming months. Thanks, great know. originally planned go year ago, pushed back year obviously impossible, I've spent year developing taste Salmiakki.  Biggest worry would whether capable job incapable understanding medical science. well, vaccinate whole part population virus known immune evasion, lot chances exactly that... like scientists warn us substantial immune evasion occurs, current vaccines likely still offer benefit individuals. population level, however, could induce viral selection escape, making prospect achieving herd immunity increasingly remote.""**

This entire civilisation exemplification peter principle global scale... Obviously. 

Older people likely vaccinated, relatively, children get infected. since fewer cases total population, fewer restrictions, therefore cases absolute terms children well. parent responsible legally incur debt child. 

What? good studies throw people.

The people don’t wear mask aren’t don’t better studies. hell advocating let children die??? Lmao. know damn well one saying children allowed die. 

But absolutely think adult chose vaccinated put back list triage. agree spirit saying, would phrase years respiratory pandemic we're still asking *if* putting physical barrier (mask) front **respiratory droplet** motion help stop movement toward people.

If virus really fly air itself, inside respiratory droplet, masks really stop movement toward people. Cloth masks would porous tiny particles -- 100 nm so. That's small seen normal optical microscopes, need special electron microscopes.

What's dumb people understanding virus particles fly air ""naked"" -- they're inside small droplets. yeah…. 

I agree. I’m anti-vaccine; rather, anti-bad information. 

It’s important note, vaxxed not, it’s first responder’s PPE protect patient.  exactly, also even third one end we're vaccinating everyone. Almost 85% population vaccinated, we've approved getting shot also kids 6 older... mix [but prevalescent one Sinovac around 70% total jabs administered followed Pfizer AstraZeneca Cansino Coronavac \(also real lesson = vaccines = amazingly good, mixing vaccines? = perfectly fine way effective 1 vaccine.

We're heading biggest reactivation travel tourism nationally here, el dieciocho de septiembre (national days) daily cases less 400 day, positivity 0,7% people gets asked vaccinated work, travel, enter cinemas, clubs, etc... everything asks green vaccination pass honestly best idea!!! I'm glad controlled finally I'm vaccinated two doses waiting actually third one able travel regaining normal life again! agree. Also assume person writing article formal training understanding subject writing about, like case, biology/virology/medicine. get concerns too. irony exact thing said last year. Looking back, compared now, semi-alarmist since kids didn’t seem spread old strain easily. Delta overtake MU MU resistant vaccines? careful buy one, fakes

They're much easier buy now. Home Depot went one last month. Grainger even sent ""hey, N95 bought little ago, sale now"" email couple days ago.  didn’t mean imply was, symptoms could long gone could still positive Pretty much exactly expect US. think ever go away (zero Covid) spring 2022 think hospitals getting overrun big issue right now, along protecting can't protect (kids/imunocomprised). 

If going south unvaccinated states, think things would pretty normal right now, even huge improvement anything last year look sporting events things normal.

Spring 2022 pretty much back normal. Even new variant think boosters able take care things.

I think rest world things could different longer.

Wish people understood type expectation, always see worried many make seem like never end. 

I guess understand ""just two weeks"" mantra echoed entire pandemic. completely agree cautious feel like overreacting, probably right thing. going states seems like still cause issues states, feel like time needed.

For come spring 2022 kids vaccinated, boosters available, vaccines continue effective hospitalization. natural immunity effect. strongly consider critical restrictions (though even barely see much restriction live, mask suggestions indoors many abide). here, I’ve gone honeymoon Hawaii July, I’m living life, fuck not? point vaccines wasn’t it?  I’d bet biopsy would involved, important remember mRNA vaccines doesn’t train body fight mRNA, protein mRNA makes.

I’m sure best way would be, doctors would need find protein unique cancer came identified body’s immune system make mRNA vaccine encoded make protein. 

Maybe looking DNA, mRNA, looking proteins themselves, sure.  Chilllll fuck out, far worse viruses Covid… No. people adults. culpable. chose bad information sources. many good ones also access to. people brains responsible decisions adult. least they’re filling hospitals, unlike unvaccinated fucks understanding that, even get variant evade antibodies, vaccines still provide level protection. Sincere question curiosity - virus droplets pass mask, increase viral load someone infected also wearing mask? become irrelevant already infection basically viral load?

(I 100% vaccine mask wearing!) a) changed Jan/Feb Dec/Jan spike wrong CA.

b) Midwest broad. COVID Iowa mild August 
compared November. Ohio. noticeable wave, baby compared chaos Nov-Jan. Example:  
c) Perhaps counter people's views Aug 
Aug. Yes, Aug 2021 worse children Aug 2020. concede that. 
d) But, chart posted shows COVID children 
isn't drastically different ever been. similar common 
spike across country Dec/Jan. 
d) also said article posted would 
be ideal could state-by-state comparisons, since national spikes mirrored across states.  Yeah, truly able circumvent natural vaccine antibodies effectively, ""outcompete"" argument makes sense. Sure, wont spread fast delta issue. Injecting it, drinking it, rubbing paste armpits. guess it, they're it... self-medicating dosage. smallest county US 64 people. smallest county Nebraska 400 Peanut butter first time questioned decision enlist lol 7 day positivity dropped 20% last week. looks like Delta burns population quickly, case, US re-mandating masks delaying inevitable, hospitals going overrun system strained, let Delta run though mid-August, covid done

It's September care share theory worked out? pretty much it’ll MU, delta ultimate variant squasher seems far. Iowa Octob/November … California’s August 2020 … Dec’20-Jan’21 … Aug/Sept ‘21

Those goalposts. 

More children indeed infected, ill, hospitalized, dying [than last August, [back US significant spike daily Aug 2020 relatively baby wave/spike compared Dec'20-Jan'21 Aug/Sept '21.

It wasn’t tell, counters everyone saying. 

It doesn’t. makes sense put minds people, see COVID kind divine test. survived it, think they've chosen, therefore need vaccine. outcompeted delta. vaccinated, hope are, things pretty peachy. feel bad hospitals dealing unvaccinated I've enjoying myself. Went two restaurants movies weekend.  Old people? LOL..I'm 48 years old. sure assume lot. Congrats, first person I've ever blocked reddit. Exactly. flu fucks people up. Remember swine flu?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Hey, I'm stopping getting wikipedia degree. power you. Ah, *is* link! Where'd find that?

I'll leave text case paywalled anyone. Daily Covid 19 cases exceed 100k day think It’s pronounced “mew” like Pokémon  Nobody said entire population though? though? Kids little risk. main risk may give someone else. parents family vaccinated little risk there.

My wife teaches 3 year olds ""pod"" starts tomorrow. Nobody wear masks (per agreement parents families). Obviously kids vaccinated families are, wife family basically everyone know. really see much risk.

Kids getting viruses start school happening long kids kids school existed. I'd try worry. article might help maybe people stop acting like US donated doses country.

RTFA - comments referring G20 countries US way, nz seems like cool country go f one

The statement former Prime Minister via current role World Health Organization. got nothing New Zealand.

From Clark co-chaired independent panel established World Health Organization review world’s pandemic preparedness response. ""There targeted vaccine teachers particular push teachers get one other.""

Knowing happening one state important thing note - statement factually incorrect.  going get Covid one day. cant avoid forever. sorry sounds terrible. hope get time soon. County in? I’m assuming northern ca asked professor ""Can organisms evolve ability evolve?"" answer. Meaning virus somehow evolved susceptibility mutation would expect see sudden boom variants. analogy chemistry might radioactivity instability isotope.   read article? New Zealand asking anything - statement *former* Prime Minister works World Health Clark co-chaired independent panel established World Health Organization review world’s pandemic preparedness response. cow industry wants know mu-ving new markets. long accepted human dosages, extremely safe would worry. problem people taking huge dosages leads issues ( true many substances) Governor Tom Wolf among pro-active leaders early pandemic, trying right thing educators. single dose factor seen benefit. specifically earmarked 100,000 J&amp;J vaccines teachers.  Hospitalizations fatalities highly concentrated at-risk groups age 65+ health conditions, vaccinated. younger people getting vaccinated much risk. makes sense see larger number cases, smaller number serious illnesses. problem studies CDC showing catching virus equal generate immunity response antibodies everybody. people within study receive immunity antibodies fought COVID infection. That's really fucked part. Math hard! CT started posting percentage vaccinated unvaccinated cases. like 70% cases unvaxxed 30% vaxxed. But, since CT 70% fully vaxxed (I think??), percentage like work to? like 30% cases, 30% vaxxed people right? like people talk prison statistics, like certain minority overrepresented prison relative general population size. calculate that? theory ""don't bash me"" knows plausible. But, mu bypass vaccines effectively, Delta gets breakthrough infections small pace, realm possibility mu cause widespread havoc vaccinated community delta continues unvaccinated? People lie, dude, even really important things. people really good it. curious hear messages booster thing, bit fuster cluck far. hope says something agreement FDA, CDC, scientific bodies rather telling everyone get third shot. WORLD LOVE AGAINNNN  Wow that's impressive.   hope end line lie vaccines prevent spread well. do. Mandatory vaccines students obviously waiting availability vaccine kids. hopeful FDA approved vaccines required majority school kids like many vaccines (MMR, chicken pox, polio, etc). Color impressed. 

I'm still trying explain troglodytes microchipped, ivermectin can't treat Covid, injecting bleach bad idea, rebelling vaccine make one tough, masks fucking help.  Also, many older Portuguese people still remember polio, measles chickenpox real threats back days. Unfortunately, that's zero risk choice either. I'm parent pull 4 year old Pre-K first week. school wonderful, community spread alone nervous.

But feel relief. worry grieve every day wonderful social experiences having. 

Keeping home lowers risk catching COVID (and grateful privilege that) costing real ways. 

No one knows better two bad options. love that! think sub rule editorializing post titles. said september updates kid trials, specify september would super interesting fun mechanic build game though... location based variant mutation... Religiosity seems decent indicator someone unvaccinated. new leader Israël good subject though, seen talk anything vaccines. interesting Nebraska ""only"" state without Mu variant. Allegedly. Hmmm.   Based current low- low-certainty evidence, uncertain efficacy safety ivermectin used treat prevent COVID-19.

This equate ""useless"". classmate high school gave tape pink album one side, Lincoln back 1988 1989. said, “you like weird music” gave me, completely unlabeled. literally didn’t even know band listening asked week later. People taking unproven, untested drug covid think covid vaccine untested unproven??

You can't make shit up. Please everyone read this, twice to. risks vaccinated people completely blown proportion.

we're living exciting times. :( problem taking doctor prescribed Ivermectin treat case Covid-19 (which probably useless, mostly safe). People self-medicating livestock levels drug. They're taking extremely high doses, sometimes long periods.

The end result messy (often literally). think you’re missing point. matter much whine it, get uneducated people whatever think right thing. 

My point got vaccinated first permissible opportunity, wash hands, wear mask take reasonable steps protect family.  family 2 immunocompromised individuals. 

My point know can’t depend others keep safe. 

The anti-vaxxers like teenagers acting out. they’re criticized chastised, act out. 

By imposing arbitrary guidelines, otherwise reasonable people take anything seriously know part they’re hearing bullshit. I’m making excuses idiots. I’m trying understand they’re idiots small contribution could make improve situation. 

Singing choir punishing children isn’t working. Misleading posts like give food current low- low-certainty evidence, uncertain efficacy safety ivermectin used treat prevent COVID-19. completed studies small considered high quality. Several studies underway may produce clearer answers review updates. Overall, reliable evidence available support use ivermectin treatment prevention COVID-19 outside well-designed randomized trials.   Yep say example population say 100k, 65k vaccinated. 1500 cases, 400 among vaccinated (""breakthrough cases""). 27% new cases among vaccinated, breakthrough rate 0.6%. numbers CT plug think find something similar.

What also gets lost illness breakthrough cases almost always mild, true unvaccinated cases. ""case"" different meaning.

The percentage cases vaccinated, percentage cases vaccinated population, totally different things. delta spreading younger unvaccinated population far cases group; older people vaccinated cases less frequent still occur. apparently ratio 25/75 areas. Yeah really argument ""cdc part deep state"" ""college scientists brainwashed liberals"". suddenly burden proof lies showing people organizations ""in it"".  quite strange bring here, yes acceptable parents make children obese, especially children even old enough truly making regular food choices (i.e. job buy food)

Obesity increases risk mortality considerably associated many chronic health conditions. Additionally obese child much hard attain much harder maintain healthy weight adult due fact body retains fat cells even they're empty metabolic changes occur. *pregnant horse woman realized you’re talking breakthrough infections. habit lately commenting wrong posts - oof. None people know vaccinated mainly wasn’t available time. friend made vent wasn’t vaccinated even though it’s available. What's really ironic anti-maskers anti-vaxxers ones complaining ""freedom"" simultaneously prolonging shit. 

You get vaccinated polio, small pox, measles attend public school. different? absolutely correct. Trying get nuanced discussion patient whether ivermectin actually helpful waste time. tried. times give dose used killing parasites move on. understand it’s function is. 

However, shown anti-viral properties. understand someone confuse treating preventing covid. 

However, it’s use covid it’s infancy findings make people draw conclusion one way another. point research needed people take sign use it. Politicizing Covid works ways apparently. That's false dichotomy. option ""unvaccinated emt emt"". gives much power people choosing unvaccinated. Make industry-wide mandates, company-wide. people want stay current field work, get vaccinated. People want abide basic necessary medical service first responder job. like someone believe CPR basic first aid.

Whether contract says B rarely matters employer's standpoint, unless union. employer whatever want gamble wanting deal taking court (their legal team bigger yours). Buy dip?  Abbott either brain damaged, evil. Either way needs relieved duties Governor Texas. ""leadership"" nothing help end pandemic. removed power outright neglience duty constituents mind boggling say least. definition ""make this""? U.S. get two weeks vacation year. People would much rather sick work hours. (Not condoning btw) Really depends personal situation. hospitals overloaded area? unvaccinated high-risk family members house see regularly? high-risk even vaccinated? take time work sick, without financial hardship?

For spouse answer things results us willing take risk getting sick, since serious illness risk insanely low us fully vaccinated. careful vaccines. point can't give living may get sick week... always risk. they? state legislature?

Why want leave? know small circle acquaintances 3 breakthrough infections. guess anecdotal data worse official. exactly saying. interesting weighting short long-term outcomes organism. Well least America half population would get winded climbing single flight steps pre-covid.  says tested yet whether thing works way around--from mRNA vaccine followed breakthrough infection, would exciting did. order would mean could still severity infection vaccine, infection would give massively broad scale protection mention here. I'd lean towards something related boosters rather masks. reassuring love reading this. I've known 6 fully vaccinated people gotten covid past 2 weeks getting really demoralizing.  hope female healthcare workers leave let state burn. Tell uterus, figure run vent ✊ I've worked least several people highly competent good work, really driven excel careers. bad employees require much management, essentially settled comfy IC roles.

When worked together office almost seemed like inspired passions others team. ""5pm, see tomorrow!"" crowd. pretty flexible work schedule, occasional late nights we'd usually make another week.

These people completely dropped switched WFH.

Sure--I'm saying evolutionary advantage ever get better. anything, evolved optimal weighting ""copy enough correctly reproduce"" ""mess enough chance survive long term"".

Ironically, balance struggle politically. Individualism (copy correctly) versus societal (long-term good).  I've never worked state CPS handles truancy. Used prevalent decades ago, three states worked truancy valid call would screened out. bet would fairly quickly address lot institutional problems. seen Copenhagen last weekend. first weekend fully open lot bars clubs long lines outside. nice life feels pretty much like pandemic now. daughter's sickness nothing anything that's going COVID?  OG, that's recent variants anyway. Much less Delta. Delta still smashing everything path. 

Mu mutations interest, epidemiologist's blog gets eaten spam-filter, RIP:

D614G: mutation common. started appear Feb 2020 every variant thereafter. mutation increases transmissibility virus.

P681H: mutation found Alpha variant (first discovered UK), increases transmissibility.

I've lost energy fight crazies, thankfully finally convinced mom dad get vaccinated. 

This really difficult, sadly is. 

Hang stay safe! balancing act - lack restrictions many countries applied incredibly destructive effects likely felt years decades. experience, presenting facts leads goalposts getting moved form whattaboutism. 

I definitely think conspiracies real, like example think hostile state actors intentionally trying poison us spreading toxic propaganda need take measures like actively fight it.

Didn't say that. Read usernames. require negative test work? thought standard guidelines 2 weeks testing positive… maybe things changed go bars times fully vaccinated. agree felt weird bit scary. Ended feeling quite anxious drank planned really relax. think never careful pandemic, really guys handle things within reason, mostly mentally. husband prefers anything (literally anything, even going store mins) things improve. hand social things like outdoor dining friends, outdoor concerts, indoor activity fall apart mentally emotionally. alone. going take long time know consequences actions.

We noped in-person school last day district allowed us choose. want elementary kids eating cafeteria. hard no. everything going parts country.

A week school little one going go open house last year's virtual kids. little one missing lot, I'm left wondering made right choice.

I hope virtual school lesser two evils. soon vaccine approved, we'll line little one go back school. then, suffer different ways. J J better people saying. According doctor it’s effective specifically delta variant zero doubt history look back Trump's politicization would normally straightforward public health threat tackled science, complete tragedy.

The implications politicization, COVID's long-term impact US, outside immediate death count, become clear time. Exactly wrote quote specifically. fucked. Thank information shared here! found insightful informative.

Are serology tests made available over-the-counter fashion? off-the-shelf fashion? must administered healthcare professional appointment? Sadly, [Portuguese seem among least vaccinated Massachusetts. 56% whites Bristol County, (where Portuguese-Americans plurality) vs 67% whites state overall. recruit hulk hogan, eat veggies, take vitamins, say prayers get vaccinated right? currently are, restrictions lifted. always balancing act. However there's doubt restrictions many countries applied incredibly destructive effects likely felt years decades. daughter got covid first week school going back week. half school currently home quarantined. surreal. ""the they've done date"" weird thing say “superhuman” immunity referring occurring got covid 19 early (or possibly even different SARS 2002-2003) later vaccinated mRNA, “naturally” immune virus. unless infected asymptomatic, likely don’t “superhuman” immunity article referring to. true, it’s pretty clear line article referring talking about. 

The truth that, context article, really *doesn’t* make sense. think implying, incorrectly, mu something worry emerging future. also possible “worrisome future” part isn’t referring *anything*, sounded like foreboding last sentence sort forgettable article. Nope. girl thing. can’t afford take 10 days work get break case. Yeah, totally politicized extremes, they're bleeding people low-rent radicalized party weirdness last years.

Ivermectin vaccine attacked like BLM, live saving therapeutics!

I think getting better, proof that, every time happening, hope positive direction fuel fire.

I even fucking know anymore. bit odd mentality groups. typically see people die meaningless ways, random ways. knew medic save retirement seen many people die cancer retired. group also comfortable higher levels risk often dumb things like wearing seatbelts. amazing! excited see results compare long term effects COVID. Hopefully people hesitant see data make rational, informed decisions. Sweden, among many others (20% deduction). rude, given referring 'horse dewormer' first, shows really know much drug.

I'd abandon train thought right friends people died. hospitalized people telling everyone get vaccinated. YouTube valid source imo tested first time? lot people convinced before. twas something else. fully vaccinated May 2021, still social distracte wear masks caught covid brought home gave five three year old. asthma rough lungs able receive antibody infusion think definitely helped recover faster. kids mild cases (my five year old fever hours kids maybe coughed five times each). think mild cases attributed fact case mild end, lower viral load. fully vaccinated husband never caught me.

I suspect caught parents' night school many parents wearing masks. vaccination pass driving lot vaccination among young Italy, required lot fun stuff summer, without one go holiday all. Saying people dumb dehumanizing. stretching term far. EMTs paid badly heard. pay EMTs we'd get educated people job. far know need take science classes EMT, need training program take test.  would good know data came exactly. Sadly think anti vaxxers impossible. know someone like know they'll say even studies like done find risks (emphasis ""find risks""). ""I believe them, they're it"". believe doctors paid / threatened stay silent. help idiots medical field refuse take vaccine... ""those people must know something"". Also idea person heard this, they're claiming Pfizer never got full approval extension emergency use. worth I'm gonna ask, even truth this? People still acting like thing vaccine . Sad part , people arent vaccinated never wore masks .

edit : yee haw Good point! 

Why drop kids supervised total strangers insalubrious soup everyday? make boss fell less insecure?! C''mon! Lots states track chain pharmacies bothering look up. busy, others mad many going waste mind someone got booster. 

People close state border could go next state too, dropped residency requirements supply exceeded demand. still exists, take plus usual vitamin cocktails. still causing issue people autoimmune disease.  Totally didn’t see hat coming. 🙄  Eric Topol trusts long thread explaining week show we've likely hit peak wave, numbers decreasing next couple weeks, asterisk seasonality waning immunity could bring trouble fall, recommended suggestion mass program boosters/updated vaccine. seem confound aggressive attacks thoughtful alternative reasonable views virulence evolves time pathogenic organisms &amp;#x200B;

I think idea mask mandates forever booster shots every 8 months doom-and-gloom. Mask mandates stay forever. Almost epidemiologist think so. honestly idea people get idea. 

And unlikely need booster shots every 8 month. looking likely three-dose regimen, like hep b vaccine. think people projecting influenza-virus properties onto coronavirus, virus, expect yearly shot like flu. get annual shot Hepatitis B, booster shot 6 months picking you, I'm willing go far ""innocent people got propagandized certain information sources"" idea. disservice millions Americans *didn't* go rabbit hole.

Adults agency. Nobody BS without permission. ""tricked"" people need acquiescence scam.  feel whole, we’ve said “fuck it” accept whatever deaths come….partly vaccine good protecting vulnerable populations, partly assume worst won’t happen kid. worst definitely happen *some* kids, answer society. 

The thing left mandate vaccine, we’re going that. It’s probably impossible national level, it’s non-starter least 20 states. 

I go back forth, today feels hopeless. details exactly this’ll entail? incentives vaccination, testing schools, stimulus, extended unemployment, etc? I’m kind worried sweeping mandates go down. Every reporter ran lose job. *least* make couple phone calls check facts. Holy shit.

The people scream misinformation worst spreading it.    also help people look percentages severity assume smaller group that's affected. 1 3% chance sound low, that's scale small. Consider 2,000 dead fully-infected city 100,000, 20,000 1 million, real potential risk becomes convincing.

Sure, 980,000 come fine, 20,000 would people every block. Everyone know one dead point. Chaffee Foley Democrats. rest county supervisors, including Do, Republicans. great news... We'll able quickly vaccinate remaining population (6-14 years old) given millions Sinovac doses usually arrive every month. now, around 72% entire country one dose, kids vaccinated might reach 80% more. makes room leave ""better"" vaccines booster shots (Pfizer AZ now) \*laughs southern\* would still randomly develop mutation resists vaccines mutation could selected for. chances mutation changes spike protein much completely evades mRNA vaccines high, ability change vaccine formulation match “new” mutant spike protein even better now. feel guys. Stay safe!  Yeah, that’s clearly best solution. point gotta ask “living it” actually means. messaging endemicity can’t collide long restrictions post-vaccination. gets dissonant while. pointing point number 1 false choice. provide doses world still generate supply additional doses. Vaccine production roof continues increase. end year, Pfizer produced 3 billion total doses, additional 4 billion next year. combined approved manufacturers volume vaccines produced year end staggering- 15 billion doses. 2022 see even higher capacity. We've come long way early 2021. expect challenges ahead, (knock wood) availability vaccines worldwide major problem moving forward.  It’s pretty safe bet least 30-40 million people “gave up” getting second dose whatever reason too. Look difference “one dose” percentage fully vaccinated percentage (~22%). That’s roughly 70 million Americans. Assuming 3-4 weeks shots 1 million doses give take administered per day, likely aren’t 30 million people actively waiting second dose, meaning 40 million abandoned/forgot/died/whatever. belief easily comprehensively proven incorrect. don’t know! says that? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Don't think really agree 70M ""more enough"" since surprised worldwide we're looking 4x unconfirmed cases. Ugh, scary. Glad seem coming side already  Vaccination rates gradually tick 

Unfortunately doubt one. anecdotal, know several people currently blaming vaccine XYZ health issues currently experiencing. bad ingestion headaches. Good luck convincing get additional shots. Also less cases COVID, even harder convince people get vaccinated. threat appear less immediate. Unless maybe really deadly variant appears. social media infatuation ivermectin equivalent someone 30 years ago looking symptoms medical encyclopedia convincing cancer.

We asked class sick knew right away apparently always messing mask, wearing eyes/head instead correctly, guess we'll play waiting game see gets sick. 

For 18 months everything supposed never knew anyone got covid, one week back school this, kind pissed off. Sounds logical enough me! already said matter when, if, get Covid variant. point becomes endemic (may already considered way?) we've exposed natural immunity less imminent risk provided. 

Everything date basically slow disease enough keep infections manageable level buy time get vaccines improve treatment approaches - there's never opportunity Covid ""Zero"". 

Eventually becomes like flu people feel like crap days get better - problem still today many people zero exposure thus natural way fight infection. vaccines exposure resolve time too. wonder many people get infected Florida go home get tested and/or pass away. early PCR test detect COVID? took PCR test Saturday. felt perfectly fine symptoms.

How keeping, thyroid all? Darwin increase 75% 80-90% move on.

I mean, no, won't. ""Darwin"" means ""people dying"".  think there's actually many people that. serious concern honestly, getting vaccinated greatly reduces chances getting symptoms all. Hopefully helps feel little bit better. problem **supposedly** something like 15-20% people America full anti-vaxx lot harder get versus lazy hesitant. Hopefully figure overstated. maybe they’ll find employment options limited decide finally get it. anyone surprised? First off, know endemic means? I'm sure based used there. means become normal disease exists population regular basis, like flu. 

Next, want address moment new mutations entire pandemic start over

This mutations work. vast majority mutations impact virus. small number mutations capability make virus contagious infectious (as saw delta). statistically, longer virus human population, usually trends become *less* infections infections. mutations also make disease less contagious less infectious.

Add fact covid novel virus, people's immune systems antibodies for. Now, majority population (in US) vaccinated contracted it, informed immune response. mutation likely escape immune response. severe mutation may mean body less effective fighting virus, still effective fighting virus novel clue. mutation mean entirely new virus, slightly evolved version old virus.

So no, pandemic going ""start over"". That's remotely work. Hope  Good. Hope increases. Last thing need strain completely evades vaccines also lie say immunocompromised.

If hunting third shot, I'd rather lie identity. worried aunt first several months past eligibility everyone ohh side effects I'm sure...

We got explaining absolutely right concerned effects beginning, look many people taken now. really worried 2nd week first major unrelated medical issue heard doctor 'Well guess can't *absolutely, 100%* rule related...' came got taking (doctor recommended) extra weeks. 

Luckily, easier since (D) barrage propaganda making part identity trusts know I'm talking since degree includes good bit medical background knowledge (neuroscience). Nah we're obviously getting variants Republicans in... India, Colombia South Africa refusing vaccinate.

Wait...   county moved less 4% since July 12. 53.1%. Much like land area maps vs population density maps see pockets highly vaccinated population centers large areas low moderate vaccination rates. military requiring probably largest employer guess. currently reading office. There's difference zero-covid strategy strategy keep hospitals overwhelmed.  Wait thought kids didn’t get sick? sadly making, didn’t like this; adults vaccinated could significantly reduced likelihood children getting infected. person Texas (and country) refused get vaccinated blood hands. Apathetic sure  we're UK, say ""fuck it"" absolutely nothing. Apparently, that's ""learning"" live it.

Thanks input. Wedding 200 people family want mandate vaccines fear offending someone. country article about. I'm 50s, left, jabs kid. England [This blog group epidemiologists biologists gives good overview similarities differences influenza SARS-CoV2 specifically rates mutation SARS-CoV2.

This shows previous infection even coronaviruses associated less severe COVID19 symptoms. suggests variants SARS-CoV2 emerge may virulent previously infected patients. important note possibility [antibody-dependent enhancement potential make symptoms reinfection even worse. Evidence ADE SARS-CoV2 clear moment. likely happening least subset patients. It’s throwing statistics. may checked point vaccination, government documenting softwares record everyone’s immunization records Right, so... vaccine/immune escape really primary concern. 

At point can't keep telling vaccinated people stay holed up. work. bad sociology.  people cannot concentrate home need different environment focus. indeed extroverts suffer WFH. Maybe people disabilities like dyslexia. Ah yes, blame international travel people US refusing get vaccinated.  ""The jury still out..."" ""...there good evidence support efficacy ivermectin treating covid"" belong statement. good evidence support efficacy despite studied, reason dismiss idea.  also case many countries. Maybe since COVID say...maybe rich people should, dunno, build hospitals offer incentives hire doctors nurses? This.

It’s time powers acknowledge there’s nothing prevent climate change.

Now it’s acknowledging *survive* climate change. hope give us issue antigenic sin. virus bypass vaccine immune response, also triggers old immune response whenever new vaccine introduced means right back square one. production data here: daily surely enough everyone, given least 1/3 world vaccinated we're rapidly approaching phase ""how get rich countries stop quintuple vaccinating"" get ""how secure supply Africa parts Asia?""

I get it, would nice produce 100m day, even absence supply chains focused higher-need regions could already make huge dent. heard vaccinated receive vaccine post-covid infection help restore resolve longer symptoms. post Sweden, I'm talking Denmark all.

Jesus Christ... I’m bed now. leave let confirm Sweden shithole. Congrats Job Security. point masks protect people around you, obviously can't completely prevent spread. keep distance still easily get infected... Like measures, obviously make less likely, talking mask wearing now? main problem would wrong environment could make sure safe first  Also, mutate less harmful strain. depends. 

Next week, indoors? I'd skip. 

Late October/early November, primarily outside? I'd honestly probably go, especially person someone important (and given wedding, assume likely case). 

The vaccines work. Breakthrough cases seem likely Delta compared original strain, there's lot misinformation going around people thinking vaccinated people likely get infected unvaccinated, that's true. 

Also, wedding later fall, think possible we'll back end surge cases falling again. poorly tracked states plus actually need form ID places. results trials 12s yet. expect end year. Nothing FDA EU regulator do. hospital obligation give people prescription medications. cases dangerous given state patient, medications receiving. Medication interactions common.

The notion forcing hospitals give medications patient idiot thinks would help absurd. Man... post Sweden, I'm talking Denmark all. think correlation viral load amount long covid all?  replication errors indeed random lead mutations.

What Extinction event talking less 50% 1st world county's populations vaccinated. 

The mutation enabled spread faster farther variants, replication error first happened spawned mutation infact random.  arguing different things. mutation happened different time would still random replication errors spawned regardless time failed spread compete variants.  Also:

- everybody gets 1 shot gets 2nd. 1 shot better nothing perfect leading indicator fully vaccinated.

- vaccines last forever, we're getting 8 months since first ones administered. Getting country get boosters going significantly difficult original vaccine.

While better late never, fear we've badly missed window knock thing via current vaccines. No? International travel main reason we're getting biggest difference kansas flu. proper term resequence code recombine genome.

Viral recombination well known, that’s asking source resequencing itself, something resequencing would imply complete re-write really threw off, thanks providing source clarifying meant. 

And note from: agree recombination may sometimes occur vaccine virus circulating wild-type counterpart. suggestive evidence occurred NDV vaccine virus circulating NDV strain (8), although know similar evidence mumps measles virus. Recombination yields virus mosaic genome containing sections parents. virus likely would exhibit virulence phenotype resembling one parent something between. thus create hazard exceeding circulating wild-type virus already present. 

This would suggest even happen it’s far likely create dud sort super virus. pretty much exactly said beginning article shared explained.

You literally said (paraphrasing I’m mobile): “we originally told 70-80% that’s enough? Allow doubt”

That implies think scientists arbitrarily moving goalposts, aren’t. still OG covid 70-80% would enough. Delta going take 90%+, similarly measles. 

You correct vaccine-only herd immunity highly unlikely point, isn’t it’s possible, it’s many people won’t get board it. operating place bad faith, condescending don’t arguments I’m saying except high school grade sophistics.

I’m operating bad faith guy, didn’t really say anything respond directly. made wild claims vaccines dangerous might recombine sars-cov-2 form even worse strain. suuuuuuuuuuper unlikely happen, I’m even sure it’s risk mRNA vaccines first place, able find literature that. 

You also made claims scientists advocating vaccination might cause additional variants, widely left field, burden proof squarely (and scientists) show wrong. doubly true far variants originating unvaccinated populations. think might want apply dunning kruger effect yourself.

No, know depth stuff am. know enough read (mostly) understand scientific literature, exactly stick literature try little conjecture possible. also try repeat single dissenting opinion it’s somehow fact. 

So one us acting bad faith again? latest data live shows 28% hospitalized COVID patients fully vaccinated average age 69.

C.D.C. reported terrifying fact July: Vaccinated people Delta variant Covid virus carried roughly viral load noses throats unvaccinated people.
The news seemed suggest even vaccinated highly vulnerable getting infected passing virus others. Sure enough, stories vaccinated people getting Covid — so-called breakthrough infections — around summer: party Provincetown, Mass.; among Chicago Cubs; Capitol Hill. Delta seemed might changing recent weeks, however, data become available, suggests true picture less alarming. Yes, Delta increased chances getting Covid almost everyone. you’re vaccinated, Covid infection still uncommon, high viral loads worrisome initially sounded.
How small chances average vaccinated American contracting Covid? Probably one 5,000 per day, even lower people take precautions live highly vaccinated community.
#Or maybe one 10,000
The estimates based statistics three places reported detailed data Covid infections vaccination status: Utah; Virginia; King County, includes Seattle, Washington state. three consistent idea one 5,000 vaccinated Americans tested positive Covid day recent chances surely higher places worst Covid outbreaks, like Southeast. places many fewer cases — like Northeast, well Chicago, Los Angeles San Francisco areas — chances lower, probably less 1 10,000. That’s Seattle data shows, example. (These numbers don’t include undiagnosed cases, often mild people notice pass virus anyone Here’s one way think one-in-10,000 daily chance: would take three months combined risk reach 1 percent.
“There’s lot miscommunication risks really vaccinated people, vaccinated people thinking lives,” Dr. Ashish Jha Brown University told colleague Tara Parker-Pope. (I recommend Tara’s recent Q. A. breakthrough unvaccinated, course, chances infection far higher, Dr. Jeffrey Duchin, top public-health official Seattle, noted. chances also risen much since Delta began Another way understand situation compare state’s vaccination rate recent daily Covid infection rate. infection rates least vaccinated states four times high vaccinated entire country received shots rate Northeast California, current Delta wave would small fraction current size. Delta problem. Vaccine hesitancy bigger problem.
#The science, numbers help show talking point viral loads problematic. one statements managed true misleading. Even size viral loads similar, virus behaves differently noses throats vaccinated unvaccinated person, viral load akin enemy army facing little resistance. vaccinated person, human immune system launches powerful response tends prevail quickly — often host body gets sick infects others. viral loads initially similar size end confess one bit hesitation walking data breakthrough infections: It’s clear much worrying them. vaccinated, Covid resembles flu usually mild one. Society ground halt Britain, many people become comfortable current Covid risks. vaccines make serious illness rare adults, risks young children low Britain may never recommend receive vaccine. Letting virus continue dominate life, hand, large “There’s feeling finally breathe; start trying get back we’ve lost,” Devi Sridhar, head global public health program University Edinburgh, told know many Americans feel differently. level Covid anxiety higher, especially communities lean left politically. “correct” response Covid. Different people respond risk differently.
But least one part American anxiety seem become disconnected facts recent weeks: effectiveness vaccines. new ABC News/Washington Post poll, nearly half adults judged “risk getting sick coronavirus” either moderate high — even though 75 percent adults received least one reality, risks getting version virus remain small vaccinated, risks getting badly sick remain Seattle average recent day, one every one million vaccinated residents admitted hospital Covid symptoms. risk close zero human mind can’t easily process it. best attempt say Covid risks vaccinated people order magnitude risks people unthinkingly accept every day, like riding vehicle.

# bottom Delta really changed course pandemic. far contagious earlier versions virus calls precautions necessary couple months ago, like wearing masks indoor even Delta, overall risks vaccinated remain extremely small. Dr. Monica Gandhi, infectious-disease specialist University California, San Francisco, wrote Friday, “The messaging last month U.S. basically served terrify vaccinated make unvaccinated eligible adults doubt effectiveness vaccines.” Neither views children?

You’re wrong impossible choice. enrolled 4.5 year old small private Pre-K GA. school almost everything can: mask mandates older class (3,4, 5 year olds), teachers vaccinated wear masks indoors, windows open weather permits, meals eaten outside whenever weather permits, one parents donated air purifiers classrooms.

But, still panicked community rates pulled first week. early August still hot eat outside and/or windows open. even mask mandates, consistently saw three kids walk every day without masks on. mean, they're preschoolers hope much.

So far, school two positive cases: one toddler room one older kids' room. closed five days everyone get tested. far know, cases turned up.

I worry much daughter severe case (the risk objectively small). What's holding back unknown - what's going happen infected kids 5 10 years? Possibly nothing. Possibly significant health complications.

But know missing really important social cognitive experiences. first five years important years life. There's recapturing mental potential kids right later 

So, today, thoughts county cases continue decline month get 50 cases per 100k, I'll send back October. then, weather allow outside day they'll windows open inside. 

Of course, rain still exist, meals inside. cases declining mean can't catch it. past month really made hit home much missing I'm afraid hypothetical outcomes.  Absolutely good result. Europe behind Spain Portugal first doses fully vaxed par higher Germany France. 

And forget every nation mentioned surpassed UK nosense vaccination campaing weeks ago total matter time made vaccine mandatory, pseudo mandatory requiring green pass everything, talking right extending use workplaces.

There always people thay refuse matter much make patetich life miserable. lost hope point virus help reduce number one way other. Sorry bad mindset Im pretty much done trying help saving life.

We've still got ways go matter well poorly think country remember there's whole world waiting vaccine. sounds cost effective practical. relative, 70's, got virus one year ago. First January 2021 asked participate research lab get bloodwork. month gets antibody test shown positive every month. Finished vaccines early February. June, test results included separate line antibodies produced vaccination. Recent September 2021 results show still high number antibodies infection vaccine. know one ""better"" fascinating. Also, sick 2 weeks virus believes still long-haul symptoms. symptoms vaccinations.  Coworker told believes covid surge vaccinated, getting sick, showing symptoms getting unvaxxed sick find really surprising. Portuguese family members vaccinated, they're Barnstable county. However, could Provincetown-- remember AIDS epidemic hitting region pretty bad. Wonder would perceived Germany. already Solidaritätszuschlag still paying reunion east west Germany.

Cannot think scenario anyone would happy add another one top. want make worse variants controlled research settings test vaccines respond it. done time proactively plan solutions rather go, “Let’s wait see future holds. Hopefully ok.” Lol Sorry rant though talking idiot Trump supporting cops still force spreading disease upon community unqualified impunity. Fire asses already. similar sentiment welcome aboard.

Hell, tree huggers making us cutters leave buffer strips along feeder creeks back 1980's salmon rivers right degrees temperature takes kill smolt. simple that. heroes really.  listened. agree.

I think ever getting rid Covid. point, stay vaccine job. Nobody ever said would 100% prevent us getting Covid, vaccine promise case keep us hospital. really sick moderate Covid immune compromised teenager same. Chances are, would have, least, needed admission, worse, vaccinated. telehealth visit doc yesterday, cried tears gratitude vaccinated. really doubt would tell tale unvaccinated.  


If people getting vaccine going get sick anyway, that's good enough reason, could prevent dying getting seriously ill. number people dying Covid significantly higher unvaccinated versus unvaccinated. dying vaccinated, median age 74 4.5 comorbidities (65% people died fully vaccinated, older 65). unvaccinated dying median age 53 3 comorbidities.  


The vaccine may stopped earlier variants spreading, job keep people hospital, thus causing hospitals become overrun, well prevent death vast majority. Paywall  entire report came one random reddit user posting Vancouver subreddit claimed they're UBC student.

I'm saying can't true, I'm saying entire article based absolutely nothing might well completely made far anyone really knows. totally understand that. Gibraltar big good case watch Viruses don’t try hurt people, goal reproduce.

Technically goal all. Replication do. Ah. love vaccine. Good Israel going first. Even US reached 100% vaccination rate, global vaccination rate FAR mutations happen anywhere world.

Probably high. think amount people 70+ vaxxed pretty high...possibly low 90's %. mortality tier probably like .1%-1%. blame morons refused wear mask (and still do), socially distance. 

not china. discussion guy. explanation combo following:

* Heart attack deaths number
* Cancer deaths number
* Car accident deaths number
* Victims violent crime number
* People dying unknown respiratory disease number (yes, really said that)
* deaths completely totally made never happened re-read second paragraph original comment? :)

But, clarify, ""reliable"" protection means fully vaccinated person, worst case scenario illness comparable average case flu common cold infection. all, US, that's vaccines sold public wanted get shots ASAP.

I covid twice got chance get vaxxed. cases, things completely manageable cough syrup day two rest. times, impact taste smell enough make comfort foods stop comfort foods.

This latest episode far worse. I'm almost completely symptom free eight days testing positive trouble breathing anything hospital worthy like that. hand, run bunch light errands today got put order self-isolate. least ones could done without around people much. stomach still acting up, got super tired stuff slightly physical. feeling confident returning work Thursday. Hopefully give Thursday Friday well recover come back Monday.

A number others pointed equally likely possibility vaccine kept laid sick home vs getting far sicker laid ICU bed hooked machine. Can't dispute one. I'm male, 37, medium body build, smoker, vaping, high blood pressure. So, I'll concede :).

I'm angry, disappointed, disheartened we're still dealing crap time many us believed we'd able get vaccinated put pandemic behind us now.

Me dad overly social distanced meetup New Year's Eve end 2020 (he never even got garage haircut then). agreed gather proper celebration least one us got properly vaxxed.

Unfortunately, appeared mild heart attack March 2021. went hospital kept observation two nights. Back then, stupidly easy jump vaccine line, tell last doctor work could tell safe get poked, cuz... heart issues.

He finally go get Moderna shots (2nd Aug 03), I'm still struggling tell still getting sick despite vaxx, maybe early October good long symptoms either end.

Sorry folks, totally expect think like 2nd half 2021. Anyone nerve saying dancing around using word “pandemic” long beginning last year. twitter post pretty insightful math: alone never likely job. got combine efforts. politics made 1 strategy vs strategy.

It's moronic, look data see effective stacking strategies are.

It's even moronic since thing people object compound strategies on. decide seatbelt airbag get car. decide want airplane seat life preserver oxygen mask board plane. obviously get both.

But reason comes virus, either vaccine, mask nothing. US least, Republicans Democrats responsible mess. Republicans pushed nothing secretly getting vaccine (all lawmakers vaccinated FWIW) Democrats pushed vaccine secretly hoping virus enough swing states help next election. I’ve thinking lately. Statistically, majority people infected COVID 1) mild/moderate symptoms need hospital, 2) last estimate saw long-haul symptoms placed prevalence around 25%.

Obviously 25% end severe cases, news grim.

But worry vast numbers cases don’t make news cycle. people legitimately say “I / sister / co-worker wasn’t bad.” People pay attention personal anecdote cold statistics, anecdotes side ostriches.  wonder many don’t know family member got vaccinated. Apparently, it’s thing teenagers get vaccinated without telling anti vaccination parents. Yeah - inconclusive. get said ""seems be"", even strong sentiment leaning direction one side. 

The reality is, know. 100% giving people ammunition get vaccinated based unknown. mean, one powerful people history went national television floated idea injecting bleach beaming light people's blood stream fever, chills, cough, headache, vomiting 24 hours. still lingering cough, feels fine otherwise. 
Thus far, vaccine working great keep worst symptoms away. Hoping streak continues.   Yes. Germany France beating heart EU, seen major issues protests. Please keep going. i'm sure true september 4th mu 47 states today 49, meaning least two cases happened weekend, counting whatever extra ones work south traditionally conservative industry.  immediate co-workers (engineering group) 1 vaccinated, prior reactions vaccinations.  production group work for?  I'd guess 50% management low teens technician group. necessary eventually. can't keep collecting new seasonal viruses indefinitely. I’m talking changing laws fact retroactively prosecuting people. law person question broke rules? quarantines place prevent death, knowingly break quarantine cause deaths, responsible actions? Who’s fault then? say ""Fall"" think Fall Louisiana? 

Because hot AF moment get relief late October earliest. 

So prepared sweat. lot! LOL!  evades protection vaccines, it. nothing. seen IQ drops long-haul COVID? Lead poisoning looks like 2-ish IQ points. Long COVID 7 people long-term hospitalized. 

This unique covid. mean important, course. really 30-40k covid deaths US""

how explain half million? Quick question...

Why worry flu common cold viruses mutating something deadly like COVID? possibility new variant flu/cold virus mutating something deadly us? Yet, never seem worry that. reason COVID would likely mutate something deadly vs something like flu? That’s funny (and also not) dog’s tail stuffed skunk lol. Kidding aside I’m sure whole thing terrible experience - mr. skunk come nowhere attack you? They’re adorable little creatures wouldn’t cute bitten. they’re big enough bet power behind bites.

Oh hell animal control trying take quarantine dogs. That’s stupid. know fact (in state anyway) pet quarantine home. need doggos doggy jail. get you’re saying, without source material stuff back say here, know commenter knows stuff beyond making sense sounding intelligent? 100% want trust OP hope u/afferent_input give us reading material. Otherwise taking anonymous users comment gospel truth exactly type thing need avoid! They've packed pretty much whole time. jury still out. That’s nonsense. virus around year half ivermectin isn’t effective. Stop acting like it’s real possibility.  Yeah, wiping high touch surfaces public areas regularly good idea. Still, vaccine developers appear confident. “To date, encouraged real-world data laboratory studies vaccine see evidence virus circulating variants concern regularly escape protection,” Pfizer spokesperson Kit Longley tells the Post via email.

Please careful say here. never going listen. take pride ignorance listening. I’ve got concern getting idiots listen. Same. view yearly doctor appointments yearly lecture French people alcoholics something. Really excuse talk receptionist phone.
 
But even jumped first vaccine could get. shocks could people even lazier am. keep coming Canada?

j/k love porkchops  ID, mostly mind.

They want people vaccinated. Lots illegal immigrants obviously want show ID.

Also people paranoid, legitimate concerns (like people wanted law enforcement something). Yes, they're trailing universal flu vaccine. really double triple universal coronavirus vaccines. odd reason we've come accept truckloads people die flu every year, adding seasonal covid worse flu, think pushing people find acceptable.

Divert far money anything make vaccines universal hope actually eradicated one day. travelled pandemic, Montana much, much better North Idaho. interesting. Moderna booster scheduled afternoon, can’t figure it’s another dose first 2, it’s new variant specific booster. idea came yet? Vaccinationing 100% population ever going happen. Herd immunity delta would take probably 95%+ population antibodies infection vaccinations. Breakthrough cases still happen, mutations still happen countries. may need boosters those. Also pain enable Android, done poorly named Fennec F-Droid (based Firefox) following instructions enable arbitrary add-on Firefox Nightly. oddly envisioned Charlie IASIP singing haha.

That boggles mind. Glad he's getting though.  infecting someone murder? see ethical questions now-endemic virus? culpability end person directly infected you? count chains infection this? 

That means literally hundreds millions people alive today logic murderers.

You see ethical issues there? yes, ethics factor whether imprison people.  mention snake oil salesmen profited it. Missed point. promoted.

Mother, Step Dad, aunts, uncles, cousins, second cousins. convinced 80 year old grandma get vacc months ago, used excuse go see birthday without masks. tried stop them. hoping catch it. 

My wife vaxed brother wife, yes, def echo chambers here. need two doses count fully vaxed though. US really behind compared Western countries  good news actual number children hospitalized covid still low overall.  let Rogan hear  Yeah, country waited 8 hours get vaccine. Totally worth it. day someone made point unvaccinated population frequent intermingling vaccinated ones, mutation occurring taking hold would higher chance bypassing vaccine. Essentially vaccine part environment one evolutionary selective pressures. 
It's theoretical, course, reason worry pockets vaccine hesitancy well-covered nations.  live Mar-A-Lago chance? safe say large chunk 24% unvaccinated allowed get yet!

We offer vaccine children 12, account 15% population.  strain covered vaccines? start Both. Evolutionary pressure milder virus everyone getting repeat exposure. long term, everyone getting covid antibodies breast milk repeat exposures early childhood.
