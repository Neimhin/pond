0,2021-11-28," Every country definition fully vaccinated. one articles refers to? [How  Worth considering - health population 1918 vs current day. Look number people drugs suppress immune system, never mind HIV, transplants, cancer, etc. 1918, anything seriously wrong you, probably died flu got you.  ‚ÄúSo travel ban southern African countries may slow spread buy limited time, it‚Äôs unlikely stop it.‚Äù

Ok slowing spread buying time good thing right? Aren‚Äôt travel bans net positive?  I‚Äôm embarrassed American half country dumb, know it‚Äôs problem elsewhere too. frustrating. wish media would read articles produced media. easily unhinged news cycle ive seem while. Dozens new stories absolutely new information. insane. goal push vaccination wait see one escapes current vaccines. baffling unless clicks right now. People assholes, spread virus. Virus jump person person. Virus dumass. R0 10-30 fucking doomsday ERs Lie. could parking lots dead bodies would telling people states keep living lives. He's lying.  Vaccines near certain provide high *protective immunity*. could lose (and really know since South Africa previously infected unvaccinated) *sterilizing immunity*. creates complicated scenario incredibly hard understand intuitive way. Could have, could survived. way knowing. know, tool convinced leave got significantly worse home. Ya 4 shots year? sentence boilerplate. haven‚Äôt enough elderly (or high risk comorbid) people vaccinated infected Omicron tell. patients SA young, entire population &lt;5% 65. headline sounds like written lawyer exactly together? US repeatedly hoarded vaccines monoclonal antibodies.

South Africa probably stayed quiet Omicron. strain started November 12th, maybe even before. It‚Äôs already everywhere.

Found new chant ward COVID spirits. It‚Äôs everywhere nothing happening Exactly, it‚Äôs amazing see people responding short sighted views. Almost bot like‚Ä¶ Remains seen. Current vaccines may confer immunity. hope we‚Äôll know weeks. then, I‚Äôm still observing precautions. enough data. HIV os also pretty mild, symptomless, 15years ypu may die.  Exactly. many people coming absolutism statements variant. anything harmless near apocalyptic extremes. need gather info first. downvoted much lmao  Lots heads sand see. Remarkable. could truth. employee friend long hired her. scared. scared. want safe. want safe. appreciated getting relevant advice links. beacuse crappy boss mean one.  Anyone double vaccinated get plane go beer jam packed bar without wearing mask Canada right now. keeping top sequencing?! going on. 70% COVID Alpha R0 2.8. Delta estimated 5-7! quite right. Personally, feel give damn ivermectin. human version dosage low toxicity profile would least shut it. It'll also give Merck Pharma nice profit boost. People putting heads sand Well, Quebec went 300 cases day (for like months) 1100 cases day span week two. Could related? Pfizer I'm guessing variant actual transmit much faster people people inside country bringing fresh people abroad. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre heeeeeeeere‚Äù Fair.  Fact is, kill brainfog long vovid can't make much dumber. main problem is, idiots risking parents grand-parents health lives. ironic Omicron Variant could also called Moronic Variant? This. can‚Äôt people this?!  Locking makes sense support measures - vaccine rollout, elimination plan, simply keep triaging ICUs great degree.

Agree though, Omicron looks rather different stage, hold hope succeed much outside exceptional circumstances point. Fear is.  I‚Äôm double vaccinated Covid months ago. took couple weeks. Got booster today continue wearing masks. üëçüèΩ Yeah, I‚Äôm asking question. seems like lot people clamoring declared endemic think word carries magical legal implications make virus restrictions go away. likely won‚Äôt. 

I agree may change public perception. part, public perception changed long ago. Living Covid something discussed long time. work guy told day likes Joe Rogan interviews everybody. Like scientists. likes listen Rogan learn Coronavirus. 

This guy work also happens unvaccinated loves trump. start pandemic pulled aside whispered got covid like brag. obviously lying order get covid benefits company, provide positive diagnosis remaining employees notified ‚Äúanonymous‚Äù covid positive case. never happened absolutely type would want covid benefits. guess: won't. I‚Äôm vaccinated. breakthrough case delta, fine. I‚Äôm extremely healthy, underlying problems, knocked ass two weeks. Lots symptoms‚Ä¶ sorry affects everyone different. fine. QLD SA able contain delta snap-lockdowns. NSW Government dragged feet hesitated locking down, tried sell idea ""delta containable"". hopeful news. Meanwhile make sure we're fully vaccinated including boosters sure wear mask! need lockdown right prevent things happening, probably worried economy. Somewhat tongue cheek, though put past certain governments. recently rewatched BBC documentary ""HyperNormalisation"" talks lot major superpowers (Russia China particular) thrive global order thrown chaos. Money. take years. absolutely right. Thank taking time pointing out. Stay safe. No, that's correct. Israel anti-vaxx representation cuts across populations - religious secular, Jew Arab, young old, poor wealthy, etc etc. group immune fear propaganda. probably time new booster gets emergency approval, new variant emerge. 

I wonder long cycle go on. unlike flu, Covid seasons"". know vaccine manufacturers keep new mutations, inadvertently occur. else countries need lockdown right prevent things happening, probably worried economy. countries‚Äô responses cripple economy country reporting new variants, fewer variants going reported. Dunno voted, clearly everywhere next days countries cases. Closing boarder really help community transmission levels time (if anything like delta) covid classic. Delta suggesting 85-90% total population vaccinated herd immunity.

If omicron even worse, we‚Äôll hold onto seats‚Ä¶ people say going get use COVID around forever‚Ä¶. literally cringe inside. need eradicate it! Well certainly want speed process either work nursing home 45-50% employees filled paperwork religious exemption vaccine, Total bullshit.

My question responsible deciding gets exception? corporate HR? state? Holy fuck, shut up. saw post 5 times already That's good point.   However take time usually COVID become serious....I think folks usually end hospital quite days initial infection.   believe time infection hospitalization typically 10-12 days. People tend slowly get worse.... sure many days positive test would probably quite few.

Either way hope best.  know much 2 weeks. *Braces Floridian*  Can't really compare pandemic killed 5 million globally total global war wiped close 3 percent planet's population pretty much leveled every major city across Europe Asia. I'm sorry, always feel need undermine people's current hardships comparing past events. empathy people truly struggled pandemic without condescending harping previous generations also suffered hardships. also quite rich suggest younger generations complaining wearing masks vaccines, really demographic risk covid shifting pants piece fucking cloth. Younger people concerned Separated eachother social ramifications restrictions, completely understandable. older ones throwing fits wearing masks minor inconveniences, quite typical generation unfortunately. left OZ couple days back expat family visit. Might end lucky didn‚Äôt stay longer. feeling guys may cool high vax rates, states. imagine money could made one start pop-up strip mall clinics ‚Äúalternative protocol‚Äù Covid care? 

Patients go there, docs prescribe special ‚ÄúIvermectin protocol‚Äù, let take hits 02 tank, send home.

There many people would pay hundreds dollars even one-time visit. experience South Carolina well. Literally. 2 days dozens countries reported variant. Closing borders probably useless. Testing vaccinations best choice. normally would say go, considering virus probably everywhere now, chances encounter regardless. go fun. know long left planet. Sadly next variant comes (at point likely Africa again) doubt quick share information again‚Ä¶ burned bridge. fuck talking about, hospitals security Lol. That‚Äôs (live work city proper). It‚Äôs weird stepping bubble wondering going inside minds people elsewhere.  Let‚Äôs honest, Texas Florida aren‚Äôt changing anything matter bad gets. again, rate transmission indicative CFR, people (like you) try conflate two, realize either ignorant purposely misleading people. majority every day people symptoms mild symptons covid exposed. CFR extremely low 50, generally low overall, compared epidemics. Fortunately, last months led people realize this. (I vaxed) Efficacy rates compared unvaccinated folks. 90% vaccinated folks get severely sick/die compared group unvaccinated folks.

So that's TOP 98%+ unvaccinated survival rate.  Yay?! Would jamming wheels trolley continuation metaphor? really crazy many diverse effects people.

I know someone personally psychotic episodes thought family trying kill got sick covid. prior history mental problems, seemed due virus luckily seems gone away recovery think terrifying. 

We know sure aunt uncle hardcore anti-maskers, prevailing theory amongst rest family asymptomatic cases house party later found one people positive. aunt ended Bells-Palsey facial paralysis lasted better part year normally last couple weeks. much issue except parts Staten Island Brooklyn. vaccine requirement show app card go movie restaurant, etc. I‚Äôm sure issues restaurants outdoor spaces eat don‚Äôt need vaccine. They‚Äôve put big heaters work. 

I haven‚Äôt seen anyone mask issues either haven‚Äôt taking subway. bus don‚Äôt get without mask.

You remember horrific March -May 2020 us. heard outside windows sirens 24/7. extensive lockdown lots people left city. experience left impression people.

Other people commented smaller places like barber shops bars Burroughs aren‚Äôt strict vaccine mandate I‚Äôve never place Manhattan large cultural venue hadn‚Äôt checked vaccination. think us have. Sometimes almost pinch myself, make sure real, sort nightmare. evidence coming board supposition person infected year. 

Most people clear virus around five fourteen days. reuse N95 masks? Let's say 5 masks rotate day, giving mask 5 days quarantining use, would effective? Yes, would good outcome sure, Omicron variant lot mutations Thank china üòí Excellent point. know start stopped serving refreshments clearly changed now, especially long flights think still report it. SA scientists road Beta last year. reported it. thing happened, lock downs travel bans. 
They report feel. happening already within country irrespective new variant soon cases increase. know I'll get downvoted this, travel bans stupid. everywhere. get everywhere spread there. evidence whatsoever vaccines work well it. People say buys us time. time exactly? 2 months, still winter weather around. many people vaccinated. Old people got booster shots many countries. game changing treatments likely appear. I'm really scared easily travel bans introduced post vaccine world. Please turn concepts freedom individual rights something owned far right.  Dude, got votes agreeing WHO, medical professionals whose job look medical health people several countries around world. 

There literally nothing wrong taking precautions possible protect yourself, family, well others around susceptible virus immunocompromised, young children 5 elderly. trying spread misinfo.

Then type things without confirming. That's literally spreading misinfo. [Scottish media BBC pads Health Scotland local health protection teams supporting contact tracing undertaken establish origin virus individuals come contact recent weeks.

Seems community transmission, albeit thin details. South African Airways flown commercial flight almost 2 years. Maybe realized may 2019 still true 2021. Similar situation here. I'm area first cases well, work retail... I'm super trying get covid again. even milder case vaccine, enough me. wrong. pointless, could isolate individuals monitor came contact them. Also, public would aware new mutation , maybe would take precautions. I‚Äôm hoping comes free toy Doubling case loads would kill medical system. wear masks, Don‚Äôt stick things bum, you‚Äôll waiting long time ER hard folding chair get thing removed. interesting know symptoms. I‚Äôm hoping omicron turns mild. Yes, affirmative. Sounds like smart move, countries follow suit. AZD? Grim. Interested see related travel community infections. yeap got scheduled new omicron broke thankfully end week. Gimme optimism makes think people learn others, even own, mistakes Agreed. comments saying 'hurr durr SA vaccinate first' smack western sense entitlement superiority, travel bans week make sense clearly everywhere already. Make multiple PcR tests, temporary self isolation etc, fine, blanket bans ridiculous.

The thing would say seems giving AZD premature would ensured level protection population simply now. Vaccine hesitancy appears built interim. chance

Don‚Äôt idiot. virus doesn‚Äôt care boredom, frustration, indifference. choose get boosted, hurting yourself. Yep. Great African solidarity. Fuck following science anymore get little worried Amirite? racism xenophobia global scale. 

Besides first case detected beginning November. ‚Äúdetecting early‚Äù here. around world already. 

Western politicians using score cheap political points home fucking Africa African economies it. 

How Americans get 70 80 percent vaccinated talk. Ofc can. problem south Africa essentially cut flights now. Another problem citizens - I'm sure instance Brit coming back UK UAE would claim South Africa recently, one would check whether that's actually true, I'm sure citizen South Africa would also go unchecked. Retrovirus different Coronavirus. Mu Nu Xi Omicron Pi Ro Sigma tau Upsilon

So Omicron might jump sigma Upsilon. 

get Sigma memes ready 2023 come UK upmost confidence?

Also matter came from? new variant exists going everywhere, matter nationality originated? shitty furthering point. even opened? waiting since start visit Tokyo... Masks shit dude, live one wears masks shit now, even ""scandals"" popular holiday destinations **no one** wearing masks, ever, cases never spiked whatsoever, already proven mostly seasonal thing whether there's mask mandate not, whether people wear masks seem much effect.

Then could argue people wearing masks careful things, that's hypothesis. FFVII üôåüèªüôåüèª   Yes timeline different. 3rd dose 8 weeks 2nd dose whereas booster 24 weeks 2nd dose. Wow, hot take. pharmaceutical company pharmaceutical work. would‚Äôve guessed. US great job testing COVID, meaning found lot cases.

If little testing little cases, that's it. viruses RNA. Oh shit, Biden sold vaccine ""ass turnips"" ""ass tulips."" extremely unacceptable lowest degree potential uncertain possibilities. I'm sure this, virus mutating improve ACE2 binding affecting age groups equally seems obvious evolutionary path. Bro wut ? read 2 positive Alpha variant, S-gene mutation ""dropped out"" results (one three identifiers molecular pcr covid tests look for, need two identify covid virus), actually makes easy track variant even follow-up genomic sequencing. shows results testing already require international passengers, could easily require documentation forwarded officials. take much effort US screen omicron. Yes, OP seems think reinfection shouldn‚Äôt possible you‚Äôve sick previously vaccinated: immune system doesn‚Äôt mean pathogen can‚Äôt reinfect, allows faster response blunts subsequent illness.

In terms spread, need hope thing relatively contained. spreads, higher likelihood mutations. It‚Äôs already mutates form we‚Äôve seen far - I‚Äôm really worried it‚Äôll find perfect host make much deadly (think movie Contagion opposed first wave 2020) So, wait. What? immunity vaccine natural infection longer protects us, offers 10 20 percent protection . concerned about, that‚Äôs info waiting find out. come say, problem vaccinations still working, everything go back November 26 whatever.

They're completely unrealistic scenarios.

There's zero chance variant actually harmless, there's selection pressure case. even variant high vaccine escape potential, we're nowhere near back March 2020 we'll new vaccines within months.

The truth always somewhere middle, know exactly middle yet. western Australian I‚Äôm amazed anyone outside Western Australia knows this. Strict visitors would say Japan pretty lenient citizens returning Japan. Home quarantine enforcement getting name published website one checks.

Seeing rise Omicron variant reminded one things bothered since January 2020 can't governments across world ban non-essential travel time being?

This true all. dumb agree, 0 social engineering methods affect highly contagious virus. methods work contagiousness low literally impossible beat exponential curve. zealot Mureddu convinced sick 67 years old man (Joe McCarron) leave hosptial. Mureddu related old man. old man's family? let stranger decide fate?

People boosters likely fine people aren‚Äôt boosted. folks natural immunity also antibodies nucleocapsid spike actually helps immunity spike mutations. get scared
magnetise toward scared idiots
parrot dumb shit internet symptoms? Okay, pay taxes debt matched, since could prevent circumstance mean buy thus right use it. South Africa, government wont able enforce mandate. Idiot opposition parties block courts block everything.

What help us pretty much every major corporation I'm aware going mandate place January, basically like working us get vaccinated, first court case finds companies favor (obviously individuals taking court the. Resources locked up) ripple effect clearly didn‚Äôt read link US government. statement matter. said US doesn‚Äôt require testing. said Unvaccinated US Citizens required test, per government site. rude boo, mention media blackout time (sound familiar?)

Spain country report deadly influenza hence dubbed Spanish flu. ‚Äúfact‚Äù we‚Äôd lockdowns instead actively fighting aliens, adds extra goosebumps me‚Ä¶ like terrifying et mofos wouldn‚Äôt even try put fight ?! Sure. flip side SA vaccination figures don‚Äôt look great. everyone shits SA created mutation. Meanwhile cases incredible lay low months. 

We never stopped mandating masks.
We never stopped mandating social distancing.
We opened social events fully. 
SA still 11pm curfew.

SA found omicron. SA found beta. 

And SA country get outright travel ban essentially whole western world. Mine got poor care too. way Covid. happens alot eldercare. cousin south Texas said actually ready hospice. Whereas friend, 50 year old nurse plays tennis needs joint replaced pressured hard DNR. dementia either. Crazy stuff.   Wait like upcoming Holidays? Even without omicron wasn‚Äôt gonna happen  people follow public health guidelines. Africa either, places like South Korea, Vietnam, China, Japan etc also fared relatively well compared U.S., UK, Brazil etc He's going distance new Omicron variant 10 mutations spike protein, legit concerns variant could escape immunity. think Delta, 3 mutations spike protein enough lower efficacy vaccine point still could get infected Covid

I doubt Omicron going problematic Delta, number mutations best indicator. Mu Beta mutations Delta never took off. can‚Äôt speak EU, Germany Hungary absolutely increased respirator ICU capacity totally support lockdowns buy people time vaccinate, increase hospital capacity development new vaccines. 

on side note far know (at least EU) effort made increase hospital capacity‚Ä¶ nearly two years crisis.

the way crisis managed absolutly‚Ä¶ well pff  basically illegal detain prevent citizens entering country reason. 


Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaahahahahhahahahaha. 

You've never dealt CBP officer bad mood then. absolutely detain number reasons part legacy Patriot Act. cannot deny entry citizen(which international standard American one). absolutely detain you. Try entering US 5kg heroine luggage tell CBP ""it basically illegal detain citizens reason."" Come dude. I, numerous friends, detained upon reentry ISIS thing extensive travel history Turkey countries. friends even Iraq years ISIS became threat. got detained questioned hours upon reentry. Despite us nearly opposite ISIS-supporters get! idea like go process. One previous trips London actually pulled aside prior boarding told, bluntly, ""randomly selected go enhanced security screening request United States government"" proceeded strip searched belongings taken apart front tested number things. stopped arrived back America go process questioned, again, trip. yes absolutely detained citizen denied entry country. Immigration officers USA great deal power seem realize.

As quarantines, history enough examples quarantines enforced USA someone researched would say quarantine individuals. legal precedent so(Mary Mallon one infamous examples). lack willpower enforce said rules. states actively banning enforcing quarantines public health tools. appalling. God help us get truly lethal airborne virus high mortality rate many states banned containment measures, tools left stop next outbreak. hate people saying ""we can't this."" absolutely *can* people actually stood jobs. Plenty nations adequately demonstrated quarantine people. USA could well well! long people willpower anything, mean cannot surprised nothing done. future SA cover up, would simply put much resources tracking new variants. little upside first country declare new variant. FDA approve much risk. Half posts say harmless media twisting words doctor said virus unusual symptoms (but mild). I'm 100% sure dumb say entire virus mild based 7 clusters say unusual symptoms sample size 7.

She saw young patients healthy men. wanted highlight extreme exhaustion rapid pulse. Media seeing went say ""omnicron mild symptoms"". getting seriously ill large numbers therefore overwhelming hospitals largely unvaccinated.

This fully true, healthy young peoples dont get severe illness.

actually young healthy 20 years old unvaccinated less risk 70 years old vaccinated.

There reason apply lockdown vaccination status alone foget many age biais disease. bold strategy, Cotton. Let's see pays him. Would even work? mean HIV unter control medicated sure, pretty much normal immune system.

But ""active HIV""? even generate antibodies?  That‚Äôs I‚Äôve always theorized, pandemic, Japan probably trying enjoy former glory days isolation world long possible. Covid‚Äôs convenient excuse kinda ‚Äúkeep Japan Japanese‚Äù long possible. Also really hate Japan wants stay closed off, problem sending students, workers, etc around world everyone else isn‚Äôt pushing hard enough reciprocal agreements recognizing vaccine certificates. example, supposed go grad school Tokyo fall obviously didn‚Äôt happen. Yet friend Yokohama friends able go LA fine, prove vaccinated good go. happy LA year study abroad, can‚Äôt help feel sort resentment.  Los Angeles. Everyone on. GUARANTEE either virus already Japan, still arrive spread like wild fire sometime latter, matter fancy schemes sound like‚Ä¶ unless completely isolate rWorld isn‚Äôt possible 21st century‚Ä¶

All measures pointless. Learn coexist virus. Ironically idiots brainwashed get vaccinated fueling moneymaking. could've mess now. mean that's objective standpoint perfect sense. Natural antibodies well shots. need get well who've shots contract virus boost immune system even more. words, big number balls always form shape end, even though none knows new Omicron variant 10 mutations spike protein, legit concerns variant could escape immunity. think Delta, 3 mutations spike protein enough lower efficacy vaccine point still could get infected Covid, vaccine still offered protection enough land hospital ICU least selling point Delta, now, Omicron 10 mutations, vaccine could good nothing, that's everyone's biggest fear governments overreacting closing border, whole situation starting look like early 2020. self-inflected stupidity and/or laziness reason withhold medical treatment smokers get lung cancer treatment? morbidly obese people type two diabetes? Sunbathers melanoma? draw line? Maybe people cardio + high blood pressure? Oh, definitely avoid pissing Xi CCP.

I'd respect said that. Hell, I'd small piece respect actually made plausible lie. 

The fact they're lying us pathetic lie shows little think us. requires people want vaccine. deadly diseases clear evident threat personal health lot easier ""hey sake society please"". enough vaccines go around. reason low vaccination rate people choosing get it, whatever reasons. Sure, eat Skittles it. point propaganda.

Yes mutations spike protein, normal. Yes, mrna vaccines based spike protein.

However, protection severe disease death relies heavily T-cells, epitopes yet significantly change. mention bodies adaptive immune system undergoes somatic hypermutation provides VAST protection likely variants one come across.

Get vaccinated odds severe disease death low.

Wear mask.

Have rapid tests handy. live Bamako, Mali. sufficient vaccine supply could vaccinate maybe 10-15% population started wasting doses declining new shipments. People simply want vaccine.

The sad reality Western Sub-Saharan Africa remain vaccinated long supply issues solved. Yes does, case matters. contact tracing exists. open faucet more, cases come multiply exponentially, like stating. Less less less better unknowns effects new variant us. That's casual low level shade rest country Westralian friend. dirty New South Welshmen got chuckle me. 

At least Queenslanders like foreigners, like china israel. ""very high risk"" precisely yet know whether compete Delta. I'm sensing misunderstanding means viruses ""compete"", understandable given way word used contexts.

If compete, means antibodies either variant effective other, infected one likely prevent infection other. scenario, whichever one effective spreading may replace other. Omicron competes Delta less likely cause severe disease, could extremely good may end out-competing Delta.

However, compete? would mean antibodies one effective could end 2 variants infecting communities simultaneously and/or consecutively. scenario, even Omicron less likely cause severe disease, total number cases could skyrocket. could lead higher case loads hospitals already near capacity. would extremely bad. 

The worst-case-scenario Delta Omicron extremely dangerous transmissible, compete, Omicron bypasses vaccines.

Right now, know enough, safe option treat compete prepare worst scientists work.

Now there's actually nuance couple scenarios, point that, right now, best tool take data make projections, prepare projections data deems likely and/or dangerous. get data, projections improve. Scientists working hard get best data possible, takes time. Ironic people protecting must needle-phobic think beats vaccine. even feel mine done Bullshit, partner meant fly uk today tested lands. Omicron news like 3 days. hell ""oversold"" kind narrative it? Particularly one concern?

Are referring **one** reddit post quoting South African doctor discovered it? variant everywhere already. 1 case 10 next week 100 week after. matter anymore stop 5 flying in. Let vaccinated folks in. Would fair game. That‚Äôs like saying wear mask it‚Äôs 100% effective. writing me? Probably Unicron May sounds promising. Maybe don‚Äôt shit pants fart diarrhea. It‚Äôs wrong statement doesn‚Äôt mean shit (or yes, diarrhea case) [It sure Westerners travel 3rd world African countries what? force vaccine arms people want it? think dramatically underestimating level vaccine hesitancy Western Sub-Saharan Africa. I'm Bamako, Mali right maybe 1 ever 10 people talk say want get vaccine. 

Simply supplying vaccine going damn thing 3rd world African countries. Idk Westerners seem get this. sounds like transformer me, think might showing age! Travel ban allow countries gear prepare fight new strain.

The last thing everyone want repeat china initially handle covid. sure one like when, one country hide distort truth.

Be responsible right thing, withholding distorting facts. nations behave like rogue country different way china handle initial covid situation. 

The important thing contain virus, another newer mutation countries countries may chip help out. Like delta variant contagious sadly would bad. many countries Europe healthcare system barley able cope cases is. 100%  Six jumbo jets Johannesburg landing day Atlanta. like 7-0. Oh you‚Äôre talking 48 hour ban lorry drivers modes transport unaffected? bring up? Ah, got it, curious lost 1 week window tourism open, lol. pressure mutate less deadly occurs viruses kill host spread spreads restricted circumstances. example Ebola deadly spread direct contact bodily fluids. Even flu usually spread start feeling physically ill. 

COVID spreads several days asymptomatically thus pressure become less deadly. mutations accrues completely random. better worse. Africa AIDS crisis perfect place happen mutations tend occur immunocompromised individuals. article make timeline clear? long ago South African player return Portugal? available cost *lot* 35%+ unemployment low wages here, many would choose either Covid test buying groceries. Testing positive also means isolate also means people go 2 weeks without income.

It's really Covid starts spreading affluent white populations start seeing numbers officially rise. medical insurance, afford tests financially crippled going weeks without working. Typical sociopath. Question though, whether either way would way out.

I see two scenario's:

1. infectious, less deadly, would way obvious reasons.
2. infectious, deady deadlier, would next 4 weeks infects everyone, hundreds thousands die world wide short period, may also over. You‚Äôre right. marry me? There's catch 22. reason theorised highly transmissible poor cross-immunity delta. that's true immunity gained create much protection delta either.

If good cross-immunity able outcompete delta. Yes, recommendations (middle sentence) sensible, think first last sentence? Anti Vaxxers: Huh? abundance evidence they've achieved nothing I'm spend 30 minutes looking links common knowledge point. can't anything, trying control highly infectious diseases via quarantine nature disease asymptomatic period still spreading useless. get everyone eventually best solution make sure bodies prepared much be. *who* *you* ask WHO? Thanos here?! Fair enough, thanks letting know.  One releases antibodies one releases cytokines like sounds like whatever they're saying tangential actual proper thought. understood it, best vaccination including booster infection.

Then fully vaccinated infection, infection gives better immunity exact variant, worse variants. Hopefully recover fully, stay positive  I‚Äôm asking who! think link broken?

The sequencing stats available here: 20 African nations sequenced greater proportion positive tests South Africa (although there's another debate look terms testing rates course).

I deny said last paragraph. travel bans involve block countries southern Africa rather South Africa. hotels rather compound New Zealand, many five star, although we're switching away home isolation change strategy. Unless Omicron upends that. reminded radiolab episode: give week two, Omicron discovered countries, Africa-specific restrictions probably dropped. people vaccinated caught Delta recently recovered could catch new variant may antibody/vaccine resistant. chance could rapidly wipe Delta variant. long term effects, wait see.  I‚Äôve seen. Yep im sure countries going report omni cases us officially declares some. also criticised countries closing borders South Africa. pathogens spread killing host. Anthrax one comes mind. Smallpox could also spread scabs, ‚Äúcontingency plan‚Äù variola virus.

You right cannot *rely* virus becoming less virulent. hand, fact we, host species, even aware taking measures prevent spread, would apply selective pressure. time, even imperfect vaccine still buy immune system enough time get infection control evolve new antibodies. Well way pandemic clear. Vaccinate much possible three shots. Even take bit time become ""noise"" Planning trip asian country week, really rethinking point. 

Feel like could full lockdown 2 weeks. Yeah pressure like example Africa strain seems originated. Poor students.  3 go SIGMA strain. Look sigma male memes understand context. Yes speculation have. don‚Äôt see anything wrong articles draw expert opinions good know least possibility. AZ turned actually work fine highly effective. we've seen vaccines require booster shot like J&amp;J one done vaccine better AZ. make lot bad assumptions. said solution problem, ineffective. Feel free provide evidence ineffective. still smell ‚Äúif can‚Äôt everything might well nothing‚Äù ideology. remember travel bans Alpha identified UK Delta India? France literally closed border isolating EU lorry drivers UK Christmas due alpha. 

WHO may saying travel bans countries ignoring entire time. nothing Africa please stop victim mentality.  movie variant deadly vaccine resistant purposes plot tension. know noting virulence omicron even sera neutralization studies would tell us responds antibodies petri dish, never mind full immune response actual human. likely days weeks better information. trouble managing anxiety consider disconnecting. reddit news bit then.  Also looking vaccines protection delta offers reduction 80-90% serious illness. 12 people x rate serious illness vaccinated seems small.

Even rates serious illness death delta, would bad, higher transmissibility. compare communicable disease covid diabetes cancer? also poor indicator COVID-19. example Alpha variant much deadlier original SARS-COV-2 virus mutated from. don‚Äôt think football team going less vaccinated even Portugal whole 90% vaccinated. I‚Äôm curious real data vaccines used. poster‚Äôs recommendations perfectly sensible. That‚Äôs said last time well one knows yet . front page alone see articles saying going global threat countries prepare articles saying mild may good thing countries banning foreigners seems like overreaction really mild. None new articles coming guessing without verified information helping things residents coming approved countries little 10 days vaccinated, could done home. Problem unless live Tokyo it‚Äôs easy get home airport can‚Äôt use public transit. really wait data. Still little known new variant. Although say we're screwed I'd say setback totally back square one. E484 immediately stood me. recall one variants also E484Q. believe E484 changes reduce ability bind ACE2 pretty reliably thus far contribute greatly immune evasion.

N501Y also stands comparison, changes positions B.1.351 also characteristics B.1.617.2, B.1.1.7, etc. new ones... L452 though?  Thanks. would wildly unexpected turn makes sense theory. 

That said - thought Omicron little relation dominant Beta 2020? naive thankfully allows make decisions stock investments market react. /s sensationalism days, painful watch.

I know 'journalists' home country salivating first confirmed case bring red caps 'breaking news' banners. think becoming clear transmissible delta. speed seems spread must higher delta already quite high.

Now add lot mutations good chance evades immunity (many omicron patients doubly vaccinated) made youself nice shit soup.

Seems reasonable err side caution here.   cousin want get lead poisoning get vaccinated.

Can't pick family guess. hundreds professional soccer teams across 10+ countries Europe, really think use catch say 90% fully vaccinated think thing ""proven"" either vaccine-induced natural immunity show large degree variability one person next. Towards end TA:

""""The presence multiple mutations spike protein  
receptor-binding domain suggests Omicron may high likelihood 
 immune escape antibody-mediated protection. However, immune  
escape potential cell-mediated immunity difficult  
predict,"" said.""

Can someone ELI5 difference antibody-mediated protection cell-mediated immunity ? Well find could quible stats definition tiny literally one African country meantioned PDF.

&amp;#x200B;

And vaccine inequitiblity population mass Africa going many new variants coming Africa. majority descovered SA countries Africa almost testing. sure this? I'm meant flying home UK Christmas, transitting Tokyo - think would still happen right now? Moderna/Pfizer combined around 600m doses month 2022. They'll ones update vaccine produce quickest.

This hopefully need 1 dose regimen already vaccinated, Moderna Pfizer able produce sufficient doses next year dose entire world needed.

AZ/Novavax/J&amp;J would take longer adapt scale production vaccines expect. I'm honestly surprised South African patriotism recently. probably surprised, I've never seen before. think best bet would search answers experts. field. almost certainly here. Remember kept finding cases Alpha earlier earlier knew look for. far know, there's little variant-specific testing happens people get tested. impression sample flagged ""covid present"" fraction sent bigger lab sequenced determine variant then, wonder prob/stats, determine many samples probably variant. process takes awhile - sometimes weeks. There's testing variants here, Delta. Weren‚Äôt largely disproportionately young vaccinated population? so, doesn‚Äôt say virulent would broader population. One country community spread dominate spread travel reason it‚Äôll kill less time people sort pre existing immunity, variant less severe. Scenario 2 likely mutations spike protein.

As long main virus body unchanged, would maintain deadliness.  seems like ever science US says something worried distance government rushes say it‚Äôs fine. can‚Äôt help thanks billionaire behind scenes whatever stock doesn‚Äôt plummet. don‚Äôt trust anything anymore. idea organization isn‚Äôt corrupted US 1%.

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated 8 year old. I‚Äôve read much shit country corruption past several years. would rather people die take profit loss. wher dat sexy arcee  Yeah ‚Äúfair‚Äù probably wrong word use. That‚Äôs situation anyway, making example. 

Anyway idea ban countries travel unless 75% vaccinated screams ignorance. gun hanging Eligible population. includes 5+ year olds. People think Japan small hear population density. consider lot land Japan mountains, basically suitable development, hear ""lack space"" ""population density"" ideas. live? live DC frequently travel SC, week per month average. DC arguably one strictest lockdowns beginning WFH since start life changed 0 except maybe first month. 

I outdoor dining bars open SC late April. going trips beaches friends wife early May 2020. flying back forth DC SC entire time.

DC outdoor dining August 2020 latest, can‚Äôt remember earlier don‚Äôt pictures phone time earlier. 

I could never travel, could never gather friends limitation going grocery store, never lines, self restricted first started. fucks sake gym SC didn‚Äôt close May gym DC reopened August 2020.  Yes. Get countries vaccinated get ostracized. It‚Äôs simple. country Europe supply issues anymore, it‚Äôs entirely fault antivaxxers. Countries need start putting harsh penalties antivaxxers immunize populations criticism would expected nuance (and understanding it) world much would depend much less severe guess. example twice contagious Delta slightly less severe Delta wouldnt exactly great situation since would end sending people hospital Delta since slightly less severe wont help much spreads far easily.

But lets say twice contagious much much less severe sure could probably work favour. 

Another key bit also protection vaccines prior infection. vaccines etc still least protect us severe disease help us tremendously since least know line defence rely on. get mix early! Thank using sense logic.  understand all, positived may Africa themselves. But, early recognizing Omnicrons presense, degrees seperation idientified cases, host brought part World, going narrow. travel link. Obviously circulating Europe time now. still, EU bans flights bunch southern African countries. worries. specific going forward. Crazy 1-2 words completely change perspective single issue.
That would crazy fast overturn Covid admissions. USA, average length stay hospital Covid patients 10 days. New admissions doubling every week triple inpatient stays. Hopefully recovering quicker. DGAF ‚Äúfair‚Äù you. There‚Äôs global pandemic. ‚Äúfair‚Äù literally last thing list priorities. Really? people Botswana contact anyone Holland something? statistically impossible? I‚Äôm bringing theory Holland/Belgium/Germany worst outbreak worldwide moment potential variants would seem high there. Also, since Holland/South Africa close relation/lots travel two, could possible variant jumped two early stages, well detected Yeah sounds lovely /s imagine people experience alpha delta variants COVID. exceptions supposed rule evolution? evolution generally described popular communication. Yes, inaccurate misleading. Good know UK always keep borders open porous.

**Welcome matter they're from** 

**Welcome OMICRON.** That‚Äôs crazy, one point I‚Äôve found round trip tickets Tokyo DC like $480, $500. reason b sad..  So, family thing probably relevant yes. places rules visit ""tourism"" family.

And rules changed, talking flight NE SA, doubt would restriction time forcing people test departure.

Could wrong though, I'm 100% Thank you. you‚Äôre vaxxed, not?   Ah bad, misunderstood you. believe *total* hospitalisations tripled due lot getting discharged. Travel bans clearly work. like quarantine, bigger. Look NZ. People literally though .... Yes. see too. Either unvaccinated 1 dose, which, since days delta, unvaccinated. 

Epidemiologic week 45: 135 admissions
Epidemiologic week 47: 580 admissions
Quadruple Yeah, mean end day comes better safe sorry. Japan already pretty locked was, anything unusual them. Hopefully weeks get data, we'll better sense bad, fingers crossed. Might mean June 2022 upper bound though cynical ass says knew didn‚Äôt care, that‚Äôs assumption. See: trump phone call Woodward ‚ÄúSadly‚Äù fair, clinician reason even know variant right now. advocated test new variant patients seeing showed different symptoms delta. 

We definitely need data, important note reason even sound alarms omicron speculation different symptoms.  US given vaccines nations rest world combined? Oh ya, has. much hoarding vaccines. Also, quit trying make race issue, pathetic. Travel banned that's concentrated. Quit trying woke, simple. statistically impossible sample found Botswana 11 november come Netherlands. Totally right. mass amnesia rationale universal vaccination prevent variants. sudden might good thing seven billion cases asymptomatic coronavirus?  Good ELI5. True name Buy time what, specifically, much time ? Yes. co-worker tested positive twenty days ago. Fully vaxed booster.

He quarantine twenty days immunocompromised. that's recommended time immunocompromised peeps.

He gets back work Friday. Looking forward seeing again.

Only person I've heard situation. likely immunocompromised. 

According texts, flu like symptoms majority quarantine time. Poor kid everything right. 

Unless immunocompromised, feel fully vaxed booster still warrant lot ease mind. Ymmv.  could actually *be* WA, crying help, sending coded message held hostage. user starts ordering pizza 911, we‚Äôll know what‚Äôs up.   get reputation   think that's mostly wishful thinking moment. COVID becomes transmittable person symptomatic, virus really much evolutionary pressure become less severe. 

So far seems young people get affected Omicron, would mean higher percentages people ending hospital. Even less severe, transmissible likely pack hospitals better Delta, lead deaths greatly reduced quality life many people (at least time). Furthermore likely put immense strain US insurance system, given exorbitant cost hospital stays.

Then economic implications. Businesses started bounce back places, likely deter patrons, partly also due media hysteria. Winter time also notoriously bad viruses. Likely lead confusion around anticipating consumer demand, screw supply chains (they already terrible, consumer goods, also companies machine manufacturing, high tech, industries)

I also expect implications vaccine hesitancy. booster shot fun (for me), know people support vaccination hesitant get due awful side effects last days. picture emerging need boosters every X months, people willing go long that. many, barely agreed get 2 shots, asking get one reoccurring basis. yes, virus undoubtedly far worse reoccurring need vaccination, however fatigue mental trauma caused whole ordeal exactly made people think clearly. Couple absolutely insane politics US, one party (in 2 party system) effectively taken anti-vaccine mantle, recipe disaster.

Does make furious people want take vaccines believe BS conspiracy theories? Yes - literally participating killing fellow countryfolk ignorance stubbornness, also damaging economy causing economic impact felt many years come. Furthermore, wealthy western nations need lot terms making vaccine available globally, including opening patents, think CEOs Pfiser Moderna enough billions afford nth yacht mansion. insanity

Not stop spread perspective

But planes best chance understand severity omicron . controlled group, see much variant spreads testing everyone, testing multiple times see incubation period, look percent vaxxed tested positive , follow group see hospitalization numbers look like

Honestly huge mistake people cdc fired argument getting test diagnosis ASAP  That's pretty much happened grandfather way COVID. health declining, caught flu right moved overseas, skipped seeing avoid getting sick. ended dying year later. think Belgium.. 4 cases vaccinated. bypass immunity, know often certainly early know much, omicron first found samples 3 weeks old. So, data many patients, data taken 3 weeks patient progress. South Africa whole really negatively affected travel ban?

It seems like 1% pissed allowed go vacation/business trips. Except vaccin moderately helps prevent infections. without doubt effective severe disease, good preventing infections.

Which means vaccinating everyone SA likely stop variant, alas. South African people probably form immunity already anyway.  might manifest almost entirely mild symptoms like Israel seen far. People need better fear mongering. That's really sad. know hope still manage stay touch ways. Omicron.. sounds like something transformers üòÇüòÇ article appears South Africa requiring tests, US felt good enough. high? everywhere. health organizations come incompetent say anyone common sense knows someone chronic fatigue syndrome 20 years now, sure hope get treated better (taken seriously) there‚Äôs money spent research them. exception groups great work, CFS research feels like stagnant pond it‚Äôs funded.  favourite new word around pandemic ""performative."" announced 2 cases Omicron Canadian city yesterday. imagine lot runny noses soon . Same. **ever** lockdown? guess state state basis live North Carolina. businesses closed could still order take out. could still freely go grocery store liquor store. think lockdown think Italy had. ask state leave house. harsh travel ban?

Millions people already died woe me, I'm allowed sit flying metal tube breathe contents lungs passenger me!

Just zoom call! bad health decisions still affects others around them. planning trip South Africa five months, got scuttled day departure due Omicron. Fucking bullshit. I‚Äôm like - don‚Äôt think plan trip far ahead really Covid control. literally 5 days reported peak season almost two months long. splitting hairs. misinformed French travel ban. presented whole uk cut France extension EU. simply wasn‚Äôt. 48 hours truckers. eu countries full travel bans. 

If want talk risks would say new cases reported generally 30k new cases day, months massive risk generating new
mutations. personally would say situation far worse UK SA. 
 

Also ofcourse going 400% increases start 6 month cycle next wave. 
We‚Äôre bottom wave. cases low months. actual movement 2k ish new cases last couple days. Compare UKs 30k new cases every day since July. since like precision 7th July. Also, since like percentages that‚Äôs 1500%. Every single day. Since July. UK new variant factory months. effective travel bans rogue nation?

And increased cases figure isn‚Äôt directly attributable new variant either, atleast isn‚Äôt truly demonstrable. also due year end functions parties school going ages year end among things. attribute boogie man omicron variant wish.  hasn‚Äôt reaction strong since first Covid lockdowns?? Wow, pandemic game really nailed depiction NZ expert all, Spanish Flu three distinct waves. Omicron would fourth wave Covid. Pandemics don‚Äôt last forever, even mutated disease, like ‚Äúthe flu‚Äù still around. Trying optimistic, maybe Omicron end pandemic, though last wave Spanish Flu worst. Unless like common cold people feel sick day Same, bro. Same. ü§û countries probably don‚Äôt track cases well Love Holland treating people plane South Africa lepers country like 20,000 cases/day. Anyone else wonder variant actually came Holland? work live Japan we‚Äôre leaving Christmas? Supposed family come back states holidays weeks. That's many countries travel banning lower Africa. Japan even banning everyone. referring ICU quote, said they're seeing demographic change patients stressed almost unvaccinated. believe also tripling, quadrupling. I‚Äôm still puzzled story 61 passengers two flights testing positive. Assuming everyone needed negative PCR tests fly first place, assuming wear masks flight, means one people contracted virus day flew virus rapidly spread plane among passengers. much plane‚Äôs air filtration mask wearing, etc. See mean?

Bahaha. underrated comment thread. not, highly influencable feeble minded people, uneducated found comfort sad internet black hole terminally stupid US states still report. worldometer plugs data back whichever dates supposed in. whether florida says 100 today says ""there 5 today, 10 yesterday, 15 two weeks before, 70 randomly last month"" bother, ends graphs correctly Swiss wonder respond change seasons?

It's summer South Africa winter us northern hemisphere. panic?? Colorado wave ages. Yeah don‚Äôt want cookies. find even scarier post erodes confidence social institutions.

If went whole pandemic without loss confidence ""social institutions"" even research systemic failures lead this, irresponsible terms citizenship end. ""social institution"" mean make terrible decisions expense constituents (again read posts). Care answer questions?

If ""social institutions"" CDC, WHO, national governments, corporations, etc failed need systemically address shortcomings. COVID, many areas (such climate change, etc).

Now, here's question. disagree previous posts (not social institutions general, whether failures go BEYOND Trump?) Ashish K. Jha:

""Is possible Omicron Variant sets us way back square one?

No. won't.

We lots tests detect Omicron cases easily. 

We soon going therapies work.

Yes, vaccines MAY take hit protection. BUT, provide protection. Maybe even lot depending data.

Point is, March 2020. MUCH better place."" I‚Äôd surprised isn‚Äôt already here. Nobody knows sure, I‚Äôm pretty confident vaccines still good job preventing hospitalization death omicron. hope wake call start sharing vaccine. always thought prioritize vaccinating everyone offering boosters Christmas cancelled worldwide. armed protests plot kidnap governor think understand ""y'all mfers own"" mentality state government.

But point well taken. It'll 3.14 times worse Omicron like it. They'll run Greek letters eventually. Canada. (2 cases Ontario) think much global reaction Delta. Again. Like person mentioned Italy. I‚Äôm talking this. it‚Äôs clear people thread selective memory driven fear rather actually happened, so. Someone yesterday said direct flights Canada Vancouver South African Airlines. 8 waa shocked couod fly far. trying spread misinfo.

Cheers! cities gone hard lockdown since first wave January-February 2020.

While technically true entire cities lockdown, generally speaking 3-4 cases found area, entire district city locked hard quarantine larger denser cities still million people pretty easily.

A lesson others. Play stupid games win stupid prizes something...   Affirmative  Meh Like like SK Australia put people proper quarantine. Anything else effect. virus get many eager believe scam, gonna spread. Meanwhile FDA waste months testing new vaccine booster prohibit anyone wants getting reason thousands continue die every day. Yeah no. Alpha came UK they're butthurt it.

This shitty SA govt blaming problems foreigners like shitty governments (Russia China also constantly) named omnicron?

WHO named omicron, yes  Give community service hospitals. anywhere significant unsupervised access patients, performing essential easy learn jobs keep hospital running. provides small relief hospital staff hopefully shows potential consequences actions.  answer vaccinate entire planet‚Ä¶ rapidly please give example ""constant shootings"" US hospital? 

Yes, US gun problem. No, contestant shootings US hospitals. evidence enact longer strict travel restrictions? likelihood another variant originating Africa high, best interest countries put long term travel ban place put pressure increasing vaccinations preventative measures prevent variants emerging?

You're right, probably many places now, shutting flow variant corners world smart move least temporarily? Like others mentioned, buys everyone time figure one different. lets countries people come South Africa get contact traced isolated. can't many people point grand scheme things. contagious early reports make be, isolating majority one area seems intuitive.

On hand, may right future repercussions decision. But, say another variant detected country, country, effort prevent happening them, withholds information it. Eventually information would come think backlash repercussions could possibly worse temporary travel ban shared info early. Especially smaller country hold much sway world. Living US, new variant came here, would expect countries put travel restrictions place. recall correctly, many US citizens early on. I'm guessing still do. That's expected times in. 

Say boat. boat bunch leaks. know eventually water going get bad sink. also life boats, going take time get loaded get away safely. Would try plug leaks load people lifeboats? Would someone bailing water, knowing minute gain means lives saved? Pfizer said get new vaccine rolled 100 days necessary. take time vaccinate people new batch. need little time.

What argument travel ban, ""it's already spread over""? ""because millions Chinese people name"".

Saved click.

Is Winnie? think so. Xi extremely common name China. would like naming Bob variant. Like this? spamming message governor said old people need sacrifice economy know yet. want contain it, ban travel. country-specific bans work. shocking two years learning people still learned lesson. detect it, already country.

In practice, regardless want about, countries publish find new variant disadvantage. discouraging detection publication practical gain. Lol amazing‚Ä¶still laughing. Effin cotton effin A! Yeah COVID early March, August. August. happens lot really told. get test second time around, knew it.  said people COVID tested positive. people COVID tested positive.  definitely bad, could lot worse. again, seven months ago, vaccination canpaigns continued time. Yeah actually see half posts say it‚Äôs harmless half say we‚Äôre back March 2020.

Neither true data. Yes. Implying you‚Äôre immune‚Ä¶ word guidance boosters suffered myocarditis side effects second mRNA shot? really hard find guidance. thing I've found interview Cincinnati area hospital director suggesting J&amp;J booster, otherwise pretty much literature seems people J&amp;J getting mRNA booster instead.  Same, fairly strong reaction second Moderna shot, basically stuff folks mention, feeling like crud sweating, low fever stuff like muscle aches fatigue, etc. kind nervous heard booster Moderna bit rough second dose, times kind tough right didn‚Äôt opportunity takeoff two days row work, personal experience booster probably maybe little bit less severe second shot, would much Rather mild discomfort day two get full effects Covid/Delta infection. I‚Äôm sure health insurance situation going like 2022, aside long Covid, extreme disability death,if go hospital even couple days or, heck even one day, would possibly screwed financially even best health outcome

I beyond grateful feel fortunate access vaccine booster.

Yeah. I‚Äôve already accepted year college probably wash again, depressing is, I‚Äôm giving senior year. 

People age deserve least one unbroken, normal year college. We‚Äôre going debt shitty experience. over. Look mink culling starters. refuse call anything Liverpool vs Man Utd Old Trafford variant Protection starts wane almost immediately, initially % decrease effectiveness fairly small, month gets bit less effective. That's Delta, immune evasion much.

I guess fear Omicron going much better evading protection incurred vaccines, boost immune response now, likely when/if starts surging couple months, enough protection remains prevent severe outcomes.

I think they're finally going ""go hard, go early"" response pandemics urged WHO. likely downsides topping boosters cost, wait couple months find necessary, waste time can't get back. important right UK could probably delivering daily boosters currently is: bottleneck delivery seems uptake. Increasing pool eligible means slots booked. Yeah definitely changed equation me. would probably close back normal now, I‚Äôm also double vaxxed boosted, little one. also found pregnant week everything shut US little traumatic, sound dramatic. Minus going grocery store seeing vaccinated people pretty much still living March 2020 lol. 2 years ago would told becoming NP greatest decision I've ever made would recommended route. Now, got nothing you. Sorry, man. pain real Can‚Äôt argue data! viruses work, want spread kill thier priority. vaccines effective remain effective variation. worst case needing booster. Stop obese. Obesity ok.   amount deaths due covid obesity comorbidity leader far. remember covid brand new many people claiming incubation time 2 weeks.

Fortunately turn common believed, possible examples cases there. gone 2019 again... knows ever time got family worry about, too. older, vaccinated early boosted.   Fully vaccinated people expected let life pass lockdown. many people lost much important time. Children experienced record learning loss. College students gone thousands debt online power points. Seniors unable live last years life family. 

Enough enough. vaccines. Get them.  Seems like quite alarming language, given little still know new variant. girlfriend hit raw daily since never takes test never gets pregnant very, regional.

So depending live USA, die hard antivaxers might might \~40% population, 5%. lot european countries/federal states either lockdown planing like efficacy steady 6 month mark drops off, right? We've shitloads breakthrough infections 6 month mark US least. Tldr? realize animal population trumps human population... right? 

You try playing ""other"" viruses animals... who's talking them? We're talking covid sars2.   feel like one vaccinated 3 times , still masking everywhere go, washing hands lot (which pandemic) social distancing (again already did). AKA Chelsea vs Norwich variant. Honestly nothing scaring much right play next couple weeks. I‚Äôm triple vaxed pretty much living life without limitations right young child couldn‚Äôt get vaccinated yet would probably feel differently. actually see half posts say it‚Äôs harmless half say we‚Äôre back March 2020. 
Neither true data.

That's incorrect. Data MAKE something true. Whatever truth is, already true, continue true, matter long humans take figure out. 

All know figure out, going better look back say need react strongly look back say react strongly enough. hurts talk lockdowns. told shot things get better. lockdowns even less get shot . High cases, hospitalisations deaths psychologically financially devastating aswell. virus destroys life also economy. Even lockdown implemented people reduce contacts, buy stuff. anything incidence wont go down.
Could lot averted? Absolutely. Easier measures implemented months ago. unfortunately people became careless politicians react quickly.
Nobody likes lockdown. also dont like car accidents stroke patients able find ICU beds.  Sean dead asshole skinny better thou intellectual. ü§î Mostly agree. us remained cautious continued take precautions change much. worry though amount I'm seeing ""maybe mild"" abandoned precautions continue take them. people little scared might needed. misunderstand me. It‚Äôs still punishment whether view travel ban vital.

The end result South Africans even though nobody limiting travel punish them. still punishment. deleted Salon article quotes Clear Labs CEO. Salon left leaning website usually politics see auto deleted post there‚Äôs chance articles website could opinion based. winter anyway. It'll keep warm. excuses. True. guess I‚Äôm crossing fingers widespread think maybe it‚Äôs less severe fear. Right? Idk man gotta think something positive lol. I‚Äôve done young toddler protect. hope someday gets level risk accept family. Im Upstate NY Canada confirmed assuming now. Ive purge LinkedIn contacts pushing anti vax isnt appropriate IMHO, hoping kids could ditch masks soon seems like never happen. Same, grandmother Nagano 94 now. Likely see late.  inclined think enforcement failed rather tests itself. high chance tests never done passengers presented fake papers. absolutely checks papers looking says negative result somewhere. Michael Mina posted wastewater data Pretoria Twitter today indicates enormous spread SA already makes sense.   hold memory correct plastic divider Yep, variant-specific vaccines provide enough advantage make time, effort, resources, confusion switching worth original version (particularly boosted) work well is.

That might change time, won‚Äôt know bit.

As certified guy Reddit reads lot stuff, armchair guess current boosted vaccines provide ample protection, particularly severe disease death, another round boosters (perhaps variant specific time) recommended sometime first half 2022 least demographics. variant-specific part that, probably already much table regards. People like live fear reason. you‚Äôre fully vaccinated you‚Äôre still paranoid, bigger issues. Source information animal reservoir spreading COVID back humans? Yes there's lot trolls Massively. Damn really blows. excited visit Japan. :( hopeful started reopening November... restrictions lasted long already. bit disheartening. Protection wanes 6 months right, thats symptomatic infection. 3 month gap booster? think it‚Äôs likely governments deem politically prudent appear *taking action*. 

Most studies place estimated delays ‚Äúfew days‚Äù range much larger travel restriction we‚Äôre seeing here. likely won‚Äôt binary, let‚Äôs define immunity vaccine COVID last 6 months. Let‚Äôs also say effectiveness defined greater 50 percent effective reducing hospitalization deaths. previous Vaccinations infections reduce risk significantly Omicron, half people vaccinated get Onicron without effective protection.

Did even read comment got soap box started preaching? Please tell post post. would never take tone person.

Yes complete antibody escape highly unlikely, 100 percent vaccine effectiveness highly unlikely.

Yes know several weeks vaccine makers performing lab trials get real world data multiple countries. Would feel comfortable visit grandma instant booster starts gain effect would rather wait peak reached? OP visits grandma anyways around month. idk we're discussing further.

If wanna pedantic re-read initial takes **up to** two weeks booster show effect

Your claim initial statement false correct. 32% significant compared people claiming. US, wear mask anymore completely crazy decision. Seems like good news far severity bad news far widespread already SA. Medically ok would wait contagious (consult doctor) exposure person giving vaccines people pharmacy flu. around longer first sequencing course. unlikely circulating long. amount drift samples collected far implies common ancestor sometime October-ish.

Plus, unlike Delta, tracked S-gene target failure regular PCRs. widespread, S-gene target failure makes easy track (at least population basis.. every S-gene target failure Omicron). wsnt go Japan, gotta keep suitcase packed ready go moment's notice border open day.

On thought there's time suitcase. hear border open, head straight nearest airpory. saves time. find current vaccines effective Omicron, think need variant-specific booster. Although may able incorporate changes future batches vaccine, mRNA technology easily editable, IIRC. Covid booster jabs offered over-18s help stop potential wave driven new variant Omicron, UK government advisers say. oh well.. 63%, we're saved guess.. taken passed college level stat classes 99.5 1:200 thing still surprised lmao Quick question, I‚Äôm recovering flu, I‚Äôm traveling overseas two weeks wanted go ahead get covid booster trip. y‚Äôall think it‚Äôs okay get covid booster recovering flu? submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Will interesting see result ,effectively anti -vaxers endangers life could nicked ..fantastic!!  Also kinda funny fear monger virus entitled opinion say something calm fears offer hope it‚Äôs suddenly ‚ÄúYOU‚ÄôRE VIROLOGIST REEE‚Äù Antivaxxers aren‚Äôt people getting sick hospitals Covid. province Canada we‚Äôve fully vaccinated individuals die Covid past weeks (they seniors).  mean Ebola open borders? agree. wish legal way this. least force pay pocket? something. Wish country would close border too, instead waiting seeing guy gets it. long developed world keep pulling stuff ground cheaply one really gives shit. Actually deaths US well vaccines. Quite political scientific figures Germany are. Definitely. think it'll possible squash new variants pop up. life now. Maybe travel restrictions slow spread couple weeks, change outcome.

Considering reaction countries discover new variants, UK Kent (Alpha) variant SA Omicron, surprise least going forward countries probably stay quiet new variants avoid economic repercussions.

Could anyone even imagine countries like Russia dictatorships/authoritrian regimes admitting new variants country? They'll likely happily play ignorant.

This seem case honest best interests. Same. graduated college. I'm starting work, get older etc. want fun vacation becoming real boomer Maybe is. lot assholes actually got screwed. See: antiva antimaskers. lockdowns coming needed, 94% vulnerable population vaccinated 70% total count children. point people refuse vaccinate thier problem, matter media says thia variations. magically break vaccine wven slightly less effective, could easily fixed booster. Time stop fearmongering media. brother same. dehydration first two night chills third. People take seriously starts affect people near Even they're extremely cautious 5%.... thats still significant increase compared average including 0-17.... lol 10% 2 scary #&amp;$^%. able restrain it. would extremely stupid let's say Germany huge bump cases increase restrictions neighbors really low cases. mean, would found really soon, lose reputation premonition - Pandemic Story interesting read. TLDR CDC game since 1970's, flu vaccine push went sideways. understand mean, opens giant worms. problem rhetoric journalists use. Got it. 


None changes fact new variants, similar Omicron, definitely worth monitoring. possibility bad day absolutely possible here. position (i.e., enough experience power within company), I'd strongarm keeping remote threatening quit don't.

That, I'd quit find another job. Again, position so. sort neutral pediatric vaccinations saw [COVID-19 sixth highest cause death disease children ages five 11 U.S. comparable rates death seen children heart lung disease.

Yes, kids unlikely die Covid, especially healthy ones. kids unlikely die anything period, especially healthy ones. absolute risk virus low, relative risk surprisingly high. don‚Äôt need office space, sell end lease? ""setting us back"" trope unpopular narrative around many people seem express glee idea ""vaccines useless we're back March 2020"". course reality likely far nuanced that.  see huge issue years presenting ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù topic legitimate viewpoints. CDC going far way placate science deniers stupid. people never change! let rest us protect ourselves! Look California cases maybe percent two lower national average decent lock down.  think world pick one newspaper tv station gets report story?

No. I'm merely stating media stick facts, instead contributing general noise. it, limit facts actually relevant ones.

What need factual reporting. Right now, facts new variant numerous mutations, already present several countries around world, know less nothing worthy note it, various governments reacting limiting travel and/or introducing restrictions. That's right now. 

If want reassure people, could also reiterate mRNA technology enables relatively quick production new vaccine, become necessary, pharma companies already testing whether current vaccines stand test.

That's wanted say. Stick relevant facts. definitive proof more/less infectious ‚Äì repeat speculation. definitive proof efficacy current vaccines lack thereof - cut speculation. Fauci said something presser, mean needs blasted entire world see, especially given he's speculating like everybody else (""it might evade immune response, case, there's chance!""). Israeli doctor said something (""mild symptoms only, different Delta!"") also mean media run story immediately. Interesting plays people, first two shots gave mild headache chills/fever, booster gave bit sore arm. think concern travel restrictions *absolutely* founded science enacting travel restrictions *globally* variant already found, globally - it‚Äôs reached Europe, UK several countries Africa officially already - there‚Äôs way it‚Äôs already. you‚Äôre going strictly enforce domestic covid policy based science, sure effective it‚Äôs na√Øve think you‚Äôre actually closing door variant. Simply saying ‚Äúno new visitors!‚Äù strict vaccine mandates robots social policies back domestic policies‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre going awful lot. 

That said isn‚Äôt commentary Japan countries, I‚Äôm intimately familiar covid policy works over. 2x Pfizer, finished series March, got Covid late august / early September. Got pretty fun symptoms, 102 fever, 2 days feeling great resembled common cold.

Got moderna booster yesterday, heart rate noticeably elevated scary (I low resting heart rate normally), lymph node injection arm slightly swollen. Next morning, arm sore, I‚Äôm tired, bad overall. come doesn‚Äôt go clinical trials again? mean it‚Äôs good don‚Äôt get wrong, prove changes they‚Äôve made safe? suspect hurry returning offices due budget used renting pressure mostly real state. someone traveling like 2 weeks (US Puerto Rico), concerned flight canceled last minute? seen friends family years finally got around vacation flight scaring us worried canceled. fully vaccinated. Yea could recommend saying running beginning pandemic are, many others us. think maximise protection vulnerable people vaccinated late. data always shown older age groups boosting around 4-5 months avoid significant drops protection. 6 months presumably chosen order limit supply needed.

They've said booster rollout invites based age vulnerability, basically back original rollout system. practice think people going receiving boosters 3 months, even much less 6 months this. would mean first general cohort 18 year olds get vaccine would getting boosters now. get that, I'd thought rooms drew air outside think get massive military spending coupled amazing innovation.

Coupled get racism, government incompetence, greed, rudeness obesity. win lose some. Lost brother Covid, friend 44 years. Mask up, wash hands, get vax/booster stop whining. still unknown. far hospitalizations par previous surges country. sounds like logic would applied everyone Trump office thing. end day logistical costs much non-zero cancelled flight, discounted plane tix past year absolutely zero problem $16 insurance $1500 ticket (my actual experience flying relatively remote area summer) like covid field hospitals opened never utilized means plenty capacity covid need mandatory  Also racking damage monoclonal antibodies given lead problems. 

And things get bad say enough supply treat people. Well parts ""Zero Covid"" Twitter pretty much gone full anti-vax. Saw talking vaccines worthless stopping new variants (never mind they're popping undervaccinated areas) stopping 100% transmission Pfizer deceived us vaccines would end pandemic could make profit.

When going acknowledge ""Zero Covid""ers dangerous grifters grifting longer justifiable pretext ""UwU can't blame us passionate public health UwU"" Wtf transited Montr√©al. numbers show youth happy kill lots elderly. They're real victims can't speak they're dead. seems bit extreme? country boosters three months (or anything lower 6 months)?

How would work long-term? Getting booster every 3 months seem ridiculous imo. think show see CDC pandering anti-vaxxers symptom much deeper problem US: nation rapidly becoming ungovernable. CDC can't fix that, unfortunately. yeah, point rapid testing start rapid test way semi normal bit vaccinate things.... issue policy workable, issue people want admit covid danger B never get covid 0. need build safe rails bit till work seasonal flu mode multi variant targeted printed MRNA vaccines every 6 months year scale meet demand.... long arm time fade background maybe even mostly gone...... power tech refuse engage it.... people told omicron would mild cold viruses never evolve virulent /s lot companies trouble getting staff. give workers want get out-competed ones do, least industries workers high demand.   really punishment though it? responsible act. Every country gonna catch it, every country face travel consequences. grown it. Right ask bothers you, specifically? million reasons double layer cloth mask detrimental, like 2 reasons extremely rare. 

If like recommendation good mask send links. I'm bigger guy took find one right me, bad all.  feels like goal movement. stoke fears ‚Äúmuh freedoms!‚Äù  headlines. even know many cases omicron. know another delta driven surge, like we're seeing across Europe etc. 

It's silly jump conclusions point.  No. live Missouri everyone care protected safe. lost family member 2 months ago. might glad died fast kill family I'm glad trauma losing watching husband cope brother's death panic attacks he's watching idiotic family gather, wondering next. 

On top that, medical emergency spring. spent two 9-hour days ER, condition got even worse ended 2 emergency surgeries week hospital. I'm go surgery, there's hostile man mask, refusing covid test he's emergency surgery shot dick off. (I really can't make up. even drugged point 4 security guards called). terrifying 2 weeks post 2nd shot hoping unmasked around kill me.

Why worried that? I'm blood cancer survivor got heart lung damage chemo can't go oxygen ventilators without likely killing requiring transplant. I'm mid-30s, healthy enough run 5Ks hike mountains Covid could kill me. I'm antibody t-cell vaccine studies still can't sure I'm even protected three vaccines I've received.

So enough care vaccinated v unvaccinated. People like can't afford stop caring risk. can't afford stop caring might gallbladder fail. might care unvaccinated surely affected die. edgelord ""over it"" stop reality people kill people love. Regardless political views, think agree CDC entirely useless point. @australia take note. virus supposedly highest infectiousness yet, I've gotta honest, expected cases now. International air travel still massive luxury people, including Americans, Canadians, Japanese, etc. tantrum travel bans privileged meltdowns ever. MAYBE societies rethink building economy single industry, especially TOURISM.  feel badly ONE nation every society responsibility itself, moment country starts blaming domestic problems countries, stop listening.  mush would love travel foreign country since pandemic began able to. . .    I'm sorry, people NEED fly internationally right now. 

I've lived decade foreign country, choice consequences came also alone. FUCK  anyone share booster experience breakthrough Covid case post full vaccination? booster Wednesday curious might for. Last shot April symptomatic case late august. China lie way anything. comes pandemics, often middle it. 

Such treaties going useless. Scary shit could significant effects generally younger African countries. Let‚Äôs support Africa fights Transformers villain variant. Agreed. Monkey attack nurses, nurses leave. Monkey shocked Pikachu, monkey dies. threshold success ""not issues virus?"" makes sense. 

Australia even hit 2,000 deaths. US full months 2,000 deaths *a day*. There's denying whatever did, work. see could defend it. over, body naturally makes whole mess different antibodies towards antigen presented - look somatic hypermutation - even sees mutated antigen.

That's understandable contagious believe need implement larger scale ban travel.. sounds shitty seems like going fun Christmas. new Vox podcast week talks really good.

Delta run course population. Stop spreading misinformation, calling correct information sources misinformation Well US some.are.going conspiracy designed tank stock market lower holiday spending. need vote person chosen office now.
No masks vaccines. self congratulate seeing though vast conspiracy.  worry mate, downvoted good measure Children age 2 account 10% total hospital admissions omicron epicenter Tshwane South Africa, according National Institute Communicable Diseases.

More kids admitted early stages country entering current fourth wave infections, although similar trend occurred third wave delta dominant, said Waasila Jassat, public health specialist institute.

South African scientists last week first identify new variant known omicron, symptoms described mild, exact risk new strain still uncertain. Governments across globe stepped travel restrictions response, World Health Organization warned variant could fuel fresh surge infections.

‚ÄúThe young children immature immune system also vaccinated, risk,‚Äù said Jassat, part developing managing South Africa‚Äôs national hospital surveillance system Covid-19.

She said part increased rate admissions may reflect extra precaution part parents given new concern mutation. pediatric report due later week provide information.

‚ÄúPeople likely admit children precaution treat home something go wrong -- especially young children higher proportion death,‚Äù Jaffat said. 

Vaccine Protection

Scientists South Africa said Monday existing vaccines still likely protect severe illness, though small children able get shots yet. third country‚Äôs population fully vaccinated. 

During delta-driven third wave, hospital admission age 19 jumped 43%, country since opened vaccinations adolescents 12 17 years. 

‚ÄúIt however appear early part wave higher proportion children admitted past,‚Äù Jaffat said. work China giving super low infection rate. Russia thing Russian vaccine. dumb. Where's source  company experienced extreme effectivity accuracy boost since started working 100% home. Still want us come back 100% pandemic over. 

Personally hope hybrid model working bit home bit office, 100% home beats 100% office easily. 50-100 office workers 2 doesn‚Äôt want work home, rest does. 

But management insist full return. Lines drawn medical infrastructure/ hospitals handle terms severe illnesses hospitalization well long term effects. Death metric matters.  also feel needle first two, booster actually pretty painful shot, shots go. wonder luck draw getting good person injecting not. No. 

This misinformation. South Africa started seasonal covid wave. dominant *one* providence. wave *Delta* rest South Africa started time. would believe that, fact even Jo'burg city can't hit 70% year, Gauten province practically stalled. That‚Äôs great doesn‚Äôt bother you. million reasons masks detrimental different people. People continue wear long want, desperately need way requiring everyone. Wait till Spring summer safe.Europe gone bit crazy. However take chance would bet Italy, Spain Portugal safest shut along Scandinavia.  line drawn based percent population dying total deaths? breakthrough cases, good preventing severe disease. like prevent breakthrough cases nearly well.

Could 90% infection (wonderful). Could 20% (pretty bad hopefully still effective severe disease).  get saying,but majority population unvaccinated. good metric. think read something like 25% vaxxed.

Theres immunocompromised individuals risk death common illnesses higher rate healthy covid cases... force mandated EVERYTHInG them? risk too! IMO important get infected changes virus makes body. 
So higher infection rate dangerous, right? mean ... transmission bad. 
Saying higher chance heart attack survivable give warm fuzzy. heart still gets damaged. checked Looking seems like lot places walk ins appointments LA.  think situation's getting better, something like pops Yeah, kinda know answer.

The ones blocking entire world (Israel, Japan Morocco) even fully open, issue going back closed borders. domestic manufacturing raw materials back running afford hunker down. vaccines fully FDA approved yet? 

If great mandatory easily fully FDA approved... wait minute US approved Pfizer vaccine enforce mandatory federal laws. 

Step away ask Moderna vaccine FDA approved Pfizer has? tomfoolery going pretty clear.

Headnote CDC vaccine tracker seen possible, CDC links person‚Äôs first, second, booster doses together. However, linking sometimes possible CDC receive personally identifiable information vaccine doses. lead over-estimates first doses under-estimates subsequent doses. CDC encourages people bring CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Record card appointment another COVID-19 vaccine shot card help ensure doses linked. Learn CDC estimates vaccination coverage footnotes page.

The referenced footnote **How CDC estimates vaccination coverage** * CDC estimates number people receiving least one dose, number people fully vaccinated, number people booster dose. CDC estimates based data includes dose number (first, second, booster additional dose). However, dose number may incorrect data CDC receives personally identifiable * protect privacy vaccine recipients, CDC receives data without personally identifiable information (de-identified data) vaccine doses. record dose unique person identifier. jurisdiction provider uses unique person identifier link records within systems. However, CDC cannot use unique person identifier identify individual people name. person received doses one jurisdiction different providers within jurisdiction, could receive different unique person identifiers different doses. CDC may able link multiple unique person identifiers different jurisdictions providers single person. * challenges linking doses someone vaccinated different jurisdictions different providers need remove personally identifiable information (de-identify) data protect peoples‚Äô privacy. means that, even high-quality data CDC receives jurisdictions federal entities, limits CDC analyze ** example, people receive first second dose 2-dose vaccine provider doses given within weeks other. receive booster dose months later, it‚Äôs possible go new location dose. person may moved provider gave initial doses may longer offer vaccination. often happens people went mass vaccination clinics since closed. scenario, person‚Äôs booster dose may appear first dose reported. one example CDC‚Äôs data may over-estimate first doses under-estimate booster doses. * Another issue poses challenges estimating doses administered every jurisdiction provider uses reporting practices. people receiving doses attributed jurisdiction reside, reporting method might change doses move different vaccination location. Also, CDC may lack information person‚Äôs residence. issues cause CDC‚Äôs dose number estimates differ reported jurisdictions federal entities. * CDC capped percent population coverage metrics 99%. cap helps address potential overestimates vaccination coverage due first, second, booster doses linked. reasons overestimates include census denominator data including part-time residents potential data reporting errors. * CDC also updating COVID Data Tracker CDC website prominent statements better explain limitations vaccination coverage estimates shown Data Tracker‚Äôs ‚ÄúVaccination Delivery Coverage‚Äù grouping. change help people appropriately interpret vaccination coverage data. got downvoted shit said current vaccines would rendered obsolete. People love hang false hope bs. thought might like 8th inning, think 4th 5th inning. instead giving 3rd doses Europe North America sent millions doses Africa might stop variants popping every months. Hell, even getting people rich countries mostly vaccinated far help world topping immunity previously protected people. global problem - let's get disease control worldwide. literally grocery trip America. idea burden utterly indefensible. weekly shot, would still trivial.

‚ÄúIt difficult predict persistence effects supply constraints, appears factors pushing inflation upward linger well next year,‚Äù Mr. Powell plans say. ‚ÄúIn addition, rapid improvement labor market, slack diminishing, wages rising brisk pace.‚Äù

Mr. Powell also address new variant, governments scientists racing assess contain. though, simple that, think counterproductive pretend otherwise.

Meanwhile, we've seen police straight gun people broad daylight much, much lesser things, claim ""they feared lives"" Lol. True. goal get everyone vaccinated be. includes holdouts fixing problems international vaccine equity. Lab techs too. Hundreds hours mandatory overtime, thousands COVID tests per day.

I assumed would need 2 additional doses, one. I'm wondering state requirements? anyone info situation? state opened vaccinations even get second dose.  brave Depends you‚Äôre given situation seems cells antibodies. bet life cell response. like folks bet COVID instead getting vaccinated. 

Better vaxed/boostered though. 

I wait results testing real world go around licking doorknobs. Honestly, I'm pretty hopeful. scientist made feel much better! going pay rent? Unfortunately government state long since given COVID management let alone lockdowns. 

Seems case lot places, not? Sadly, change politicians little minds average antigen test takes 5-15 minutes cheap (i get lab 25 bucks, went US DIY kits.for $10 dollars). average PCR test significantly expensive, done lab takes 2+ days do

Note said average, know priority PCR test done quicker people get booster 6 mos wait?  Eventually, official making announcement isn‚Äôt going makes happen. Well that‚Äôs exactly I‚Äôm asking though. states suddenly longer able make rules mandates see fit? CDC declares endemic, suddenly mean places can‚Äôt enforce mask mandates? public transit can‚Äôt enforce mask mandates? mandatory masks travel plane? optional? 

I feeling lot people *think* going happen. haven‚Äôt heard anything confirming this. remember late mother-in-law getting shitty end life cancer care unvaccinated filling hospitals. sympathy refuse getting shot end hospital. lol  think sad downvoted. üò≠ room can't sealed box, people need oxygen. there's ventilation addition AC heating. longest commercial flight currently London - Perth route...

I've sicker covid ever got I'm still here.

You get sick, stay home, get better. complicated. Countless viruses world media owns every single person lets media scare talking one them. right thing, sadly many people able separate real fiction.

Hehehe, maybe went back time told Chris Carter many nutcases believe 5G towers giving people 'rona show's influence discount conspiracy theorists today, maybe X Files exist many people would take pandemic much seriously. People fully vaccinated travel Netherlands, must able show proof vaccination.

Joey Rogaine fuck nugget. Ya focus ‚Äúsurvival rate‚Äù baffles me. got booster yesterday feel like crap today. anything like actual Covid feels like, sign for. Posters every 6 months. 

Shoot, I‚Äôd get shot treat dry skin. Adults considered eligible boosters 6 months second dose Pfizer Moderna, 2 months dose Johnson Johnson. reached mark yet, think recommendation (although suppose could ask doctor. would probably bit apprehensive waiting reach 6 months) much less concern given normal COVID infections last well month (vs AIDS chronic condition) CoV-2 mutates much slower rate? Another factor would given course disease. given people started self isolate, getting around protease inhibitor might happen occasionally, heavily selected population level.  ad revenue panic clicks would pay fines anyways.

Take pick. DaileyMail posted article saying Biden advisors want adults get boostee soon possible protect Omicron. 6 mos wait no? Sorry changing subject. Copied pasted another comment mine:

Well, uninvited arrived. think you‚Äôre special? reaction I'm getting elsewhere. think anywhere near appropriate respect populace variant. reaction virologists on-the-record comments pretty concerning. (not few) governments advised top virologists reacting vigorously. give people clue virologists saying behind closed doors. Thanks can't believe people want everything avoid getting disease.

They believe ever get it.

""I'm healthy"" popular refrain.

They also beleive serious, despite nearly 800k dead U.S. alone. That's also ""media histeria"" views dollars.

They've got excuse everything. showed headline 3 years ago would shitting anticipation extraterrestrial invasion Good luck. Got booster 3 days. side effects 1st 2nd maybe body decided save 3rd.  always weird see Americans screaming China fucked handling pandemic, comes pandemic response reluctant kind action. 3 Moderna. second one definitely worst. Booster mild achiness lasted day. say videogames? NOPE. Read again, understand first, read again. said videogames **LIKE** *Resident Evil*. case know, popular culture influence populace mindset (hence name). like people irrational fear towards artificial intelligence movies like *The Terminator* *i Robot*, lean towards outrageous ridiculous theories *The X Factor,* fear pharmaceutical companies games like *Resident Evil*. Seriously, I've tried discuss antivaxxers pharma companies evil per se, come ridiculous *Resident Evil* [Sweet film. Outrageous. ELI5 would able mutate another virus SARS-COV-2 always variant original virus  Except anti-sciencers won‚Äôt give credibility anyone. Doesn‚Äôt matter keep rotating new faces. old news. sure it‚Äôs posted today.  ant vax anti mask protests streets live. didn‚Äôt learn jack üòê  effective treatment mentioned update steroids IL-6 inhibitors antivirals. enough people flat fucking refusing take vaccine, healthy vaccinated people literally think get Omicron, they're dead, questions asked. wondering traveling around weeks. Canada pretty good contact tracing though, correct? different note, Biden Emergency meeting told US Adults get booster soon possible, according Dailey Mail. sure includes previous 6 month wait advice advised run get one morning. health officials Canada said anything yet this?  heard expert say yet we're back square one. 

Should trusting posters experts doomsday predictions? u think 3rd shot booster many states US misguided. Better give rest world new variants don‚Äôt creep fast. [U.S. buy 10 mln courses Pfizer's COVID-19 pill $5.3 Steroid treatments, yes. new pills supposedly antivirals keep virus replicating early stages infection, like tami flu works flu. NH here. got back movies. Besides wife I, 3 people wearing masks. others side side eating possibly unwashed hands. One couple coughing whole 3 hour movie. Really glad wife boostered masks eat anything. 

Its unfortunate see considering Thanksgiving happened winter Xmas right around corner.   might vaccine eligibility opened 5-11 year olds (some school mask requirements set end around 2 months approval). Healthcare capacity increased necessary (and yes looks like necessary). 

But waves infection see infection ""run everyone"" smaller areas. easy follow US report based 50 States. good example, go look Louisiana year. August recording high 40% positivity rate COVID tests. October rate much much lower. Yes, folks got vaccinated. made daily case count drop 5,000 per day August 500 per day end October. 

And much like vaccines seem require second third dose spaced bit effective, unvaccinated achieve something similar catch ""yearly"" case COVID immune system gets better better fighting virus. remember it, 1 year ago. Looking forward bright 2020-3. Fauci likes jabber like 10 minutes stuff, news likes take 1% said turn misleading headline. Anytime headline starts like ""Fauci says"" pretty much safely ignore says says probably exactly say whatever headline, least without bunch context.  U.S place world anti-vaxxers it, unfortunately. Thats cases Europe spiking. Fair enough. tell lowly ËÄÅÂ§ñ that‚Äôs worked two schools, I‚Äôve never asked get vaccinated. say care received compared unvaccinated noticeably different.

In ways?  Good ol deflection malpractice... already ""data"" list cardiac arrest symptom. joke. take us morons? effects declaring endemic?

It‚Äôs recognization reality. happens next? assess personal risks accordingly. Public health makes recommendations based current spread. live Seattle going crowded sports games comic-con next week. I‚Äôm betting life :) need poll.  think Seattle get via Asia. Wish could bet! Lol.  one trick judges absolutely love! It‚Äôs confirmed Ontario Canada, absolute guarantee it‚Äôs there. much surveillance much would prefer? Yeah, look increase cases last 2-3 weeks. understand circulating, low levels go back weeks. I'm sure pick increase hospitalizations. People refusing get vaccinated, else could happened.... inverse correlation vaccinated populations viral mutations disease‚Ä¶.
Example source: explain how? testing numbers Japan ""tiny"" country higher infected cases is, difference population aside, simply infected cases lower lol 

Do believe daily positive rate US ever maintained 5%?  No, far that. fact, even duration higher 5% positive rate US far longer Japan. recommend see ""Daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases per million people"" chart World Data site also shows positive rates countries pandemic compare Japan US. is. says travel bans suddenly everyone isn‚Äôt ‚Äúfollowing science anymore‚Äù Africa. ‚ÄòNu‚Äô easily confounded ‚Äònew,‚Äô ‚ÄòXi‚Äô used common last name,‚Äù said, adding agency‚Äôs ‚Äúbest practices naming disease suggest avoiding ‚Äòcausing offence cultural, social, national, regional, professional ethnic groups.‚Äô ‚Äù

many part world returing poverty still mean wealthy people need haul asses world new kind fun.

forget wealthy, little guy get hurt most.

not every countries afford pay citizen stay home say temporary measure known virus. think sensible, maybe easier small island nation compared countries. Avengers: Age Omicron people think blatantly running interference China People seem think governments wait threat confirmed heavy handed measures something. kind disease covid is, wait disease gets in, already late. super contagious disease like means matter days weeks, entire population threat exposure, hospitals overrun.

I think heavy handed measures make sense borders. Yes travelers banned. able eliminate keep cases domestically, people within live largely normal lives (see Taiwan). Happens lot people power lie economic/political interests , also often better access information That‚Äôs case whole entire time. gonna grad school Tokyo starting fall, decided cut losses go Europe instead Japan gonna budge. Even foreigner vaccinated + would follow strict quarantine testing regiment.  omicron thing must pretty gnarly? Japan must found new it? seems like kind dramatic response? absolutely would've one fucking dipshits brainwashed scared science Huh? I‚Äôm millennial‚Ä¶ fucking zoomer trash. pointless test models probably telling there's thousands cases US already Stay away people.

Make easier them. terms rules I‚Äôm pretty sure Aucklands level 4 harsher Melbourne ever had. Shit, say apartment windows can't opened. Yeah. Considering authoritarian mindset says subvert individual rights spawned systems killed least 20 times many virus.

Besides, evaluating incorrectly. low lethality highly contagious virus something lock 1. anything 2. ineffective. Harshest moment. Melbourne's lockdown time. couple MCU films saga. Wonder willingly countries report new variants know punished it. need balance incentive report advent commercial flight, previous generation dealt Spanish flu quarantine isolation. sound strategy. lot countries restricted banned flights UK alpha came out. Seem like long time ago. Sigh. Question - reuse N95 masks? Let's say 5 masks rotate day, giving mask 5 days quarantining use, would effective? enduring lockdown government learned evil past happens respect individual rights somehow thing different time. lockdowns nothing appropriate low lethality highly contagious virus. 

You could 100% vaccination rate would still happen. could lock 10 years would still happen. beating exponential curve highly contagious virus. Luckily neither low lethality much all, god help us ebola mutates something infectious. considered 800,000 deaths vs. 5000 deaths (in country 4 times large) convincing argument?

You're approaching unreasonable people think China handled pandemic better US. think consider think reasonable think otherwise. variant, know could transmissible, also know proving less severe,"" Mr Morrison said.

Fwiw Australian PM reliable source information. Hoping turns correct despite. Certainly know virus strain come existence day first discovered. long existence know, discovery date. I'm sure voted, trying hit date.

Its high likely started back October maybe even before. 

Its markers pre Delta strain, possibly mutating months immo-compromised host.

This likely already everywhere.

The likely hood ""just caught time"" zero, might well be. Yeah said right things. mild unusual cases definitely. can't conclude mild non-healthy, non-young people. COVID generally severe non-healthy non-young people. Unless Omicron different, keep mind general rule thumb 80% spread done 20% people. single person walking around Omicron necessarily (a) infectious particular time (b) intrinsically (based set physical characteristics still really understand) superspreader. take number unsuspecting walking-Omicrons variant 'everywhere soon'. 

Of course, problem almost certainly large number unsuspecting Omicron spreaders now. Bro read title??? 3 sentences travel restrictions apply U.S. citizens, lawful permanent residents, certain categories travelers.

And US tests citizens exit. entry. said cannot legally quarantined anyways there's little point That's planet earth gets hit massive One Winged Angel. moronic anagram People love conspiracy theory. idea people charge know thing X extremely dangerous telling us *reasons* alluring lot people there.

If Omicron known world governments truly horrendous needing extreme reactions, limiting travel bans. keep secret either. matter, capable keeping secret! Way many people would know, good number scientists medical professionals care humanity's well-being. prove variant predominantly is, also South African living county tell originate here, first case came tourist, scientists picked shared info world, already seen cases countries outside SA Africa well Europe, Israel Australia, likely world already. know could originated person USA traveled Botswana someone Botswana traveled here. 

They talk possible mutated someone HIV, look anything possible mean even America China million people living HIV/AIDS Africa cases regard theory must started‚Ä¶ 

Then see comments vaccinations needing increased etc, people sure understand think help I‚Äôm sure will, large portion world still vaccinated, maybe new variant sprouting Russia virus mutated better handle cold something. need another booster shot, one per variant every 7months‚Ä¶ viruses mutate vax vax, influenza hundred years still mutates even though flu shot‚Ä¶ personally don‚Äôt feel like getting poked every 7months‚Ä¶

Theories, conspiracies misinformation hearing since covid bullshit, nobody knows anything honestly media also know blow shit proportion, don‚Äôt deny covid real problem many people lost lives, it‚Äôs sad unfair welcome life‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt first pandemic won‚Äôt last‚Ä¶ Biden‚Äôs government xenophobic racist one going know bad going be. Pissing people sounds better another lock me. Mmm hmm (hank hills voice) tired listening two works ""may be"" That's massive could little information severity. Wow literally eased bit restrictions two winter seasons without vaccines. people know aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated don‚Äôt see point. Similar Joe Rogan did. good logic is. 
 
Fun fact: South Africa almost put military bases collateral secure vaccines. Pfizer backed story made papers. knowledge developed country requirement put it.

As rest Africa, don‚Äôt buying power compete developed nations vaccines. don‚Äôt. 

But focusing first world. plateaued 60% best. doesn‚Äôt first world get 90% start talking vaccines. remember day Japan closed schools. emailed kid‚Äôs principal find plan was. responded hadn‚Äôt heard anything school district field trip. took kid school following day got weird looks front desk staff. took school two weeks close up. Japan right back they‚Äôre probably right time. sure understand comment thread, refuse get vaccinated. understand rather vulnerable society includes elderly. 90% COVID deaths 55 years age. Many fully vaccinated. 

Currently lockdown Austria prevent healthcare system collapsing. like many others actually vaccinated endure another lockdown think want get vaccinated. Getting vaccinated personal choice, solidarity.  ""It's good King.""

Yes, US throws weight around. Sometimes good, sometimes ill, we're always willing roll Influence check.

The oil thing though: ignore oil sucking world dry would leave us last huge source. Imagine world OPEC begging US cut oil production flood market tank oil prices. Probably good thing. think that's we're (we=the US) aiming for, likely achieve. Interesting take. people want name virus. Others want dis China. Lol!! know yet mild people young, healthy, previously infected/vaccinated. doctor actually said much, generate attention. ‚ÄúMore concerned‚Äù what? people dying unnecessarily, hospitals overwhelmed, covid spreading vulnerable, virus mutating, pandemic never ending? tell whole picture. Often quoted many guns US guns per person. Ignoring fact majority Americans gun owners. handful insane amount guns collectors distort picture. people believe packing when, fact many gun owners overall even fewer people carry hunting going shooting range. Getting PCR tested Draconian covid pretty much front center population

People aware it, chance infection China pretty much zero, daily life g far less impacted Maybe ok end justify means, don‚Äôt tell everyone sort covid free Chinese utopia large here.

In many countries Europe, 1% population currently infected virus, moment. Many countries go general lockdown. Excuse me, comparison, far handling pandemic goes, people China way better off.  Yes response. thought critically context, subtext, responses. 

Not sure feel need attack responses. perspective, mine. think comment contributes erosion trust pubic institutions, specifically CDC WHO. Eroding trust public institutions designed keep folks safe, especially pandemic seems like larger public disservice. 

You essentially armchair quarterback. value adding here? don‚Äôt trust CDC WHO, don‚Äôt think real-time decisions make sense given know year later, critical many things really don‚Äôt anything substance say. understand perspective, think twice see people sowing distrust institutions need midst pandemic. mean critical wish, acknowledge comments don‚Äôt really anything evolve public safety. I'd like know too. Ten hours later, still responded. ever know? Devine severe disease. Death rate 1%  think people got tired. still spreading 25% per day pace infect people countries months. We're still waiting find severe breakthroughs, reinfections, naive infections are, though little learned promising. actual level immune escape still released. Gosh fucking hate ne0l1berals c0rp0rate d3m0crats  hear sequence passangers arrived US SA weekend?? They're interested finding cases. money. Yep.

Someone explain people know mild? Even regular COVID without vaccinations **young people** walked around like nothing burger well

* Observation: Governments taking heavy-handed actions, we're simultaneously told data.
* Question: data, governments seem freaking out?
* Answer: ""They must know they're telling us.""

Of course, think far likely answer ""They know, prepare worst better information.""

After all, Omicron bad hype, last thing want get head start. isn't, relax emergency actions. Gun stats actually facts. amount cases detected really matter itself, single case COVID, test million times million cases COVID (I know certainly count them, get point).

What matter many cases get relative many tests do. recommends travel bans. since day one trump China countries didn‚Äôt like. Travel bans counter productive. gunk supply chains, damage world economy. 
It‚Äôs cheap political tricks appease worried first world citizens destruction third world economies. punishment maybe state level racism xenophobia would call it. control changes behavior relative case rates, vaccination rates leading geometric changes infection/severe case rates, weather (seasonality), average age vaccinated, vaccine immunity waning time etc?

I assume so. You‚Äôre confident model seems. Doubt mutations going on. OG Delta what? know many people quarantined specifically Shenyang, National Health Commission publishes national numbers daily. end first wave, maximum number people ever quarantine one time 50,000, currently, 30,000 people quarantine. wife almost given seeing family point. We're hoping visit Japan 2035 maybe that's optimistic. due unique history Israel great respect science enormous intelligence capability. KNOW. mean America tends actually want something done tend make aid dependent upon thing.

Well, remdesivir failed COVID clinical trial anyway, guess retool one FIP sooner later. someone correct I'm wrong. believe heard omicron variant on/using/targetting? different spike protein alpha delta. I'm probably 100% using terminology wrong believe that's heard. Welcome living Transformers movie :) Much world coming winter. yet know variant spreads easier less serious. Trying delay weeks least country do. think reaction UK, restrictions 4 months high Delta case numbers, show dangerous might be. sure not, UK one 1st remove countries red list.  Yeah I‚Äôve full couple times started getting annual vaccines 15 years ago. Wouldn‚Äôt wish anyone. Yes ""asked"" remain air force base. mandatory quarantine, allowed leave. quietly did.

You right thing getting booster delta ripping world.  pretty good contact tracing though, correct?

Depends are. Ontario pretty good.

Did grow cotton barrel something? real world operates. Obviously nobody going risk country save economy place know exists. move concerning say least. thought world really past need intense preventative actions are. That‚Äôs gaslighting SA started plenty vaccine. told US stop sending using stock. 

Hardly anyone got vaccinated government corrupt shit nobody trusts it.  Sates generally make rules based recommendations, federal government mandate things purview (federal property, workers) can't generally tell Oklahoma lot cases. make recommendations, biggest stick funding.

Most states going recommendations, elderly/immunocompromised/underlying conditions./public-facing job/health-care worker, etc. However, underlying conditions really broad includes things like overweight -- almost everyone. states plenty boosters plenty asking them, tracking specifics trouble worth giving people booster 6 months makes sense safety data came in. bad call really. UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) carrying targeted testing places person visited likely infectious - including, thought, Westminster.

So quarantine traveling? common all. happen last name president, know anything piss off. know? China. advised travel restrictions related Omicron Ah like FIP medicine cats buy black market drug company never released tweaked molecule slightly remdesivir COVID came around don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre overreacting. Considering they‚Äôve control rates incredibly well recently massive public health, I‚Äôm surprised haven‚Äôt done sooner. would phrase it? ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty certain it‚Äôs can‚Äôt show diagnosed case yet‚Äù reality. Perhaps time ban travel Africa foreseeable future then. One issue antivaxxers skeptical new drugs seek proper treatment till symptoms get really bad. point virus already done lot damage. CDC test returning citizens last year. point *could*. point won‚Äôt temporarily alter judicial precedents violating quarantine.

Maximum 6 months prison 750K fine.

Up $1M quarantine breaking directly correlated death bodily maiming another. realize never another point lockdowns here? He‚Äôs ridiculously touch sometimes green light flashes, flags go Yeah months it‚Äôll something else next year something else round round go! Yup. know 100% political decision. go life normal get infected soon, super cautious get infected anyway year two. get either way. first option allows forgo masking go events again, second option allows live 1 2 years someone would die it. also worth noting second option also makes likely die virus year two older get infected. help people keep calling ""omni-cron"" news. sounds like Unicron's bigger evil brother me. love this, idea means (your comment) testing poor countries abysmal. pretty much get tested end ER. population vaccine natural immunity.

So could tons people getting Omicron ain't dying see it. ‚Äúcolds‚Äù coronaviruses. would join sub-list. counting things make numbers ""better"" kinda thing Trying strengthen position superpower everything including Covid-19 guess. US throughout pandemic. Cells look proteins Sars has

Right they're activated? cells front lines seen spike protein old variant. new one. Right?

Doesn't cause immune evasion? There's stopping variant spreading U.S., much less curbing it. really wanted show making sincere effort, they'd imposed restrictions last week waiting senselessly weekend. understand may giving U.S. nationals time reschedule flights home, foreign nationals realized suddenly time crunch get States. 

And matter time variant showed Mexico Canada, already reporting cases. already, inevitably coming hours, days. Piss poor grand standing U.S. government. used Lyme disease vaccine even killed disease ticks bit you. Sadly, company got sued oblivion available dogs. think contradicted yourself. test know find mutant variant , said before, money profits.

His girlfriend family don‚Äôt even know he‚Äôs anti-vaxx, way report ?

Oh used word a$$ internet. crazy hear online countries think US like. gun stats media really give false impression. Ima give straight. shit happening continue happen. society act Spanish Flu? Read history see went pre-covid times. time forget fear virus fizzles out. us longhaulers people lost someone, forget new reality stick us forever since PTSD experience act safer sanitary manor it. time ease go normal life, it'l process lot us mindful situation, been.

Hopefully covid turn something worse, given much species ruining earth, isnt illogical say another pandemic another virus soon fix gross act animal treatment. wet markets dont get regulated eradicated, ticking time bombs like they've always been. species grows numbers years, worse situation get general since population causes issues sanitation food demand. 

Overall, painting doomsday picture? Yes, think better look reality living instead turning blind eye acting shocked see truth ignoring long. think country fucking stupid showed last couple years, god damn, learn lot selfish ignorant ppl be. Omega Strain *laughs Darkseid*  fat contagious, sick constant 'bUt FAt pEOpLe!!!' response anytime pointed unvaccinated Covid patients overwhelming hospitals. Delta variants still us, many play nice. Vaccinations precautions still wise, even Omicron proves fairly harmless. 9 go Omega, get *really* interesting. give impression something done. like plastic dividers cramped restaurant. it‚Äôs extremely contagious, started spreading cases go way way fast.  hope nu Sounds like South Africa would love Abbot DeSantis. Yes. Moderna's vax reduced-dose booster. lol Africa large population white people Á©Ü (Mu) common last name variant Xi, yet Mu variant.

The even bother fact check lie. believe unless find laws. understanding cannot bar citizen entering country reason. involuntary quarantine detainment counts allowing entry   I‚Äôm big fan guns, always makes laugh people outside US (usually, who‚Äôve never set foot US) think US war torn battlefield gun battles raging everywhere. guess know cost/availability PCR like India, US readily available 100% free places (either covered insurance, government programs)

Back August traveling Hawaii California, find free PCR test would get turn around 72 hours. seemed shorter turnaround time. could get ""travel"" PCR test gets results 2 hours (guarantee less 24 hours), pay 150 dollars per test. (note: November got one sent results next day)

In Thailand, cheapest PCR tests travel around 60-70 dollars.

Antigen tests considerably faster cheaper, travel accepts them. less accurate false positives false negatives.  Exactly. viruses follow ""rules"" evolution established humans. Viruses whatever want to. So, we're page then?  booster protects existing variants....if new variant comes along we'd need another booster.  Lol sound upset me. There's million people name China. probably decent number expats sucks Who‚Äôs ‚Äúthey‚Äù statement? chance what? Keep healthy? test different variants? No. think even crazy hardline coviders seen kids school disaster, especially younger kids. kids missing much overall incredibly behind school. reality is, even vaccination very, little risk covid. risk low cost high, schools aren‚Äôt going close again. 

Now school children us eligible vaccines. mandating vaccines getting rid masks. We‚Äôve got get kids masks, it‚Äôs good drag long. Government easily dismantle infrastructure setup detect new variants. probably already know that. PR stunt anything else, punishes future early discoveries.

If discover new mutation tomorrow, great incentive first one report it. really. still denying entry November 8th business travelers.

Source: got denied travel automotive expos, EU, supposed happen December January. Better wait see comes mess. truly believe DGS allow game start knew South African player, DGS ""ahead"" virus rapidly contain situation.  Fuckkk Wait, rational logical comment see here?

I'd award give. Good luck telling china that. point slow things, stop   lost 0-7 Benfica ref cancel match minute second half. sadly always couple experience more. general people vaccinated etc, wont feel much it, course exceptions rule.

Im sorry experienced it, hopefully feel better I'd caution first omicron case discovered 18 days ago. Spread exponential, majority people infected new variant got recently (in past days). median 5-6 days show symptoms, another 3-10 days symptoms get bad enough hospitalisation, early tell mild severe really is. Take theory speculation.

A patient zero, immunocompromised contracts Beta strain, given supportive care long duration, difficulty overcoming infection. Months later exposed secondary viral infection several infectious diseases care, cells get infected viruses. bit inadvertent gene sequence splicing occurs process replicating viral RNA sequences swap viruses, causing mutations occur. errant strains unviable similar original strain - one wins gene sequence lottery outcompete others efficient spike protein design. person gets sicker, coughs breathes near people, 10 people new strain.   Love wholesome award post lmao makes sense. Hopefully ü§ûüèª I've seen lot anti lockdown protests content Australia America, think gaslight. That's good hear, SIL (Japanese Resident) supposed come visit us Taiwan next month first time pandemic would pretty sad got upended.  theory virus become less deadly infectious, that's makes virus 'survive' longest.

But early say that's happened Omnicron actually proven natural immunity indeed better vaccine? 

I understood wane little 3 months also last 12months more.   vaccination rate amongst Portuguese professional footballers really much lower among general population ? least give explaination? also want optimistic can't deny vaccines effective anymore dangerous variants appear near future.  nothing known then. great.   think guard optimism much doomerism, there's really little evidence suggest mild currently. simply enough time cases found. people variants COVID get mild-moderate symptoms. trip

Don't take trip, part problem. think circumstances special, remember everyone else thinks same. Stay put, save lives I'm pretty sure game actually politicians whatever fuck want. Probably figured keep news finding were/are still travelling.  Panic much?  vaccination rates extremely low there. Roughly 28% least 1 dose. Still say anything whether vaccines still effective not. Calm down. many wars pandemic still pandemic surprise us everytime- think folks interested data think really matters.

If living apartment building one apartments caught fire would want hear it? way variant presented. Everyone started panic everyone thought 2020 lockdowns travel restrictions. limited two options? None players tested positive yet played, results ones ruled game even federal government point? also fact time originated China, best tradition held everything secret last moment world health organizations possibly react time  thanks, ima research Sequencing numbers publicly available GISAID website. Losing 5-0. Turn internet/TV. long stay vaxxed masked, you‚Äôll likely live long healthy life. solution treat them? treat pay? taking compassion staff &amp; worried resources? may seem noble compassion extend people make poor choices too?
Our hospitals full ppl make really crap health choices. going start ""selecting"" people treatment too? That's thin ice I'm prepared stand on. stressful part thing. South African player infected before, apparently reinfection time new variant since B SAD players positive playing, might contaminated Benfica players. always, another Portuguese football soap opera starts. positive word used harmless ""Tangentialdenker"" (like like call them, still replace word ""Denker"") movement. dead guess Fingers crossed !!! say ""early 2022"" can't help think that's going March 2022, end Q1. passes early. Add bit delay nothing ever goes according plan scale, makes April. vaccine rollout take like half year things produced government fuck shit up. Maybe going qualify early Christmas present next year. Ominous, considering last time ""weird flu"" trended Twitter. Source? concur, concur? both, nz much harsher. get coffee takeaways park hangs like Melbourne. Melbourne much much longer though intense strain people's. 

Harsher = stricter 

I'd say Melbourne much much worse length ‚ÄúThe theory that, less virulent strain becomes dominant, people become infected fewer critically sick. virus, still problem, also becomes part solution; every person recovers mild case left greater immunity future infections current vaccines provide.‚Äù first thought must serious says poses high risk. really enough information conclude something like this?

So far sure mostly know basic things like mutations Omicron carries, know people Omicron travelled parts world. details less hazy.

Omicron might become realistic competitor Delta, Omicron might fizzle out.

I think would better say ""Omicron *may* pose high risk, countries must prepare case"". possible early hope. thanks this. can't remember point BBC became insufferable. Australia America media overlords. beat shot? shot lot cheaper think, think taking pill every week use pills. simple preventative measures smoking related cancer + overweight + adult onset diabetes

Completely wrong.

There equivalent getting two shots take 15-30 minutes time.

Just stop spreading bullshit information. Honestly might let China govern US point. Stop trying sink vaccine stocks. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre isolation except youth team didn‚Äôt play Saturday, 44 people isolation home,‚Äù club spokesman said Monday.

‚ÄúTwo three players two three staff symptoms, nothing serious, rest asymptomatic. Everyone waiting repeat tests, soon health authority authorises it,‚Äù added. know patient zero nessecarily right anyway, would still identified region world majority cases originating from.

South Africa tiny amount genetic sequencing covid samples. checked yesterday 97 countries/territories sequenced greater proportion positive tests South Africa. really high rates vaccination among players Primeira Liga, almost 90% vaccinated Janssen - know antibodies decline 90 days. Altough nothing said yet, players must asymptomatic really low symptoms, media would made big fuss it. link source? USA fyi requiring people test leaving home country enter. Everywhere else wants tests arrive. think first real world example Omicron‚Äôs unusually high transmissibility. outbreaks sports teams think never seen amount infections one team. also keep mind soccer teams extremely vaccinated, probably every player fully vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt look good. Quite unlikely, around 70% players league vaccinated smaller clubs percentages lower. source outbreak, South African player returned country, already caught Covid twice come Reddit doctors talking authoritarian states, government easily dismantle scientists potential devastation.

dude train left ago someone explain Omicron many bloody mutations clear parent strain? Could immunocompromised patient zero? insanely improbable antigenic shift within unvaxxed community plethora existing strains? 

Nothing I‚Äôve read seems address theories explanations sheer number mutations. seems troubling aspect thus far. Thanks advance.  Well thank fuck that! think affected much press sansationalism. fucking forcefully vaccinate Africa, time bullshit. ship vaccines say local dictators going see aid money see vaccination rates go up.

Otherwise, fucking seal entire continent let variants disrupt rest world. 13 fully vaccinated? Sure would push timeline discovery thus reaction minimum two weeks thus obscuring making ‚Äúpatient zero‚Äù harder discern. would similar delta picked wild origin discernible traceable. 

But presupposes actually came SA. aren‚Äôt even sure yet. Granted accounts seem way hasn‚Äôt confirmed way beta was. 

Also fyi SA lot genetic sequencing that‚Äôs fight TB set it. yes, probably genetic sequencing lot developed countries hence find mutations. Close Japan. Stop open. new alarmed variant big ‚Äúupdate‚Äù Delta variant spreading Africa approach Europe, world threatened new, deadly wave infection news makes feel pessimistic ever. happen virus keeps ‚Äúupdating‚Äù non-stop get new variant every month latter dangerous previous vaccines can‚Äôt protect us anymore? virus developing fast can‚Äôt catch battle it, tell insane think situation unchangeable, pandemic seriously going end humankind.  said common last name wanna use it. That‚Äôs exactly did. KLM policy test/vaccine get flight honestly think portion antivax people -the ones create memes groups social media etc - know exactly they're doing, fact actions cause people die chasing - feeling power kill people without risk punished. like serial killer without consequences  I'm forgetting all. That's said.

And agree ppl get jab. That's I'm vaccinated. cure, harm reduction measure. Others vaxxed believe still deserve treated. 

Also simple preventative measures smoking related cancer + overweight + adult onset diabetes. Maybe easy getting jab fairly easy. Stop smoking, stop ingesting garbage + lose weight. 
Should pay stupid choices non-treatment too? There's rational difference. emotive one. There's chance may bad Delta. Scientists Africa said symptoms mild far.

This could mean Omicron end dominant variant, symptoms mild (and continue remain mild everyone), one would die get hospitalized this. Omicron would simply like another cold.  There‚Äôs lot talk Australia‚Äôs covid response American media inexplicable reason. forget Austria Lockdown week week that, vaccinated recovered able outside. healthcare capacity able increased many flat leaving medical field? Nurses especially. Simillar Gamma Brazil. first detected Dec 2020, peak March-April. right vaccine works wouldnt safe travel? Low volume Futures trading Thank you, Tywin. probably right, slowing flow help better understanding different actually is. Exactly. Irish hospitals definitely security.

Irish different us lol crazy minimum sentencing guidelines, 4 years common sentence many things. lived dubai, know sure want get put prison there. slightly tanned Canadian ass agrees Everything fine meme Yep, UT Southwestern Texas, last time checked post weeks ago. I'm confident too, surprised announced yet. Like others said holidays likely. 

Just thinking back times I've gone lab holidays check samples past 20 years, none shit affected public health safety like does.... feelsbad. I'm guessing known announced. asking both. thank clarifying information. babe wake new vaccine dropped New York City approximately 25,000 covid deaths mid-June. definitely need second dose close timing; nothing. third dose 6+ months might good, - know while. ask want know whether think ban vaccinated person symptoms tested negative work extended period, seems quite relevant. it‚Äôs functioning democracy. leaders selected fair elections. free press. Voters free send current government packing don‚Äôt like pandemic response.  strain started November 12th, maybe even before. It‚Äôs already everywhere. months absolutely get single mRNA dose. Figuring exactly many months harder. Exactly. strain started November 12th, maybe even before. It‚Äôs already everywhere. strain started November 12th, maybe even before. It‚Äôs already everywhere. antibody test prior taking booster shot January earliest, take shot? strain started November 12th, maybe even before. It‚Äôs already everywhere. COVID month ago I'm fully vaxxed? European approach bend backwards anti vaxxers. surprised one bit. Even decade (it be) still need permanent changes health care system.  Moderna shown better Pfizer would go instead Pfizer  Still case would able link back variant originally infected immunocompromised person. given deltas dominance expect ancestor delta. 

This seems nothing common variant. Also rural poor. bet small hold farmer Mozambique would lot trouble getting tested COVID tried hard it. None things necessarily change puts public informed position. CDC still make recommendations want. States put whatever restrictions legally entitled make. would simply change public perception something closely resembles reality. might reduce hysteria new variant shows would expect show up. 

Most questions things need addressed Makes sense guess Lift travel ban people die ? 
I think dude!!üëéüèº requirement provide passport number nationality PCR Antigen test valid travel? 
According CDC website, U.S. peoples traveling international destination U.S. required present valid PCR Antigen test airline order board flight. require name one identifying information (which could dob passport number).  
""What information must included test result? 
Information identifies person (full name plus least one identifier date birth passport number)"" 
However noticed many PCR test centers ask passport numbers, nationality, sometime even flight numbers. law rule states information must test order valid? prefer give medical system foreign country information necessary. person talking policy says endemic. would mean putting real policies prevent spread. gap announcement becoming ""a cold"" could decades. one knows play saying like fact disingenuous. Loss taste smell found half cases. don‚Äôt need many cases go ‚ÄúHey, coin flip seems keep coming heads, maybe probability different.‚Äù roll immunocompromised play virus evolution appreciated. movie bad, though. remember hated it! pair, whose names nationalities released

So Americans!l? Would anyone care speculate Covid lingering Midwest, September wave early November wave, especially compared south massive spike earlier fall back low levels (eg &lt;10 cases per 100,000)? 

I‚Äôm tired. Someone please tell - even it‚Äôs wild guess - Midwest reach levels again? remember early days people like ""only overweight dies."" remember googling 66% Americans overweight obese. extent, lockdowns limited impact. things quite bad, people stay home. Businesses close. Lockdowns occur public support them. don‚Äôt happen, it‚Äôs absence public support.  one happy good news. yesterday, L.A. County said sequenced cases still 100% Delta. also 100% positive Omicron already here. I'm vaxxed ""90% death severe death"" seem great think close unvaxxed folks. people know gotten severe symptoms. it‚Äôs way infectious still leads reduced number severe cases, could still burden health system. Atlanta high-risk due direct flights Johannesburg (like http://flightaware.com/live/flight/DAL201/history/20211125/2055Z/FAOR/KATL arrived day Thanksgiving.)

After that, probably every US population center major international airport reasonable possibility first US Omicron case. make much sense, considering J&amp;J basically completely useless! still feel like I'm half vaccinated. Sorry, best ""No."" work you? put ketchup hotdogs, antivaxxers retreat shame. Good let‚Äôs move without lockdowns.  Incorrect. Travel bans greatly slow variant's transmission, thus giving strains familiar outcompete them. matter ""one got may well open gates entirely"" combating variant pathogens work way. Help exactly? 70% used number would stop COVID tracks

But still transmits freely, given chance. VAX otherwise. I'm guessing lack masks. Respiratory virus One theory say unusual constellation mutations suggests may emerged chronic infection immunocompromised person, untreated HIV/Aids article age well. It‚Äôs nuts. It‚Äôs *exactly* predicted would happen allowed virus run rampant immunocompromised people, whose bodies serve ramped petri dishes developing new strains.  Hmm. Could chicken egg kind thing Lift ban, brown American ass. appreciate let world know rhe strain. Good them. point detecting ""early"" others cannot take action. Every country right protect citizens Yeah. France Israel 5 months believe. Still yet, guess DaileyMail UK saying Biden wants adults go get booster soon possible said soon eligible. think former guy White House suggested reduced testing make numbers look better. True. Thank helpful reply :) Travel bans theater, variant everywhere already. Same. *Upset Quentin Tarantino noises* guys dealing anti masker vaxxers business, plan pay working regular schedule. never get conversation employer without kind snark.  also consider testing X% cases begin X% cases actually make hospital testing facility symptomatic ill. fact symptomatic / ill cases mild right point know lot asymptomatic omicron cases circulating seems promising countries vaccine mandates, forcing country impose one easy. Also fair Stupid fixed two ways: either change mindset perish so. Fair moved Michigan Virginia seen anyone wearing masks practice social distancing. bad Virginia well different level altogether. Stores restaurants swarming people one seems bothered pandemic. fully vaccinated due rising cases, getting booster shot next week. Pandemic real. Please get vaccinated stay safe, folks! haven‚Äôt seen anyone saying that. 

I seen post several times people saying it, yet see actual comments like that. mutate spike protein point evades antibodies it‚Äôs also good possibility attach well host cell ACE2 receptors anymore SA doesnt good surveillance. sequence less US. European nations best. variant gets US, CDC going identify quickly. Honestly think overreacting selling Friday. Pil went $10 single day. That's absurd.

I think mostly based new data that's emerged weekend shows *possibly* could less deadly Delta *very likely* vaccines fine vs note tourism, already closed since early 2020 7 layer? need clear instructions! Outside South Africa? It‚Äôs 5000Kms two. guess never watched versions movie ""The Thing"". wonder came management, top-down. 

I jobs, watching much Youtube. information shared chinese - english news back Jan/Feb, CNA suggesting potentially deadly, videos elderly people collapsing street. That's that's currently recommended CDC - one primary series (one shot J&amp;J, two shots Moderna Pfizer) followed one booster scared medicine video games religion pay / incentivize people get life saving medicine many crazy stupid people society. well, got deaths earth.. many anti vaxxers anti maskers. politicization shit show. vaccination rate high compared Asia, oceania even europe abundance vaccines. US pretty bad. course exaggerating ain't great man. comparing Africa. want? Halt travel go full lockdown can't leave homes?

We strict travel rules already Canads. Stricter US even, can't stop 100%. brought amongst group colleagues couple times. pick treat aggressively? 70 year old vaxxed vs 30 year old unvaxxed. Would youngest person prevax vaccines fucking work patients severe Covid die unvaxxed (my ICUs 80+% unvaxxed currently). also know vaxxed patient ventilator likely get unvaxxed staying tube town. 


It‚Äôll always case case basis, it‚Äôs pretty clear us you‚Äôre going severe Covid vaccine, already coming fight AR-15 rather Red Ryder air rifle unvaxxed. I've heard, fact mutated strain COVID far, *could* mean vaccination less effective and/or transmissible. Recent variants labeled 'variants interest', Omicron designated, Delta recent 'variant concern.'

Take I'm saying grain salt - mostly hearsay. I'm really hoping mild version Covid transmissible still offers immunity strains Covid. ends case, could seeing real light end tunnel, knock wood. state live hasn‚Äôt reported anything since last Wednesday, Thanksgiving holiday. difference European countries connected other, country comparable Japan Europe UK, size, surrounded ocean, opinion. Yup. might end two three weeks caution Moderna Pfizer announce vaccines good 85-90% effective breathe sign relief open back up. Jokes you‚Ä¶ actually sure joke on. Either way main media overlord Australian, take backs!   ain't getting Japanese GP :/

Fuck covid... Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* India? South Africa thinks punished receiving travel bans detecting new variant, that‚Äôs perogative. punishment knowing another new strain deliberately withholding *so people leave country spread elsewhere*would far severe. don¬¥t even to. example comes Germany leave South Africa (flights still going) come back long German resident. (As long don¬¥t care 2 weeks quarantine arrival)  
And it¬¥s similar European countries. someone another state trying get WA. thing is, countries don‚Äôt hide information new variants‚Ä¶ decide putting much resources sequencing (just traveled banned find something) worth it‚Ä¶ Sequence less odds finding something decreases SA expecting 10.000 infections week. Brrr immune cells remember antigens adaptable/less specific antibodies. relatively stupid. Among Germany Austria, lowest vaccination rates western europe, due homeopathy. usually are. everyone took proper precautions, could deal ... that's asking lot citizens world. thing relaxes me, clue serverity whatever reason vaccines prevent heavy death..

That's least positive news almost like extremely strict, nation-wide mask wearing actually prevents spread airborne virus... indeed laborers, employer handle them.

Yeah South Africans often need visa travel countries depending restrictions country, may grantingvisas unless they‚Äôre residency, like studying work.  makes say that? course, always good advice - calm mask up, follow social distancing get vaccinated. think folks like situation would whatever keep people scared. vast majority people developed countries vaccinated, plenty also getting booster doses. new variant vaccine resistant much do. need get back normal, can't expect people wear masks distance forever. least that's life I'd like live.  clumping media together, deluge news new variant, even though bodies say one thing: know yet.

Over course weekend, I've seen, read interacted dozens articles publications Omicron. media ‚Äì reputable less reputable ones - quite literally jumping every single word anybody says Omicron, talking heads already talking, pundits speculating.

And for? 

The news ‚Äì any! ‚Äì current time be:

- New variant concern, named Omicron WHO, identified found several countries around world.
- far, know new strain transmissible virulent existing strains, studies underway results known days weeks come.
- know new strain going evade vaccines ‚Äì studies underway results known days weeks come.
- Vaccine companies said getting new mRNA vaccines made tested take X days.

Cut baseless speculation (I literally read article national paper nothing speculation decided go Omicron, instead Xi Nu‚Ä¶), cut reporting every single case worldwide, cut predictions based 4 cases place 10 cases place B‚Ä¶ 

Improve signal noise ratio. Stop flooding readers often baseless pointless information. Funnily enough, morning article two people plane escaping quarantine hotel (they don‚Äôt know how, since watched) caught police airport. Involuntary detention requirements met, apparently. released article day ago stating details yet overreact this

Maybe details?  private security. way army involved securing hotels would big news here. Probably went one emergency exits. nuanced, virus place already, SA simply discovered get happening people find different routes still travel. 

Countries far better testing mandatory quarantines travelers especially see EU. Needing bans shows badly setup begin with.

I actually agree bans counter productive point completely useless. Let's first get data work situation reacted two years ago. wore seatbelt way home today. There's way I'm wearing thing tomorrow. make sense worry areas, worry equivalent worry prior variant recognized.

The amount news coverage, absurdly written articles horrible variant is, simply crazy.

Is manageable? Looking happening Europe would say not. Especially Eastern Europe Germany currently. time low cases coming Delta peak late July.

Wikipedia also pages country. [WELCOME key difference UK, like Spain Portugal, achieved virtually 100% vaccination risky age groups, Austria Central European countries haven‚Äôt. means latter countries much hospitalisations deaths surge comes (while surges come countries vaccines effective enough protecting infection, much less impactful countries vaccinated virtually elderly terms deaths virtually 40s/50s terms hospitalisations).

UK, Portugal, Spain (and others) sticked quite strict age groups vaccinations, paid even younger people wait longer time vaccinated. called European countries small‚Ä¶.

If Japan Europe, would ranked 7th land mass. Russia, Ukraine, France, Spain Sweden bigger, Norway also bigger hair. Germany already bit smaller. mean they're quarantined they're still entering country, right? wonder China Winter Olympics Feb 2022? dont know yet, data drop coming weeks, days. Yet one talks New Zealand, even though borders still firmly shut. indicative reopening scheduled next year, still require 7 days home isolation - even happen I've told. Yup. it.

But doubt South Africans bothered travel ban. can't even afford plane ticket ridiculous prices anyway. 2 conflicting assessments based current data. keep hearing omicron mild also hear ICU doctors Gaetung (South Africa province spreading) saying see lot severe cases hospital. Also, NICD (South Africa's CDC) reports show quadrupling hospital admissions past 2 weeks. Covid almost selection pressure disease severity perspective, going roll dice. Alpha Delta thought severe prior variants. Alpha estimated mortality risk almost double Wuhan original, Delta thought hospitalization rate roughly 2-3 times high Alpha (though research agree this), seen fatality rate calculations.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson responded emergence Omicron making mask-wearing compulsory shops public transport England.
He also asked Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI) review booster programme under-40s, look reducing gap second third vaccine doses.

I agree. designed grab attention, incite clicks, keep us coming back check updates. working me! 

In fairness though thing moving pretty fast. I'm much worried severe illness (myself close contacts 2xvacc) ripple effects businesses whether supply chain issues, staffing, potentially reinstated physical restrictions could devastated health sector. Overreaction much? That¬¥s there¬¥s way around vaccine mandates everyone anymore. Hold on. talking serious conditions; talking getting COVID general. Plus, irrespective severe symptoms were, getting COVID means a) athletes risk getting COVID; b) competition particular athlete. 

Fair enough. went found another article says thing:

""The Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida, said Japan would reverse move earlier month reopen borders short-term business travelers international students. Japan, world‚Äôs third-largest economy, closed tourists since early pandemic, policy maintained even wealthy nations reopened vaccinated visitors."" . Pretty clear me; cannot come student, visitor coming conference another short-term trip.

Of course hope actual characteristic holds across age groups, seems sample way early much clear idea. might also infectious fatal. think posting headlines like (that actually include new studies) risks causing premature optimism, even encouraging people act less safely.

Btw article you‚Äôd like read it. reason would ineligible.

Nothing vaccine active week, let alone weeks. ended getting game hehe! played bit it. Already much interesting first played it. evidence

You mean apart reports deaths?

In fact, reported cases pneumonia variant? 

(it impossible could really godsend variant) Uh think focusing trees missing forest.

The point course likely travelled around world cases examples current community spread area. makes concerning emphasized. Thanks much. will! chance US locks down.

Maybe whole country, put past Jay Inslee lock Washington again. one proactive governors start Covid, surprised led way again.  so, Israel bans foreigners entering country stop Omicron variant?? less aggressive delta.  Oklahoma, USA. I'm like one handful 140 employees still wears mask traveling around building. ""Lockdowns"" like bad word country. saying talking heads US news would use people fully vaccinated getting breakthrough infections. reduces severity like death hospitalization didnt 100 percent stop time. became annoying here. serious ethical hurdles intentionally disseminating virus amongst population.

If think conspiracy theories mRNA vax eye-rolling, don‚Äôt want see response would something like this. course is. live age cross continents day. Perfect era virus spread. Pi.  fucking end even mutations gone through, whether Beta Delta Mu, vaccines may varying degrees protection

This true seen many different mutations, Delta example (I think) half third omicron presenting.

I want keep level head things want make assumptions. Even Delta 6+ months mRNA vaccines remained near 90% death severe disease. amazing. Boosters help it.

But stopping pandemic without precious herd immunity numbers, need sterilizing immunity part, boosters really helped still question omicron. ‚ÄúThat's trade-off vast majority people China willing make, order live lives normally without worrying virus.‚Äù

You said this, covid pretty much front center population, lockdown thousands people single case articles talking multiple pcr tests population.

Sometimes mask wearing peer pressure help there.

Last year tested negative, boarded international flight less 72h later, started symptoms towards end flight. arrived another test positive. U did, first paragraph. headline misleading. ‚ÄúFor infectious disease classed endemic phase, rate infections less stabilize across years (though occasional increases, say, winter, expected).

‚ÄúA disease endemic reproductive number stably one. means one infected person, average, infects one person,‚Äù explained Boston University epidemiologist Eleanor Murray. ‚ÄúRight now, nowhere near that. person who‚Äôs infected infecting one seem hazy definition don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted you‚Äôre right. it‚Äôs less deadly super contiguous, infect everyone, one get super sick, whole pandemic fade miss didge nobody knows that. 

Now, *can* come variant slow replicate neither causes much disease transmits well. India‚Äôs CODAGENIX working strain right used vaccine. Yes deadlier gets quicker itll fizzle out. Remember viruses want host survive long possible, beneficial become transmissible deadly. countries resources genetic sequencing? I'd imagine high list priorities.  true maybe say February/March November longer case South Africa specifically. plenty doses. fact government south africa recently asked delay vaccine deliveries lot doses stock enough take vaccine campaign slowed down. Maybe countries Africa still lack vaccines South Africa suffering vaccine hesitancy point. 

[link horrible accent, though. mean, ever heard Steve Irwin speaking english? ugh. said release that:

Effectiveness vaccines: working technical partners understand potential impact variant existing countermeasures, including vaccines. Vaccines remain critical reducing severe disease death, including dominant circulating virus, Delta. Current vaccines remain effective severe disease death

I think last line implies effective variants? bull market wild. COVID variant potential evade vaccines, become dominant strain, already begun spreading worldwide, several countries already closed borders.

This idea exists vacuum report? Children die covid. Idk gotten memo or? Definitely 4th shots yet, I'm scared might come soon new strain... think continuous reinfection expected strains continue emerge, it‚Äôs still something need verify report. number studies suggest otherwise.

Sounds like Omicron variant gonna big nothing burger ""positive"" news false though. yet prove anything. dont want live planet anymore. that, it'a RURAL. grew Rural KY. know people there... Even suspect COVID, get tested. put family work, they'll continue going work unless symptoms become obvious, need hospitalized. that, I've read apparently places testing pretty expensive (though take grain salt, time actually confirm that). case, that's even inventive people simply get tested.

I'm holding breath see variant spreads severity cases countries pretty solid systems place compared somewhere rural testing may great begin with...  Shitting Trump ""woke"" thing. think leaders age 50 waste space. going good amount blood WHO's hands.

Technically endemic means disease occurs predictable frequency, common parlance ""endemic"" means ""given trying control"". bad idea left unchecked covid continue mutate even faster ways can't predict. worst case scenario see omicron vaccines still protect us severe disease infection calculated based priors? don‚Äôt think so, booked travel RSA Canada 7 Dec 23 Dec - understood (fully vaccinated adults/teen unvaccinated child) needed negative PCR tests board plane get back home (as per rules destination country, probably transit country well, case Germany). applied going RSA. 

So would surprised passengers hadn‚Äôt PCR tested leaving South Africa (unless Netherlands didn‚Äôt require it?). would truly surprising unlikely.  need long enough fight virus. secret strategy fight virus instead try herd immunity, calculated need least four years combat virus (pace virus vs. capacity hospitals).  ***shit*** already here. agree. Covid work way population. Vaccination natural immunity slow significantly.  Internet ticket, plane, easy, list anything, hotel guarded specialized army unit, idea got away. Airports, airplanes , testing landed Canada 2 week isolation let count ways. already talking new restrictions mandatory 10 day quarantine travelling.... sigh.

Ontario ultra-super restrictive, Michigan opposite. wish middle ground honest.  article exactly sum happening, hope get data confirm Everyone assumed would called NU, it‚Äôs not. variant everyone thought would called NU. Pfizer Moderna produce exact antibodies? Absolutely. It‚Äôs taken away things make life worth living. feel bad absolutely lots people much much worse situations. ‚Ä¶ fuck. moved australia always told could manage plane ride away home  Always two is. more, less. Omicron sounds like best Covid yet! Gotta collect all! Repost. I‚Äôve made conscious effort spend less time news time nature. Whew. difference. It‚Äôll take decades unpack all, fact remains long I‚Äôd much rather Western states China citizen. 

Other hand, yes, balance could improved. tradeoff Chinese style totalitarianism worth it? guess don‚Äôt care rights relative safety, still maintain Taiwan Korea better models. Maintaining rights matters too, matter CPC maintains. I'm incredibly sorry loss. :( 

People lose jobs taking medical leave. Canada US? [that's still $20 appearing BC first, continuing minor case apocalypse, but... eh, close enough. increase capacity? extent? get expertise? takes 11 years train doctor least 2 train newbie, green nurse.

And people want take care Covid patients anymore. unvaccinated many along families terribly abusive staff insist bizarre futile treatments. 

The real solution living life ""normally"" regular vaccines boosters accept percentage population going die let unless find magical curative drug.  Well, think happen, two reasons might lessons learned Delta also winter coming holiday season, oh flu season. could make effect worse, even little less severe.  4 year max here, 87.000 EU fine, maximum punishment.

I'd guess they'll go jail couple months get months probation. follow restrictions CJ!   would assume COVID + HIV pretty bad even HIV control Japanese Japanese-American? Would make difference. trying hard change conversations lockdown. huge surge cases caused people refuse get vaccinated. complain corollary reactions state actors wasting breath that‚Äôs problem solution is. much obvious, bandaid bullet wound travel banning African countries literally everywhere. want take super seriously travel ban everyone, I'd hope we're past now.

It's pretending one stupid set self destructive assholes worthy another medical attention neither rational humane. Thanks, Obamacron‚Ä¶ One important factor many consider testing: LOT testing, find many cases would go undetected many countries. Every pupil Austria tested least 3 times week (mandatory!), PCR tests required many activities. infection rates countries may appear lower, may higher.

Still, situation bad parts country, ERs full, system collapsing (yet). strong anti-vaxxer community, major party Austria (far-right, populist, racist FP√ñ) promotes Ivermectin instead vaccines. big pile shit responsible thousands deaths, hoping get votes next elections. shit scare us more.  could name Spikey.  can't one thinking insane crazy?  Well says something transmittability. see symptoms worsen. get lot clarity next week. Thirteen cases √ìmicron variant identified Portugal, National Institute Health Doutor Ricardo Jorge (INSA) announced Monday, adding 13 positive samples ""associated cases infection Belenenses SAD players, since one positive cases recent trip South Africa.

""Preliminary tests carried INSA strongly suggest 13 cases associated Belenenses SAD players related √ìmicron variant concern,"" reads INSA statement sent press.

To ensure break transmission chains following precautionary principle Public Health, ""pending information regarding transmission, impact vaccine effectiveness √ìmicron variant"", institute states health authorities ""determined prophylactic isolation contacts infection cases associated outbreak, regardless vaccination status level exposure"".

""These contacts remain isolated undergo regular testing early possible day 5 day 10,"" institute says.

New variant discovered South Africa increased risk reinfection.

INSA also indicates analyzed samples ""218 passengers flight Maputo landed Lisbon airport November 27th"".

On flight capital Mozambique, ""only two positives detected, one associated variant Delta allowing correct identification"", INSA begun genome sequencing final confirmation cases. However, ""the predictive value tests already performed high"".

The Dr. Ricardo Jorge National Institute Health recalls new variant, initially identified South Africa southern African countries, also identified recent days European countries. ""However, still scientific data support greater transmissibility ability reduce effectiveness current vaccines,"" said INSA statement.

Like countries, Portugal also taken measures new variant, considered ""concern"" World Health Organization (WHO). INSA says throughout territory health authorities ""strengthen epidemiological surveillance, implementing control measures, prophylactic isolation contacts cases infection √ìmicron variant history travel southern Africa previous 14 days, regardless vaccination status, precautionary principle Public Health.

INSA continues monitor genetic variants new coronavirus, stressing ""Portugal aware situation, maintaining ongoing monitoring program variants national level"".

The US absolutely quarantine citizens historical precedent allows take action.  interesting know symptoms. I‚Äôm hoping omicron turns mild.

Look South Africa COVID-19 real-world data, vaccination percentage quite low ~28%, death rate - flat, cases rising (almost week now). enough data end week Testing without mandatory quarantine would still big useful step country know risks.

That's incredibly dumb. Testing isolating needs standard practice comes prevention spread. unlike idiots Netherlands, keep passengers single room 21 hours allow positive cases infect individuals negative tested may spreading virus without knowing it.

Mandatory quarantine violation rights comes public health measures US precedent take action.

The article posted Bloomberg mentioned drove 250 miles without single location get vaccine. don‚Äôt commercial systems system HIV patients. something work from. Naw keep ban whole 6 months  done studies many people antibodies, way people tested positive. exactly big mystery.  Two weeks big Moderna Pfizer actually pump new vaccine 90 days.

 getting information from? Can't spell Mr.Mureddu without Murder! Scientist need ask permission government share data scientific community around world. Unless top secret project something..lol Absolutely. clear need people get vaccinated, stay top vaccination.

Covid eventually need seasonal boosters--like influenza, first need get pandemic. mine pfizer I'm savvy mutation data. please provide place results listed? article read? universal healthcare might able convinced potential solution, everyone's costs increase - insurance premiums, cost healthcare, etc. - hospitals flooded patients can't afford pay cost hospitalizations pocket. affects us. first mutation we've recognized getting people sick even believe sufficient immunity covid, many steps away virus infect you, even fully immunized, get sick?

We're ready yet. We're still working getting much world vaccinated. scenario tough handle we're still much pandemic. Well, exactly happened Austria last year, big outbreak reported, afraid lose tourists.

Shooting messenger never wise, one point, messengers appear. Sure. seems like still spread 100% vax, makes masks simple obvious solution  Nope. It‚Äôs something they‚Äôre already thinking Rest World: Nah, B. cool. true, can't cite amorphous number using known one citation

we much testing countries beginning learn 5% positivity actually means enough testing

Unfortunately requires competent global co-operation. Still twice high percent population unvaccinated terrible. 

We see happening US self described liberals 93% vaccines conservatives 60%. seem bad realize means 85% unvaccinated conservatives. think want list places visited.  thought case now? matters discriminate country job detected new variant warned everyone general policy. current approach punishes messenger. like boarders exactly open begin with... want go travel ban route, block travel everywhere, since that's variant likely is. Blocking country always way behind. We've seen pandemic previous ones.

What might make difference cheaper cost quarantine travelers regardless country origin. possible less dangerous contagious variant Cvid could one day compete variants?

Isn't ultimately better virus host die? Queue *well least you‚Äôre US* comment‚Ä¶ There‚Äôs perverse thing going COVID getting worse means economy won‚Äôt get good interest rates won‚Äôt rise good stock prices. things looking better, prices dive interest rate increases around corner.

Evolution active choice evolving body - game statistics. Planets, stars galaxies also 'evolve' similar ways. may need revise basic understanding seems confusing. right mean sane... sayin love whole country superspreading weekend. don‚Äôt know number comes from, remembered right, nearly 40000 people Shenyang quarantined one outbreak last December alone, tens outbreaks, affected tens cities. Speaking recently, Chengdu, Chongqing Dalian many smaller cities effectively went moderate lockdown past month, border cities like Ruili hard lockdown half year. side evidence Chinese economy hit bad US summer‚Äôs Delta outbreak.

The trade-off simple speak. It‚Äôs going help lot vaccinated. Plus masks distancing, lot people working office - much better shape 2020. much better shape country unvaccinated pro-COVID freaks. 

We know cope.

Our governor already declared state emergency beef hospital staffing. Lung transplant patients tend die decade after.

We really take covid seriously enough. Aside direct mortality rate there‚Äôs whole wave medical complications current approach permitting unchecked spread causing us 30 years.  Yeah, that‚Äôs one higher ones Africa unfortunately   strain likely originate either. punishing making everyone aware. il travel bans specific countries unlikely maker practical difference. Oof. Sucks. hoping visit Japan soon even PR's hard time cells recognize antigens protein sequence-dependent manner, mutations could potentially allow virus evade previously established cell immunity, especially spike protein, omicron greatest number mutations yet seen. 

B cells cells produce antibodies.

I fully appreciate many economic social downsides lockdown. But, variant going burn right us anyway, I‚Äôd like lockdown compensation, please.  John Hopkins University, isnt hospital though. university, campus, hospital research buildings like small city. probably needs police force like UCLA large universities.

He's kind right. reason travel ban would ever effective knew 100% going prevent variant escaping. time variants concern detected/recognized, they're already world transmitted locally (even country knows not). harsh travel bans show actually fucking nothing separate families.

I personally even buy argument ""But travel bans slow spread"" variant already everywhere. Even ban specific country travel someone travel via another country. going wait three months see 27% country around hundred million people, 45 million 48 million. Enslave make drive poop trucks.

that's false, here's actually said.  Yep - even back April 2020, fear COVID new, vaccines, something like 2-3K+ Americans dying day, still armed protests several states defy lockdowns

It would straight chaos violence another lockdown attempted   said cold, immune forever. I'm quite sure hospitals security lol. Canadian ones lot security, too.

Still worth it, course. say 3 million meant total matter understand numbers Maintaining vaccines would definite must, regardless mutations, there‚Äôs still people higher risk virus.

O-micron. Omni-cron Hm yeah look good. 500 something 800 something rise right? Planned surgery probably incredibly safe.

Expert: ‚ÄúIt could don‚Äôt know yet‚Äù

Media: Experts say could end pandemic news outlets post articles every time single case omicron discovered. saying people shouldn‚Äôt cautious get vaccinated, scary headlines definitely generate lots clicks. would spawn slew ‚Äúmove Florida‚Äù commercials, advertising falling real estate prices beachfront property. Yeah, certainly possible start going fast, I'm questioning idea *already* widespread masked largely asymptomatic. case, would already showing increased positivity rate. UK.  That‚Äôs press release.

So think world pick one newspaper tv station gets report story?

There isn‚Äôt deluge one source, you‚Äôre bringing attention subreddit acting newsfeed hundreds sources. individual source one two articles. 

If don‚Äôt want see Reuters nytimes Washington post Associated Press BBC Guardian Irish News VG and‚Ä¶ go single source trust. 

You‚Äôre reloading news feed complaining it‚Äôs news feed. many people WA upset government‚Äôs handling Covid. 

It takes UK twenty-five minutes rack many Covid cases WA entire pandemic‚Ä¶ cases first month back 2020 increase risk cancer, perhaps might still worth giving elderly patients? thought cancer take years develop risk might minimal older people also ones highest fatality rate. there's one common theme pandemic, ""temporary"" measures lasting far longer anyone expected. least cautious person know oldest. goes plan take trip Japan next year Go it. Make so! Barring freak symptoms, think within days monitoring determine it‚Äôs severe. young SA people got sick month ago deathbed hospital then.

I'm saying sure anything, looks promising. There's little evidence either way, none point towards lethal. little evidence points towards mild. Churchill never said this. American politicians falsely attributed points. still weeks away enough data make hard conclusions Omicron, going fact international cases serious condition.

I'm reminded articles saying thing COVID detected outside China. ""None international cases serious condition, none dead"", guy Taiwan died, several diamond princess cases started needing treatment outside ship. Took least week news stop trying put positive spin international cases.

I remember thing Delta started reported outside India. ""It appears contagious, less deadly UK variant."" summer fall waves pretty much ended notion ""done"" Covid vaccines.

All know Omicron mutated dominant variants, appears virulent enough compete Delta. would hold buying less deadly cope pieces least weeks this, I've seen song dance enough know usually age well. largely thinking UK European governments. Trump count; he's stupid impossible tell whether something malice ignorance. problem rapid test working, work Netherland's passengers doubt US, unlike UK demanding PCR test enter country. Like much pandemic it‚Äôs best wait least couple weeks data look at. can‚Äôt get worked every time something may may end concerning. still better deal without adding wood fire bringing even cases SA. unaware vaccines. I'm judging brother male friends. got Pfizer vaccinated early due teacher.

However, case football teams know majority players got shots beginning season part league vaccination campaign. got J&amp;J single dose, therefore practical sportsmen  United States donated vaccines rest entire world combined. half, happen even liberal states. People would literally riot streets call politicians heads sticks. Lockdown right Christmas? Good luck that, midterms would absolute bloodbath. read story years ago first recorded instance quarantine history. pharoah ordered military surround village kill anyone trying leave. prevent spread terribly deadly disease wiped entire village. Archaeologists found village discovered disease chicken pox. Back thousands years ago, chicken pox terrifying disease near 100% mortality rate. several thousands years co-evolution, mainly childhood illness dangerous us typical flu virus.

Problem is, I've never able verify story. can't tell made up, fell cracks DNA sequencing, virology, archaeology. Deaths lag four six weeks cases. we're right beginning thing, going longer really able understand implications we're seeing. data going hard get handle - number deaths number hospitalizations, strain infected vaccinated many times vaccine long ago, prior COVID infection. information need taken account understand much problem have. SA low vaccine rate.

You're right low amount cases noticeable, reckon amount cases low. We're seing loads countries finding it, Belgium, Canada, Scotland, Holland.

There many countries receiving low number cases SA reckon.

So think likely lot young vaccinated people SA got infected one month, think geninely good sign deaths increased. That‚Äôs Satan dirty. way Murdoch fallen angel‚Ä¶  athletes vaccinated. even Remember USA decided take planeload people home Diamond Princess Yokohama? literally stuck cargo aircraft virtually protection other. Woops! infected. clean passengers evacuation flight even told they'd stuck people infected virus hours confined space. HOARDED VACCINES ALONG WEALTHY COUNTRIES. HOARDED HUNDREDS MILLIONS EXCESS DOSES DONATING. Simple people need simple explanations things happen.  ""Extremely mild symptoms"" omicron spreading faster less deadly

I think yet known fact. hope right though. else rest people? 


Point told so. Thank you. take med little risk cuts chance dying 30%, means ""show effect"" ""peaking"" quite different? stop misinformation right there. Complete antibody escape complete vaccine escape highly highly unlikely, especially boosted. still idea level thing competes won‚Äôt know maybe next week best weekend. Even antibody waning, still significant protection moderate severe disease. shares message people want believe Ah. makes sense. Yes, like unvaccinated children. Vaccines 5 can't come soon enough. calling another lockdown? figured first heard news, moment two panic idea covid strain could infect enough test positive quickly. is‚Ä¶ good news?‚Ä¶. guess? things considered. Japan closing borders... deja vu point, seen hospitalization spike

[Hospitalization quadrupled 2 weeks (from 135 580) Guateng Province (epicenter Omicron). They're shitty. can‚Äôt unwell else he‚Äôd tested surely? ‚ÄúIf get sick die quickly particular virus, virus less opportunity infect others. ‚Äú entirely correct, largely expected vaccinated individuals; also likely indicator we're dealing variant significant immune escape ability (and articles mentioning lot football players got J&amp;J known less effective variants). Obviously need data anecdotal observations, we're seeing clearly better news finding people admitted ICU couple days experiencing symptoms.

It probably line variants, possibly like Alpha Delta far severity goes. think Beta actually dangerous one far, less transmission ability Alpha never really got foothold outside South Africa. PCR tests pick infections couple months back passengers might contagious time may recovered infection still testing positive. husband situation. real possibility able see mother alive. hope Omicron dosent become big thing

We know bad Omicron is. appears contagious, know less bad Delta people get infected.  flight 600 passengers. ~60 positive. 13 Omicron. 

So 13/600, roughly 2%  hit Canada, here. disease severity perspective good thing?? I'm guessing first case found northeast. Maybe NYC again. around months. I‚Äôve read, mutated current state late September early October. based similar process determined early virus actually Washington State Well said. wear stupid mask people, onerous request. Exactly one omicron spreading faster less deadly. good thing, virus endemic deal , vaccines. like flu except better vaccines. refuse vaccinate, thier problem.  women men also suffer auto-immune disorders. 30 year olds pregnant stick pfizer/biontech, 30+ take offered, pfizer moderna. Really, hospitals need stop accepting COVID patients they're vaccinnated. Cruel, yes....but point, unvaccinated fucking health care might need future. Besides, unvaccinated made choice, let bear consequences accordingly. another lockdown going psychologically financially devastating lot people :( JASON I'm surprised, embarrassed. like can't stop showing world much suck. double vaxxed

Small correction: They're vaxxed, probably got Jansen. saw people saying gave one football players get fully vaxxed faster. US *lot* problems, anyone says doesn‚Äôt actually know third-world country like. America much better world, especially ‚Äúdeveloping‚Äù nations‚Äîin fact, military makes life miserable said nations. Also adding third test 3 days landing quarantine hotel home wait period seems plan countries lifted blanket bans. US position seems since point tying stop really, bare minimum buy time 10% passengers 2 planes test positive, think another lambda?

Interesting POV, make much sense. world surprises everyday joys living country verge another lockdown

The bad news is, 13 members soccer team Portugal confirmed infected Omicron.

The good news is, every one 13 cases either mild symptoms, completely asymptomatic. players team vaccinated.

So again, thee feeling vaccinated/boosted, may still get it, anything serious. Yeah, sure. Right no! fuck's sake, stop reading reply actually read comment responding to.

Nobody saying people exercising. Nobody saying people take steps obese. They're saying, take common sense measures prevent spreading things (washing hands, get vaccinated, etc). Walking fucking treadmill going that.

**Obviously** people healthy, physically active, great shape going hold disease much better aren't. OP saying obese, unvaccinated, gross hygiene... Maybe consider things order:

1. Get vaccinated.

2. Wash hands regularly.

3. Exercise form healthy habits.

Rather order:

1. Exercise longer obese

2. wash hands

3. get vaccinated wouldn‚Äôt hurt improve overall quality air even without Covid worry about. Evade direct antibodies, perhaps, evade memory response immune system, no. I‚Äôd still get vaccine. way vaccines targeted alpha weren‚Äôt fully effective preventing delta infection extremely effective preventing severe disease. Bruh country digital certifications QR code issued government soon vaccines arrived exhaustion relevant virus. things genetic components. every smoker gets cancer every lung cancer caused smoking.

Omicron's spike protein different, protected?

Thanks advance explanation SA purely anecdotal two people work complain weird flu makes dizzy side effects.

The cases underreported sure tests cost much filling car cases could quite high. isn‚Äôt feeling many people dying like delta started up. early July. 

That said delta unvaccinated besides health care workers. implying one deathbed SA omicron? 100 people ICU Gauteng, I've read big recent increase. know known many omicron, assumption seems that's what's driving increase. reading different numbers? Yes are. need negative test returning USA South Africa, since November 8th. Considering global air travel didn‚Äôt exist back Spanish flu era, I‚Äôd draw meaningful comparisons there. 
I think best hope vaccines remain effective variants us choose coexist safely COVID-19 able so. 

I‚Äôm really sure many talking like become endemic though. 
It simply much transmissible measures place prevent jumping around world forever, constantly evolving along way. Actually keeping pandemic impacted Australia neighboring countries. 
It crushing blow seemed like bit return world's normal routine.
Now anyone's guess things turn out. say mister vIrOlOgIsT. argument: omicron beyond containment travel bans mega disruptive? Deepl translation:

Now 14 people omikron variant Netherlands

There 14 people Netherlands shown new omikron variant. also concerns someone flew back South Africa weekend undergo test Schiphol Airport, reports Minister De Jonge.

*Further analysis shown people tested positive far probably contracted virus different places. ""In case flight,"" De Jonge writes Lower House.*

The minister said earlier inconceivable already infections new corona variant Netherlands radar. Scientists still many questions omikron variant. remember Virologists studied World Warcraft virus outbreak caused bug. outbreak, people would go way catch virus run many crowds people possible succumbing it. thought ridiculous time - odd terrorist, would something like that? 
Now - oh. Right? 

If people think side effects bad, wait get virus! amount shutdowns going stop covid point. may able slow down, pick right back soon lift restrictions. Lockdowns merely delay inevitable. simply know effect vaccines' prevention severe illness death. early know. Japan ""fairly open travel"". borders closed everyone since march 2020.

They barely started plans let students Nov. 8. Every day. True. Philippines, many public transport drivers resorted begging eat. 

Government support SMEs also non existent. live university district, sad see many businesses folded. one talking wishing death anyone, wtf talking about??

Strawman argument even vaccine requirement, cements theory theater.

If ridiculous restrictions necessary, think we'd massive covid-19 outbreak campus constantly hearing people getting sick....yet haven't.  Well say said? don‚Äôt know transmissible doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean severe disease say hospitals overwhelmed? UK banned though Alpha variant. Sweden banned flights year. can't help shake irrational thought somehow pandemic collective punishment Tiger King thing. second this, newsnodes first finding good tracker. Found data GISAID click Source South Africa row newsnodes page go either way. 

Ideally want less severe compete delta terms transmission.  save suspense. ok, like everyone else gotten vaccinated. I‚Äôve seen discussions omicron seemed pose first vaccines have-not nations boosters wealthy nations, either-or proposition. Anybody got reliable information this? conversation really need having. many Antivaxx chicks US, they've made clear never get vaccinated ""muh freedom!!!!!"" lost cause. mean even mama trump telling get vaccinated booed tell u antivaxx Well, commuting, least car likely heavy pandemic becuase fewer people taking mass transit fear COVID transmission. know answers great questions yet. Omicron known world governments truly horrendous needing extreme reactions, limiting travel bans. keep secret either.

I mean recordings American president knowing bad covid telling everyone big deal. 

I'm saying case theres definitely proof happened 2020. Source this? know fact it‚Äôs South Africa? sequenced doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs there.

The main thing could ""know"" would escaped vaccine immunity. case, they'd probably focused selling Pfizer/Moderna/JNJ stock rather passing new protective measures. point dark part wishes Covid started vicious. People dying sight, streets. seeing horrendous effect happens need hospital care privacy laws. 

If people dropping streets maybe people would taking seriously. way modern advancements made worse treat enough, prevent, enough, make seem like common cold enough people take seriously. mean, things considered, I'd still rather worldwide pandemic. go global shutdown finally, let's clean mess up. suffering younger populations covid fall-out byproducts restrictions limits paused life past couple years IMMENSE. 

The reality sacrificed youth‚Äôs lives mostly protect old sick.  looking one Damn. I'm really sorry. decision totally understandable. work ICU nurses doctors putting pandemic important, also I'm sure incredibly stressful, exhausting, traumatic them. hope find new career like without go bunch hassle.

If mind asking, experience much intense ICU work last months compared previous wave?

Good luck. may get best lawyer, still get one. self represent cannot appeal grounds mistrial Influenza yearly. Cov seems might every 3 months look rate waning efficacy. thoughts frequency? Let's face it: variants going keep popping up. Omnicron already found countries. can't keep blanket travel bans years come new one discovered. 

What really needs happen every country require travelers vaccinated provide proof negative COVID test upon entry. keeps equitable everyone every country. Hell, make get rapid test airport land even add quarantine period. science community even saying that's best way forward point.

Dec. - Feb. South Africa's busiest tourism season summer there. Last year, another variant popped around time SA reported many people probably cancelled trips lockdown. hoping bounce back year, travel bans dealing another blow ahead busy tourism season. THAT'S South Africans particularly peeved time around singled countries omnicron cases confirmed not. That's fair feel.  eventually everyone really going say fuck carry usual kill lot people. 

Most USA says hello. Maybe fuck - delta didn‚Äôt foothold S.A. it‚Äôs apples apples comparison.  working fine too. Also, updating much tracker: Definitely case NY. Still forced back offices new variant, Thanksgiving Black Friday there's mass gatherings crowds. Telecommuting 100% time working fine reason go back office make appear everything okay excuse keep paying rent.  No, care people, even they're part family friendgroup. think unvaccinated misguided dont wish death upon them. dont want old, vaccinated lady die breakthrough case cant find hospital bed stroke overburdened hospitals due antivaxx. it‚Äôs transmissible it‚Äôs mild? hospitals would overwhelmed. it‚Äôs transmissible mean it‚Äôs severe? I‚Äôm genuinely asking don‚Äôt know less 10% people fully vaccinated though. course almost everyone unvaccinated. 

Also, can't imagine many football players demographics risk anything mild symptoms 99.99% time, even previous infections and/or vaccination. may get great lawyer, still get one. represent cannot appeal grounds mistrial. again, it‚Äôs going outbreak unvaccinated.

The people sympathy healthcare workers going deal conspiracy peddling morons people unable vaccinated medical reasons worry encountering antivaxxers. true say: women Omicron Persei 7, men Omicron Persei 9. wait turns bad, way late.  Exactly. someone still owed $1400 Delta cancelled flights June 2020, answer likely, ‚Äúno.‚Äù  one knows happen. government respond moving target many unknown variables appeasement? would response been?

‚ÄúI‚Äôve many great responses, many people saying so, honest god, man came me, tears eyes, saying sir, you‚Äôve many tremendous responses.‚Äù definitely care two reasons. care minimizing suffering world, since vaccine minimizes suffering wish people would lament people getting vaccinated whatever reason. Secondly, people vaccinated cause lot suffering families healthcare workers. One thing dangerous mental well think people needlessly dying think ""whatever"". still tragedy. Talking testing kiddo. didn‚Äôt say anything detaining. want get technical, citizen detained 72 hours point must charged released. Holding someone indefinitely without due process agree NYC miles ahead somewhere like Texas Florida sequencing approach COVID, grading US poorly 'monolith' correct approach. like group projects, weakest link drags whole team. Even hold NYC shining example, comparative sequencing/cases since Jan 2021 - New Zealand 30%, Australia, 13%, UK 14%, *NYC 8%*, US 5.5% Yup. 2 kids old enough vaccinated. It‚Äôs going looooooong winter. lol, flu Glad hear that. havent. done part. decided jump car middle trip. emotional unreasonable. Antivaxx dont care others, people think ""im vaccinated fuck everyone"". dont get decide interventions needed.

CDC quite clear masks even vaccinated incidence higher 50 positive rate you‚Äôve fully resume activities prior pandemic. reduce risk infected Delta variant possibly spreading others, wear mask indoors public area substantial high transmission. areas high substantial incidence know. They'd rather react early ease restrictions. act late start pandemic over.

Basically they've closed borders till get idea serious omicron is. rate spread around world already know extremely transmissible, need know equally lethal Delta, strong immunities. certificate isn‚Äôt valid. Honestly, I‚Äôd rather ban willingly unvaccinated hospitals restrictions rest us. Time get damn lives back. Perpetuate thing rail ignorant actions masquerading rugged individualism.  Nothing really changed accepted life now. got lucky affect taste sniffer wrong still. Hopefully get back normal. Yes. honestly 5 get feeling increased. still gonna concern heart attack hospitals full morons  I‚Äôll never go back cold nose. study going around compared antibody levels among bunch different combinations. I‚Äôm sure find google bit. Moderna vax + Moderna booster resulted highest antibodies, Pfizer vax + Moderna booster better Pfizer vax + Pfizer booster. Yes, I‚Äôve gotten point ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Overrated know levels least halved 4 months. know translates protection. antibody study I'm still pending first report. think point early 2020 waited covid obviously huge deal start taking steps. know omicron big deal yet, time we're sure response far behind. may need act assumption worst true. public health measures work without universal compliance.

I'm sorry, pandemic, value right individual refuse get tested possibly transmit dangerous virus community less important community's need stop viral transmission. Worked fine me. Pretty neat. Nicely said  saw one grandmother holidays 2019. passed away spring, fortunately restrictions eased enough dad could see then. seen grandmother person since holidays, zoom.

I think sad truth pandemic. time passes without seeing loved ones, make assessment decide see person.

I covid October 2020. took year almost fully recover, desire avoid getting covid outweighed desire see people person. brief period summer year fully vaccinated, case numbers low life felt sort normal again.

I bunkered delta wave, case numbers look good I'm boosted. I'll see people it'll probably mostly outdoors, however, knows see remaining grandmother person again. best way contain spread deadly disease people kept apart one another.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  many play actually infected. Wonder many 13 cases people infected 2 doses vaccine.... one cannot maintain without sacrificing people extreme extent

The European model (including Norwegian model) includes accepting massive numbers deaths, huge damage economy, widespread restrictions everyday life *everyone* go indefinitely.

You're complaining one town 200,000 people several lockdowns, side equation billion people largely normal lives rest world suffers large death tolls recurring restrictions everyday life economy.

Get perspective. would procrastinate getting booster.
 current seasonal wave right Guateng, SA (where Omicron discovered) vs. previous seasonal waves indicates cases appear rising much quicker. Downvote away, thought people would want appear increasing well (750 yesterday vs 860 today What‚Äôs point? What‚Äôs point? body talking getting rid Omnicron, there's even talk getting Covid general current vaccination regime.

Time used analyze act upon it. know deadly Omnicron is, researcher needs time identify it. Moreover since mRNA churn vaccines like churn shit, one still need time produce deliver it. 

If Omnicron infectious preliminary finding is, end point overtake Delta, like Delta overtake Alpha.. every single time saved intensive bed saved, mean life saved. 

I know concept foreign you... Oh here, let's nothing curb it.. get eventually anyway. Occupancy rate ICU damned. 

That's individual got vaccinated took care priority someone choose get vaccinated while

Individual actively spent life healthy priority obese joe shoves KFC bowls breakfast? Really? Maybe look different mask? double layer cloth masks quite comfortable. honestly kind like wearing mine, especially gets colder. become second nature hardly even notice anymore. South African claimed yesterday although excess vaccine, access difficult; one might travel 100 miles get nearest vaccine site. idea true could confirmed way. Two them? Reddit?  Giving false hope patients smh Drink fluids take Tylenol. clear around 24-36 hours post shot.

I‚Äôd expect Tuesday morning feeling better. like can't 

Its making something extinct. thought supposed good that. think people accept official story behind 911 called truthers. years could wrong. 90% cases omicron dude. Omicron took dominant variant 2\~4 weeks. took 2\~3 months delta that. Meanwhile, data op kinda shits delusional optimism. company actively moving away decades successful remote work policies investing ‚Äúprestige‚Äù office spaces. 

Way read room, guys. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Oh good god, shit starting exhaust me. If/when flu strains even half severe 1918 H1N1 ever popped up, course yes. Saying U.S. never locked disingenuous. plenty businesses never going reopen doors resume activities restrictions put places like restaurants, live events, hospitality others.  governments acting minute-by-minute data still several days released yet countries locked still predicament. extreme still find surges. issue ICU already strain unvaccinated people atm

So stop treating them. chance. 

If want play fire let get burned. anyone know site stays up-to-date myths busted regarding masks, vaccinations, Covid?

I Clubhouse room evening someone gish galloping much nonsense energy write research come back argue. Would nice go site get everything easy reference help room get misinformed front me. 

On hand, point, mind made up, suppose actual facts going sway either way.  advocating flu vaccines mandatory everyone? citing worlds experts studies moving goal post? We've never talking nearly full blown isolation scenario bringing conversation moving goal posts. bringing something irrelevant situation. 


Clearly WHO, University Washington, etc understand difference travel ban isolationism. conflate two dense. week ago. Started 2x Pfizer Moderna booster flu time. Shots Friday afternoon issues middle night fever came along. Kicked ass pretty good Saturday, 103 fever. Saturday mid afternoon worst. Fever way evening ticked slightly night went on. Took Tylenol bed. Slept fine woke feeling good Sunday. Yeah get that. again, I'll take ""statements said 6 months ago"" 500. presence new variant alone mean less virulent though. Well one time spanish flu went away /s got Pfizer first two light reactions, soreness site injection honestly worst thing had. switched Moderna booster got last week, since studies showed better long term immunity, damn really fucked up. intense chills shakes, pretty severe body aches particularly joints, severe headache...I count. like said, 24 hours later, right rain. bodies work weird. 

And hey, least means probably got robust immune response. Nope believe people vaccinated recieve priority care unvaccinated. issue stems believe drawn line want magically draw makes feel good  aren‚Äôt locking anyways They're already banning international travelers, Southern African countries. Chances they'll avoid worst Omicron. Well first correlation COVID severity age orders magnitude stronger severity obesity. cases fit, lean 70 year old still going higher risk heavy 30 year old. Data shown time time again. 

And matter are, going people declining slope health‚Äîif live region strong fitness culture overall long lifespans, like ski town rockies, you‚Äôre potentially going lot living 80 year olds vulnerable. least wonders making seem like nothing burger. (unmasked) sat next pre-symptomatic breakthrough case (masked) meeting half hour‚Äîin small room‚Äîand catch it. Tested negative 3, 5, 7, 9 (for good measure) days exposure. 

You're 100% right stupid everyone going comply, masks required even 50% comply, cutting chances spreading. Scientist's dire warnings coming pass political leaders ignoring expediency, name iconic duo. Immunity booster + original course significantly stronger get infection. 

Omicron clearly infecting people again. likely anti vaxxers We're together, folks. already gave ELI5 i'll point news articles showing instance long covid people weaker immune systems. one person hiv/aids kept covid year mutated many times within one person 1. impossible go back March 2020 epidemiologically. possible-Immunity spectrum. Highly unlikely variant completely eliminate immune response entirely
2. Honestly since March 2021 vaccine eligibility opened threat vaccinated folks remained same. Delta didnt jack shit vaccinated folks. people take seriously spend much money uh Christmas season country let biggest capitalism holiday go without milking worth Yup, wife negative PCR tests symptomatic, around 5 7 days exposure. got tested 2 days later came back positive us. I'm really sure useful tests travel. Tests, masking, social distancing; together help limit spread, really think we're going get virus. 
We played rules eventually got it. Luckily fully vaxxed, like mild flu days. really good explanation. anyone watches anime Cells Work, really good explanation type cells do. Learned ever school LOL ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Yeah  strictly enforce 6 months wait looking Vax cards one show 5 months, time frame suggested France Israel? said, read past headlines. started procedures, long, let anyone in.

Fair enough. literally said though. realized said wrong arguing internet can't accept it.

You find plenty threads admit wrong (including comment). literally 10s 1000's people every country traveling country far closing borders entirely.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* also relevant kind impact vaccines it. iirc vaccines right 95% effective (hypothetically 50% vaccinated) makes big difference effectiveness goes 85% versus 75% whatever. unvaccinated impact vaccinated another Mmm... vaccinated parameter considered enough beds ICU? I‚Äôm aware. Yes, one providence Omnicron spike. rest spike South Africa seasonal spike Delta. That‚Äôs would like breakdown. I‚Äôm confused confused you. Oh wow Lie April Im wondering includes packages/mail. know old host family difficult time finding somewhere would allow send package last Christmas. trip Italy January too, fingers crossed! I‚Äôve never overseas supposed first time leaving country. exercising abundance caution variant studied new boosters developed tested. Slow spread hopefully bad, fight effectively control. slowdowns consumers wanting exposed. government can't anything Sakoku 2.0. can‚Äôt blame nurses leaving. disgusting attitudes shown sizable portion nation i.e. right, towards virus leading they‚Äôre acting get hospital, e.g. rudeness/vileness, would make quit too. It‚Äôs unreasonable think folks put crap long. People reject vaccine selfish believe makes likely die. That's opposite selfishness Banning travel place 10s thousands cases going effect banning travel place 2 cases. 2 cases mean locking travel areas higher rates infection pointless. Don¬¥t forget guys average age population around 28 year old. EU 38+ best bet right turn news. speculation they're able properly study variant, that's likely weeks away. Early indications milder, transmissible‚Äîbut I'm telling panic there's news, can't exactly cite positive source, either.

It's gonna undo years progress. There's firm proof completely evades vaccine, long vaccinated, I'd continue living (with added travel restrictions). Maybe little careful throw mask bit frequently. go again.. probably pandemics, everyone gets immunity vaccines infections Even Omicron somehow 100% evades current vaccines (which happen), variants still still infecting people.

If Omicron 100% evades current vaccines, every variant going gone short order.

But, Omicron going 100% evade current vaccines, get boosters initial doses already. never really lock down, unfortunately. Might deep mess actually locked like Australia countries did.  this. remember early days pandemic news agency released certain employer area 40 asymptomatic cases 1 hospital. thought myself, 1 person gave 40 soon we'll hospital. week announced it. 

it good say found xx asymptomatic cases tested day even days since symptoms immediate think discomfort wearing mask pretty negligible relative potential benefit?

As vaccinated individual city 77% residents 89% adults vaccinated whose hospitalization rate 3.4/100,000 people per week, honestly doubt it. It‚Äôs days, Friday saying variant hosted longer presenting symtoms think justified, especially compare current seasonal wave right Guateng, SA (where Omicron discovered) vs. previous seasonal waves. Cases appear rising much might something particular population.

[Here's recent goes several hypotheses Africa affected.  &lt;-- Search would almost certainly work here's direct link.

Agreed (and throughout) great account calming frayed nerves.  literally me; I'm gutted. Canada, can't travel country without vaccinated. Sorry wrong. NPR said new booster could hit trials 60 days.

Knowing that, suspect going 6 months reliably get one CVS/Walgreens.

And isn't, would anticipate they'd authorize immediate use everyone omicron substantial evasion properties.

So, bottom line: Get booster 6 months. become facts. destroyer fear mongers. I'll get worried start beheading people again. Variants though, time mutate, eventually becoming less virulent transmissive. 


Eventually, highly transmissive particularly virulent variant outcompete others die seasonal illness even one little presence all, Spanish flu.    million reasons masks difficult detrimental life.

How think deaf hard hearing community last couple years? Children schools learning speak read? People immigrant communities communicate languages they‚Äôre super familiar accents?

I wonder played role Australia's sudden border delay announcement. came long PM seemed indicate much would change stage, although tbf, that's uncommon. one silver lining omicron thing got get booster asap hope encourages rest reasonable America same. Really hope don‚Äôt lock nurse turned realtor - agree healthcare heading whole. getting known POTS POTs diagnosed women men, know POTS man I‚Äôve researched lot. Women get pregnancy also. malfunction central nervous system. Men better chance recovery women believe. Well they're also antivaxxers. People suing hospital use ivermectin, etc. 


Terrible attitudes drain everybody. Exactly. We've allowing outcomes ignored media way long.

They're large part depression prevalent today's world. i‚Äôm saying wait nothing. wait month collect info draw conclusions. honestly world treated anyone high risk categories last two years. category myself, don‚Äôt want groups pulled seeing everyone act like bound consequences extended beyond us lost genetic lottery. Sincerely hope headline proves sensational next weeks. evolved less deadly species evolved greater immune respones diseases? I'm already fully vaccinated since July. looking like boosters available cohort January-February, manufacturers stated updated vaccines could ready ship 100 days, meaning early March.

It would seem may possibly better waiting month get effective dose.

It's also comical divisive is, simple question immediately gets people jumping downvote button. really understand cling 'natural' immunity. 

I mean argument basically boils 'I'll get thing get protection thing.""
I mean logically ..wtf? Epidemiology PR two different fields. Umm, no. They‚Äôre uncomfortable make social interaction difficult. Hard pass. wear want. 100% agree. think jumping either conclusion right good idea! evidence treatment covid last heard. Antibody treatments think currently approved best treatment, Merck Pfizer least data treatments (not sure either approved). 

I'd looking new doctor skeptical advice I'd gotten them. 90% male friends included got J&amp;J .. know 1 2 guys got moderna pfizer. nation rapidly becoming ungovernable.

Yes, large enough percentage population decided governed. want cult personality tells want hear, real leader makes tough choices. a) typically case, stated case two independent sources least. Hopefully confirmations continue, finally look getting lives another seasonal illness going background.  South Africa appear transparent data information although apparently hard gather. don‚Äôt believe they‚Äôd suppressing anything. think they‚Äôre alarmed us Europe/N.America live HIV far bigger issue covid ever be. Raise inflation levels.    guess good proactive/cautious omicron still early stage, observations far particularly alarming  managers don‚Äôt know manage office either ime Humanity hubris excellent point, still make long haulers feel better.

There's huge issue studying female immune system taking women's health complaints seriously medicine pretty much forever. actually needs study this, once, rather leaving ""the women's immune system works differently, expected"". nice actually get concrete answers leading potential treatments, once. would better world focuses vaccinating 3rd world countries, instead producing boosters.

This need either/or choice. correct answer increase capacity both. Let ruin surprise, effective. enough anecdotal evidence. Looks like got answers every pandemic-focused scientist looking right now.

Quick! Get guy ASAP examples provided poor comparisons. Someone smoking cigarettes eating poorly negatively effects health. can't give someone else lung cancer obesity near them. Refusing get vaccinated direct impact public health everyone interact with, yourself. forget people serious medical conditions prevent vaccinated. refuse vaccination reason put much higher risk well.

Consider fact know covid vaccine 100% effective preventing illness. unvaccinated putting everyone higher risk. plenty laws place prevent people reckless things directly impact others. dont see really different. Yeah, hear attrition, hear anyone talk going *replace* health care workers. would want enter field right now?

We ""peak screwed"" yet. 5 years beyond still reeling hit healthcare system. terms overlap.

Once they're walking without holding anything (no matter unsteadily), they're toddler. Generally around one year old earlier later.

There's lots linguistic cultural variability counts baby.  (I've run still call 4 5 year olds ""babies"" find jarring).    UK (Scotland) we're hearing they're cutting waiting time 2nd booster jab 6 3 months making available 18-36yrs soon... Probably pretty likely. Many people get one cold every year. they're taking sort precautions, they're likely get cold. they're also likely get covid. Without PCR negative test, anywhere near them. Here's hoping cities follow suit. way, makes sense. young kids would one last pools COVID tap, course variant adapts infecting would tend outcompete variants resistant to. _Perhaps watching bottom heavy figure!_ yeah, old dogs &lt;33 stories like help prevent nurse burnout know. Thank them! roads lead Rupert Murdoch elsewhere thread: vaccinated rest regular viruses didn‚Äôt disappear covid arrived, they‚Äôre still circulating like always have.

People took lot extra precautions last year overall less people got regular viruses. However, locked indoors constantly sanitizing year weaken regular immune responses, people potentially prone catching regular diseases re-enter world  Skyrocketed? actual docs SA observed infectious diseases diminished NPIs. them. Proper hand hygiene, masks, distancing, fresh airflow works aswell. Since NPIs dropped people became careless saw rising infection numbers again. degree catched diseases see higher numbers, example RSV influenza. Same. every time mention people claim ‚Äúbut children hardly get covid‚Äù (which demonstrably false) ‚Äúbut don‚Äôt die covid‚Äù (okay, largely true, kids dying‚Ä¶) get met ‚Äúbut driving car risk, you‚Äôre going keep kids home time won‚Äôt drive car, you?‚Äù BS. I‚Äôm definitely worried long term sequelae, particularly concerns present even mild cases. I‚Äôm comfortable exposing kids (2 years 6.5 months) unnecessarily virus could negative long term implications, especially bc can‚Äôt consent risk. surely hope FDA works expeditiously approve vaccines littlest members society new variant turns bad seems paper.  seems best way. Currently we've got arms race ability manufacture/distribute vaccines viruses ability mutate. We're currently losing, could improve enough effort cooperation. Why? Link? still act carriers bruh.  (30M) advanced booking got J&amp;J. looked like, availability simply doled vaccination centre (i.e., predetermined, got sent specific line based age/gender). case Loul√© least. old comment idea ""viruses evolve less deadly"" wrong. Viruses vary methods transmission, shedding capabilities, diseases cause. simply mold apply viruses time, let alone one prediction sort ever-decreases virulence, even zoonotic viruses. Throw idea away. viruses virulent due aspects previous host adaption, sort rule, case-specific hypothesis. Alternatively, misunderstanding case fatality rates decreasing novel viruses introduced population due acquired immunity. Notably example virus ""evolving"" less deadly, though observed previous pandemics modern data we're seeing currently is, large, mutations one two things: increase replication capacity virus, increase affinity human ACE2. so, byproducts going higher viral loads, marginally (though I'm simplifying). causing marginal increases virulence, know wealth immunology COVID specific therapeutics early viral loads dissemination predict worse prognosis. specific adaptions pressures necessarily related virulence factors (which tie point). issue ""the virus adapting deadly"", transmission bottlenecks favoring viruses replicate faster stronger affinity entry receptor.  Yep, bizarre. 6, 4, 2 year old. always surprising think fact 2 year old know inside store restaurant like would little remember pre-pandemic. Definitely. Labs closed Thanksgiving weekend reason already heard cases. absolutely guarantee hear first US cases either today tomorrow. early say sure, honestly... 

South Africa 24% vaccinated, too. Open borders let foreign nurses.  Oh man. friend needs new doctor. caught Covid. ah ben criss special airline passengers makes think 10% would test positive average flight, disease prevalence SA much lower.

To clear, people get infected flight (though others might have)--the incubation time long. Talk overreaction. Sadly, countries gotten used banning travellers drop hat, knee jerk reaction everything status quo now. Thankfully Ivermectin kills worms! 20 percent prevalence HIV population fast.

 it‚Äôs Quebec Ontario, it‚Äôs probably also every major US state know child developed type 1 diabetes covid-like illness last year (before testing widely available). also hear uptick diabetes covid children adults. [It appears 90% Gauteng patients Link? problem. think people missing new variant really scary. I'll try explain unfortunately worrisome.

The spike protein mode entry cells therefore large changes spike protein predicted function well terms viral entry. top surface exposed. Finally, virus information replication system (genome replication) relatively error prone therefore rapid changes genes encoding proteins expected.

For reasons nearly every therapy/vaccine made targeted spike protein, also region spike protein.

Omicron, regardless severity scary lots mutations spike protein: 
This means: 

1) spike protein mutate still effective entering cells

2) virus mutate appreciable rate mutants develop

Given vaccinations targeted spike protein, huge selective (evolutionary) pressure mutations occur spike protein evade immune response. Omicron variant means mutations occur, occur appreciable rate. Add giant amount unvaccinated people virus replicate somewhat freely develop mutations. mutations near large population hosts vaccinated/providing selection mutations evade immunity vaccination.

Altogether equals Fed, large mix vaccinated unvaccinated people worst thing could've done wanted prevent new mutants.....ugh No. That's that's implying. talking theoretical number airline passengers. know. example kids unlikely die anything period

Now vaccines modernity. Childhood mortality much higher vaccines - 50%. precious Western countries stomach really shut stop thing. US never, ever going one them. Thanks worried posted furry larping covid expert Thought r/SquaredCircle second So.. real source. ""Hints"" meaningful data. models used? degree evasion? 

I doubt immune escape, especially hypothesis true (long term infection immunocompromised individual). huge difference reduction efficacy versus complete escape. 

This *doubly* true we're talking computer simulations T-cells. orders magnitude complex antibody binding simulations. damn understanding viruses mutate become easier spread. However, become weaker.

No misconception. Mutations random every aspect. outside pathogens experience evolutionary pressure. Covid experience pressure become less lethal enough people live (long enough) spread it. Pathogens would experience pressure hosts killed swiftly reliably enough reduce spread. New variants become less lethal lethal, pressure either way.
Furthermore lethality independant infectiousness. infectious pathogen doesnt become less lethal certain degree.

Your example flu correct. experienced many times therefore weak hosts die - still lot year. due constant reinfections relatively harmless. previous sars-cov-2 infections hence many deaths. 

It theorized nowadays trivial, endemic common cold coronaviruses cause previous pandemics, many deaths since everyone came contact many times. Vaccines work similar way, easing us first couple contacts virus without risk dying. Yeah, also listening good. Crazy took pandemic really wake us things, fear actually change things. 

My office stubbornly decided go back 4 days week made lame points podcast points collaboration working family. power control. Pure simple. Probably works great, given covid candy resistance quickly develop.

Oh, tested positive demanded antivirals? took one dose stopped felt fine? longer Covid hosted animals likely develop evolve suit hosts instead jump species again. 

This make vaccines chicken eggs. Essentially infect chicken egg virus it‚Äôs great living inside chicken biology human, inject humans since look enough like human barrier illicit immune response. Given that, it‚Äôs likely adapt host diverge humans it‚Äôll worse infecting humans.  Thanks, mod! 25% population put unemployment. live house indefinitely mean lockdown. Nice, that's roughly 20k passengers per week least 10% positive Covid

is implying 10% SA covid. public health expert actually believes number. That‚Äôs everywhere Western world right now. Anti-Vax Austrians went crazy mandate. 


Germany considering something similar real nuts who, stupid reason, supported Trump also anti-vax what? Wanting go grad school? Wanting resume life vast majority countries allowed since last year? tired watching Japan let Olympics happen let Japanese people enter leave freely? vaccinated meaning nothing Japan? pissed they're even going process newly added visa documents came waste time? almost wonder multi-week process new documents made specifically say relaxed restrictions hopes new variant appearing anyone could actually enter. I'm selfish dangerous possibly capable entering quarantining correctly virtue Japanese, permanent resident, spouse, tax funded scholarship, celebrity, part Olympics, tax funded English teacher. Evolutionary pressure occur vacuum. majority covid spread occurs asymptomatic period host interacting people. become symptomatic host tends isolate may even become hospitalized. time spread drastically reduced interactions others reduced.

Extending time infection symptom onset effective mechanism increase spread. Pay hazard pay like 100k+ hazard pay‚Ä¶ per quarter. Mr Fauci says young kids next year thats said last year. used get downvoted oblivion ‚Äúmuh choice‚Äù crowd several months ago take, need institute severe consequences unvaccinated want chance hell getting lives back. Won‚Äôt get vaccinated? Okay! You‚Äôre longer eligible work, certainly unemployment, longer allowed dine restaurants, fly plane, basically anything besides grocery store. 

You wanna get benefits living society, can‚Äôt active danger it. don‚Äôt see mask mandate ever coming back area, thank god. really good people get mildly sick lot, kids get sick frequently. Even people paid sick leave, runs eventually, I'd much rather let continue stay away.  known better we're middle pandemic  Sure bit strawman argument. Nobody arguing Omicron set us back square one... cells like security system, recognize new suspicious looking person either call rent cop company threat go power trip taze themselves.

lmao good analogy. 

But get little technical understand current confidence part response...

YOu're basically talking normal T-cell response towards new pathogen. something specific covid vaccine induced mean new variant basically makes immune system fall back T-cell response, mean vaccines ineffective point? 

From understand, vaccines train t-cells look specific spike type virus. spike mutated enough, need ""relearn"" fight almost like vaccinated all? Onicron hospital clinic family got original shots booked mid January. ended getting Kroger (a grocery store, Ralph‚Äôs Ralph‚Äôs pharmacy might try there) People die either way. Less long run don‚Äôt give cooties people. chance happening though. I'm actually hoping get sent back home. since August beating remember. I'm wasting probably two hours day commuting getting ready need two hours back. Sorry meant 390, actually 95 euros glorious thing working home almost forces organization state everything paper trail. designed new marketing campaign? wrote code? Who's fantastic idea real (recorded!) meeting last week?

One biggest advantages remote work makes far difficult simply wander around office leeching people's efforts. ‚ÄûThere seems be, however, important piece missing suite standards volumes research inhalable environmental contaminants. None standards, including ASTM standards (F1862, F2100, F2101, F2299) NIOSH regulation (42 CFR 84), adopted FDA regulating medical face masks surgical respirators U.S. (FDA, 2020a), regulate respirable debris micro(nano)plastics may present products. fact, neglect unique US standards: review current ISO standards (ISO 22609, 16900), EU standards (EN 140, 143, 149, 14683) Chinese standards (GB 19083, 2626; GB/T 32610, 38880; YY 0469; YY/T 0969) masks respirators found information pertinent particular type hazard. becoming necessity many daily life work, questions must raised apparent regulatory gap concerning long-term use safety. especially important given already growing body evidence inhalation micro(nano)plastics adverse effects humans animals (Prata, 2018).‚Äú medical supplies produce got pushed way richer countries, oxygen tanks, ICU beds. Serious cases died. Personally, I‚Äôve absolutely accurate home. Since I‚Äôve back office, I‚Äôve anxious commute, people walking around unmasked, breakthrough infections, etc I‚Äôve actually missed emails. It‚Äôs anxiety inducing distracting   significant donation 500,000 vaccines Nigeria represents Ireland‚Äôs continued commitment universal access COVID-19 vaccines fair equitable distribution work together bring global pandemic control.

who writes shit? nice donate, declaration moronic. think neighbor  OAN? Yeah, that's terrible propaganda. think lot lazy arrogant here, too. Though would love free healthcare, imagine good would be. wondered African nations, situation. world always seems forget them. known people came Somalia, nice, kind people lot. true Europe already multiple cases. 8 years ICU Level 1 trauma center, TNCC, CCRN, clinical preceptor, care tons ECMO patients‚Ä¶. worked COVID ICU saw patients die weeks whole career. put four people body bags one shift, meanwhile hallway another patient standing bed, screaming antivax/antimask conspiracy shit spitting coworkers (yes, covid+). 8 coworkers quit week. daily reality right now, don‚Äôt blame anyone decides they‚Äôve enough leaves. 2 Days ago 750. likely scenario lose nearly protection *against infection*, retain nearly protection *against severe disease infected*. Booster shots first doses raises second number. caveat older people probably get priority. entry ban affect Japanese nationals foreign residents returning country

It actually loose. Let guess. variant turns bad would first scream didn‚Äôt enough beginning. worry, u/poemforyoursprog probably kill him.  mention vast majority citizens vaccinated. areas 10% vaccination rates. That's also gonna impact numbers. Japan aging population susceptible breakthrough infections. also line terms vaccine priority. Furthermore, lot chaos controversy happened beginning pandemic (with Diamond Princess Cruise ship, Sapporo Snow Festival, Abe's 2 masks, government favoratism towards tourism sector). Many critics Japanese government questioned whether economy human life important. Abe also resigned covid lowered public confidence. 

(side note: Japan Sinks Netflix deals similar issues covid--profits people, dirty politics, scandal, etc. Oguri Shun also snacc. Anywho, I. Ah.) 

Anyway, buncha shit happened, Japan's border policies similar South Korea's (who well hindering spread covid) strictest world completely close borders. 

14 day quarantine, downloading tracking app, arranging private transportation/lodging, PCR test upon landing, negative rapid test prior departure, etc.

Japanese nationals always allowed go back home, becomes huge pain ass quarantine requirements arranging private lodging, etc. Mix match completely safe. Pfizer Moderna similar except Moderna's somewhat bigger dose (slightly immunity, bigger increase side effects). Really get. make appointment, click ""i eligible"" button one, it. walk that's thing. Walgreens history incorrectly denying people doses, though. yeah mate, blunt? :(


I guess hard distinguish sarcasm days, given everyone fucking crazy exactly point. Vax get care unvax. 
 
Just like non obese obese.

Ok.. track point trying make earlier? 

You replied forgot: 
 
Exercise stop obese.

To still key. many severe infections overload already fragile heath systems. Get vaccinated/boosted, wear masks, wash hands frequently.

If everyone equally prioritized trying combat obesity would moot correct? missing true desired end point, prevent overload healthcare system therefore preventing us getting point choice made first place? Getting vaccinated helps keep people hospital. Losing weight help outcomes long run, good alternative vaccinating population, much less variable benefits. [the goggles U.S. Supreme Court justice turned away request eight Mass General Brigham Inc. workers religious exemption Massachusetts hospital system‚Äôs requirement vaccinated Stephen Breyer rejected request without requesting response hospital referring matter full, nine-member court. Breyer, assigned handle emergency matters Massachusetts, gave workers, say already fired jobs, contended mandatory vaccine policy violates federal job-discrimination disabilities law. Boards got hauled back office. 

My productivity plummeted, I‚Äôm finding eating unhealthily, exercising less, getting less sleep. 

Already looking places  Omicron might turn bark bite - way knowing moment. air thick uncertainty. 

I think Japan learned lesson taking 'wait see' approach. 

An ounce prevention worth pound cure. Hospitals definitely lag usually 2-3 weeks. circulating almost 2 months feels like we‚Äôd seen something dire. don‚Äôt get wrong doesn‚Äôt look great SA probably clearest data point right lol
Internet: ‚ÄúNope.‚Äù hypothetically january 2020 7 cases country football team full another families others covid responded way would much better result. Friend mine spend time (I believe 2 weeks) quarantine hotel Hong Kong returning Canada. didn‚Äôt test positive‚Ä¶ want travel. 2 weeks can‚Äôt leave room. watch TV read; try exercise room. Meals brought door pick knock. 

The disheartening thing is: said Covid circulating hotels despite ridiculously strict measures place. Woah weird almost essential industry extremely high intentionally placed barriers entry employment people within medical field get paid fuck ton money also creating constant shortage doctors nurses across country bad idea essential services finally needed en masses. That's craaaaazyyyyyy Well, that's difference. Nobody ever forgets maple syrup. Honestly can't say I'm surprised really. terrifying think it. cold September, first since COVID hit. partner picked work gave me. got PCR COVID tested three times five days negative, really cold.

But anyone unvaxxed sick, would 100000% assume COVID. muddles water IMO. Would rather binary - either it‚Äôs mandated still early draw firm conclusions either doctors experts cautioned overall number patients far remains small‚Äîand infections recent‚Äîto draw firm conclusions whether Omicron leads milder severe cases Covid-19 variants.   means first hospitalizations resulting variant likely happened recently, given severe illness Covid-19 takes two weeks catching virus develop, deaths lag even behind. Glad still haven‚Äôt taken mask off. hell wants go back that? loved work commute every day made suck. Say office! pick cake Thanksgiving bakery queens. quite people waiting inside. Like least 50. saw maybe 5 unmasked people. really makes wonder, exactly goes heads people see everyone wearing one, aren't. Yes. Yay, thanks lot, unvaccinated ppl won‚Äôt take anything read online seriously December 10.  know get downvoted, that's truth. People Reddit always get sensitive China brought onto tables talking COVID origins. 

To fair, Chinese government care rest world. cold, fat. world ended fault, shed tears. shows deplorable rotten are. always act opposition 90% countries do. countries want end climate change, China want to. countries want peace, China want to. always want stand out, negative reasons. like vermin, feeding onto carcass disgrace nations. want seize power influence. pandemic gave golden opportunity so.

Maybe countries rely much everything, much power. still totally debunked Viruses acquire mutations looking people. acquire mutations mutating within people. kid turns 5 2 weeks. pediatrician doesn‚Äôt carry vaccine go pharmacy clinic. doctor said danger get one now, it‚Äôs finding place go it. anyone know anywhere get one? I‚Äôm nervous uptick school everyone traveling. close‚Ä¶ also means 2 weeks people traveling world south Africa means already late contain.  Also South Africa overweight / obese EU / US. people always make comparisons serious disease / death countries Asia / Scandanavia keep ignoring countries like 76% population overweight obese like US. news, water wet. question here. understanding viruses mutate become easier spread. However, become weaker.

this always true even likely debating release statement 2-3 days point cat's bag. could even likely local level. large space able work want spread illness. Tim gets decide handles that. personal choice. Moderna gang here, also pretty high covid anxiety. 

My first shot sore arm. Second felt like getting sick next day(like unwell feeling, knees hurt bit, felt like kicked nuts, etc). Also may low fever. Felt fine night after. 

Booster bad. mainly felt little run down, feel like second. fever, tired. slept bit, felt fine after. still bit tired back normal. 

Wife felt normal booster, nothing noteworthy her. 

I'd bet feel fine. went first two. feel crappy know thing it'll pass (and advil Tylenol hurt lol). Well blows. Good argument factory farming. took 2 years. Well done us. Yes, I'm sure we'll see S-gene dropout go up. wonder much already, tho, assumed PCR error. hope not! normal behavior. need take deep breath. learn could induce long term effects 10 years ? Death viable metric. call stores, ask first available appointment take it? call next one sooner, take one (and cancel first) work way get date like what? i've vaccinated since may lol idk comment people dying (so stay home/mask up/get vaccinated) misconstrued lmao hopefully secure people gradually moved towards reality third shot going expected well time moves on. want environments like functioning hospitals time. First time I've seen referenced! Great work!  think I've seen film before, like ending. impression 13 confirmed Omicron far rest hadn‚Äôt commented yet (or haven‚Äôt sequenced). changed?  Never hypothetically, would rather 50% effectiveness booster waning effectiveness second shot soon 0%? (numbers made up)

also hypothetically, opposed getting 4th shot one day three limit?

most importantly, think booster doses tossed trash right benefit protected Alpha, Delta, Beta, etc mean time (ie next 100 days plus shipping) aren‚Äôt looking really!
Really annoys take cues countries whole pandemic. Lol Yesterday said countries closing borders, etc. Countries found Thursday Night/Friday. borders open not? suggesting countries move PCR testing quarantine instead right away? company's internal homepage, released article called something like ""4 benefits work commute provides"". seriously tried make case commuting good thing helped destress day transition work personal life. 

So guess commutes stressful eyes, oh also fuck environment employees' preferences. Fuckin morons, could find way drown 3 inches water what's weird employees know handle yet. grew world employer king. 

I imagine many companies suffer head recruiting can't accept new reality. need act nice, return calls emails, etc. Many recruiters able that. I'd agree UK vaccines heavy lifting us go back 2019 normality (for part). Again, understand **no restrictions** nearly **five months** hospitalizations even able reach **1/4** January, death rate even less compared January. That's matters friend, going zero-covid 0 deaths 0 hospitalizations. living virus looks like **five months**! Ughhhhh!!!! put subjective numbers it, I'd say 8/10 certain significantly infectious delta 2/10 certain significantly less serious. There's decent possibility infectious new infections happening fast hit point cases enough time become serious represent significant fraction total cases. Also remember 50% likely cause hospitalization infects 3x many people, results 50% hospitalizations. Fucks sake, even read news? Day ruined , stress worries elevated. Great start day. keep checking every 5 minutes first US case. TIL chickens fart?   gonna approach trivial levels though, already know that. line needed drawn somewhere it. Kind of, yeah. Brazilian Supreme Court tends meddle (unlawfully) Executive Branch's affairs. anxious even though wasn‚Äôt particularly fun, booster wasn‚Äôt bad second dose. Anecdotally friends said same. Also, Tylenol really helps take edge worst experience. Good luck almost like they're 2 years behind ball this... Voluntary disguise. Pre-Pandemic:

WFH/Hybrid - We've learned it. Many successful even. Promotions, frequent prior pandemic.


WFH/Hybrid post pandemic - Probable many people types work continue.

Getting promoted WFH post pandemic - Less likely. 

Getting promoted office - likely. Right delta likely threat. Get booster avoid delta maybe get better protection omicron.  months omicron specific booster. Deal if: happens thinking recently wanted vaccinate holdouts know, inoculate vape oil. oh wow UK course administer third dose elderly vulnerable groups 1-9 end year (~30 million people, nearly half population). given third dose 17.8 million people far. 

Assuming current vaccines still least prevent serious illness (I'd bet three trick!) hard see UK returning lockdown restrictions ever again. restrictions since July hospitalisations managed breach 1/4 back January. wonder shareholders feel that, actually exposed less productive?

I seen indication happen yet, there's lot data published media really draw clear cost benefit removing offices picture. need see big study lot media coverage point 1) WFH negatively impact productivity, 2) closing offices save X% operating expenses average corporations. Right media still mostly way conservative talk ""people can't wait back office"" headlines of, ""what lose WFH?"" understanding flights south africa southern states America 


Then see states confirming coronovirus... 
And see everything checks out. covid here! Look telemedicine. short stint working volunteer nurse Navajo surge last year, two weeks rough.

Interesting. def heard someone talking news long time ago. 

I get feeling like flu shot: annual even every 6 months kind thing virus becomes endemic. hope eventually make shots less reactogenic get nasty side effects. think evidence call overwhelming well Omicron too, regardless **strongly** praise CDC Director Walensky making call today. Thank you. Im taking shit right support wastewater detection sewers. Heres hoping variant sewage system low. South Africa high antibody counts though understand it: people double vaccinated (Corona certificate), need test. seems like correct path, however main motivation covid issues. Highly conservative places Brasil trying cancel Carnaval years, Covid perfect excuse follow plan cancel party.   ‚Äúmight‚Äù positive outcomes purely due optics probably can‚Äôt ducking already. South Africa irrelevant litmus test. 23% vaxxed. They're fucked regardless Omicron, honestly fuck em. They're throwing vaccines away due vaccine hesitancy.

The real test among vaxxed populace.

If live mild symptoms, GG COVID. won. now. It‚Äôs old chestnut: repeat something enough times becomes truth.

Thank unvaccinated people making wonderful nurses leave field. get vaccinated lessen burden illness everyone guys wanted freedom unfortunately caught Covid 19 started dying. No, agenda mean post/OP apparently foaming mouth. agree whole mask thing, relax dude. I'm going funnel bleach ass road cone order keep Omicrons stealing children. SA 28% vaccination rate. 24% fully vaccinated. 

SA also 20% population infected HIV.

It surprising hospitalizations going up, fully attribute specifically new mutations means. Wow. bow eminent brilliance. /s mean numbers made like said data could back much preliminary, think pretty reasonable take information currently available. think lot employees knew, especially younger ones, management didn‚Äôt want accept it. I‚Äôve asked remote know plenty others too, answer always something like ‚Äúwe reevaluate 6 months need here‚Äù thing immune-compromised people vaccines don‚Äôt work well them. It‚Äôs part reason healthy people healthy immune systems get vaccinated ‚Äî protect immune-compromised (cancer patients, organ transplants, HIVers, elderly, babies, etc) via herd immunity. Japan says hello. wear masks indoors outdoors regardless vaccination status. 

Tokyo densely populated NYC. Covid numbers plummeted tremendously. Yeah, viewpoint pretty outdated. 50th District (East County) remaining conservative area. Even insults date. Everyone knows smoke crack San Diego, meth. MSM news two days now. Meh. really can't ""mandate"" masks restaurants bars, since one needs remove mask eat/drink. however mandate vaccination places I've seem taking pretty seriously. went sit Taco Bell last week one workers immediately came running check vax credentials.

TL;DR: perhaps Omicron's superpower high immune evasion, high R0; Delta significantly higher R0 enough immune can't keep spreading.

The projected opening land borders supposed happen December postponed now. 

Starting January 1st 2022, mobility pass allows people attend places like restaurants, cinemas clubs, updated mandatory booster shot apply pass. Chile 40% population three doses.  Global sanctions *and* aid? Part seems counterproductive me.  maybe Colorado lock down. case US mean, equivalent GP, going see serious cases. serious cases would another covid patient elsewhere distinguish identified yet.

Doesn't need bias type patients access to. Yes, good national job market good refuse move jobs Live NYC, second (third? fifth? eleventh?) big deal us. CDC advised ""masks indoors regardless vax status"" back August folks know (including me) heeded advice.

The people see wearing masks known vax-hesitant groups, pretty much duration pandemic. This. It‚Äôs like United States campuses generally hotbeds assault compared anyplace else. It‚Äôs way likely hire armed security guards campuses regardless actual crime rate. agenda mean think people wear mask, especially given new variant circulating - bet ass do. well, BC we're drowning - burning starts summer. doctor one first suspect strain inform world, observed 7 patients infected virus reported it.

Yet sat arse claiming said wasn‚Äôt backed scientific data!? Incredible got flu booster arm time. next day absolute nightmare next morning back normal. heard say booster worse first two others say flu shot what‚Äôs making people getting time feel cruddy. I‚Äôve never experience flu shot knows. It‚Äôs nothing scared of. Nothing unmanageable. feels like mild flu body aches, fatigue, headache, nausea, low grade fever. still get things. You‚Äôll feel run 2 years one country call treaty...imagine long take get significant amount countries agree early say trying make contractor position. job market one going take contractor position entry level specialist job don‚Äôt even really get set hours rate assumed antivax

forgive us, speaking like idiot assumed idiotic stances well. Wonder many, any, plane Amsterdam end getting it. would great news zero. they're head Howl Fest, count something? Lol what? Europe regularly banned developed countries based level covid individual country. happened throughout covid. know bc Switzerland time checking family UK, Netherlands, France restricted travel. also several instances holiday makers (from developed countries) banned traveling developed countries. one remember this!??

Someone else posted article criteria. idea Depression obesity qualifying factors. Lol can't believe bad messaging really is... complete ‚Äúmask-hole‚Äù 2020 months ago, vaccinated possible. realized media politicians don‚Äôt weigh medical experts say, spit criticize daring question anything, even it‚Äôs redundant minimal help. LOL yup. There‚Äôs difference shopping mask, (which reasonable) shutting schools/closing businesses like restaurants think folks worried about. I'm anxiously waiting word 16/17 12-15 timelines boosters too. teens fully vaxed one chronically ill asthma. Makes nervous could get breakthrough infections.  anyone remember early covid Facebook post going around gargling water think vinegar prevent covid? don‚Äôt know randomly popped head.

Agreed. vaccines widely available people don‚Äôt need go mass distribution centers.  see doctor go nearby pharmacy. Took kid second dose yesterday parent another kid next us got booster grade schoolers got first second shot. Boosters like getting flu shot, small hassle mostly lowers odds getting super sick.

59.1% fully vaccinated

19.1% (11.2% US population) received They‚Äôre mental fair play. suppose it‚Äôs easy you‚Äôre insular.  I'm late buddy college who's perfect example this: 

He's MD got medicine ""right"" reasons. medical missions, made waves residency advocating underserved populations etc. 

He's hospitalist ER doc throughout pandemic basically missed first year first kid's life. 

Since Delta he's trying tend mental health desperately travelling, camping can't reached, meditating etc. working. He's constantly swamped getting yelled watching people die way they've dying since last year. feels like can't enough. 

He felt hope news around antiviral meds can't take it. took job private medtech company making money pure research 0 patient contact. 

If breaking guys like we're big trouble I'm decade.  don‚Äôt even think it‚Äôs comparable respect US. Aside Pearl Harbor, major attacks American soil. Dude, ‚Äúnot working‚Äù isn‚Äôt thing slowing spread. It‚Äôs mitigation effort. realize gaps air get wearing mask right? method protection PERFECT meant ONE thing reverse course virus. It‚Äôs mitigation. logic ‚Äúwell house fire we, fire dept, running late‚Ä¶ might well go, since can‚Äôt save entire house.‚Äù 

Stop making strawman this. Nobody ever said travel bans STOP pandemics spreads, one ever will. clearly don‚Äôt understand purpose intention behind temporary bans. It‚Äôs stop spread. purpose slow down. overwhelm healthcare systems rural areas. Absolute strawman. Every knows it‚Äôs inevitable, reason jump front train plenty tools try slow least first.  People repeat Reddit might well anti-maskers anti-everything else clearly everything isn‚Äôt perfect mitigation effort becomes ‚Äúpanacea‚Äù. realize efforts, avenues combined, direct end result number resources doctors have, like ventilators beds? Yep. neighbor wears mask incorrectly half-naked travel bans. degree things DIRECTLY impact number resources doctors inevitably comes. Stop straw-manning obvious mitigation efforts. It'll take 3 months actually tweak get approval per Moderna. however long manufacturing. distribution. it'll probably 4 months least becomes readily available. UK saying get booster 3 months imagine 4 month time span become readily available may get another regardless.

Get one anyway since help. add others said. Even danger level statistically per person, higher transmissibility, overall worse health system.

Ie let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 1.5x transmissible, similar mortality/hospitalisation rates, expect roughly 1.5x hospitalisation death rate, infects people timeframe.

It‚Äôs balancing act, it‚Äôs transmissible much less dangerous, might see downward trend hospitalisation death. worse, see much worse wave. drink elite Stop conflating basic public health restrictions freedom largest global crisis since World War 2.

Masks mandates aren‚Äôt draconian. Ramping encouragement vaccinations aren‚Äôt draconian. Apprehending fining people cough scream frontline workers isn‚Äôt draconian. Giving repeat offenders community service isn‚Äôt draconian. Stringent airline testing restrictions aren‚Äôt draconian. Quarantining arriving citizens preferred wishes disciplining breaking public health order infecting people draconian.

Stop confusing public health freedom you‚Äôre doomed probability flouting restrictions may lead permanent lung damage death stranger someone love.

Good luck. know anecdotal, family member got organ transplant still waiting room 3 days. least hospital (and I‚Äôm sure one), beds available. That‚Äôs pretty concerning sign I‚Äôm hoping doesn‚Äôt mean much one particular hospital capacity. thanks answering. read article time. Regardless, is. Worrying won‚Äôt help anything. Get vaccinated. Get boosted. Listen doctors scientists recommend/agree learn more. You‚Äôve made far, keep you‚Äôre doing. risk often gets overlooked, young healthy person scared of. Even trivial-sounding symptoms like losing sense smell months sound fucking shit. Hugs you. We‚Äôll know lot weeks. now, take day time. know, would like believe that. remember covid came out, two pillars public health advice a) wash hands, b) get flu shot. flu shot anything covid.

So think public health quite content use omicron publicity leverage point promote vaccination delta. works omicron too, fantastic--and probably will. whether matter public health agenda here. Bad analogy. Anyone normal eyes see color.

How know nano materials safe? ask source get downvoted. Classic reddit mob. Whoa, me? age, gender, almost vaccination dates Pfizer (April 8th, April 29th, November 20th). Weird! Yes got mine today. made appointment 2 weeks ago nyc opened adults earliest could find. Probably. 

From know several asymptomatic mild illness. know vaccine, boosters, either. Lots unknowns. make devices inject insulin need it. want one boosters. give IV drip... We‚Äôre exceptionally good right around hundred cases domestically every day, negative~zero excess deaths since pandemic. hope stay like can‚Äôt hurt careful. border closed would help tourism industry well restarted GoTo program one cares idiot already said get higher ups would knock model. Surely like pay rent office space. think they're calling general population fat. Overweight (or obesity, remember) risk factor, would allow one get booster. could sworn saw study /r/covid19 cytokine storm triggered mRNA vaccine young men shot given soon infection. mean inspire confidence protection infection.

Even protection severe illness ""likely"" them. hard part defining objective. going keep getting new variants go indefinitely. soon antivirals vaccines offer degree protection infection (and likely high degree severe illness), future restrictions need make clear goal. One apple day, keep doctor away.

A vax keep alive well. appear like reacting fast. remember Sturgeon tried ban travel Manchester. quickly changed everyone pointed stupid Scots pilling London en masse got third yesterday- bit extra crappy got flu shot time. 

I would still say side effects bit less second shot. I'm anywhere near tired. worked whole workday. super pleasant, okay. oddity lymph nodes pretty tender, armpit arm got shots in. might flu shot though, usually react bit flu shot. We're back office since September lol. There's still pandemic going care. blame CDC messaging much this. Yep, heard mask sanitizer manufacturers upset pharma companies ones making money now. want back action. 90% adults met eligibility criteria opened everyone last week. they‚Äôre telling people get boosters, wouldn‚Äôt inspire confidence boosters might help some? That‚Äôs bollocks though? Given I‚Äôve happy get double vaccinated boosted, would care getting another shot point improves protection? get flu jab every year. article says 24%. Right, last weekend Portuguese first league football team play 9 players 13 corona, turned Omnikron. often happend earlier variants? Posting third time now: people really need get sense perspective here.

During WWII, people live food rations, mandated blackouts, forced evacuations, constant threat gassed bombed, conscription barely-adults sacrifice lives, general hell real, actual war.

WWII lasted six years. pandemic barely lasted two. went hell one darkest periods modern history. wear piece fabric watch Netflix. that's takes break us, west good long. world faced genuine crisis half century shows.

I desperately want end, too. I'm tired sinking feeling could day. want sense calm there's nothing threatening home. want able things without monkey back.

It happen, pandemics come end, we've extraordinarily fortunate modern-day miracle scientific progress bringing us vaccines treatments work well do. we're yet. now, patience name game. think variant spur get vaccinated? Dr. Fucki's fault. likes make lives living hell develop new viruses keep us ""COVID jail."" people get tested symptomatic, maybe majority barely symptomatic catching people flying tests mandatory it‚Äôs old version News orgs need stop reporting 1 dose vaxxed. That's partially vaccinated provides limited protection compared 2 doses. Even single J&amp;J shot sufficient 2 doses stated Dr. Fauci evidence collected medical journals, antibody titers, etc. Commenter assuming thing. Less 1/5 fully vaccinated persons gotten booster. Even look 65s, 45%. might problem getting booster, breaking doors get  lesson learn back say useless meetings. still end relenting times, I've found better get saying no, less end say it. case two months ago think actually San Diego.  governors tripple vaxxed tested daily.
'Let get COVID' wait 6 months even effective booster. point high risk catching waves, premature booster still better none. people ‚Äúdone‚Äù virus doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs done them. haha funny reddit quote nurses, medical staff. work Respiratory Therapist. Every single department short staffed. core staff leaving one replace say people going start getting tired. might get vaccination rates need 4th booster. think said 100 days development build substantial supply. would expect longer average joe get one though. preceptor tell this: dealing passive-aggressive people (like commenter), expect solve problems them, figure lives, preferences, values, futures: ""If angrier leave, won.""  general zeitgeist parts country ‚Äòwe‚Äôre it,‚Äô‚Äâ‚Äù Wachter said. ‚ÄúPoliticians it. .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. think it‚Äôs going sort region probably political persuasion.‚Äù

But weariness evident even blue regions. Republicans already suggesting omicron fabrication.

‚ÄúThey going try sell us new ‚ÄòVariants‚Äô rest lives don‚Äôt tell shove it,‚Äù tweeted Kari Lake, GOP candidate governor Arizona backed former president Donald Trump.

Ronnie Jackson, White House physician turned GOP member Congress Texas, also hinted conspiracy.

‚ÄúHere comes MEV ‚Äî Midterm Election Variant!‚Äù Jackson posted Twitter feed. ‚ÄúThey NEED reason push unsolicited nationwide mail-in ballots. Democrats anything CHEAT election ‚Äî we‚Äôre going let them!‚Äù

Some Republican officials acted anti-lockdown sentiment. New state laws Kansas block state officials closing businesses, example. Montana legislature prevented health officials quarantining exposed virus. North Dakota passed law barring health officials issuing mask mandates, even cases like active tuberculosis outbreak.

The supreme courts Michigan, Wisconsin Kentucky curtailed ability states‚Äô Democratic governors implement emergency measures statewide mask mandates.
Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee (R) recently signed legislation banning government mask mandates situations well vaccine mandates, allowed another bill stripping local public health authorities emergency powers become law without signature.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) called special session signed legislation month block efforts control virus, including prohibition employer vaccine mandates school boards issuing mask mandates quarantining students exposed virus.

The new laws follow measures prohibit localities mandating masks fining businesses violate covid restrictions, county officials said undermined ability respond summer surge led record hospitalizations, infections deaths.
Over weekend, state local officials largely used interest omicron variant reiterate current restrictions rather publicly discuss new ones.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) urged vigilance variant said emergence accentuated urgency vaccinations wearing masks indoors. 

Connecticut mask mandate, towns, including New Haven, still do.
‚ÄúThis news Omicron variant reminds us importance vaccinated getting booster,‚Äù Lamont tweeted Sunday. ‚ÄúWe entered winter holiday season still need mask indoor public places, practice proper hand hygiene, get tested stay home feel sick.‚Äù

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) received booster shot Sunday encouraged others follow lead. ‚ÄúThe best way strengthen protection covid-19 get booster shot,‚Äù tweeted, photo receiving shot.

He said social distancing measures restoring indoor mask mandate, imposed Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) response summer delta surge, premature scientists health officials await additional information variant.

I never said side effects reported people took it. I'm saying likely greater number people reporting severe side effects people take flu vaccine.

Note never said COVID vaccine worse symptoms flu vaccine; argument idea ""way worse,"" seems like blatant exaggeration.

Since last week busy travel week people gathered celebrate Thanksgiving, expect see huge spike testing/cases somewhere around December 2nd thru December 9th. I'm expecting confirmed case US timeframe well.

All we've doing. Get vaccinated/boosted, wear masks diligent hand sanitization. I‚Äôm scheduled booster December 1, currently 30mg prednisone (immunosuppressant) though chronic flareup.

If Omicron spread across planet weeks detected, whatever replaces next wave even transmissible. That's good hear. right want agree. inevitable though ever need release modified ""boosters"", updates respond new variant, going people get screwed based timing variant.

It would ideal get annual updated boosters annual bi-annual release.   People! Can't read?! CDC made remarkable discovery: virus travels planes Amsterdam.   health issues prevent getting vaccine? also worth noting second option also makes likely die virus year two older get infected.

This real question answer, testing T-cell responses much slower.

And WHO's perspective, worth picking fight name variant, decided would better call Omicron. Infection rate per week hospitals able cope amount people needing ICU, divided population (Germany). Without vaccines 800 weeks, vaccines 200 weeks. everyone viruses seem come China! couple days since found it.

is surprising dont definitive scientific answer yet? Sure surprised guys start another regime. would like 5th time continental European philosophy started authoritarian dictatorship name collectivism? dammit, guess can't go visit japan next year.  Around 22% nursing home residents vaccinated died contracting Covid-19. immunity omicron give protection variants. Totally. Obviously hope become reality. trouble countries sectors countries low vaccination rates. risks severe infections overwhelming health systems. get vaccinated CJ! Thanks lol Looks like elderly, particularly unvaccinated elderly, driving wave. unknown placed isolation hospital: flight risk medical reasons.

Could obviously relevant medical reasons. I've exact convo look deathrate, nothing's going on, completely I'm looking deathrate, almost 1000 per week usual time None corona related! propose punishing country like South Africa stopping traveling majority population hasn‚Äôt plane let alone reason travel abroad? 

How would change mind getting vaccinated? wouldn‚Äôt give shit travel bans, people getting vaccinated need travel still getting punished. Meh, that's Japan. country said yes Olympic games decided students definitely bring COVID.

Basically though going fly uk today, air tickets booked already paid 1 test leaving iirc 2 tests landing. 

It mandatory get tested traveling. Well people talked presenting mild cases healthy, either unvaccinated 1 jab.

I think players okay, news saying aren't. wait.. infectious, less deadly, would way obvious reasons.

This might still bad. super mild.  People still under-estimating impact covid-19. 

It would lot better lockdowns started earlier, continued vaccines available, special restrictions continued place now.

But governments also under-estimated impact covid mistakenly believed economies would suffer less damage lockdowns started later, lifted earlier, special restrictions lifted well.

The net result is: millions people infected unavoidable; millions died unavoidable; thousands business avoidable crashed burns; hundreds thousands jobs (including mine) lost unavoidable (although redundancy probably avoidable.) Passport stamp?  MAX POWERS

New variant may infect kill less, experts say
None November 29, 2021

The large amount √îmicron mutations unusual fact needs investigated Brazil, say scientists consulted Estad√£o. Discovered South Africa, new variant coronavirus 50 mutations. 30 located so-called spike protein, one allows virus enter human cells one main targets vaccines covid-19.

√îmicron variant confirmed four continents; Austria Brazil study suspected cases
√îmicron variant confirmed four continents; Austria Brazil study suspected cases

A first hypothesis occurrence many mutations (three times seen Delta variant) developed immunocompromised patient harbored Alpha variant long time South Africa. tests detect √îmicron specific gene ‚Äì Alpha, according international experts. ‚ÄúWe never seen variant many mutations‚Äù, says professor Amilcar Tanuri, coordinator Virology Laboratory Federal University Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ).

Tanuri says supports hypothesis emerging viruses tend attenuate spread human population. mutation, tendency become transmissible less lethal.

The first reports doctors South Africa indicate virus spreads rapidly, without large number serious cases. ‚ÄúThis observation South Africa still empirical, corroborates hypothesis attenuation virus increase transmissibility‚Äù, says coordinator UFRJ.

‚ÄúIn Brazil, still access √îmicron variant study it‚Äù, says Tanuri. ‚ÄúAs soon detected country, first thing done isolate virus put contact serum patients vaccinated Brazil also infected Delta variant‚Äù, says virologist.

In way, possible know whether overcome coronaviruses confers immunity (cross-protection) √îmicron. second question need answered new variant behave. words: going replace Delta Brazil, seems Africa. virus transmitted faster competitor, wins dispute. former continues circulate, lesser extent. worth remembering Delta ended causing increase cases Brazil ‚Äì according many experts, combination vaccination sanitary measures.

According Tanuri, several groups published sequencing viruses found people persistent prolonged infection previous variants. study carried UFRJ two dozen patients, researchers observed accumulation mutations spike protein proportional time virus remains individual.

For epidemiology Cesar Victora, professor emeritus Federal University Pelotas (UFPel), reports doctors South Africa may sign coronavirus evolving like many viruses aggressive first, become attenuated time. ‚ÄúThis could happening, would good news, early know,‚Äù says.

The specialist believes country needs expand variant monitoring system. ‚ÄúWe increase capacity. We've still done little sequencing. variant may already yet discovered‚Äù, says coordinator scientific committee Instituto Todos Pela Sa√∫de. ""Spanish"" Flu 2.0 I‚Äôm Irish, talking hole completely wrong  thing say omicron far dangerous delta since players probably gotten serious symptoms delta either. required vaccinated individuals well, negative test within three days opposed day unvaccinated.  Ireland ffs. don‚Äôt problems guns violence yanks  mean‚Ä¶ several athletes got COVID Japan (if mistaken). Also, sure mean foreign visitors? Coaches, medical stuff, others allowed in. It‚Äôs like athletes show up. 

I cannot say handled nothing compare against. olympics China soon compare Japan China see well former did. 

Irrespective, point look Japan place everything right comes COVID. reason restrict entrance students; wish, force spend 3-5 days government issued hotel. sure it‚Äôs possible 1-2 hotels close airport handle that. nope; let‚Äôs ban everyone entering country. recent preprint study health staff Massachusetts suggests could be, although state long naturally acquired immunity lasts extends non-Delta linked travel? So, magically manifested Great Britan, way S. Africa? That's, well, impossible. Unless, S. Africa true origin variant, call bullshit. Yes, obviously Chinese strategy better US less death alone, zero intention argue this.

But two extremes things, even within China policy varies, greatly, life Shanghai (as lived in) benefits say, living border areas difference constant lockdown. forbidden think measures yield similar even better overall results, neither people stopped questioning sustainability whether copied countries policy.  anyone copy/paste rest it? Everything point hiding behind paywall. No. breath warm makes molecules masks expand. believe max amount hours carry one 3/5 hours. start degrade slowly. 

Having molecules larger makes easier air flow escape mask possibly contaminate others

Pardon english, first language. No. you? yet, no. vaccinated/boosted, wear masks, wash hands frequently.

Simple steps people make way complicated. People need stop wondering simply it. person would immune system stop reinfections virus playground, unfortunately. least, understanding non-scientist.  P current tests detect markers omicron, catch all? Well that's absolutely wrong. Kindly stop posting anything fact, since clearly background this. spreading misinformation. thought case unvaccinated denied organ transplants justified since going get lot complications covid.  fair since countries United States. say that... sounds great. can't imagine able smell taste anything. Currently US requires negative test enter country. time frame given study 3 days onset symptoms you‚Äôre risk age group Covid Symptoms you‚Äôd silly get test straight away. 
As long pharmacists GP‚Äôs/family doctors pills stocked don‚Äôt think would difficult make sure risk people access within kind time frame it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs going completely ineffective otherwise, even don‚Äôt keep everyone hospital they‚Äôll probably keep ICU Alcoholics smokers pay consumption taxes. probably impose sugar tax reflect social costs. hate put way, net costs smokers actually pay healthcare consume.  I'm scared lol seems pre-mature WHO's part. Yes, knew infectious deadly disease chose spread around. virulence

I think meant greater transmissibility. Greater virulence would mean deadlier harmful disease. Murder???? stupid? I‚Äôm sorry didn‚Äôt mention precise date leak uk cases. sure split hairs frame misinformation means. 

My point say western world doesn‚Äôt treat rest western world different. 

I clearly demonstrated did. New variant UK. EU recommends travel ban. New variant SA. EU recommends immediate travel ban two weeks. 

It‚Äôs simple concept trying obfuscate nit picking. 

Now changing argument situation SA bad. next breath say situation EU peak nothing UK issuing travel bans new variants. Pick one opposing viewpoint please. 

And proven time travel bans work destructive. Quarantine yes. Observation yes. Vaccination yes.

This wrong. Pfizer Moderna started evaluating need update vaccine. They'll answer question week two, that's confirmed.

The vaccines worked reasonably well reducing symptoms previous variants. likely thing happen Omicron lead relatively mild breakthrough infections vaccinated people lead relatively severe symptoms unvaccinated population. 

Honestly best bet keep number infected hence number mutations vaccinating many people possible, reduces infections. someone vaccinated subsequently infected, best protection covid know of.   LMAO I'm fan haha

To really, really simplify -

In essence, everything happened covid asking (or requiring) young population sacrifice lives old, sick, vulnerable. Put young lives hold protect others.

Not treatment, vaccines, knowledge. 

I would argue it‚Äôs time old, sick, vulnerable populations take measures make sacrifices young really majority people lives. Instead everyone wear mask endlessly (and mostly uselessly low ineffective compliance is), people need extra protection wear good masks themselves. Instead restrictions travel bans, people vulnerable rescue social interactions. here. Problem worked ER. remember day CDC said ‚Äúhandkerchiefs‚Äù around face good enough. lasted two days.

True. cases identified far South Africa travelers there. means restricting travel still act limit speed spreads, giving us time work best approaches limit transmission, minimize severity symptomatic disease, validate treatments.

Screening reduces spread, eliminate risk it, even PCRs. basically non-asians? Omicron variant likely spread internationally, posing ‚Äúvery high‚Äù global risk Covid-19 surges could ‚Äúsevere consequences‚Äù areas, World Health Organization (WHO) said.

None really. I'll probably start wearing mask more(never fully dropped worn much). yh nothing else really. I'm double vaccinated plan get booster I've passed 6 month threshold roughly late December/early January. Unless say vaccines work severe disease see need change behaviour increasing mask wearing. Since familiar science know Israel saw cases dropping half population saw boosters. fact remains vaccination rate many countries low solution increasing cases avert overburdening hospitals. give science behind basis mathematical models presented results surveys vaccination acceptance, consider target vaccination rate (vaccination protection full vaccination) 85% 12‚Äì59 year olds 90% people aged 60 necessary also achievable. vaccination quota reached time, pronounced 4th wave coming autumn / winter seems unlikely, provided population continues adhere basic hygiene measures addition vaccination and, number infections increases again, reduces contacts certain extent. delta dont need wear masks amongst abysmal vaccination uptake unscientific. previous variants first dose.  Good news people start recover could get worse. really hope turns big deal. like able visit grandfather. take months. Get third dose asap opportunity. Except MUCH likely become less contagious less lethal. also said patients mostly younger. wonder might milder cases, rather anything variant itself. Younger people generally tended milder cases along. Indeed. Always find amusing people expect certainty... like remind _everything_ universe motion relative everything else.. above, ... make rule anyone talking something positive related omicron must start ‚ÄúGOOD NEWS EVERYONE‚Äù one version rona get make futurama jokes ain‚Äôt passing Surface transmission known covid variants close negligible. suppose nobody say sure, it‚Äôs nearly certain continue case.

Or maybe: Identify cases, isolate add cases traveling? Nah, would insane. thoughts well. Seems quick reaction around globe. Yeah, hospitals generally run full. usually run full patients days weeks. ICUs tend get patients stabilized appropriate placement, another part hospital rehabilitation home home. would stay long term. Unfortionately, covid patients take beds long periods time. turnover rate slower unable absorb new patient load. 

Additionally, hospital ICU ever got full previous covid, could divert patients local hospitals. can't happen every hospital ICU area full. 

And capacity mercy staffing, suffering years. beds fine staff care them. ECMO machines need two nurses times. Five ECMO patients sound like lot, that's ten nurses per shift, able work patients. Adding another ECMO bed anything there's enough nurses trained staff it. Hey pal, see buffalo guy. fellow upstate guy was/is lucky enough long covid. bad 8mo, bad 4, much better.

I really understand people claim everywhere already. different place early 2020 comes testing. certainly spreading currently aware of, doubt that. claim widespread, world already, pretty silly me. like weasels words way express certainty universe 100% certainty actually impossible. fine masks... still wear mine circumstances despite received booster shot... feeling like pandemic never end self-fulfilling prophecy sorts. mindset, trying wean irrational fear reinforced doom-mongers. use analytical mind assess risk things seem much less bleak, especially gauge relative risk.

The couple detained leave country: found airplane. ""Both persons handed GGD,"" military police reported social media. would set sights flight Spain, reports AT5.

A spokesperson reveals hotel Kennemerland region positively tested travelers South Africa isolation. Inside hotel, private security guards ensure guests must remain isolation so. Outside, police military police make sure one enters hotel business there.

The couple may prosecuted violating quarantine, including years prison. hotel couple isolation want say anything matter Sunday evening.

Translated www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) Let‚Äôs ramp fear regardless big dick. mind going nude showing off.  trolling? world overreacting news disease that‚Äôs quite obviously endemic around world time Kremlin troll factories sophisticated coordinated give credit for. aim cause maximum damage, especially since Russia announced Omicron borders well. 

For lesser known variants, aim cause maximum fear. variant they‚Äôre opposite that‚Äôs concerns see random red truckbot blasting [Elvis Michael that's him. Say hi please. Several early sequenced cases Johannesburg vicinity airport. guess every airport direct flights infections now. cares Austria? mean, kangaroos shrimp barbie, offer rest world? live suburb Frankfurt conservative neighborhood Waldorf school. people nice frightened technology. scared anything genetic, worry cellphones cause cancer, frightened 5G, terrified electronic banking &amp; tap-to-pay. reject anything ""modern.""

This quack's jab would probably reassure stresses ""old technology,"" tried &amp; true. 

This attracts people like think. Old technology given conservative old German doctor traditional type. end day, virus' great selective pressure become fatal, spread. increased fatality we've seen delta perhaps inadvertent virtue virus finding much efficient/quick way reproducing reaching harmful levels immune system chance (as might alpha beta).

So, perhaps, bottom line vaccinated much greater danger delta not, might another story. concerned Europe surges yet US supposedly yet. makes sense me. I‚Äôve looked sites like worldometer seems like states stopped reporting. Cognitive dissonance bad mental health. find accurate information regarding COVID rates? study obviously rapid tests performed first german case week [showed work fine. Probably circulating months without people really noticing. 

Makes wonder it‚Äôs transmissible not. Drilling making well man. drill hole find nothing. 

The best way find water try drill well. think point stands Let's also stop providing medical care clinically obese we're it.  understand China want public it??? Yeah, everywhere. Exactly. US, drove closest pharmacy got vaxxed (twice far) 12 minutes time. free. Govt drive every village convince everyone need it. think means shouldn‚Äôt reported about? ignore completely? point whinging here? Soooooo many people getting long-term sick/disabled thing. :(  Western Australia says hello.


And rest: did, months months. Even true still relevant latest variant.

We still remain vigilant global immunity help reduce mutation future breakthrough virus variants emerge. others said past 6 month threshold get it. Delta still prevalent likely stay way US Europe etc bit longer. Immunity 2nd dose still wains rate last longer sudden. 

At least current vaccines least still protect us severe disease doctors still recommend get booster eligible. Tests still done determine whether vaccines still work etc nothing confirmed say initial reports said severe cases ??? fake? agree first dose statement protection wanes within weeks hence second dose. probably meant short term decline transmission, valid.

While agree upon great protection, specially young&amp;healthy, booster shot delta concern huge proportion pretty much countries population unvaccinated. One could done everything right (by getting vaccinated) society still face tragedy due unvaccinated, clogg hospital beds. delays other, even vaccinated patients, treatment, see europe currently.
It seems discord comes different viewpoints, assess individual risk assess populations. Repost.  requirements ending *January*? peak respiratory-disease season?  mean... Like vaccine? (don't @me know mRNA vaccines work like that) West allowed millions people die something entirely preventable, *and* people West suffered daily restrictions boot.

CoVID-19 may forever, China zero-CoVID countries gotten dangerous phase, vaccines effective drugs, orders magnitude fewer deaths per capita West.

It's West done tiny bit worse, handled pandemic better arguable, subjective judgment call. mismanagement Europe US full-blown, unmitigated disaster, prompt serious reflection wrong societies. kinds people would hide zombie bite Agreed! omicron variant identified last week. new scientists cultured enough run tests it. going least ten days lab work clinical data give us enough information make sensible policy choices.

I hope G7 decide stop locking barn door horse gone. Omicron identified South Africa, know originated there, found least half dozen countries three continents. Trying quarantine sub-saharan Africa stop omicron. two things world can‚Äôt stand. People flee COVID quarantine‚Ä¶and DUTCH! Check r/COVID19 sub. Theres Qatar infection comprehensive study Also say young people getting sicker previous strains? Omicron comes wipes us out. Haha it‚Äôs actually true. Covid cause impotence men. reckon talked more. Might help people decide really want get vaxxed lol Yeah, I'd writing premier whoever continue like April. Shit fucking serious.  probably every airport direct flight Johannesburg already. rate growth suggests index case ~2 months ago, ~80% cases within last week, ~80% infections recent get tested yet. Expect numbers rise quickly first case found given location. unbelievable, eyes world them, decide catch plane Spain. understand. I'd rather talk 28 days later I'm glad things much better there. 

Hopefully get hurt Omicron variant.  It‚Äôs impassable, it‚Äôs highly unlikely full escape variant (that is, going 95% efficacy infection robust protection severe disease death 0% efficacy everything) emerge, especially one fell swoop. Possible? Sure. much reasonable assumption would window away protections series evolutions. expect 95% hold up? No. expect vaccines drop anything near useless. Pfizer again. reaction all. Right, hospitals designed full capacity normal conditions. add new, highly infectious disease top that. patients disappear? people stop heart attacks strokes car accidents? cancer take time off?  also thousands regime critics outside country. Surely, would've heard something contacts relatives. 

What think likely, country uses authoritarian power cover pandemic contain pandemic? economical standpoint, China would reason go latter. Containing virus means necessary means keep producing goods western world grow economy. Hiding pandemic letting run rampant would erode people's trust government, could potentially damage image even leaked outside world, damage economy overwhelm healthcare systems. absolutely authority contain virus ways western governments able use would considered unconstitutional. care private choices personal freedoms. literally deployed military Wuhan keep people breaking lockdown. effective measure would absolutely fly countries. he's making Dumb Dumber reference joke infecting others. dead people go dancing. Ya absolutely true. Hospitals don‚Äôt want know things get busy totally cancel bunch surgeries, including coronary bypasses, turn PACU‚Äôs preop areas ICU‚Äôs hire bunch contractors staff it. Also using tents, chairs hallway, literal fucking gift shop treat ER patients covid patients hold ER beds 12-36 hours.

Because totally ideal, completely normal, extremely optimal health systems do. Canada I'd hope right, heard reports second infections less severe. (Maybe data now, long ago) can't claim expert Dutch law, mandatory hotel quaratine prior warning (essentially involuntary detention) different proposition compared choosing get plane knowing face hotel quaratine end. 

UK law make provision involuntary detention public health reason, threshold used exceptionally high - unless solid evidence Omicron harmful would almost impossible justify UK law. Well, shit needs change. 

General. Strikes. Ok? family lives states away me. I‚Äôve decided fly things better. worth risk picking something potentially killing someone 60s 70s I‚Äôd visiting. It‚Äôs first world country issue. It‚Äôs risk benefit analysis. I‚Äôm willing give visits person christmas couple years means people care likely safe able enjoy decades visits holidays. Austria followed Australia's lockdown letter, they'd extra letters.  Reddit works mysterious ways. take able to, like data shown unvaxxed hit hardest right simply lot unvaxxed. vaxxed data shown vaxxed infected number twice even triple time higher. Number figure nothing virus, don‚Äôt see report saying vaccine effective new strain Israel already ban foreigners entry. Every variant makes every country, pandemic folks, that's pandemics do. 3-4 days $50-100k/day without insurance (at least $1k with) vs 1 day home. But, sure, vaccines work.

Even ignoring death, arguably miniscule risk healthy people, risk long covid (10-30% depending study), 1 day cold vs 3 day hospital stay? Bro... discovered 11th November. Even originate Southern Africa everywhere now. Travel bans pointless. Quarantines sure. everything else cheap political points. wait holidays hit, last year spiked around Christmas new years despite total lockdown. question chance breakthrough severe infection (protective immunity) breakthrough transmission (sterilizing immunity) compared unvaccinated person. target numbers dropping NPI's could depend current prevalence exposure rate relative others. science clear numbers *well* 5% Delta third dose, probably 1% range. 87% herd immunity upper bound threshold (seen Mumbai), 99% protective sterilizing immunity essentially 13 times part. I'm going break didgeridoo solidarity. know yet. Western Wahsd multiple deaths, don‚Äôt remember that. could vaccinated. started 2020 thinking want reduce waste... now... buy stuff people can't lick post Tik Tok üòÜ experts *hopeful* ""that may cause mild illness, without trademark symptoms Covid.""

However, doctor mentioned within article pointed ""it's early assume variant cause severe illness, too.""

Even though cases province involved younger people, doctors ""expect[ed] vast majority mild cases anyway, regardless vaccination status.""

The important point here, too, ""barely enough time infections time progress severe disease hospitalization.""


This means need time, least two weeks, study data. point, they'll able determine variant's severity info transmissibility. It'll also show degree protection current vaccines offer Omicron variant. Vaccine makers already taking steps adapt variant we'll probably improved vaccines early 2022.  data testing US: see testing US really inhomogenous. Places like Vermont report quite high positive cases despite high vaccination rate, due good testing rate. dont test, cant detect cases.

Also check international numbers, feature datasets testing also hospitalisations etc rule thumb look positive rate testing numbers. high dark field also high, meaning many cases undetected virus runs rampant population.
While US vaccination rate pretty bad compared many european countries US hardest hit country aswell many categories, e.g. deaths per capita. Therefore people got temporary immunisation infection. comparison: germany UK (one hardest hit european countries) would need double covid fatalities. Isn‚Äôt strain even weaker delta? meant contributing lack deaths. Edelweiss, Edelweiss

It seems like never ending supply many people difficult brains wrap around. isn‚Äôt enough evidence yet, meaningless  I'm sure we've missed significant portion, honestly, buy 0.35% case fatality rate. Even CDC estimates, 0.6% roughly case fatality rate, dramatically different assumed 0.35% used say 100% south africa infected. Also, case fatality rate must much lower given breakthrough cases nowhere near.the mortality full unvaxxed cases. I'm saying know nothing still assuming omicron MUST raging covid-recovered patients based incomplete data somewhat irresponsible.

Should super extra vigilant? Yes. Might correct? Yes. prepare like might case. Yes. G'day Mate! draw line somewhere. Fortunately people draw way that! I'm waiting 6 months get mine roughly end December/early January(can't remember exact date got 2nd dose).

It'd good kind ""variant bounty"" counteract issue (although want go overboard actually encourage creation variants). Like rhino horse five legs. variant sufficiently successful, like Delta (and like Beta), mutations occur top it. Omicron appears derived Delta infection severely immunocompromised individual fought infection long time. example Delta boosters now, would likely much higher efficacy Omicron original vaccine.

Conclusion? way early panic new variant everyone appears panicking about. It, likely, another variation theme getting used to. Worst case, imho, may spread like Delta providing another opportunity unvaccinated individuals get sick and/or die vaccinated previously vaccinated substantially better outcomes irrespective vaccination previous infections. could slightly different clinical characteristics potentially impacting different sub-populations (age?) overall, another wave sea Covid gradually getting smaller smaller like ripples pond time inputs decline case Covid reservoir becomes less naive many standpoints.

Melbourne 91% 12+ population fully vaccinated, numbers neither going down‚Ä¶ sitting around 1000 day, real restrictions (except unvaccinated).. stopped climbing passed 80% so. Yeah, owner Gucci brand resides America one advocating unimpeded travel all. Put massive restrictions flights.

And even 200k residents Ruili, logic show difference one said 800k death better less democracies. Maintaining normalcy life isn‚Äôt worth kind sacrifice.

This travel ban pointless, punitive security theater make everyone feel ""safer."" said ‚Äòsmall size country‚Äô, referring land mass specifically.

I see came conclusion. deleted comment, noted European nations part European continent, thus country comparable size UK‚Ä¶.

I‚Äôm bringing theory Holland/Belgium/Germany worst outbreak worldwide moment potential variants would seem high there.

I know getting downvoted hell, that's reasonable inference draw. Luckily us, particular variant gives us insanely easy way track it, use method disprove theory. 

When someone takes PCR Covid test, test looks 3 specific genes sample. currently circulating variants, 3 genes detected. Omicron, 2 are. third one comes blank. course still need send genetic testing absolutely 100% sure, makes ridiculously easy tell glance cases likely Omicron, unlikely so.

Given information, assorted governments scientific communities searched recent positive PCR tests, looking signs Omicron. theory correct new variant driving current surge, they'd finding tests 2 3 genes showing EVERYWHERE. aren't. They're finding one two tests sign, within last days, almost people recently traveled southern Africa.

Nice, love Kacey Musgraves. seems like lot people putting much consideration seriousness increased transmissibility quickly may spread. Severe disease would nightmare even deadly there‚Äôs signs mutation rapid infection rate reach havoc own. getting boosters weeks. Whoa, guy wrong there's problem saying that. understood meant think votes unecessary, told viruses true clear exactly like problem, learning virus too. Deaths spiking SA lethal.

Mainly young people got infected though, least caused deaths spike young unvaccinated SAians. unvaccinated, thia variation dangerous vaccinated looks less deadly anyway. giant media driven fearmongering variant. No, *hoarded* vaccines along wealthy nations. race class thing, obviously, thing present plenty white countries banned travel US, several African countries bans haven‚Äôt even reported cases. Stop apologist, pathetic. rich countries hold vaccines, covid evolved poor countries. Cruise ships packed old people--Each ship morgue also Yeah, that‚Äôs American thing do. Thankfully less prevalent Europe. going break though vaccines, period. Stop repeating one tweet untill actually know means. variation less deadly spreads much faster hard natural immunity mRna vaccines. short, variation going magically make vaccines ineffective. worsrt need booster safe. variation fade away news like others, remember delta going kill us never talked about. won‚Äôt make difference. It‚Äôs almost certainly already community spreading every country world. It‚Äôs already detected Europe, China, Canada too.  \*does\* matter, thing we're talking about, symptoms especially mild.

Was confirmed? saw reports said symptoms mild (Israeli report, etc.), also reports said ""it take weeks know"". bit confused. Yes Either blanket travel ban i.e. Japan one all. Selective banning stupid, ineffective (this researched) borderline dangerous reason. way South Africa going transparent future.

I also strong sense ban would've different nonexistent variant detected 'developed' country like UK Japan, that's politics. good chunk world doesn‚Äôt even enough vaccines 18+, approving vaccines 11 (who hardly ever get seriously ill) priority think Pfizer ask approval haven‚Äôt done everywhere yet. Might still take months places stop getting ready gut Superman Lex gave him. fits better liver decease get slowly yellow xD They‚Äôll let off. Dutch government pander freedom lobby. discomfort test depends nurse. pretty good many, quite intense, makes eyes water. Okay nice, US citizens need banned traveling countries selfish vacations they‚Äôve almost entire pandemic. Double ban role hoarding vaccines prioritizing profits letting counties produce order save lives people countries/slow new strains, composed many classist, selfish, ableist people little capacity self-reflection empathy.  Glad agree. keep hearing pills like taken really early infection. people realise infected; least know Covid virus; doctors might realise soon enough path serious course illness. wonder useful pills be, circumstances? mean many days pass real-life scenario infection / first symptoms day people actually receiving medication. Sure, inefficient vaccines would caused vaccine hesitancy. Plus wouldn‚Äôt gotten us magical 70% heard immunity everyone chasing time. remember two couple reasons turned down. Sorry hear that. wife moved California two nephews born late 2020. think we'll able see couple years rate. starting open little little yeah, anymore. PR ""We losing money."" 30 mutations spike protein\* stage pandemic, travel restrictions domestic politics science, hence caution them. Countries often take draconian decisions borders lax ones regards safety measures domestically - ""plays well voters"" package, caveat bad decision public health perspective. couple weeks actual data answer that, sadly. Stay safe! Something doesn‚Äôt feel right. It‚Äôs don‚Äôt know something don‚Äôt don‚Äôt want us panic like last time. large fractions population would *get fucking shots*, we'd eventually get ahead. variants would show less frequently, even show might spread slowly enough highly-vaccinated population 3 months would enough get ahead them. chances came someone vaccinated? Reading somewhere actually S-protein changed, chances came someone vaccinated highly likely (Spike protein mrna vaccines build) change N-protein well, makes chances even greater.  scrambled Sunday gather data new Omicron variant, capabilities ‚Äî perhaps important ‚Äî effectively current vaccines protect it.

Call old fashioned I'm pretty sure capabilities orders magnitude important current vaccines effectiveness it, since lethality make break would want vaccine first place. Lots dumb comments thread like one upvoted. 

How think it‚Äôs fair someone like can‚Äôt leave country visit family even though double vaccinated, done stop spread covid yet must punished idiots getting vaccinated don‚Äôt really care. 

The vast majority don‚Äôt need leave country never will, yet come dumb idea? intelligent concise breakdown vaccine protection could come man Florida. Admit it, you‚Äôre Massachusetts! Seriously! Baltimore classification system lists 7 categories virus

* Double stranded DNA
* Single stranded DNA (positive stand)
* Double stranded RNA
* Single stranded RNA (positive negative strand)
* Two can't remember, something retro-transposons think 

Not viruses RNA. People flying US already need vaccinated tested. (Except US citizens need tested 24h flight case)

And get checked properly airport.

I flew Brussels New York 8 days ago won‚Äôt travel ban country aren‚Äôt first report it. tried looking flights work around like that. find anything less $8000 3 people  want another Delta situation. Countries caught guard that. 

Hopefully overreaction. 

We've seen *same* data. Initial numbers suggest **really** infectious variant. Like, ""holy shit, can't right"" level infectiousness. 

Now, make sure data accurate, takes time. Perhaps miscalculated. 

If data *is* accurate, we'll also need time see infectious translates dangerous. Milder symptoms fine vaccinated, unvaccinated infections skyrocket, could prove overall deadly, despite ""mild"" (especially ERs **fill** millions ""mild"" cases) . know several weeks. 

In mean time, still first ""variant concern"" since 2020 (seriously), countries wanting safer sorry. old people got it? Can't imagine old people travelling getting/spreading COVID day age honestly know point is. One qualified people world given opinion agree. There's much that. 

Counties reacted quickly many bringing back additional restrictions. taken seriously INITIAL observations seeming point fact vaccines still effective symptoms least worse potentially milder. basically map countries sequencing... Well thanks, article title, impression that. Maybe they're outside Western Australia? completely ignored comments myocarditis, long covid, unknown risks many mutations Omicron variant.

It‚Äôs cheap political points. Western governments tick boxes Covid response score card look like they‚Äôre something. travel ban say tough Covid won‚Äôt mandate vaccines countries and, UK won‚Äôt even mandate masks. 

We‚Äôll started mandating masks yesterday believe. 

And won‚Äôt control seeding. 

First case discovered 11th November. It‚Äôs world wide point already. Travel bans useless. Easy everyone. Think logical. Omicron actually turns cause milder Covid-19 indicated could fact natural vaccine coming way. saying, almost inevitable journey become another cold (milder vira advantage allowing people mobile), undergo mutations way. Could Omicron important step direction. Could stereotypical? ü§£ like know thoughts policies based idiotic statement avatar... Lmao quite pathetic really. university‚Äôs mandate them? like see purely anecdotal bits symptoms people experienced search ""weird flu"" twitter. circulating weeks South Africa among youth many assumed flu since many already previously recovered Covid PCR test unaffordable many here. AstraZeneca, main vaccine COVAX sending Africa. SA turned shipments early data showed may offered weak protection Beta, surely would better nothing. people selfish stupid. can't force 100% world stop living 2 years destroy society process. Ebola quarantine would conceivably work. virus highly transmissible even lockdown everything non essential propagation point spreads things reopen. saw again. like learned nothing past 2 years. Lockdowns effective strategy.

It bad decision lock virus, help nearly enough offset negatives. arguable whether anything all. mean, going Kenny Omega...who took name finisher FF7. still works. seen climate change conference COP26 glasgow recently? would best countries world could reach united agreement incredibly hard gets refused some. Heck, even politicians one nation reach agreement. real problems, rich countries good social security systems shut economy poor countries cant, question corona infection hunger death population. Try clean can. used steamer. Useful information available online. Masks really meant used 8-14 hours max. (except permanent residents ) can‚Äôt enter.

Not true whatsoever. Regular old residents (anyone valid visa) leave come back Japan. I've done tons non-citizen/non-perm resident friends mine. circulating specific country 10000X rate everywhere

This true, COVID cases per capita significantly lower countries banning travel here. 

Secondly, evidence variant originated here. fact it, along Beta variant, discovered simply function fact better sequencing variants countries. 

Lastly, feelings, economics. SA small developing country heavy reliant foreign capital injection. travel bans going wreck havoc economy. would find two weeks later starts spreading country conscience. roast media rest pandemic, may forever. rest world unaware covid? Pointless article  lost mind moment thought lockdowns work even better Reading stories like really drives save more, get chance visit Taiwan &amp; Japan, blow bunch cash support small shops.

you're one that's engaging magical thinking right I've proven several times 


we're done confirmed tested? thought read somewhere required tested. sound upset. hope things start improve you. seroprevalence infected never gone 27%

when say eighties including vaccinated blood serum testing

in words literally proven everyone get vaccinated

because immunity provided infection durable

[infection-induced seroprevalence estimates persons aged 16 29 years (5.5% [95% CI, 4.6%-6.6%] July 2020 That's true looking individual hosts isolation, true considering macro social context. virus deadly, we'll lock create booster variants targeting specifically. variant less severe, we'll let run rampant eventually even vaccinate (the common colds). time, latter become dominant strands.  response

There probably seven eight people know still think election hoax absolutely joking. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really thing. recently travelled vaccine show enjoyed safe dining/venues compared home state. mistake thinking travel bans situation punishment. Governments US, UK, EU nations protecting citizens highest duty. would failing duty continue allow unimpeded travel part world virus spreading without knowing scope spread SA high potential Omicron evade exisiting antibodies.

 quarantine try limit spread potentially game changing virus parts world, imposition economic sanctions. still mutate would want combo vaccinations limiting exposure spread. don‚Äôt know. might regular idiot. number Spanish flu estimate using reported cases COVID. 

If used reported cases Spanish Flu would like 500,000 . 

If use total case estimate one also other. 

Last estimate saw COVID cases 25 million+ think wait week. Flurry info thing starting tomorrow Easing restrictions harshest lockdown developed world Auckland. easing Auckland regions still restrictive world. 100 limit caps restaurants, private homes contingent use vaccine passports. vaccine passports used even harsher limits.  also something clearly wring testing testing verification system. Supposedly, everyone flights negative test board (IMHO require vax too, don‚Äôt). I‚Äôve heard bunch speculation ten percent wasn‚Äôt caught. Everything fake test results rampant, tests accurate (OK, require two maybe), caught flight due lack masking/ventilation, combo. Stopping Covid crossing friendly land borders super hard stopping flying world unchecked easier help slow kinds outbreaks. Savage lol Engines pumping thumping time problem yet know effective current vaccines limiting spread effects Omicron; spread readily proof vaccination indoor activities going help much. Either current boosters effective there's good reason delay taking new one anyway. misleading? [Texas  Moderna‚Äôs vaccine candidate developed January last year people world even heard happening Wuhan. machine modeling aspect vaccine development nowadays completely misunderstood mischaracterized ‚Äúrushed‚Äù development. almost certainly eventuality they‚Äôve anticipated planned for. I‚Äôm sure running Thursday.

Such amazing era live happen! No, already confirmed. COVID killed way that.

18 million Spanish flu retrospective figure nobody recorded cases back then.

COVID retrospective figure half countries record case numbers worth anything. even ones getting ~1/2 them. 

Worldwide would surprised even 1/4 COVID deaths reported. You‚Äôre obviously going wait production‚Ä¶ approval‚Ä¶ distribution‚Ä¶ inevitable bottleneck vaccines everyone going want one once.

Someone age 50 probably would eligible booster another 8-9 months earliest. bullshit dude. head.

Experts, FDA, CDC, Dr. Fauci, talking possibility variants requiring vaccine update practically day one. 

Just antivaxxers imagined alternate reality none happened mean anyone outside echo chamber living it. selective pressure virus mutate less deadly variant. much individual level (where long incubation bypass that), macro social level, deadly virus lead lockdowns dedicated boosters targetting it, whereas less leathal version generally left run rampant. milder cases confirmed sample sizes? Would good serious like south african doctor said anyone information weird symptoms like high blood pressure? least 2 3 years covid reality. Yes are. least part it. done original strain may contained. countries need stop travel weeks Yeah know 'they know something don't' narrative coming from. Travel bans make sense unless across board. don‚Äôt know omicron originated places already spread to. Thank fuck county also low-incidence rate requirement us lose public indoor mask mandate. Completely agree. I‚Äôm sure many will, really frustrating. good news 94% adults vaccinated Manhattan, 97% Queens, Bronx, SI Brooklyn follow (in order less) high 80‚Äôs. don‚Äôt want bunch unvaccinated people point accept done can. That‚Äôs largely stick neighborhood joints; won‚Äôt anywhere near tourist hotspots season. free govt hospitals locations, even private ones charge pretty minimal fee(8-10 dollars max). Also flying fking Dubai, like money issues Physically stop hurricane bullets, matter enough. Got symptoms including fever booster dose Moderna, rather actual virus. Overreacting, promise you.

Not virus concern, Japan.

Any excuse shut outside world excuse looking since Commodore Perry.

Nobody knows anything, they're embracing xenophobia usual. may even cure cancer induce levitation. Can‚Äôt rule trials complete. Washington DC Dulles Airport (Northern Virginia), New York (Newark, New Jersey) get lot flights Africa. countries done same

Some jurisdictions still opened rest country yet, look Western Australia Assuming death rates go back March 2020, sure. requires magical thinking hate much. get prosecuted. Dutch gov set example. Moderna lowered dose booster specifically reduce side-effects. So... good hear anecdote saying working. got rash 2nd Moderna. shot made feel like crap second far worst. hope third bit milder reaction. sacrifice freedom safety deserve neither current vaccines ineffective there's zero reason wait new one, would also different enough reasons waiting apply. Omicron going absolutely decimate southern US. overrun hospitals? excess death rate 2020? 2021? numbers get closer reality...and way lower per capita US due keeping visitors, masking, distancing etc Sooo 34% Orthodox seniors unvaccinated vs 15% otherwise. 

That's pretty fucking bad. populations size there's twice many unvaxxed Orthodox Pretty sure China said start Covid, well, understand, Moderna higher dosage Pfizer 1st 2nd shots. third Moderna shot, dosage cut 1/2 Pfizer same. 50% Moderna still bigger dosage Pfizer. think people greater reaction Moderna.

I said 48 million known cases produced 750k deaths

even another 45 million people got verifiably infected could mathematically infer would result another 750,000 deaths

not mention continued clogging healthcare system

it's literally simple math logic answer level oversight cooperation experts countries outbreaks cannot feasibly hidden scientific community.

They already cannot hidden. China tried damnedest failed miserably. China can't hide outbreak, country day age. sample size? long enough spot severe symptoms usually get severe Day 10? Pfizer three shots. Third shot/booster hit shot 2. got mild fever, malaise, chills day. took Tylenol twice day function. 


The worst aspect pain deltoid shot. took days go away. know due pharmacy worker gave whatever, terrible sidelined gym little bit.  ""Winnie Pooh"" already taken norovirus. due repeated exposure, subsequent outbreaks nothing compared original. understand Cells b cells work especially well antibodies don't. 

Aren't cells b cells trained look thing introduced immune system, spike protein. changed enough know look for?

The immune system seen whole virus. punished sharing data. Precautions taken new variant predominantly is. 

If government labs run halfway intelligent people, understand distinction. 

For example, reasonable people get positive Covid test understand difference asked self-isolate punished. 


Also, I'm struggling understand karma it. point calling attention internet points? feel though impact quality ideas? people judge opinion based internet points? Scientists ring alarm bell Government decide whether make public.

Data public, possibly hide it. China failed keep wraps, miserably, every country fail. did?

They covid free pandemic. know much testing they've done. viral loads low unlikely severe case.  **If** immune escape thorough current boosters ineffective, would also reason impose 6 month wait.

Like need 6 month wait getting flu shot either.  media focuses antibodies, B cells real MVP. human restrictions come economic social cost, could disincentive report new variants. ‚ÄúI've heard grapevine countries push sequences quickly [in past] worried travel bans,‚Äù says Emma Hodcroft, virologist University Bern. ‚ÄúThis opposite want.‚Äù

Money social status comes important survival fellow humans.

Enjoy Kid Rock concert. 

Omicron definitely will. Yeah none happened last variants like lamda discovered nope. first immunity flu actually held secondly mutating deadly strains following generally common track viruses mutate less lethal strain.


[But every often, direct descendants 1918 flu combined bird flu swine flu create powerful new pandemic strains, exactly happened 1957, 1968 2009. later flu outbreaks, created part 1918 virus, claimed millions additional lives, earning 1918 flu odious title ‚Äúthe mother making claims statements based incomplete misunderstood information best

at worse repeating sophomoric misinformation unfathomable guys downvoted this... faith humanity evaporated. Man hate people much US done 748 million tests since early 2020

Japan done 27 million

I'm glad japan lot people look japan's low numbers never look tiny testing numbers been, months ago japan days 30-40% positivity piss poor testing was.  misleading title misleading? 

Lol subs quality stayed see. cares? One, governments decide publicize stuff, scientists do. Two, reported variant time still slow hitting whole globe. cares little slower next time since we've failed contain every time anyways. Winnie Pooh doesn‚Äôt like virus called Xi Right talking Ireland bombing religion couple decades ago? May 90% probably actually 85% effective, month 25%. good thing vaccines stop seriously sick it? mean already picked number countries. No, saying 3 million deaths based idea 48 million people exposed. false. Seroprevalence 80s now. think bothered hugely anti vax large following going NYC unvaxed exclaiming fun 16+ teens would possibly lead following footsteps. know going build coronavirus lab would locate far away natural reservoirs possible. kind dumbass builds things near stuff need?

I mean there's way coincidence home near job could anywhere Earth. Dammit sound like crazy man talking myself! read comments reading post.  Baltimore Omg messaging CDC constantly arms. Always pandering towards anti-vax people really harmed messaging. South Africa: pls ban bad.

Rest world: speed vaccinations. I'm genuinely little bit worried either a) ends 6 months year (like we've saying almost 2 years lmao) b) end eventually everyone really going say fuck carry usual kill lot people. 

(and end mean Fauci means, like 10k cases 90% vaccinated. know never gonna fully eradicated even without eradicating still ""over."") almost certainly less $100 insure tickets covid shutdowns. Excuse keep Americans Preventing travelling different. That's foreign country agreeing US requests test passengers. foreign country laws apply. 

Once US soil, US law applies can't deny citizens entry.  It‚Äôs honestly disturbing people becoming comfortable idea banning travel don‚Äôt even see issue - yes, tourism decimated. 3% doesn‚Äôt sound like lot (and employs closer 5%).

That instantly adds 5% unemployment services ancillary also take big hit - restaurants, bars, mechanics safari vehicles, etc. million+ people dealt another blow top they‚Äôve already faced. ‚Äúpostponing meetings zoom‚Äù possibility, mere uncertainty caused ban often enough spoil deal cancel project.

Additionally, little evidence travel ban even *works*. recommends *against* effective measure curbing I‚Äôm claiming indefinite lockdowns. I‚Äôm claiming indefinite NPIs.  could never gather friends limitation going grocery store, never lines, self restricted first started.

Oh. outing *as problem*.

Me, many people know, home months. flying around hanging friends family. Nonessential businesses closed 2020. lives sitting couch, grocery store week two, sitting couch.

Just one stopping gathering groups mean supposed shit. One potential downside proves even 3rd dose current-gen vaccines provide good protection Omicron tweaked vaccine required could well harming uptake next-gen shots would everyone's 4th dose within 1 year.  ‚ÄúHold incubation period‚Äù 

- Omicron really hardly children dying Covid, check official stats. virus impacts kids, cant believe people still dont know Precaution. Fingers crossed. 

Still hoping Omicron turns much less virulent infectious, thereby giving everyone immunity fast whole mess months. Unlikely oh well. flight different, foreign country allowed prevent boarding US request. US soil can't deny entry.

Otherwise feel virus keep hopping mutating countries vaccinated different rates. One day fear virus come along perfect balance mortality, transmitsbility, mutability, time symptoms occur destroys civilization know it. Jansen?

First off, I'm done MCU references thrown everywhere days. can't people grasp serious topics without making Marvel/Star Wars/Harry Potter references analogies? Like ""trump voldemort"" ""pandemic like blip avengers"". r/ReadAnotherDamnBook, damnit. 
 
Second, okay want vaccinate rights. thing people likely sources variants keep seeing every two months. Unvaxxed choice reason keeps dragging further. hard choice. benefits outweigh risks much. people use ""human rights"" argument masking distancing, thus making hell shitshow last longer longer longer. countries starting close borders currently indication deadly omicron actually is? I'm assuming people Reddit US, metrics present I'm sorry assuming location. Thank **Sakoku forever!!!!** came back Japan beginning November. work 6 months starting May. DoD contractors allowed country, however National State Emergency definitely played part restricting able free time *on top of* restrictions airbase's command placed us well. 

Long story short basically stayed hotel room 6 months fucking miserable. go back next summer hopefully Omicron handled same. vaccines aren‚Äôt it, is? I‚Äôm willing use NPIs rest life. 

Some us actually social. us devastated mental health wise able things friends another 6 months. us college want fucking experience. idea vaccination status players is? I‚Äôm assuming mostly vaccinated. Champ! Thanks  Countries banning travel SA. Also surrounding countries sequencing. 

And COVID case numbers, Omicron case numbers. amount infected people they're finding planes SA insane. clearly epicenter Omicron even originate there. problem remains unvaccinated. Omicron turns significantly transmissible, hospitals going slammed worse already are. That's problem everyone, one example ancillary risk vaccinated. Thank you, makes lot sense. state don‚Äôt boosters available yet. I‚Äôm concerned. new variant plus waning immunity gonna big bad time. Quad vax coming. We‚Äôll getting boasters every 6 months foreseeable future, IMHO. everyone lives UK US. I'm saying that. I'm saying cannot use vaccines panacea open everything back up. help immensely, like said silver bullet. 

Like said another poster, live Top 3 (population) US city life pretty much back normal. things pre-pandemic, sure fuss about. can't go another musical eat another six months, I'm gonna lose sleep it. US center world. us live countries things heavily restricted going full lockdown again. Maybe look outside bubble while. college still highly restricted. request frankly slap fact young adults lost best years life told, got vaccinated, trapped indefinite restriction hell. need ramp. assumed antivax someone speak hivemind talling points break down. Simple dronie probably done specifically improve protection winter months always worst healthcare system. dunno variant good bad. seems spread faster bad. seems lesser symptons good. spreads well without killing might give anti vaxers antibodies too.  


i know wonder vacant offices converted housing. Even COVID totally dies (in however many years is) many people gotten taste remote work going back. I'd surprised even 75% office workers back office full time within 5 years. kids die? matter? AZ seems main vaccine given older age groups, due concerns younger age groups mostly given Pfizer. Everyone know AZ first time around given Pfizer booster.

I suspect main aim use boosters get worst winter month. older age groups vulnerable already getting boosters 6 months up. [Transmission SARS-CoV-2 mink farms humans mink back end June 2020, 68% mink farm workers tested positive virus antibodies SARS-CoV-2. large clusters infection initiated human COVID-19 cases viruses bear D614G mutation. Sequencing subsequently shown mink-to-human transmission also occurred. look way. filtration still meets expected performance threshold, good enough. would say 95%+ ok (meaning takes 20x longer get sick close contact sick person, compared maskless). I'm vaxxed tired life pretty much back normal live Top 3 (population) US city. Nothing stopping everything pre-pandemic, I'm sure fuss about. missed something recently? live WA problem leaving state anyone known issues coming back. Also family outside WA come WA fine. said. said mental health considered. Also, ever going reach ""acceptable"" level wear masks Germany? answer never. Besides descriptions below, cell-mediated immunity works immune cells check cells, killing infected cells. Think shooting buddy getting bit zombie. Antibody-mediated immunity identify neutralize virus infects cell, stop infection less killing cells contain it. Think shooting zombies bite. ok paul blart? 40s thr UK got pfizer/Moderna rare bloodclot issue. Really older people got AZ think close past 6 month tiny differences worth worrying about

I rather follow evidence base medicine committee vaccine experts armchair epidemologist opinion. logic unless 100% protection shouldn‚Äôt reopen. 

There always infections new variants. always spread. 

Covid restricted life worth living long term. you‚Äôre abroad, may want manual switch cell carriers you‚Äôre roaming. issues France Spain.  may respond ""who cares it"" like learned Thanos means fine ends flawed.

First off, I'm done MCU references everywhere. can't people grasp serious topics without making Marvel/Star Wars/Harry Potter references analogies? r/ReadAnotherDamnBook, damnit.

Second, okay want vaccinate rights. thing people likely sources variants keep seeing every two months. Unvaxxed choice reason keeps dragging further. hard choice. benefits outweigh risks much. people use ""human rights"" argument masking distancing, thus making hell shitshow last longer longer longer. Yeah live Belgium last week highest number covid cases since beginning pandemic. vaccination level 75%, things looking good here, hospitals filling up. want anyone die think people power either. answers think opening everything back rolling dice ""see happens"" answer either. Don‚Äôt dick approval criteria lower, since it‚Äôs reasonable assume sequence changes mRNA vaccine won‚Äôt change safety profile. think he‚Äôs trying say reinfection delta omicron occur large enough degree , variants could coexist large degree displace like saw delta alpha example. don‚Äôt enough data draw conclusion yet. Maybe end worked me. Here's link main page navigate from: works time! someone fully vaccinated, young healthy still ended ass two full weeks lingering effects lasted 3 months‚Ä¶ Covid ain‚Äôt joke. Even don‚Äôt end hospitalized dead, it‚Äôs well worth avoiding -assuming don‚Äôt end hospitalized dead wearing mask social distancing‚Ä¶ *eye roll* lol 

I‚Äôm advocate fear mongering, woods yet. You‚Äôve got right idea. people need know. live Manhattan. Yes, lockdown, quite time. 

I'm sick hearing people places talk opressive requires masks vaccines. say effective all. help **a lot** fact still spread presents problems. degree they're effective still widely understood, especially new variants. I'd rather take cautionary approach rash one open everything back regard might happen.

Thankfully people power willing make rash decisions either represent *everyone* people tired ""want live lives again"". frequently

tiny differences worth worrying about, differences become slightly less tiny comparing extreme ends 20s 30s bracket, 28 vs. 31 something equally unimportant. people fussy proven, safe vaccines helpful.

now talking 21 year old vs 39 year old, sure, get choice go pfizer. I'm obese also booster. 

You're shrieking obesity nobody arguing healthier good weight, we're telling using protections work immediately smarter focusing ones don't. vaxed day could also booster.

And hey look, agree us! really trying make point yelling ...the point lockdowns avoid brink collapse, waiting we're brink fucking collapse lockdown? people really think way?? many suicides acceptable then? many years life want young people lose via taking lives? many willing accept? lives young people done everything asked them

They not, CDC recommends wearing masks even vaccinated high risk scenarios, e.g. indoors incidence 50 positivity rate 8%.

Your hyperbolic comment claiming phsyical health wouldnt looked untrue aswell. wrong one major step thought process.

The current covid strains already go human animal human. mutating entire time.

The initial bat jump mutated within animals first time. think vaccinated society willing stomach unvaccinated people facing consequences actions. us fed think.  There's much definitively know yet. Sequencing finding hundreds cases UK seem originated strain found SA meaning could circulating locations longer first indicated. Given that, OP's speculation current vaccines become useless new variant likely new variant becoming another strain current vaccines effective against. Also bad news prevalent false negative fake test results are. far know Denmark confirmed two cases, travellers South Africa. collectively forgetting that‚Äôs exactly happened US March 2020? title sits wrong me. something along lines ‚ÄúCorporate healthcare puts patients danger decades abusive staff practices leading people quit.‚Äù something like that. Thank you. learning loss children lack real college education young adults going wide impacts future. think fact ignored alternative, let virus run rampant burn comes unknowns think majority society willing stomach.

There's vocal minority (who old, preexisting conditions, etc) want happen thankfully live society people position make call. residents matter doubling time. SA like 1000X Omicron cases US Europe right now. 

It take weeks months countries reach level cut travel SA. Letting 60 vs 1000 infected makes big difference soon Omicron dominant. 

It's buying time study vaccines. Nobody thinks long term solution  UK mostly Astra Zeneca? 

I know Belgium offers booster 4 months Astra Zeneca, 6 months Pfizer/Moderna. I've vaxed day could also booster. 

I'm also obese choice effort. 

Let's see get hospitalized first :) It‚Äôs early call vaccine effect us future yet got it. People don‚Äôt like look objectively. It‚Äôs we‚Äôve made political issue it‚Äôs health science issue  care Trump's FDA commissioner? Stop fear mongering variant. Sounds it‚Äôs mild version covid far. Also worry variants remember goal virus stay alive. Viruses mutate become easily spreadable less deadly. There's much one post, commentary took Reddit, general news, Twitter, etc. 

Then there's also people seem confused wording ""vaccines still effective"" mean something like ""vaccine almost unaffected variant, one confusing ones, ""South Africa crushed Delta wave already Omichron arrived"" mean ""Omichron likely can't compete Delta"" 

It feels like people become jaded fear mongering news throughout pandemic they're thing opposite direction Agreed - completely worth it, good hear experiences folks prepare (letting boss know next days might drag bit). meant shade toward Westralians. downvoted? There's already news Israel saying vaccines helping variant. üòÇ  I've worked disease control situations animal welfare rule always better safe inconvenience 10 14 days figure bad fucked non quarantined dog breaks parvo.

I wish focus wasnt travel bans, dont work instead vaccine personal level protection masking etc. Sounds like best-case scenario true reports saying do. Back Tokugawa era.  Literally everyone judges research does. basically, fully vaccinated booster, need yet another booster Omicron 3-4 months

This true point. likely variant around months caused death destruction media would like to. Though samples tested Omicron isolated. Right now, soon know whether Omicron prove blessedly less harmful variant out-competes prior, dangerous variants.

Even proves case, Delta prior variants still there. vanish blink eye. best, we're looking weeks months they're overtaken - they're overtaken all.

One error keep making prematurely declare victory. Every time we've done that, new surge quickly follows. unsustainable.  No, not. Travel restrictions useless virus already seeded population. Wow. 
I'm favor travel ban couple weeks slow spread least get better understanding variant. 

And yet even see hardship people. We're social creatures. need certain amount physical contact. understand humans, lesson worth learning. try, lol Mid May me. thought pretty good shot this.... Unicron Thankfully they‚Äôre vaccinated boosted better odds getting elected president dying covid Get page consistent? kind craziness drinking there? kind question this? Barely inconvenience! think would change mind one family members would end dead stranger. Lovely. Covid hosted mutated within animals. always danger new variants mutated within animals.

You wrong, considering nuances either. hosted animals, many disease result global pandemics. virus pool 50k people infected mutate much slowly virus pool 500k infected.

Reducing number people infected world's highest priority comes stopping pandemic. mean yeah wolf real past story too, that‚Äôs people listened first place. Calling wolf often wolf appearances makes people stop listening leads replace people charge people less likely sound alarm.

Moderna recall tested ""Delta tweaked"" booster time ago, found original vaccine worked fine still, especially boosted. fr fr point getting vaccinated strain may (and likely, will) able evade vaccine current form? Would better wait vaccine adjusted Omicron?

Yes. Even Omicron somehow 100% evades current vaccines (which happen), variants still still infecting people.

Get vaccinated ASAP. effective Omicron, booster variant specifically. wait booster come start vaccination process, unprotected entirely.  doctor seen 5 patients can‚Äôt possibly know could happen Omicron infects hundreds thousands people. You‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs entirely expression concern hypothetical possibility. Like said mom getting fat could turn ugly, nothing factually could say statements.

""Looking mildness symptoms, reason panicking, see severely ill patients""

""The hype that's created media &amp; worldwide correlate clinical picture"" hope one takeaways pandemic internet learns patience. ""Every federal agency grown less competent month long-time civil servants leave""

That's pretty broad generalization quite fair feds. agencies walloped (State specifically, comes mind), leadership top (politically appointed roles) shuffling around too. federal hiring grown competitive years there's incredible influx applicants last several years. agencies even undergoing really large transformation efforts improve hiring, training, retention rates. I'd hazard guess say least agencies, minimum, improving competence. quote article current system disincentivizes countries alerting others threats inevitably land shores.""

If country believes honest risks put no-travel list, they're incentive either dishonest, whole lot deep digging find they're hosting new strain.

Starting exercise now, obese life, way fight COVID stupid idea. Prioritize three things OP mentioned first, add exercise well. way go. would better could stop shitting bed every months new variant comes up, will. way media acting past couple days criminal. basically, fully vaccinated booster, need yet another booster Omicron 3-4 months (pfizer stated take around 100 days develop [Source]( thought handle thing, starting spiral control. It‚Äôs insane people downvoting you, Africa expendable.

Sure, worried take vaccination seriously enough despite effectivity unlimited resources, might get randomly shot wrong neighborhood wrong neighborhood, might get shot randomly around school take care children futures, might get run sidewalk *because.*

But type assault happens lady walking around night abandoned places... Actually safer lot places.

So different spin that, feel safe enough regard home, even safer US.

Everything else sucks though. Compassion fatigue real. South Africa requires full vaccination **and** PCR test entry.

They cannot, however, set requirements people leaving country.

Once border airport, responsibility. requirements set destination country and/or airline. KLM Netherlands responsible, South Africa. completely logical. since worldwide response covid anything well-coordinated logical, understand people wondering it. Thus far really good locking barn horses already gone. sure you‚Äôre upvoted spreading misinformation  US worst cesspool covid world always sending mixed signals.

What's remaining encouraging cases reported either asymptomatic mild; including team staff young in-shape athletes (we seem limited data point older individuals good).

Hong Kong flight Uhh, yeah, no, travel bans work stop spread viruses inhibit pandemics. They're panacea. play peoples anti-immigrant fears, containment standpoint they're waste time resources. No, think they're saying endless articles multiple news sources speculating wildly new variant impact unhelpful, misleading, damaging. 99% speculation strongly slanted 'end days' viewpoint pretty irresponsible considering actually known right now.

? Remember reddditors talking using US military vaccinate people world. going happen, idea!  cautious governments fine. tremendous amount news articles media going evade immunity fear mongering general well. Thanks Well situations always complicated. I'm kinda glad live totalitarian state detain people without legal basis. actually think age groups backwards. younger people get vaccines first, mobile living ahead them. Old people at-risk, they‚Äôre getting children, grandchildren, care nurse, etc, would get from? logically back line. I'll add UK birthplace Alpha hear bitching much countries banning travel. 

SA government using travel ban classic ""foreigners bad"" deflect problems back home. news stations pronouncing ‚Äúnew‚Äù wrong?! New? Nu. New? Nu. constitution allow ""draconian"" measures, bars restaurants closing 7-8pm that's probably extreme thing 

restrictions crowds, events etc, seating areas/seating blocked off, early closure bars, pubs, restaurants lots mask use One country overreacting, plausible overreaction. seems global powers (who‚Äôve mostly downplaying pandemic restart economies) backpedaling - backpedaling really fast variant. conversation optimism shifted, fast, virtually everywhere. 

They must know truly suspect something don‚Äôt. 
 
Israel always step ahead fight Delta, sure.

But look total list covid strains. better, worse terms transmission/fatality rates. Keep years. safe  Israel shut borders hours. system suggested would take weeks best get running, especially poorer countries. answer level oversight cooperation experts countries outbreaks cannot feasibly hidden scientific community.

it's cold never cold repeatedly exposed 2 miraculously change it

just like malaria several times turn malaria malaria lite

(that's parasite think see point)

having flu several times change flu virus benign form flu

if need flu vaccine flu kill people anymore Hong Kong

Fuck me, chilling like 6 months, hope nothing happens this. Also, want get Omicron, we're gonna banned countries, sucks me. nothing new, measures already place alpha delta variants

But ago eased restrictions incoming workers students, undoing due Omicron 

Note nothing tourism that's still limits  borders.

Been pretty strict visitors.  since COVID RNA virus, worry mutating virus.

There theoretical concern could cause mutations DNA organisms humans -- usually leads cancer. However, chance small course treatment short benefits seen outweigh risks. ^^^THIS^^^

I would also add improvements vaccines, treatments PPE crucial.

It must clear **is** strategy going forward. sugarcoating, declarations victory. panic, either - simply is, New Normal.

Governments ungovernable seen fit make sure endemic = pandemic conditions foreseeable future. I'm congratulating them, yes, stupid game. win stupid prizes. ""experts add two weeks credible data variant's vaccine resistance.""

No one's surprised hospitals exploding.  problem I'm trying point determining effects health care system ones really matter anyway ones bogged that's 48 million.

that means there's still far many people also get incredibly ill contribute bogging healthcare system

that means there's still far many people also die it

you're trying defend position amorphous blob number even taking account numbers know wreaked absolute havoc entire world so... Stems compassion. Read article. Sounds extremely promising me. never going vaccinate way this. also fuel xenophobia racism.  weird. talk friends outside area, I‚Äôm like, what? People aren‚Äôt masking stores? recommended CVS. Drink 16 oz. water shot. could done secret one would ever know..... oh.......wait minute!   comparing Delta South Africa valid comparison since Delta never dominant strain South Africa. Vax? we're symptomatic? Severe?  30k cases day average got going right now. fyi pretty big deal. Even couple weeks days get us much closer new vaccine turns needed. keep seeing conflicting info:

1) vaccine less effective new variants altered spike proteins vaccine teaches immune system recognize spike protein.

2) vaccine produces T-cell response prevents severe disease death even variants.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* cold first time get it. exposure, perhaps couple exposures, cold. Again, virus changes, us.  specific?  Damn. Calling out. Cause whose one hitting copy paste comment? Never said nothing.  Sure, exact... tells us way 48 million. think subs copy copypasta tbh. already know amino acid substitutions b.1.351 (Beta) plus bunch one unknown impact.

Not exactly. amino acid substitution thinking position E484 RBD. Beta variant E484K mutation Omicron E484A. RBD original spike protein (used vaccines) Glutamate E484. Beta variant Lysine (K) E484. looks like Omicron variant Alanine (A) position. E484 position major target immune reaction receptor binding domain, seem part spike immune system strongest reactions against. SA 30 percent. get that, immune response still send antibodies catches issue. Given level mutation might slow able deal. 

As said, folks counting previous exposure instead getting vaccine provides antibodies t-cell response. 

So like example, chickenpox , example provide flu.  vaccination rule one shot. could gotten one waltzed restaurant 5 mins later. experience Manhattan check. said, random person‚Äôs vaccine card photo, presented confidently, wouldn‚Äôt surprised let in. Jerks gonna jerk. Overall, system works. Positivity rate city 1.6%, statewide average 3.5%, Buffalo upstate counties around 7-9% South Africa - 302 Billion dollar GDP afford vaccines. AstraZeneca approved vaccine US, probably want get new course anyway, case starts become relevant. Stop spreading misinformation. statement correct. give us total number population

please take math class sure what‚Äôs issue lock borders. Ironically think SA closed borders upon discovery variant protect others. like self-quarantine world scale.

The key message been: ‚Äúif sick, get help quarantine yourself‚Äù can‚Äôt countries new variants think way? There‚Äôs nothing them, sound policy. Don‚Äôt assume honest everything happens.  literally think hurts peoples chances getting vaccinated every single time says ‚Äúget shot‚Äù

Just like commercials tell people get shots, actually doesn‚Äôt good. I‚Äôm almost sure it‚Äôs hurting chances rather helping  enough data it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è people panicking proof do. could lower transmission rate 10x deadlier. keeping shit closed smart thing. Dr. Sickle says Moronic Variant might absolute spookiest. nothing slow spread potentially deadly virus ridiculous.

If anyone balls would sanctioned China hiding original virus control. Everyone Florida could die lockdown. Lockdowns never happen US even airborne ebola. major step pointless since there's simply nowhere go 98-99% overall effectiveness vaccine booster. remaining couple percent likely immunocompromised vaccine failures (theoretically possible injected outside muscle).  take subways routinely. Mask compliance consistently near 100% trains. 90% platforms. One dose mRNA vaccine J&amp;J provides excellent protection infection severe disease. reason make regimen that‚Äôs FDA EUA CDC authorize. question. Omicron strain proves much milder symptoms, would best encourage strain become dominant harmful ones? Kind like selective breeding. 
 
I mean, either way we‚Äôre stuck covid exposure milder form virus pretty much like traditional vaccines. mortality rate likely higher vaccine, it‚Äôd job ‚Äúvaccinating‚Äù antivaxxers, lower risk profile high risk. 
 
Idk, I‚Äôm doctor epidemiologist whatever, I‚Äôm quite prepared wrong number fundamental levels, obvious someone works field (so go easy me). thought contagious ‚Äúvaccine‚Äù would appear circumvent whole problem vaccinations. Though I‚Äôm guessing vaccine manufacturers wouldn‚Äôt happy that. 
 
Oh perhaps omicron isn‚Äôt right strain, could applied future strain even lower risk profile. 
 
Lastly, everyone wants to, could still get vaccinated. Governments wouldn‚Äôt push issue hard.  
 
Thoughts? ""Hear Mr. President, fight virus, virus!!"" however act 3 movies go ü§£ lady airline desk foreign country literally looks make sure name says ""covid test."" information testing center asks guess Japan kinds lax far covid restrictions go? Tbf South America worst parts America. South America. Got Pfizer three shots. side effects except minor soreness injection site. underarm soreness (also minor) day booster lymph node swollen, apparently side effect common booster shot first two doses. think birthers. self-selecting isolate difficult unless one independently wealthy / means go indefinite amount time (weeks/months) without income? That's thought year ago. guess know cost/availability PCR like India, US readily available 100% free places (either covered insurance, government programs). inconvenience/discomfort test, 8 year old test done responded ""that's it?"" seems ridiculous fake that. even ill-informed excuse like vaccination does. whole excuse would ""I want q-tip slightly nose"" Yeah. Even delay weeks might help us understand new variant functionally different.

Every time slow spread buys time. Maybe/probably spread North America, little premature it? anywhere started administering Novavaxs original vaccine? That's quite disappointment strong results taking long move trial completion regulatory submission. wishing going suddenly turn cold make so. fact covid behaved opposite manner


so I'm going ask getting information basis, mean factual basis, making original statement?

If omicron-specific booster turns necessary (which won‚Äôt known weeks) earliest would available quantity would March, late help winter‚Äôs surge. also may turn current booster produces high enough level NAb protect omicron. We‚Äôll know weeks- change need getting booster now. Reluctantly crouched starting line.. exist, planet, enough highly specialized filters Pfizer Moderna max production capabilities

This problem unique market capitalism lack centralized planning time crisis. Production country Germany United States could easily redirected toward critical end creating enough highly-specialized filters. production facilities don‚Äôt exist, could built. specialized employees don‚Äôt exist, reallocated less critical industries trained speed.

Nothing even remotely resembling sort effort happened United States because, well, that‚Äôs big government socialism. **the market capacity respond international humanitarian crisis**, domestic international capacity address crisis hamstrung extent market priorities (namely profit) privileged expense making vaccines saving lives. 

The United States 800,000 people dead virus stock market all-time highs. reflection priority profit human life typical American extreme. patent lifted profit reasons, like medical patents within profit-first system, lives lost maximum unless dissonance least somewhat addressed. issue vaccines Africa merely reflection fact that, market capitalist system, minimal resources mobilized toward unprofitable ends saving lives poor African residents. Dang that‚Äôs slightly better Russia.  permanently ofcourse, temporary closures specific borders would likely legal. I.e. air travel .

 Also rate limiting would legal mandatory quarantine 14 days Australia citizens last year.

Even legal court say so, takes time. government even illegal things political will. Inflows (eating) - outflows (calories burned) + change storage(fat stores) = 0

First law thermodynamics. link read that? wonder could go get booster too. Last dose 3 months ago. (I'm US) county fast ban India well, see issue things studied. sucks Africa sucked India it‚Äôs going suck happens country too. Wildly untrue. mean point wouldn‚Äôt require lockdowns could go back normal everyone got vaccinated really don‚Äôt give many shits point. anti vaccine person dies helps reduce surplus population levels. USA. vaccination rate much better SA states sequencing enough even catch whether mutations variants emerging here. 

Is way worldwide blanket travel procedure variants emerge (such quarantine funded countries - poorer countries feel pressure rule others). giving turnaround time much credit. supply chain alone plus demand plus priority elderly rich people... gonna 2 months Same.

It‚Äôs nonsensical. It‚Äôs masks don‚Äôt help, vacuum do, real life, reward vs hassle mostly worth it. vaccinated boosted, it‚Äôs nothing useless annoyance. 

We need way mask mandates ASAP. Whose stance? disputing whether air travel safe unsafe. commenting fact drawing bunch conclusions article, really can't information given. society wanting cautious. lives countless young people across world completely disrupted close two years. point cost benefit reassess risk appetite actually  Dont even try argue people here, crazy people downvotes disobeying Rule 5, Keep information quality high. world far tell, started 8th month.

Literally said, read past headlines. started procedures, long, let anyone in.

Its 2 years since let outsider in. Literally country world this. definition ""open"" since started.

By realized said wrong arguing internet can't accept it.

So I'll help simply mute thread go day.

Have nice day. problem optimistic side news pessimists always ""well better assume worst cautious"" argument back pocket... true extent discount negatives come along fear mongering jumping worst case scenarios including economic, mental health, etc. scientific community's consensus point wastewater surveillance provides leading indicator? single google search returns multiple studies corroborating this, know offhand peer-reviewed.

.... because, jesus fucking christ... data set alarming.  would push timeline discovery back, exactly much hard guess, South Africa uploads samples GISAID would trivial trace back. would also look weird samples new strain one noticed it, there‚Äôs also chance someone else looking data reports identified another country. current stance air travel safe planes contribute transmission, okay, you. higher mortality due vaccine waning omicron?  run travel media business, covid fucking devastating me.

I‚Äôve traveled internationally lot since, easy. would take testing vax requirements paperwork huge amounts extra work could get masks. Goddamn hate much Can't afford good ones, there's definitely lawyers around. ymmv day feeling crappy, day feeling better, fine. I'm curious percentage people admitted vaccinated. Thus far mild asymptomatic vaccinated people I've read. could gotten together people someone house Another side effect nurses left ones somehow dont see Covid something worried about.

I visiting grandpa hospital month ago nurse going check protocol. asked vaccinated said vaccinated April I'd getting booster later week replied 'oh, trust that?' ""Governments irresponsible"" necessarily sentiment across globe, level certainly compare US. speak someone lived Taiwan US.

In Taiwan, people always ""trust"" government either. short (6?) years ago, massive number protestors occupied congress forced then-ruling KMT party withdraw opening certain Taiwanese industries Chinese investments. mention because, short years later, Taiwanese people much approve support current government's response pandemic, hard closure border mandatory 14-day entry quarantine (in designated hotels) cell phone tracking.

Personally think that's healthier attitude towards government kind animosity towards US. Criticize appropriate, assuming anything government touches turns shit unhelpful counterproductive. certain things best handled government (health insurance, military, foreign policy), even inefficiently. people elect officials support view government functions, expect demand job. May less effective vaccine vaccines available convincing people vaccinated two different things. ‚ÄúEarlier year [vaccine] programme [in South Africa] slowed insufficient doses. deliveries delayed due oversupply, making country outlier continent still starved vaccines.‚Äù

Lack vaccines definitely part problem African continent, vaccine hesitancy. would trust common sense precautions SILENCE experts know nothing yet. would say insurance companies stop covering unvaccinated let‚Äôs real, they‚Äôll keep coming, refuse pay, hospitals left bill. guy sent SWAT team someone accused fudging numbers 'the countries lowest numbers"", he?

Ok, buy that. first saw transformers braid read Unicron like yep we‚Äôre fucked.  South Africa too: [South African doctor raised alarm omicron variant says symptoms ‚Äòunusual still common, much less likely disease make jump animal human, disease already endemic humans simply infect another human. 

I think already made point another comment thread, issue SARS-NCoV-2 targets ACE-2 receptor gain entry infect cells. Since ACE-2 receptor morphologically similar across Mammal species well reptiles, amphibians, birds, able spill wide range species easily jump easily.

The issue what's known- SARS-2 virus capabilities infect wide range animals, yet unknown- coronaviruses species spreading within might interact SARS-2 virus one individual animal infected Covid yet unknown animal coronavirus two viruses swap genes replicating coinfected cell. 

There's potential viable yet unknown coronavirus infects certain birds lets say... Utah, picks genes SARS-2 give potential spill-over humans like SARS-2 sometime 2019. animal coronavirus might cause much visible symptoms Utah birds, could become severe highly infectious virus spills humans. Fun fact, 97% obese people try lose weight inevitably fail, gain back within year. sure ""Stop obese"" totally great advice, amazing solved obesity problem simple way. South Africa first place admit new strain exists there. unfortunately political issue countries announcing existence new strain, goes back ""Spanish flu"" early 1900s. time new strain ""discovered"" everywhere. isolating ""banning"" people traveling certain country lost cause, especially travel bans US example, ban people coming countries - apply US citizens, still stravel freely however want. South Africa silence scientists genetic sequencing? don‚Äôt think anyone would notice suddenly stopped uploading samples GISAID? fake whole sequences? % hospitalizations vaccinated? Wow. Dumb Google. Thanks Canadian dude. irrelevant inevitable pretty much going everywhere. Best thing mental health. statewide percentage population taking test figure? opinion lockdowns restrictions? already agreed can't close borders starve millions people depend tourism can't lockdowns starve billions people need go work right? people still favour nonsense measures? Yes, know COVID recedes let 21,000 people die. Hopefully international community learn pandemic page. Lord knows may one much worse covid future. What‚Äôs testing like Florida? Correct honest. Even today beloved coronavirus subreddit upvotes headlines non factual disproved salvitate towards. 

You love it. feed it. want pedestal screaming right everyone else isn't. want every media consume back point to. superior! wrong enough data things changed never actually wrong others right. must savior! Way early say. hasn‚Äôt even week. currently available vaccines may still offer enough protection it, don‚Äôt know yet. 

Remember also talk reformulating vaccines Delta variant ‚Äî never actually happened turned current vaccines already good enough. 

Also, let‚Äôs see much threat Omicron isn‚Äôt 3-4 months. skipped Xi Nu went straight Omicron‚Ä¶. Wonder why‚Ä¶ Omicron 30 new mutations. current vaccines shit. lie, estate sales tell truth. whose information ""good""? Yours? Critical healthcare people put danger Covid exposes abusive corporate staffing wage policies causing staffing shortages skilled medical personnel page consistent? kind craziness drinking there?

I know real ?

Why dont go war something... like world war fix entire situation /s students month.

As far tell, started 8th athletes coaches. tourists.

From every country. Literally 10's 1000s japanese residents.

From every country.

Literally open every country, everyone them. Nah think current hodge podge approach great. /s Literally 1 person alone said that, provided zero data back up.

It seems like pouring oil waves effort calm storm. political push stop countries banning travel. wild literally said exact comment, word word, Delta 7 months ago. 

The reality enough information know. Personally, fact concern variant indicative good thing. variants like Mu get nearly much legitimate attention. think everything published yet, something going makes concern. guess done try reduce risks winter months period healthcare system typically struggles even normal times. acknowledge masks work reduce spread also acknowledging highly vaccinated populations change cost-benefit ratio terms individual compliance policymaking.

This makes sense. think everybody does, makes sense. #1 point also needed (although many studies mask wearing, definitely use many more).

But conflate 'wear mask' mask mandates ... two different things (and threshold mandates higher; people wearing masks even without mandate). 

I also think answer nuanced, like bunch papers actual recommendations :). Vaccination rates variable. infection/hospitalization rates (if hospitals overflowing, almost risk decrease worth it), would wear/mandate masks etc love Dodge Ball reference. Hmmm think Australia New Zealand would tend disagree  excellent point. ‚ÄúIf omicron turns significantly transmissible, hospitals going slammed worse already are‚Äù. 

I asked transmissible relates severe disease. 

You said didn‚Äôt know. 

If don‚Äôt know say hospitals slammed already it‚Äôs transmissible? Got Moderna booster 2 Pfizer doses. side effects similar dose 2 Pfizer different Moderna booster. they're really interested pretending air travel safe, would ever admit 60/600 passengers tested positive covid? *Use brain second*, would (or anyone else) think confined space 1 10 people covid positive safe? amount ""but filters"" going convince people safe.

You're jumping conclusions related health minister wrote. specifically stated infections *so-far found*, linked passenger's. says nothing air travel safety, never denied people could test positive coming days (hence quarantine applies passengers SA). 

The article/update really specific this, seeing written *further analysis* found cases linked, pretty much implies researchers ran virus' genetics order verify different enough come single/couple superspreaders. No, can't stand mask anymore! 2 years, almost lost wife cause quarantine, got Covid-19, got vaccine, destroyed skin hands washing hands like moron, bloody can't see shit everytime I'm cold place enter building cause I'm wearing glasses. STF. allowed ask anything! Capich? got booster, knocked flat two days. Like first one, I'm basically 100% better now, know opinion counts nil compared vulnerable people, damn, else around would annoyed get omicron booster two months third shot? Wow great visualizations thank you! You‚Äôre fortunate. Unfortunately us live areas isn‚Äôt case. course [travel bans claim work even pass smell test.  fuck, that's scary  hmmm... seem like mild symptoms Forgive something lost translation here, seem anything update suggest news provided make air travel seem safe. rather indicate fact fourteen people coming (apparently) sorts different neighborhoods activities levels risk, boarding two different cities, infected prior boarding rather happening due one person infected serving super spreader context. tells us situation ground South Africa conditions KLM flights.

That said, personally convinced good idea treat passengers tested negative Schipol though they're fine, given omicron cases we've seen seem rather long incubation period virus remains undetectable. people got infected two flights (if did) might position trigger positive. injunction shall effect ‚Äúper se‚Äù deferral vaccination available pregnant students San Diego Unified School District‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccination mandate,‚Äù Judges Berzon Bennett said court documents. ‚ÄúThe injunction shall terminate upon removal ‚Äúper se‚Äù deferral option pregnant students.‚Äù

Good; seems easy, science based solution this. Politicians need pretend they're something appease d00 mers destroy economy piss Covid d3 niers.  surprised. grew San Diego. It‚Äôs extremely conservative city, siding imaginary sky daddy beliefs fitting. *actually* pregnant getting exemption something potentially affect health fetus different pretending like imaginary friend doesn‚Äôt like science therefore shouldn‚Äôt get vaccine. San Diego shithole joke. person's ""we know yet"" Omicron. Saying vaccines still effective Delta addressing person said. Looks like data still backdated last week. Today though, hospitalizations past 3 weeks Gauteng Ugh. breezy time initial two shots Pfizer, Moderna booster got last night (including flu shot) absolutely walloping ass. Fever, chills, absolutely pounding headache, arms aching. It‚Äôs worth course, long expect suffer? ask transmissible. indications is, however. That's said said. Go back read.   3 slides actually, reason page started defaulting 3rd slide today... 

Click left arrow beneath chart slide 1, apply Gauteng filter. set go back, new variant want to‚Ä¶ imagine throwing leadership/HR send everyone back? place work remained silent. 

I think addressed, it‚Äôs fluid know they‚Äôre tough spot‚Ä¶ remember seeing severe vaccinared patients number cases, deaths, hospitalizations remaining low indicates symptomatic infection -- especially bad outcomes -- quite rare (at least first glance).  Dont get got much hate...

Did like read comments? pretty obvious he's getting hate.

Even comment exactly kind. ""Stop obese"" way oversimplifies makes obvious he's kind jabs alone wont make it.

Disagree. We'd make simple stuff (jabs masks) actually got everyone vaccinated. Problem is, still loads vaccinated. Pregnant women high risk covid Another burden unvaccinated imposing society. drag everyone choices. ""The emergence Omicron variant coronavirus South Africa driven sharp increase Covid-19 hospitalizations country‚Äôs hot-spot province past two weeks, although fewer patients treated severe disease previous surges,""

That sound like mild symptoms me.
Also, knows many people got infected symptoms. Probably shitload PCR-testing two flights gives 10% positivity rate.
We'll know next weeks. I'm amazed actually know day, take long find out. hospitals can't keep flood patients, still problem regardless whether rate hospitalizations pe case count stays steady goes up. goes up, make bad problem even worse. Honestly, would get shot every month meant never wear mask again. No, mean, agree saying suggested reasonable makes sense. really opposite. Pregnancy high risk factor COVID, meanwhile evidence vaccine safe pregnancy keeps ‚ÄúIt horrifying watch young, healthy women able breathe babies lose oxygen levels,‚Äù said Dr. Linda Eckert, professor obstetrics gynecology University Washington. ‚ÄúIf people want fear, fear Obstetricians know threat real-life consequences. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs simply devastating watch family take baby home without mother know could prevented,‚Äù said Swamy, noting nearly every physician working major medical center witnessed pregnant patient die COVID-19. serious, C19 feels worthwhile eradicating like can't - problem think painful worth, acting short sighted manner. Variants keep popping up, ever quickly, time cause serious disruptions, loss life erosion quality life many. tired C19, give easily. human virus transfers animals likely less adept infect humans jumps back. 

In fact, viruses attenuated vaccines: they‚Äôre introduced chicken cells cells another animal, evolve infect better, therefore see worse infecting humans. still stimulate immunity injected humans. 

A new virus jumps species first time, time adapt spread rapidly species, encountering prior immunity, could become virulent. 

But stage SARS-CoV-2 going become bigger threat animals. It‚Äôs already endemic humans going evolve there. mostly discussing Delta, added emphasis continuing evaluate test reliability variants. always state level choice anyway. that's like saying plan cutting pay governors can't figure stop spreading misinformation. really think entered country get rid Omnicron? bought time; already locally transmitted. One person infect like seven people. think discomfort wearing mask pretty negligible relative potential benefit? get they're magical solution lot people think are, help stop spread potentially deadly disease small way, I'm happy endure discomfort that. they're comfortable either. red marks face wearing work time. overall seems like pretty small issue fr? vaccinated set back Florida pretty low bar though. That's first thing came mind instant close borders never nothing. South Africans view unvaccinated status symbol pride. Previously blamed government slow obtaining vaccines compared rest world. vaccines readily available bothered behave like spoilt children.Coming sorts excuses get vaccinated. That‚Äôs tough. never super close extended family, trump anti-vaxxers I‚Äôve basically cut aunts, uncles cousins.

Best luck mom though! Moms still change, mom mostly apolitical life, voted gay marriage back 2008 church told become quite raging lib full belief universal health care, abortion rights, saving environment. even phone banked goergia run election back January, first time volunteering campaign ever, age 70.

Ps. always use parental controls block foxnews tv‚Ä¶.  Well science would say 1 test enough, country going trust another country testing. double testing ensures proper balance. Look going away, deal omni yet another another. reason virus mutate evolve fast. fact print replacement vaccine boosters insane, also night. need front line mitigation slowdown curbs covid strains. covid delta flew .... much different local person store.... fly yet seen variation..... boom big issue... sequences needs rapid fire. flying country sequence avg big... magical new flight gets treatment.... fact life  ""Simple easy.""

It's used lot different ways, think appropriate ok vaccinated individuals getting priority care unvaccinated?

Me? Sure. Fortunately I'm one makes decisions I'm little overly vindictive. taken Hippocratic oath? No, they're okay it. opinion lot relevant ok non obese individuals getting priority care obese?

Me? No. I'm aware difficult change lifestyle many obese/overweight people habits set childhood expecting change year two realistic. Well hopefully WFH option many people move city since work someplace half housing costs halfway decent internet. could finally create bit housing glut.  think worst part nobody knows thing stop silly speculation. brings doomcallers, dismissive crowd everyone else opinion.

It's really fault guess, probably step away media let things sort curious side wants stay informed. Got booster morning. Im playing stuff.   Maybe‚Ä¶we don‚Äôt know yet  get data giant-ass spreadsheet? Clicking Gauteng shows 862 currently admitted, right?

How many daily admissions would say last week Covid Gauteng (and how'd figure out)? Well, that's never going happen, let's panic instead Certificate expired!  it‚Äôs way way way widespread detected then? Yup, unvaccinated damn selfish. Yet, point, there‚Äôs getting them. It‚Äôs sunk cost fallacy. vaccinate now, think proves wrong time. - are. one pro-vaccine shame finally getting it. We‚Äôd thank them. nothing else tends indicate Omicron least mild previous strains. Dang, kinda hoping would be, considering governments moving quickly it‚Äôs looking good. increase took two weeks too! want vaccine, I've every vaccine offered entire life covid one. Two close friends suffered strange heart problems several weeks first jabs. Ones female police officer, blue collar worker plastering. One wear 24/7 heart monitor check heart patterns collapsed walk boyfriend.

I'm scared taking it, heart problems caused vaccine understated? dealing cancer diagnosis year I'm terrified making things potentially worse health. friends 25/26... Like ones linked well office answered signing 15 year lease facilities said don‚Äôt know make office workers integrated home‚Ä¶.

Like seriously dumbass, call desk zoom like do. Yes, trust anything right. comment referred federal level. There's funding Congress like last time, state pull anyway. read article small number current Covid-19 cases South Africa  
have confirmed Omicron genomic sequencing,  
surefire way determine variant caused infection. Omicron  
shows differently variants one widely used  
polymerase chain reaction, PCR, tests, making easier track.  
Based method, South African experts say vast majority  
recent cases Gauteng appear caused Omicron. anyone know yet exactly dangerous Omicron actually is? reading sorts conflicting stuff. That‚Äôs quite reasonable approach. milder Delta, would cause amount damage it, especially 'at minimum'? make sense sound like puppet. high concentration cases there. might nearby though, like Botswana. Honestly, there's point. Even federal decision, enough people would listen effective.

Not enough country cares enough harm reduction measures effective. Rs strong point say we're like security theater. would nice though, working hard make things worse.

A message 'we're going force anything you, really wear mask, get shots try reduce exposure' would helpful. But, late now. need Vax fly? Even delay would help, people get vaccinated meantime. Especially time would take get omicron-specific vaccine approved distributed. caught South Africa plane, even allowed fly? 61 caught test flight? find hard believe.    I‚Äôm pretending that. absolutely is.   worth bearing mind plenty severe cases start mild cases. prevent coming in? variant already enter country make country immediately doomed. vaccinated gets infected Omnicron mean pointless get vaccine... want go pointing slippery-slope fallacy? makes paella tension. China, centralized economy still cannot produce filters nationalistic dick waving. Fosun plant still online, largely seems China wants use ""Chinese"" vaccine.

Let's pretend centralized non-market economies particularly good coming better solutions. fail different ways.  much hoping would less virulent Vaccinated here, new variant reinfect unvaccinated again, setting us back months.
I right, we‚Äôll never get back even semi-normalcy. Okay, yeah, productive hobbies exercised lot months 2020 state restricted non-grocery store/gas station economic activity whatever, pretend like anything luxury reserved upper-middle class delusional. Yep, basically looks variant least severe Delta potentially contagious and/or resistant vaccines. 

If confirmed literally nightmare. Sorry I've met quite doctors whose grip logical thinking suspect best. Lots memorization become doctor. Lawyers whole seem think bit better. wish could family turned staunch anti vaxxers thanks steady diet Fox Newsmax. mostly care mom 57 wholeheartedly believes vaccine dangerous. we've lucky get Covid yet worry sick unvaccinated every day. like truly makes fucking sick knowing day could get even everything ""right"" end ER dead. I'd like know percentage hospitalized cases young, though. Omicron contagious still dangerous Delta, increases hospitalizations age groups. It‚Äôs V BAD assumptions... questioning. every ""sceptic"" question answered sort teach lesson.

Think fair ask ? South Africa Delta wave, Omikron replacing Delta moment. bit concerning many countries taking variant seriously quickly. happen previous variants know don't?

Some thoughts Japan general - absolutely loathe countries allowing Japanese citizens travel, Japan give reciprocity. countries allow this? Sorry think there's much useful info learned sharing half remembered anecdotes day old cases. accurate surge began month ago. hahahahaha. imagine australia ever past 2 years. infectious less harmful... good? live global economy community. travel ban extremely impactful anyone relies travel conduct business see family.

I family spread around globe constant cycle knee jerk reaction panic made last couple years absolutely unmanageable times. None helped, simply made another thing deal with. definitely know you. think trying mislead; explicitly said worried mildness seeing would apply older patients. people left part out. Nobody stated Mr.Winters.

Thats interpretation. 
And biased seems. South Africa actually put hold receiving vaccines surplus have. We're actually number one global provider vaccine sure 'call start sharing' comes in. Maybe call educate explain vaccine better needed? harm good. stupid political move, tells citizens 'oh, we're taking action to' total bullshit creates false sense security. viewpoint shared many medical experts scientists. citizens individual countries assume already take proper precautions.  also highlights benefit vaccinated relying treatment monoclonal antibodies: antibodies made body, even binding strongly new variant old, still induce immune response adapt antibodies better bind new strain. doubt know much made public. Closing borders mostly way say ‚Äúlook we‚Äôre something it‚Äù pisses people countries don‚Äôt vote you.

If saw announcements emergency measures like new lockdowns domestically politically painful you‚Äôd know scared. number people entering Japan overseas always mostly Japanese people, new restrictions anything prevent bringing omicron country. government Japan also limited limits place rights citizens. can't force hotels quarantine. 

By contrast, number foreign students workers entering Japan always small, easy impose whatever restrictions like - tell go straight airport van hotel, there's much do. Well, theory, understand it, variant many mutations likely result single patient unable clear Covid infection long time, transmitted others.

Not sure modulates likelihood related South Africa surrounding countries, number sequenced cases South Africa would seem indicate there's community transmission there. Whether that's result low vaccine uptake, super-spreader event, actual origination there, seems currently unclear.

Given people saying cases Omicron may go back September, we'll probably never know. Pick battles carefully.

Evidence vaccine safety effectiveness extremely clear - demonstrated blinded randomized controlled trial gold standard demonstrating effectiveness.

Evidence mask effectiveness lot murkier. one, can't blinded trial masks!  Probably best mask RCT shows small effect; best arguments mask use based arguably low cost wearing rather unambiguously measurable benefit. Paywall‚Ä¶ Pfizer's data readout age 2-4 vaccine study comes year planned, FDA CDC accelerate processes authorization.

Being platform vax production/infrastructure place I'm assuming process much faster. Even ignoring waning, 3rd shots give much protection even severe disease (like 80%+ reduction deaths 70yo+) 2nd shots peak protection. 3rd shots called boosters, considered 3rd shot series.  Buy primary think, track omicron PCR signal.  although similar trend occurred third wave delta dominant

That's article. laws designed make things difficult. Thank mandatory. would allow others err side feel best without told do.

You pro vaccine also wanting mandatory. That's big step know... actually thinking vaccines work understanding risk free. know floor buffers drive around mall make floor shiny? They're one except mall cops drive bad guys it. Yeah, sending second grader back school unvaccinated Delta surge getting started state back August pure hell. thought zero chance would make Christmas without bringing COVID home. GLAD gets second dose Saturday. sure hope find vaccines slow variant too. 

I say though, invested expensive KF94 masks (so could sure weren‚Äòt fake) bought air purifier classroom and‚Ä¶ far good. Knocking wood. hate high-quality masks kids air purifiers school expensive. Every kid sitting classroom sharing air others access them. know people like that, believe lockdowns restrictions last virus eradicated government print money offset stalling virtually economic activity.

It sounds extremely unrealistic, IMO. Companies really need educate managers effectively manage remote/hybrid organization absolutely clue it. hand, plenty orgs functioned perfectly fine 100% remote pandemic totally possible well. I‚Äôm assuming vast majority hospitalized unvaccinated? don‚Äôt want way minimize sudden rise, feel like it‚Äôs important part equation. many times I've played plague Inc happened WAY earlier!!! killing host undesired side effect evolutionary standpoint.

But covid kills host long protracted battle, long immune system would normally dealt it. killing host puts real evolutionary pressure virus. least we're lot better prepared now. 

Everyone needs remember... Jan 2020 covid first came had:

\~0 tests available.

0% population immunity

0 Mask wearing (in parts world)

0 understanding virus

0 vaccines

0 vaccine production/distribution infrastructure

0 treatments/antivirals. Under-30 men (not everyone) high chance myocarditis. seem drop 25-30 group, much lower 30-35 group. age nearly professional athletes retire, may unsurprising. Using 30 ""hard"" cutoff obviously arbitrary (versus 31, say).

Young people simply need big doses. 30 microgram dose already far needed get huge level immune response immunity. Delta won't, ask omicron. ""Baby"" pretty generic term - definition exact age refers.

Generally ""infant"" refers someone 0 12 months old, ""toddler"" refers someone 12 36 months old. little defined ""baby"", even technical terms vary depending ask. Especially previously effective treatments like Monoclonal Antibodies, etc, work poorly all. Damn! Children getting sick (or sicker) adults goes long way explaining global panic omicron causing.

The ""best"" thing COVID far largely spared children. Things different variant sickens kills kids. truly hope case, course really know couple weeks least, scary.  Cause politics? coworker went Japan US last week business. said part increased rate admissions may reflect extra precaution part parents given new concern mutation. pediatric report due later week provide information.

Is RSV outbreak South Africa? know it‚Äôs caused havoc young children parts world year immunity built last year. Time tell it‚Äôs covid extra cautious parents. both, guess‚Ä¶ entire premise post assumes reinfections, infections vaccinated people. things know happen. majority adult population boosted and, know, quite susceptible infection. people infected vaccinated previously infected much less likely severe disease. shit, opened way soon  Olympics 5 months ago.  respected member community says mild already has. stories travelers South Africa (e.g., KLM passengers Belenenses football player) infected Omicron variant apparent travel history Gauteng. Literally thing Japan year. Maybe already happened. guys don‚Äôt know. wait month?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* South African medical association chair called nothing burger. I'm worried all! Yes, many industry workers basically call times. also friend working food distribution he's averaging 70+ hours week often without single day multiple weeks row. Plenty people supply chain side things issue since pandemic started.

I'm pro vax boosted, coming point privilege assume people actually get reliable days off. indeed are. Confusing title.   Honestly build field hospitals let unvaccinated catch once. Neither vaccinated unvaccinated going thank anyone public health right thing here.   measure that? ? alternative thousands deaths abundance evidence vaccines safe least safer actual virus, im gonna go trusting FDA this. FDA operated humans. Humans allowed wrong while.

Again, alternative?  Literally foreign travel banned. matter country, matter method transportation. Money reason this. Money lives. Every country banned travel day one pandemic. people need rebel recent obligation. directives vaccinate, wear mask, wash hands, continuously tug underwear, perhaps could focused attention ""born rebels"", compromise one point, let call victory, less pandemic daily lives.  said part increased rate admissions may reflect extra precaution part parents given new concern mutation. pediatric report due later week provide information.
‚ÄúPeople likely admit children precaution treat home something go wrong -- especially young children higher proportion death,‚Äù Omicron says stated vax priority non vax. 

That line. asked detail line became broken Wish also balls draw conclusions sample size 7 like South African doctor Yes! 3 year old lived half life pandemic. frustrated vaccines available yet. area 50% vaccinated, choices keep home put risk since can't rely others eligible vaccine help protect her. 
With omicron coming, really upset inability vaccinated.

Is preliminary info pediatric trials? dose using 2-4 year old group? less 5-11 group? That‚Äôs like asking put seatbelt idea serious injury be, lol World take every Christmas season going hear this? Get asap (2 weeks travel want it, 1 week minimum) wear mask protect others flu. really bad, need take seriously Honestly think current uncertainties right now, omicron-fueled surge one pretty safely assume given. see random near vertical spike midst ever receding Delta wave, region variant sequenced dominant, would make sense otherwise.

What know yet whether due increased contagiousness, increase immune escape, less problematic effects. ever sticks idk gets special treatment

It turns bullshit way every conversation have, promise whoever talking everything want, claim genius, people agree regardless facts.

Trump walking talking social engineering problem.  Likely mildly symptomatic would go clinic. allegedly first ring alarm bell though possible different variant? Moderate/Severe cases disappointing say least many think Monoclonal Antibodies Treatment treatments may work well all. Sigh hoping March April Japan holiday 2022... looks like happen.  Like forcing mandatory vaccines fully fully FDA approved? Like erring side caution? like FDA ever wrong...   Given region 90% PCRs S-gene target failures, seems likely driven Omicron Delta. 

There lot theoretical reasons believe variant highly transmissible somewhat vaccine evasive (especially antibodies, probably much T/B-cells help prevent severe disease). 

This mean sky falling. worth monitoring. doctor said doctors treat people scientists mathematicians treat pandemics. home doctor life puts huge risk dunning Kruger. Lots ancedotes. There‚Äôs chance omicron Goldilocks Covid, high transmissibility low virulence‚Äîthe predictable result viral evolutionary selective pressures. 

Meaning, there‚Äôs chance vaccinated individuals breakthrough case doesn‚Äôt matter version gentle. 

If case could effectively infect 1/3rd whole world nobody would really notice la 2009 swine flu. assume that‚Ä¶? vaccination rate much lower developed world even significant immune evasion, vaccines still likely prevent severe outcomes via cellular immunity. Yeah, that's story....

They stayed ""highly secured"" hotel. security guards front desk (no police obviously) authority keep anyone inside. alert mayor, give special order detain two idiots. already plane. almost left, probably would detained Spain, fact got far shows enforcement NL farce. company wants everyone office days week point strong suggestion. many people want come in. asked company thinking incentives get people summarily dismissed. going days week affect curious see try get everyone come back. management thinks benefits company willing put place incentives. way shift blame US Healthcare' poorly run system onto workers. Hospital admin loves using nurses scapegoats. get thrown bus time malpractice lawsuits. ‚Äúweekend‚Äù could stand-in someone days row. Whether Mon - Wed Fri - Sun, point mainly cannot afford days off, may ways strategically schedule booster. highly deadly waited would late. serious question? never played video game consequences screwing many lost hours time? always play safe stakes large enough. never drew lines, mate. sure about.

(Well, mean, did, admitted one draw lines fault mine wanting draw first line)   Let's also keep mind less 23 percent entire population fully vaccinated. still need alot info severity, hospitalizations increasing country sub par vaccination rates best indicator. Literally. Within last weeks think. Wow indeed. problem sitting driver seat. exactly risk ignoring advice CDC health experts. lack empathy astonishing. thing outside country go war South Africa force everyone get vaccinated choose death gunshot

Something completely question would travel policies dependent % population vaccinated. enough world enacts policies like these, could help put vaccine-hesitant countries' government feet fire.

At point, countries world decent access vaccines. Yawn... stop poor they‚Äôre it.  /r/unexpectedbillwurtz entered grad school Tokyo fall scholarship. school originally adamant paying arrived Japan would cancel wasn‚Äôt March. didn‚Äôt think much since optimistic border situation.

US thinking lay next April bonuses due. This^^^  patients shop around Obviously scientists wanna scare guys that's direct be. conclusive research gonna happen probably 1 year omnicron probably kills million folks. Sounds like general discussion thread here, too. Nobody *says* 10% SA Covid positive, about? wife‚Äôs hospital unit doesn‚Äôt deal COVID patients travelers core staff. Hospitals treating nurses like shit. 

The reason go hospital nursing care required. entire point hospital. keep shitting see happens. China implemented, continues implement measures combat covid countries world half assed pandemic. source? lupus?  % sequenced metric measure things though. 

I'm virologist epidemiologist, I've heard several podcasts say NGS-SA top tier operation. story much rather hear.

People able pull go best compensated time needed most.

But understand difficulty prospect. I'm glad right thing yourself. one stay hospital years ago, stunned much work nurses did. Dr. would breeze 10 minutes (at most) morning rounds nurses took care rest 23 hours 50 minutes day. day discharged, came back gave gift basket flowers, candy, gift cards. grateful small gesture....I remember thinking people paid appreciated enough, sure.... Yup, hospitalizations fairly poor metric general, hospitals going send sick toddler home without damn sure fine. Combine fact parents scared overly cautious surprising number high. Yeah -Wish hadnt gone. gave Tylenol IV fluids monitored while. dont mind asking resting heart rate? variant already worldwide. Africa may 2-3 weeks ahead everywhere else. ‚Äúfewer patients treated severe disease previous surges, country‚Äôs National Institute Communicable Diseases said.‚Äú Yep let's ban people need hospitalization hospitals. know reopened borders. never end. ‚Äúfewer patients treated severe disease previous surges, country‚Äôs National Institute Communicable Diseases said.‚Äú Maybe Japanese passport. imagine alone would make things difficult. also abundance elderly nursing homes.   Thanks. I'm extremely careful. Lots dunces here. state sub probably mostly still whining put mask.  data collected yet 12 million region numbers scary yet, growth bit terrififying I‚Äôd take people wearing mask point‚Ä¶ yes agree. think so. Flu hospitalizations actually great burden healthcare capacity, US report 200,000-800,000 hospitalizations per year. plan surgery room closures around flu seasons, manageable flu seasons quite predictable work things advance. new variant spread fast cause high amount hospitalizations system already overloading burnt out, problems different numbers. Sadly, disinformation machine also time prep there's plenty nonsense getting pumped right now.  company work rapidly expanding. hiring, enough room everyone offices.

Hybrid schedules introduced: 2 days + 3 days out, 3 days + 2 days out. Along always home, always office. Roughly even split people among 4 voluntary categories. People suggest quit, idea job market looks like reality.

Just claim number people claiming unemployment lowest since pandemic, that‚Äôs benefits ended, people would rather blow brains going good job they‚Äôve 5-10 years, making $10 hour Wendy‚Äôs.

My job absolutely sucks, I‚Äôve office every day since July 2020, watched 40% coworkers systematically eliminated rest us picking work.

Of course quit, didn‚Äôt get degree delivering food college kids, I‚Äôm stuck start car garage one day I've read surplus vaccines, lots people refusing take them. It‚Äôs always going mutate way. hope covid mutates go direction, transmittable less deadly.  even looking here?  Initial doses Pfizer late March mid-April, symptomatic breakthrough early September. I've got post want see breakthrough compares yours. 

I got booster (Pfizer again) 10 days ago. sore arm 36 hours (not nearly sore first two doses, though). harder usual wake morning (\~14 hours booster) up, fine. 24 hours booster, faint/slight headache went away ibuprofen stayed gone thereafter. it. wife works medical field, took pulse ox told good didn‚Äôt panic. Understandable tho, I‚Äôm used aware heart rate like statistics work, risk dying COVID-19 goes age quantified. [Here data showing risk dying COVID-19 compares previous age bracket. example, COVID-19 death rate people aged 70-74 3.8%, COVID-19 death rate people aged 65-69 2.0%, moving 65-69 age group 70-74 age group increases risk dying COVID-19 1.8%. ages 65-69, risk dying COVID-19 goes roughly .36% year. Obviously much risk goes year depends current age say that's statistics work clearly wrong. took data Minnesota Department Health. second part comment, know go life normal regard masking attending events, comment referring person's personal decision cautious, Life normal dude.

My daughter miss 6 weeks person school far school year due COVID protocols without even getting sick November. Two times year different member family contracted COVID, time happens needs stay home 20 days (10 days infected person's quarantine, 10 days quarantine per school policy). times tested negative beginning end quarantine, never gotten virus still miss half school year far. Clearly life normal. sky falling  mainly middle managers frontline supervisors senior executives want people back office. solution fire middle managers. one would even know gone, anything productivity would likely increase further. used travel every year space A, easy tourist visa. Blew savings I‚Äôm glad did.  Yeah Spain confirmed couple hours ago well. selfish point view, % vaxxed matters. I'm triple vaxxed scheduled fly internationally soon. (from one heavily vaxxed place another). likely trigger global shutdowns heavily vaxxed nations?    Care share source? 

Any substantial mutation slow otherwise impede immune response, whether antibodies memory cells. question degree. Even mutagenic disaster influenza shows cross-strain protection T/B cells (albeit limited) degree antigen difference orders magnitudes greater we're talking here. 

Showing decay different saying full immunity escape. It‚Äôs anecdotal wouldn‚Äôt call original comment disingenuous, believe majority people life change. Literally life didn‚Äôt change major metropolitan area less populated cities throughout southeast. 

Also, point ‚Äútechnically right‚Ä¶‚Äù erroneous, never made argument. You‚Äôve bolstered statement make seem though ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù exchange experiences making seem though made argument. doctor said even caveated patients young healthy, don‚Äôt know people ran mild symptom narrative. Seeing Eric Feigl Ding get ass handed Twitter quite satisfying least ‚ÄúMany mutations know problematic, many look like likely contributing evasion,‚Äù says Moore. even hints computer modelling B.1.1.529 could dodge immunity conferred another component immune system called cells, says Moore. yeah worked really well last 2 years last time sick (I guess 2 years ago now) feel bad. Basically runny nose. cases like that, *want* work want expose people, WFH sick great idea. able visit dual citizenship? Suicidal Batmans Also, 35% SA population vaccinated. Recommended quarantine always double digits, never changed. good thing live fuckin atlanta. damn go clinical trials, trials smaller faster. Rather than, ""This brand new check everything,"" becomes, ""This shown safe past, want make sure tweaks something unexpected."" dozen people enough trial, rather needing thousands. 30 percent South African people vaccinated. definitely influence hospitalization. Still enough data, tho3. We'll know week two. Genuine question here. understanding viruses mutate become easier spread. However, become weaker. Like flu example. get time, it‚Äôs mutated many times point, it‚Äôs really threat us. Covid mutating seem making easily spreadable, also stronger? 

Or reading new information different variants we‚Äôre getting correctly?  I‚Äôm ok too, me, see slowing travel way keep icu‚Äôs overwhelmed. actually locked slowed spread early pandemic, maybe businesses would made it. 

We tried half hearted sort lockdowns...it work. point source read more? Thanks. likely catching things, like colds stomach bugs, amid coronavirus pandemic? 

I unvaccinated family members say colds right now, course plausible, covid going around, likelihood they've caught colds covid? Yikes. I‚Äôm sorry. unvaccinated individual want vaccinated that's choice. 

I mean vaccines work great care do. get sick it. They'll get sick die. made choice.

If choose smoke pack day 30 years probably die lung cancer. choice. choose KFC bowl breakfast daily probably die early heart failure. choice. FDA needs let parents want vaccinate kids 5 it. It‚Äôs time stop fucking around. Still link provided. included ""I think"" ""I believe"" post. current status Hydroxychloroquine Azithromycin combo treatment? friend one week infection found prescription doc on. thought totally debunked effective dangerous? since looked it... agree everything said, virus circulating months nessecarily mean going pose problem. Delta first sequenced Dec 2020, probably came existence months earlier that, explode India March 2021. regions months behind that. Alpha pretty similar trajectory. 

We seen Covid circulate relatively low rates community extended periods time takes suddenly like rocket, probably mostly spread via superspreader events highly random, also exponential growth takes reach critical mass. Exactly. ""Be afraid, also, know shit yet!"" scare tactics beyond bull shit. Everyone pretty sick them. scare tactics could end better world, Omicron less deadly Delta? Keep mind SA absolutly ravaged Delta year. Another upswing hospitalisations good sign. ...South Africa sequences 1% test samples...many many countries track new variants (not disparage country, they've got lot plate is). Even US sequences 4x many test samples per capita SA.  Japan also really need test much judging hospital beds full.  Huh, good idea tbh. reports corner Germany weeks ago. Inflows (earning) - outflows (spending) + change storage(being homeless) = GAINZ

its easy peasants, make money! Wiki page omicron NZ blueprint rest world, I‚Äôve seen. Certainly regulatory agencies around world look FDA/CDC doing.

I idea Quebec this, wonder get blame us this, least small part? turns Omicron escapes vaccines need revert back relying mask wearing, probably time CDC start telling people get N95 (or KN95 KF94) masks opposed cloth masks surgical masks mainly show.

Thise hospitalized milder  Right. first headline Omnicron didnt brush eyeroll. Assuming take face value. changes shit there‚Äôs also long covid children too. see anecdotes community spread countries actually try contact trace, definitely supports idea underdoor drafts sufficient spread virus.


But would still apply Occam's hotel quarantine Omicron anecdote: likelier human error played kind role here. careful looking news reports quite articles referencing individual saying ""lower symptoms"". I've even see folks say multiple doctors saying without source back up. want hopeful, sure. want doomsday get it. need patient anything. Proactive OK too. Good data! Thanks.  True; brings mind one favorite quotes Plato... 


‚ÄúHe real tyrant, whatever men may think, real slave, obliged practice greatest adulation servility, flatterer vilest mankind. desires utterly unable satisfy, wants one, truly poor, know inspect whole soul him: life long beset fear full convulsions distractions, even State resembles: surely resemblance holds? Moreover, saying before, grows worse power: becomes necessity jealous, faithless, unjust, friendless, impious, first; purveyor cherisher every sort vice, consequence supremely miserable, makes everybody else miserable himself. -- Plato, ""The Republic"" THIS. Corporate healthcare administration creating disgusting, unacceptable, abusive working conditions bedside staff years. conditions got even worse covid, become completely control past two years‚Ä¶ Covid didn‚Äôt create this, it‚Äôs straw broke camel‚Äôs back. mean percentage hospitalizations rising would really bad, rising absolute counts matter healthcare capacity closer absolute count new beds nurses magically spawning case counts rise. Omicron evolved single long-term host persistent covid, person infected 15 months ago vaccinated.  South Africa far 100% unvaccinated. Viral evolution happen vaccinated populations. also comical divisive is, simple question immediately gets people jumping downvote button.

I feel there. yeah, would say still good idea get booster soon available you. new booster comes specifically new variant, still able get one well (down weeks month apart would suspect, there's gap needed all).

The reason people wait 6-8 months last dose booster people *need* booster then. medical professionals follow still advocating everyone get vaccinated, get boosters, wash hands, socially distance, wear masks. far, seems like yet another variant. I've read Omicron might result considerable reduction vaccine effective. that's case, still encouraged get booster shots, opposed waiting targeted solution new year? I've 3 pfizer doses btw. people take precautions, anything spreading. also they're like unvaccinated people know, they'll refuse Covid tests deny death certificate printed it. trust either way. likely can't logic worst might convince kids households go test. That's best I've able do. Im talking cases u know like people become positive noware unexpectedly bad luck nothing done thats nature virus expecially transmittable non symptomatic periods. know must quarintine purposely leave selfish things held accountable actions.many countrys strict hotel quarintine people go tourists think want. fair. every cvs Walgreens within ten mile radius fully booked week.

Even though sucks getting booster, I'm damn happy hear that.

People getting vaxxed! Things might actually bad! work Moderna. wear masks places indoors Manhattan anyway. saying get 399 euro fine? weird felt sore soon needle went pfizer shots, 2nd shot fucked whole 24 hours. someone explain me? I've received one dose take second dose week. statistics like scare me.. (Also, Sweden, 87% reported Covid-cases October fully vaccinated people) important issue variants incredibly high percentage HIV positive hosts southern Africa.  Scientist's dire warnings coming pass political leaders ignoring expediency

Plot every disaster movie withdrawal symptoms heavy? providing insight

Anecdotal evidence couple dozen young, healthy people coming *right symptoms started* isn‚Äôt insight. It‚Äôs misleading info doesn‚Äôt help anything false downplaying, bad false fear mongering. Almost South Africa previously recovered, vaccinated. person incubated Omicron vaccinated. best mix vaccinated unvaccinated people homogeneously. Get vaccinated. Get second dose. Get third dose.  severe reaction PFIZER 2nd dose (only 1 person know hospital nurse oof) reason I'm going Pfizer again, scared Moderna booster would me. Doesn‚Äôt mean variant likely circulating quite time? Unless ludicrous R0 spreading rate beyond even Delta (seems unlikely)‚Ä¶

So it‚Äôs former isn‚Äôt kind good thing could well increasing spreading weeks largely haven‚Äôt seen correlation hospitalizations, especially areas high vax prevalence?

Genuine question ""100 years long time Americans, 100 miles long distance Europeans."" true.

But said, pace similar last Delta wave hospitalizations aren‚Äôt great sign, severity appears less. 

There‚Äôs enough information go of. Schedule it, matter far out. 5+ crowd getting 2nd shots likely busy. need accept walk ins unlikely happen unless health department sets clinic call ask. Otherwise get schedule wait another days. Maybe expand radius beyond 10 miles. family drive nearly 100 miles get first vaccines. Yes do, happens depends building. modern high rise hotel, done common venting. gap door enough problem. I've stayed plenty places feel draft air flowing in.

If motel everything open, AC/heating unit basically window unit. fresh air instead recric, drawing fresh air. something like motel every door opens outside, really issue since sharing ventilation rooms. motel model used purpose built quarantine facilities. belief vaccines cause variants looking crumbs? neither. two, Maple syrup better pancakes. Gauteng township think....so skew towards groups we're seeing (unvaxxed, older, poorer, immunocompromised). means US/western folks vaxxed clear yet. Smell training (you'd google it) recommended before. I'm sorry hear it. leadership people themselves? compare country, USA, neglected education system mental health issues badly contributed problems dealing pandemic. also massive inequality. problems there? South Africa abysmal vaccination rates however. Quebec close 85% population vaccinated currently vaccinating children. Yet another study limited never published first place. Everyone wants write COVID paper whether useful data not. Correct. Lots conspiracies FB. Source: antivax family Gauteng. Perhaps report reddit police violating ""you cannot post stuff someone somewhere might butthurt about"" rule. pandemic led believe science needs alarmist docile.

Mainly stupid people need yelled order make good things happen.    *CDC incompetence intensifies*  common known side effect. Parosmia name. paid attention known side effects getting it? never said shouldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs completely different I‚Äôm saying.   Africa lots unvaccinated people small children, though. variant able penetrate demographics bad them. Apparently hospitalizations quadrupled 3 weeks: also showing 90% cases unvaccinated something like 30-35% country vaccinated.  

If seeing significant elevation hospitalizations vaccinated people would concerning. reason assume vaccine work long spike protein exists. virus somehow mutates without spike protein, think fucked. Countries implemented proper lockdowns (Vietnam, China, Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan) zero local infections weeks months time.

Lockdowns work. thing spread 5G.  Ewww observations far particularly alarming

Times like rife misinformation.

If state something like this, please cite source.

Otherwise, delete post, leads many doubt medical experts. Toddlers eligible vaccine, insignificant percentage hospitalized anymore. 

My kids adults now, mean I'm going say ""eh, whatever,"" bunch babies fighting lives hospital. actually tried looking job? I'm white collar professional circle took none us month casual searching snag new job. travel ban destroyed tens thousands South African tourism jobs f*cked economy already death spiral. best tell, Ding equal-opportunity fearmonger

lmao true though. fuck Omicron? stay Reddit week new pandemic shows up. Whining Dead. fuck you? post history indicate anyone worth listening to, medically mention approach ‚Äúwet markets‚Äù caused first place.

wet markets think are. Tons countries basically grocery store sells meat run vendors. China ton people eat meat, people eat meat cause novel viruses.

You're trying blame based hindsight fact novel virus easy detect trace think first month detected. Wuhan quarantined deaths. unprecedented lockdown saved millions lives across world.

If COVID-19 started country China might even found originated millions would died. That's truth cope with. misinformation? Please stop making statements without justification. cable doesn‚Äôt seem super likely. gov officials love false points escalation dont actually shift behavior‚Ä¶all confuse people. phone blowing friends/coworkers sharing news knowing wtf means. Agree wholeheartedly. I'll go one step farther: kick anyone tests positive even vaccinated. Hospitals need safe places people come get better get sick. Yes tiny fraction (0.001%) people done everything right still got extremely rare breakthrough case. fully boosted, wearing proper PPE (n95+surgical mask), hanging unvaccinated putting risky situations bars/restaurants. Given 25% vaccination rate, makes worried efficacy vaccine shower last? pretty scary, article say spike matches happened previously Delta spike less severe cases previous. Thank God, one thing blatantly better vaccines required. Common sense win often enough Exact story mine. losing lot people nothing says it‚Äôs due people forced back office. I‚Äôd suspect something they‚Äôre probably getting money new jobs. think really need everything power make sure don‚Äôt lose positives come pandemic left tragedy. Please stop spreading misinformation That's grand daddy cruise ship COVID fuck stories....this one providing insight , every single person needlessly demanding since news variant first broke. Everyone looking scapegoat point, idea targeted. still know next nothing variant, first expert observe milder cases among patients variant, let's signal out. jesus christ absurd post complaint all? Assuming heading winter are, pretty damn likely. Colds respiratory viruses gone extinct means - reduced transmission last year since many people mostly home (and masked weren't), many people unmasked living mostly normal lives again, colds everywhere. 

That said, there's obviously way know sure without test, get tested, probably worst idea stay away awhile. don‚Äôt test vaccinated primates? Canadian perspective- generally aren‚Äôt. coincidentally politicians back vaxx.

Omnicom variant excuse countries needed quickly cast South Africa adrift.

Alarming surface though doubt kids admitted extra caution opposed necessity Oh sure. It‚Äôs nice seeing alarm getting rightfully called said Delta wasn‚Äôt overwhelming spike. corresponding increase hospitalizations (which usually precede deaths) South Africa, place non-trivial number reported cases right now. like expect see hospitalizations Canada three reported cases. danger. danger idiots ran assuring us cases would mimic observed early stages. rest world composed relatively small islands. isn‚Äôt 2020 though stop acting comparing that. strange seeing acclaim getting international subs canadian subs seem agree cheap posturing make slow federal response early pandemic. bro often wash hands? Stonks Nothing happen, short term profits matter long term stability. yo if:

  outcompeted delta. I'm saying true. think we're misunderstanding one another.

While still common, much less likely disease make jump animal human, disease already endemic humans simply infect another human. I'm saying much easier someone catch COVID-19, since already millions cases happening right moment... human get entirely new-to-humans disease/variant animals first time.

We going cull livestock prevent transmission animal humans back again, even though gives rise new variants/disease. much likely, easier, get human population vaccinated disease already spreading amongst us less pool mutate within time infects someone new. even feasible though? Big office buildings simply built serve housing. understand it, retrofitting residential use would likely extremely expensive, even prohibitively so. Redoing plumbing alone would nuts. expect somehow converted, they'd probably tailored towards ultra wealthy. lockdowns extremely damaging businesses people's health

I share opinion. opinion last year also, leases, rents, mortgages, debts frozen personal business.

We need lose businesses charge space taxes anything, unable operate.

While agree locking terrible people's mental health, would gladly ungladly heartbeat means putting healthcare workers struggling last 2 years pressure total collapse, along deaths people unable get treatment non-covid related illnesses.

It's sitting home watching TV, forced imprisonment labor camp. nothing variant months back, called Lambda. saying people forcefully moved quarantine? sad? something tell people comes casual conversation.

I'm healthy guy, back country camper. Got covid last March. wrecked 3 weeks. severe breathing problems year. Obviously fucked entire system. recently started breath little normally, anyone smokes nearby, REALLY feel it. Sometimes breathing normally still hear little *wheeeze* know normal back yet might ever return.

Yeah, sure - might get Covid, might get fine. Maybe symptoms would mild. Maybe symptoms would harsh. Maybe system fucked like me. Maybe end ICU.

Being ""young healthy"" bullshit reasoning. virus give shit young healthy are. anyone else sit back sometimes think: I‚Äôm vaccinated boosted, parents, In-laws, siblings boosters, everyone care protected safe. don‚Äôt really give shit willingly unvaccinated anymore. problem without contact tracing, could people already incubation period know let country. that, everyone infected come contact become carrier spread throughout ever circle come contact with.

I also colleague lost father lives China (also due covid). could go first 3 weeks quarantine hotel room able see mother. able make time funeral, even pandemic.

The pandemic sucks, frankly, travel ban really change much. anybody gotten different booster vaccine original 2 vaccines? really sick first two (which know normal), wanna try minimize selecting different brand hoping helps.

I‚Äôll let make argument Bnonews.com. Here‚Äôs silver linings Honestly point, I‚Äôd rather ban willingly unvaccinated hospitals limit lives everyone else. great fucking vaccines population well protected deserves lives back. Oh America dining bars etc. difference people spreading catching Covid. think masks great society accept long term. Maybe every day use feeling bit sniffly still want go interact society shouod mask up. cold since 2019 great. Definitely directly due widespread mask usage. Get fake majority world include africa yes, even healthcare workers low numbers.

Covax significantly delayed india stoped exports 6 months, address delta .

Not getting bonuses, incentives, help moral either management gets annual bonuses. scheduled booster next week. wonder data look like, hopefully still effective variant. Fully vaccinated people, especially boosters, able whatever fuck want - including wear mask. We‚Äôve done part. kind goes air known mechanical issue. covid treated myth whole faker thing get turned head bit.

With holidays etc coming seemingly higher transmission omricon, short term protection lead ..at least UK Same, it‚Äôs ever think word used. Yep, delta wave last months county often times 0 open icu beds hospitals despite highly vaxxed area, good portion covid patients hospitals county lower Vax areas i've hardcore back animal crossing, too, thanks new update last month, sooo really simulation, huh?  still able return China either. people work at, own, part supply chain bars restaurants literally cannot live without them. 

Don‚Äôt forget ability stay home survive without huge financial loss always massive privilege. catch Covid I'll B SAD too! crazy. friend barely got weekend part Japan Exchange Teaching Program, meanwhile peers make through. not, go read laws. like US citizens cannot denied entry detained border.

You‚Äôre dramatic acting like isn‚Äôt things *always* been. Fun fact, know Mississippi (of states lol) one like 2 states allow religious exemptions children vaccinated enrolled school? 

Get fucking grip, better yet, get vaccinated. Wuss familiar cases people getting virus multiple times even getting vaccinated, fact doubled vaxxed people got strain, strengthen concern bypasses bit immune system.

Are concerns unjustified? would interested accounts people Omicrom doing. dying symptoms light. Vaccinated not. vaccines? 7 8 infections fully vaccinated tells exactly nothing efficacy vaccines.

* sample size way small
* absolutely clue many people exposed vaccinated. Given cases currently reported actually traveled South Africa given current travel restrictions, I'd wager vaccinated people severely overrepresented.
* absolutely clue many people fully vaccinated exposed infected
* getting infected one thing, way important vaccine still prevents severe progressions. long people require medical intervention, increase detection efforts lock homes.

The biggest problem pandemic people scientifically illiterate understand statistics all. point getting vaccinated strain may (and likely, will) able evade vaccine current form?

You're making assumptions. Yes, get vaccinated even Omicron evades vaccines, still varients proven lessen severity of. could yes. Shit... tired wearing masks. fully vaccinated got booster shot. Enough enough already. planning month long vacation Australia Feb 2021. Still waiting lol Yes, think still go. I'm really worried getting sick, I'm mostly worried stuck cabin week quarantined family. Dutch resident - please opposite people here. Please wear masks, social distance, work home, gather, get vaccinated, get boosters, take seriously. :( I‚Äôve heard hesitancy. know reasoning behind part world in? see lot US obviously, think lot domestic politics, wonder contributing factors countries different political landscapes Yes, double vaxxed asymptomatic. others mild symptoms right now. people vaccine prior infection, Omicron ""control group"" measure fitness compared Delta.

The looking question whether existing immune cells recognize Omicron, so, degree. Also, scientists explore whether measurable difference exists prior infection versus vaccination people infected Omicron. 

Personally, would helpful know soon possible whether at-home tests detect Omicron. Current advice testing window several days, based relatively short incubation Delta. Omicron seems thus far incubate closer 10 11 days rather 4 5. holds, could see many people assuming they're negative really, they're week away detectable viral load. Sure, healthy immune system extremely beneficial however three listed implemented immediately. get that. I‚Äôm double vaccinated myself. I‚Äôm saying relaxing restrictions milder variant, would effect vaccinating aren‚Äôt willing get vaccinated. Basically whole ‚Äúbut freedums‚Äù debate could done away with, without stepping anyone‚Äôs toes creating level civil unrest seen around globe. 
 
Tbh, level polarisation society symptom something much worse covid. We‚Äôve lived amongst viruses entirety human existence, they‚Äôre much part nature are. 
 
If put much evolutionary pressure them, might win battle, you‚Äôll far much worse long term war. It‚Äôs kind similar we‚Äôre seeing bacteria resistant drugs. 
 
It‚Äôs silly fight hard inevitable. It‚Äôs late wipe covid, next best scenario basically breed something harmless common cold. Necessity mother invention. We‚Äôre creating necessity covid mutate survival rather putting pressure mutate something less harmful, we‚Äôre pushing become resistant treatment. 
 
Think it. harmless virulent strain, would outcompete harmful, less virulent strain. Basically, soon one strain found, need relax restrictions let continue dominant long possible.  Yeah went warn suddenly rainy shitty weather, could drive cases activities move indoors. shall close borders prevent foreigners coming in!

Nice see someone taking new COVID strain seriously!

COVID? remember thing Delta started reported outside India. ""It appears contagious, less deadly UK variant."" summer fall waves pretty much ended notion ""done"" Covid vaccines.

But that's thing, consequences Delta happened way faster Beta's. remember blink eye already news death, hospitalizations shit going crazy many corners world. recall Delta caused devastation faster methods, Omicron worse Big (no pun intended) slower infectious terms. I'm dedicated hospitals like TB.  What‚Äôs social isolation multi-generational family? Assuming work well Omicron variants. Judges dislike pre se (self represented) defendants process judge instruct rules procedure -- effect holding hand throughout trial -- includes limited subpoenaing witnesses. jury selection, trial 

It's stuff narcissists love, though. 

When dude loses case whine play martyr card. Damm actually good terms parents. person evolved likely caught covid last year could never kick immunocompromised. Vaccinating world important prevent next one unless managed vaccinate everyone around patient zero omicron, vaccines wouldn‚Äôt stopped this. Ah yes, tourism money. Way important protecting people‚Äôe health safety. work government? seem think like do. summer there. Kinda predictable really. should‚Äôve given vaccines poorer countries instead vaccination teenagers etc. 100% eligible took probably seen mutation. thinking would need time amass number mutations had. I'm imagining evolving hidden Africa first get detected SA. Honestly, wish. Save money cell phone plans. Exactly. time lag variant begins circulating catch means it‚Äôs likely already spread. Travel restrictions add complications exchange false sense security. coughed today.

I high unknown risk. world shut 2 months may cough know what's causing sure. definitely may may allergies drive tests whenever kids get sort symptom (school requires this) times use rapid test sanity drive clinic doesn‚Äôt make sense missing p681r mutation think one key mutations delta's transmission. Hopefully either omicron pick mutation mutations make nonviable mutation. Otherwise, pi could first variant high consequece, designation yet use. think yes. bad luck happens there's virus particles air, filter least limit dose get get less sick.

If somebody stands coughs outside door whatever, get in. It‚Äôs best way get natural immunity trains Interesting. That‚Äôs rather long time. rapidly changing situation. confirmed cases several countries within last day shows already spread across continents undetected. 

being prepared like stocking hospitals PPE prior potential spike overreacting Guys, site track far omicron spread list country already infected it? Thanks Ok .wtf want thank us early detection transparency come holiday South Africa dust settled things safe. tourism industry sure needs it. sure agree victim attitude government, emotionally want agree head tells foreign countries trying protect citizens. Hope best. Prepare worst. much wait see. Delta absolutely nothing Argentina virus likely mutate SA, SA one African countries actually test.

I'm punishing unvaccinated. Let's cherry pick country right thing though instead punish everyone unvaccinated. that's goal, ban anyone unvaccinated entry regardless from. aside, I'm personally much favor treating bullishly l voluntarily unvaccinated triaging hospitals mostly ill. unvaccinated intubated kid comes kid headache resources needed kid, continue sick unvaccinated parking lot.   Ah man. I'm Australian due visit family next year worried things revert back closed borders it'll go mix messaging. One hour government officials taking heavy measures hour later officials make statements saying concrete data yet.

So really looks like hiding something dripping news cause panic. really incompetent policy statement making. Hah, like countries block travel Scotland first place comnunity spread omicrin outside SA. totally different testing arrival x days arrival

US also require rapid antigen less sensitive false negatives PCR articles I've read unsure rapid antigen even detect new variant point getting vaccinated strain may (and likely, will) able evade vaccine current form? Would better wait vaccine adjusted Omicron? Pre-departure tests failed identify one 61 positve cases KLM flights South Africa Amsterdam closing borders ineffective, omicron already everywhere. Small, ineffectual, castrated federal government libertarian dream. regulations toothless laws. Republican paradise. Delta never ""talked about"" became [de-facto 6 months say 5 doses!

Remember everyone lockdown 2 weeks it'll over! experts said so! here, totally you. Dang dude... I'm really trying kick flying greater NYC area there's reason pay $500-700 round trip Tokyo. subscribe something like Scott's Cheap Flights set price alerts. paid $206 round trip Denver - Tokyo ticket May. makes feel better trip February almost certainly going come fruition. throw away yet. positive, people, 60 plus tested ""negative"" get flight positive landing. rapid tests best already symptomatic. PCR still ""gold standard"" even got rapid test return work correct, flu. even drive-through test accurate home one, really concerened. Covid hosted mutated within animals. always danger new variants mutated within animals. 

Everyone likes point polio small pox. hosted animals. They're erring side caution. addition commenters said, extremely low testing another factor. miss insane amounts cases, also probably missed majority deaths.

Places like Yemen example reported relatively deaths, satellite images show cemeteries getting filled last Source? Mike Jones!  cells - one shoplifter? gonna eat him... Could get better, could get worse. 

*Situation normal: fucked up*. Good sources, thanks! Hopefully open intervals otherwise chaos. I'm sure would give priority near 6 month mark, older age ranges. hope anyway! great everyone opened up, older ranges still higher risk. ever hear tragedy Darth Plagueis Wise? thought not.

Senior Researcher SA CSIR (see black curve): appear increasing well (it 750 2 days ago vs 860 reported today).

I'm well enough work hacking coughing everywhere, I'm gonna use extremely limited sick time case there's time actually need it.

If sick work, take day. No, one noticed unusual symptoms reported board. argument, casting aspersions someone absolutely right thing. Micrograms, edited  talking differences/similarities nations different vaccination rates. talking differences/similarities nations different healthcare systems.

The U.K. example government-run healthcare experiencing problems person replying talking about:  ""The vast majority patients unvaccinated people small proportion people partially fully vaccinated.""

We clumping ""partially vaccinated"" unvaccinated time. Since delta hit, know first dose provide real protection likely fades quickly. 

The data would really help ""Covid cases persons least 2 weeks 2nd dose Covid vaccine."" really tell us protection time. also need stop considering single J&amp;J dose vaccinated. 

South Africa 29% partially vaccinated 24% fully vaccinated rate. 1/3 fully vaccinated J&amp;J, 16% considered truly fully vaccinated. would love know percentage 10% classified unvaccinated falls 13% partially vaccinated J&amp;J. 90% population unvaccinated, yeah it‚Äôs surprising. Cause important things take care invest money time finding right shameful mask. Hell two, Excelsior NYC COVID SAFE. We're lousy passes! severely diminishes impact statistic they're trying push people fear click article. much metric report many unvaccinated people getting moderate severe symptoms, perspective hospital capacity. We're talking region 7% vaccination rate all. fun done year! Plus nightclubs music venues open full capacity UK since... July! yet, hospitalizations even reached 1/4 January lockdown required control outbreak, lockdown nearly five months. what's fucking problem lol? :) degree protection uncertain. reasonable assume vaccines help prevent serious disease variant less contained vaccines. reason car airbags seat belt. Today Dude, can't nice things China Russia, especially former, always acting opposition rest countries do. simply apples discord world, could easily start WWIII. one major side effects covid. may came back time. shit. popularion unvaccinated. Nurses aren‚Äôt leaving patients danger, *hospital admin* *putting* patients danger deliberate bare bones staffing working conditions they‚Äôve created. Hospital admin putting nurses licenses danger working conditions they‚Äôve created. Unfortunately, South Africa struggling major vaccine hesitancy point they‚Äôve turned shipments vaccines aren‚Äôt enough people want ones already have. 

I fully vaccinated, also don‚Äôt fully blame residents part hesitancy government handled HIV issue. Also, apartheid has, course, long lasting effects trust government. anyone wanting follow South Africa Covid stats trends, look Twitter it?  thought NICD?

Attacking insults exactly going make arguments somehow valid. people already it, hurt? 

A soft recommendation that, recommendation. reminding people remain cautious, especially learn Omicron. Me!!!!!! worried struggle get appt open all. booster booked 6 1/2 months post 2nd dose. necessarily. Hospitalizations lag right? could early cases detected. feel like circulating while, would've already picked cases US no? lost grandpa pandemic go funeral due travel restrictions. 

Call often keep spirits up. country 24% vaccination rate, increase hospitalizations driven primarily individual's inability fight virus rather indicate dangerous strain. could hospitalized OG Covid too. NYC. South Africa also like 23% vaccinated using case study affect countries seems like lost cause  Patients, population. 90% patients US unvaxxed too. get saying, issue everyone gets paid sick days.

I knew common lose sense smell. know I'd regain get bonus weird oily awful smell

That definitely common knowledge, maybe spread mainstream great parosmia intelligence brothers, Death, War, Famine? Yes, cases people describe ""the sick I've ever felt life"" count mild long die get admitted hospital. love geniuses suggesting GP, sits SA medical association board, reported variant first place consulted multiple clinics observed patients independent practice, lying public prevent travel bans SA political reasons.

It's downright disgusting cast aspersions doctor brought light manner. Nurses quitting travel gigs pay 2-3 times current rate. good morale new travel nurse joins floor making much money you, even though training know hospital much better due experience. 

Raise pay staff nurses see quitting droves paid, money put hours day. stop patients yelling possibly even attacking you. pay erase stuff exhausted people seen. 

It's thankless.  Also variant detected directly pcr S-gene dropout. widespread UK would know now. Likely something along lines standardized responses outbreaks. Like agree shut international travel couple weeks stop spread omicron. Country level quarantine zones, example global sanctions aid South Africa right now. agreed base level testing see better data global scale.

In age 65+ vaccinated get infected. Twice much!

In article link says even half patients vaccinated.

And country 24.1 percent vaccinated.

What say? Time tell.... upcoming days make clear. take two weeks people end hospital we'll wait see develops   I've lived whole life honestly say I've never seen gator IRL. Hub seen golf course times tho. know that, personally, thought isolation. unfortunately live several hundred miles loved ones able see since pandemic, idea getting 3+ years see enough make completely lose hope. i've struggled severe depression since kid, like nothing i've ever experienced. calculation want try make. Certainly Omicron cases growing 5x weekly Omicron hospitalizations grow 5x weekly, top Delta non-Covid hospitalizations. question ratio is. incredibly hard calculate think, multiple variables significant uncertainty uncertainty combines.

Say Omicron growing 5x [3-7x] per week (17-32% per day). currently 1,800 positive tests Gauteng day today 7-day average (we use 7-day averages since that's hospitalizations done), 12,600 last week. Test undercounting 4x-20x (based 60% seropositivity Delta wave South Africa's testing hit rate abysmal; obviously tremendous variable). lastly 10 (7-14) day gap positive tests hospitalizations. Lets call 300 Omicron infections week 48, think ended yesterday.

Then upper bound 32% daily growth, 4x test undercounting, 14 day gap: 300 hospitalizations correspond running case average 15 days ago. gives 300 / ( 12600 / 1.32 ^ 15 * 4 ) = 38% hospitalization rate.

Now lower bound: 17% daily growth, 20x test undercounting, 7 day gap. 300 hospitlaizations correspond running case average 8 days ago. gives 300 / ( 12600 / 1.17 ^ 8 * 20 ) = 0.4% hospitalization rate.

That's factor 100 margin error, think even 0.4% great we're talking 5x weekly case growth. Overall promising. No, tons vaccine available. don‚Äôt want it. think it‚Äôs fake? neighborhood highly vaccinated Manhattan. Aight hear out, administered vaccine doses form sick trays nachos? parts ""Zero Covid"" Twitter pretty much gone full anti-vax. Saw talking vaccines worthless stopping new variants (never mind they're popping undervaccinated areas) stopping 100% transmission Pfizer deceived us vaccines would end pandemic could make profit.  going acknowledge ""Zero Covid""ers dangerous grifters grifting longer justifiable pretext ""UwU can't blame us passionate public health UwU""

Ever since media started focusing breakthrough cases, I've seeing non-conservatives buying anti-vaxx propoganda. Especially subs like Covid positive sub. people claiming Pfizer Moderna's vaccines 12% effective sued ""lying public""  keep seeing news articles saying South African doctor‚Äôs seem think omicron virus contagious mild symptoms. false, know yet? least based anecdotal experience friends family, seems like complete crapshoot. know people bad reactions J&amp;J, zero reaction Moderna, bad reactions first shot nothing boosters...seems like outcomes place. 

Studies keep showing Moderna [just slightly that's went it, difference close negligible. No, across board. rules route tightened following talking host evolution? situation better hope never be. Host (ex humans) evolving would occur across generations take long long time. looking evolution virus. quote abstract nature:

""viruses jump hosts undergo strong stringent adaptive selection maximize fit new I'm guessing virologists probably know talking about. Omicron hassle end everybody vaccine virus? Tired concerned disease general. Lockdowns slow spread. eradicate though. Unfortunately thing endemic, means need learn live manage it. Completely eradicating possible (same cannot completely eradicate flu). panic.

But would prepare another 2020'esque winter, whatever course action u.s. decides take, going marginally successful past indication. 

We stink preparation, great throwing money problems... suck actually anything brain turns crisis.. 

Our nerds awesome...our population depends nerds...not much.

My two cents. ""oh god, shit again, get fucking vaccine already, fucks sake""  Check passengers 3 10 days tell us anyone caught flight. really didn't. isolated places holding parties, real carnival happened last year main cities Seems like Breyer didn‚Äôt see reason case bypass normal legal process. Hope. False, hope need throughout USA... ""Vaccines required pretty much function socially professionally"" ‚ÄúThe vast majority patients unvaccinated people small proportion people partially fully vaccinated.""  

Seems including people 1 dose 13%. data many FULLY vaccinated article. people use advanced equipment like one instead cheap disposable respirators? Sooooo ‚Ä¶ pronounce it?  say physician colleagues, bedside nurse, would want jobs (To fair, think would want mine either). ten minutes patient sees them, mean overwhelmed shitstorm are. 20 patients round census, 10 round on, 4 operate on, plus charting, reading reports, getting interrupted phone calls every minutes, squeezing clinic time outpatient procedures covering call shifts... one favourite parts nursing 12 hours up, pass report next shift, leave, none mine home. 

The number roles left healthcare bucket load work stress seems dwindling. Housekeeping, Ward Clerks, CCAs... everyone asked less faster. that's cool, want coming anyways shall enjoy rest time left beautiful beaches, waterfalls etc etc lost 100 percent guarantee See thats sucks... firing medical staff don‚Äôt want vaccinate even ones vaccinated don‚Äôt want work anymore. folds back makes worse. saw longer clip discussing cases, ended literally complaining countries cracking travelers SA, that's conclusion reached well. Cringe company still trying short change offers otherwise uber discerning hiring even staff positions. Like, guys, fucking GOOGLE level prestigious COVID, type stuff leading miles backlogs open recs. Patience what's *crucial* emerging situation high potential crisis, this. crucial, swift, intelligent, ACTION. see original post deleted. Hopefully still get reply. Amazing nail common evolutionary ancestor thing one see weeks southern tip Africa. yet still people believe evolution exists. 2 year old brother law, stationed South Africa, planning visiting us Christmas. really don‚Äôt want tell family can‚Äôt see year, giving lot anxiety. ""Hopefully international community learn this""
lol know, right?! wonder anti vax idiots fall lie believe conspiracies people upvoting conspiracies well. It‚Äôs conspiracies aren‚Äôt vaccines doctor sharing admittedly anecdotal experience. 

When bad news comes out, ones love shit come woodwork.   thought airlines allowed PCR tests. interesting possible explanation mild symptoms hospitalisation rocketing cases much higher reported due many unnoticed suggested waste water studies might interested antiparasitic drug investigated repurposing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Ivermectin showed vitro activity SARS-COV-2, high concentrations. meta-analysis investigated ivermectin 23 randomized clinical trials (3349 patients) identified systematic searches PUBMED, EMBASE, MedRxiv, trial registries. primary meta-analysis carried excluding studies high risk bias.

2) group released paper 2020. 

3) shit continues cited antivaxx idiots excuse wear one, despite authors last sentences. Sounds like someone took contact tracing lessons u s. .... pretty clear global point. 1. required federal statute. 
2. Federal statutes automatically constitutional. Except always work way unfortunately. SA surplus people get vaccinated. Even told Pfizer send vaccines. company gone mostly WFH foreseeable future. 

We already flexible work/life plan many people worked home 1 2 days week. everyone equipped laptop could take laptops home snow forecast following day, everyone could, worked home bad weather days. 

After year pandemic working home, company decided sell campus rent much, much smaller space, house employees can't work home, desk space might want work office days month, plus conference rooms meeting spaces. 20-25 people working office, workforce around 450-500 people. 

I admit surprised, CEO major micro-manager never thought he'd agree this. 

Mostly everyone know happy change. Quite long commutes 45 minutes hour half, one way, drive snow ice big deal, well gaining back commuting time. 

I one actually lived town office, gain much time, wear shoes day bonus. 

The thing mind projects, hire temps, happening, supervise temps require Zoom day long, Zoom day long, make sure working answer questions, etc. days get long. Another half-assed effort nation. even bother travel restrictions then?  went Elmhurst, Queens eat sushi days ago, pretty much everyone saw streets wore mask.


Went local Walgreens after, one face without mask.


Manhattan, hand.... Yeah, take beyond dumb. work place, since get emails normal work hours home. 

So would certainly come disingenuous used that. including ""partially vaccinated"" 10% unvaccinated meaning people 1 dose. considered unvaccinated, though. Also, South Africa used J&amp;J 1/3 fully vaccinated. point, shoe consider unvaccinated unless they've 2nd dose. I'd like see percentage remaining 10% actually 16% population actually dually vaxxed mRNA vaccine. I‚Äôm Alabama got hit summer. last wave worst. Lots staff already left, antivax stuff going full bore. Patients much nastier, many outright mean. Delta brutal, 5% survival rate vent, super sick. two decent recoveries hundreds. left trach, ESRD brittle diabetes. ground down. Always short staffed, always supplies, utterly hopeless feeling every day. something good once, we? everyone stick like climate change agreements or...?

&amp;#x200B;

Then breakthrough covid case past summer high fever 4 days, congested even longer. Sucked.

I also nervous got booster thinking realized one day sickness better 4+. ok!!   fair, risk quality masks must low otherwise millions worn masks daily entire careers would part lawsuit micro plastics.

The vast majority antibody diversity come B cell maturation, see wiki article interested. B cell production critically important part vaccination process. mostly talk antibodies easiest measure, memory B cells really allow body long-term immunity, including Covid new variants. See vaccine basically teach memory B cells Covid spike looks like, B cells try different combinations anticipate spike might look like future. actually encounter mutated future spike, shift antibody production manufacture much antibodies fit new spikes better. know far. May 2021. study ongoing Phase /r/nottheonion always selective pressure ancestral strains. long-term host evolution happens. happen vaccinated people coming contact long-term host. vaccinated unvaccinated people never mix provides different environments, different (except they're essentially same) possibilities spread. Mixing reduces *both* possibilities. Good luck finding place.

So thanks need drive traffic hour working.  dick course everyone get vaccinated.

No one said viruses mutate looking people. New mutations occured one host give competitive advantage new host selected for. selective pressure mutations lost, hence host mutations made surrounded new hosts selective pressure terrible situation. also interested wasting time, antivax movement maintains large amount population great hosts viral replication/mutations next selective pressure good ""best"" situation.  literally made up.

Exponential growth folks...it take awhile know bad really is. Credit split Abraham Lincoln FDR established Thanksgiving national holiday set date.  Would worked better pfizer modernas vaccine?

Maybe. Maybe not. asking million-dollar question, know answer least next can't imagine china better vaccine.

The numbers coronavac (Sinovac) indicate 90%+ efficiency severe worrying symptoms. Portuguese, Brazil choose take sinovac western vaccine there's lot data available Coronavac (also called Sinovac US ‚Äì Preven√ß√£o de casos de Covid-19: ‚Äì Preven√ß√£o de hospitaliza√ß√µes: ‚Äì Preven√ß√£o de interna√ß√µes em UTI: ‚Äì Preven√ß√£o de mortes: 86,3%

In case want skim it, data looking Chinese vaccine

86.3% efficiency preventing death

90.3% efficiency preventing getting ICU

87.5% efficiency preventing getting hospital

65.9% efficiency preventing getting contaminated

If want first hand experience, took 2 shots Coronavac (Sinovac) get COVID symptoms. Yo outta country move too‚Ä¶. asking, think I‚Äôve found comfortable masks (Enro masks, KN95s) still ALWAYS feel face. I‚Äôm constantly aware presence, always uncomfortable. And, unlike clothes uncomfortable (too hot sweater, need adjust way hoodie even shirt lying body)Taking off, moving adjust it, etc. kinda defeats purpose mask first place. I‚Äôll continue wear masks continue need to, won‚Äôt like it. clearly agenda

But one though, right? Surely not... Yes generally move get better jobs never occured this. 34% population 18 younger. 60% 50s vaxxed. absolutely useful vaccination data don't. People want hear bad news. Me: ‚ÄúWell wtf *do* know?‚Äù makes think studies exist presumption true  mean fair, china really good reason distrust major nations world. federal statute requires Massachusetts hospital mandate vaccines? Plaintiffs arguing Massachusetts hospital violating federal statutes - one saying vaccine required federal statute. 

I say case looking constitutional issues. .......while planet burns. lots push pull work wanted us back office fall. finally came telling wanted back person full time needed pay 20% I'm getting I'm quitting. 

I'm still working home 4 days week. ass arguments

Your argument literally ""you agenda nobody listen you"". Well first live Canada, I'm overly concerned FDA approval. Also kind making contradictory points here. worried FDA approval also think tomfoolery approving Pfizer vaccine? rushed approving would trust anything begin with? Either trust FDA problem getting Pfizer vaccine trust giving approval meaningless.

I believe medical professionals spent decades studying developing vaccines. understand new virus things constantly changing. Vaccines pretty good track records proven safe effective. vaccines rigoursly tested we've poured money resources developing them. Considering outcomes we've seen far vaccine id say working pretty damn well. We're sacrificing youth save elderly sacrificed future youth. said hospitals pay travel nurses x3 amount compared normal staff One interesting thought. getting 3rd dose 3 months, 4th dose administered? Could future see 4 doses year? thing Covid endemic working office Covid anxiety affect performance? Like much performance drop WFH Covid anxiety/depression 

Also employees way less willing work late back office. That's I've clenching ass weekend. original Delta, fuck. outcome almost certainly worse either due spread.

If exactly Delta, hometown fucked. Half towns neck woods(upstate new york) going trouble. deaths, unrest masking vaxxing disease, we're facing real potential civil unrest. 

All neighbors flying Brandon flags right now, I'm wishing buy Prius. So, first case Oct. 7, strain detected two month later December 12. 

About Alpha, first case September year ago Kent, variant detected December, time becoming dominant. TBF *is* drain shaped. is, 12M population, least fast current Delta wave Poland. let's big sporting events, concerts, plays, go Disney World, wear masks stores. Regardless vax status, one may dangerous high risk. I'm guessing line thinking informed piecemeal, half-assed approach took. right, second paragraph last comment cynical all, instead factual first. we'll never really know since try. company it‚Äôs C suite really want go back lord people. I‚Äôve literally gotten point go watch news coverage variety countries see they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs sad feel like can‚Äôt depend officials country ahead curve agile/expedient response changing circumstances. It‚Äôs wonder many confused people antivaxxers. don‚Äôt agree antivax understand what‚Äôs partly contributing it. emergency request injunctive relief. wasn‚Äôt appeal overturn lower court decision merits. answer personal experience. First, honor business‚Äô wishes, sign comply. not, especially employees don‚Äôt mask, feel ease maskless since I‚Äôm vaccinated. state (not NY) even close hospitals reach capacity. people store eventually find level risk that‚Äôs acceptable like already have, still time Covid eradicated. Assuming ever demask, Covid still around. terms trying stop pandemic, I‚Äôm quite sure means context. certainly aren‚Äôt buying time slowing spread vaccine available, already. hope extra measures beyond gaining actual immunity vaccination able remove mask cases low enough, I'm afraid they‚Äôll disappointed cases rise measures removed. really this, it. work getting done, productivity dropping, exactly achieve. Redundancy always falls hard middle management best times. Covid booster jabs offered over-18s help stop potential wave infections driven new variant Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation made series recommendations expand UK booster said **the minimum gap second vaccine dose booster reduced six three experts also said children aged 12-15 invited second jab.

This new take, believe. strongly support this, happened today 100% expected. Justice Breyer alone handles emergency matters October, dissents three conservative justices, let Maine require health-care workers inoculated without allowing religious exemptions. 

This important part, hopefully holds otherwise court throwing century+ old precedent garbage, literally killing innocent people preventable disease, among many problems, process. virus respect anyone's religious beliefs. 

No vaccine perfect every vaccine protects entire community better community vaccinated; local effect.

It seems terrible ruling would spitting COVID also fate. generation extremely lucky COVID pretty much pandemic ever faced. Throughout history, far worse, international flights common.

Really, really dumb invent brand new precedent permanently tying hands behind backs. US cases... gotta hand Biden one wish case. Mine basically said well live new normal everything else open January you‚Äôre coming back week least. Delta brutal, 5% survival rate vent, super sick. two decent recoveries hundreds. left trach, ESRD brittle diabetes.

Holy shit. I've heard before, reason example landed especially hard.

I never understand people want gamble virus vaccines usually dramatically reduce severity it. anti-vax crowd always go 1% mortality rate (or 0.01% failure math 101 shows). would want take chance put ventilator intubated, get long covid, put loved ones stress, add burden healthcare workers, bad things contracting virus bring!

I know live entirely different reality. But... get it. typical moving goalspots. Soon hear death mild. so? Thats equivalent vaccines 10% entire population... single donation, top millions we've already committed donate. Hospitalisations rise proportion cases, depends ratio proportion is. Judging positivity rate, LOT undetected infections. sort behavior greatly intensified nature game environment, reason outbreak studied provide clues humans behave threat death disease.

Plus much cooler name Coronavirus Omicron - Corrupted Blood. never pass person outside city.  Shut up, dude. take dumb af. I'm sure would happen parts. least neck woods, see like one two people still wearing masks Meijer. urban centers might able swing masks, highly doubt average person country empathy still it.

I'm saying bad wear masks, I'm saying people stupid self centered keep UK took almost 3 months detect Alpha UK. Shorter line then. We, people world, need stop catering anti-vaxxers get life. Probably long though would sequenced ago days first detected infection. would prepare another 2020'esque winter

So prepared anyway. I‚Äôm boat‚Ä¶ $3200 delta March tickets‚Ä¶ called morning basically told go fuck wait hope flight gets cancelled‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs way get refund. Staying indoors two years absolutely hard people‚Äôs mental health. Humans social animals. Yeah ‚Äúat times indoors‚Äù confusing restaurants. restaurants always least Philly area seated wear walking table, bathroom, ie seated table.  Omicron friend I'm lazy validating myself, believe they're Q493R, typo initial communication led confusion Good Oh no! Anyway‚Ä¶ case Massachusetts requirement federal statute.

This case wasn‚Äôt looking constitutional issues. forget millions college students ready slide job take entry level people waiting slide whatever position someone quits WFH. Cartography also friend flight booked March‚Ä¶ chance get money back? actually focus communications quite bit field...it's really tough we're trying convey complex info people across broad spectrum understanding. public health educate people well convince something, difficult put 2 sec clip. 

People expect answers novel virus them. think we've spoiled predictable flu seasons long appreciate unpredictable COVID be.

Thank said...yeah, CDC could definitely lot better, buy swear take communications seriously field! Michigan. Horrible vax percentages‚Ä¶ None new. None it. clearly agenda, it‚Äôs ridiculously stupid, weak ass arguments aren‚Äôt going change that. Yes exactly‚Ä¶it‚Äôs soul crushing. Since Omicron outcompeting Delta, strong reasons think worse. already late stop it. Whatever say, South Africa detected late. still try slow spread better prepare. Waiting longer means we'll watch another wave infections deaths rolls across globe. someone please link scientiic (non-anecdotal) studies show things, Moderna particular:

1) Moderna protection death wanes.

2) Moderna-fully vaccinated people statistically significant chance long COVID broken through.

TIA, either both. No, use simplests masks. Man, hope someone would make ELI5 version whole thing, could hammer home benefits vaccines unvaccinated parents. Somebody call Hawkeye.  ""social distancing"" lol.  
This shit going last forever, vaxx yourself, wear mask crowded area avoiding friends family members stupid.  misinformatiin antimaskers. Masks used decades workers around globe day long, issues. least mandate vaccination international travel. researcher Seattle worked backwards samples collected estimated common infection almost two months ago (and probably South Underrated comment right      also followed similar things happened South African delta wave child admissions, precautionary. guy also says vaccines appear preventing severe disease people too. Lmao that, closed day due worker shortages canceled appointment. 

I ended uo finding walk clinic nearby.

But yeah walgreens cvs iffy, I'd recommend finding clinic even talking pcp   land robots comets - many people interested healing power crystal waves. Many getting boosters also early adopters, much likely willing get anyway opposed forced work mandates.  


Me family (4 us together) got boosters Saturday, got back general availability available US. Well that's great terrible outcome.

Unfortunately early say anything guess. 

Simply enough people confirmed variant. 

Then go data analytics statuses...

1. Age
2. comorbidities
3. vaxxed/unvaxxed
4. so, date last shot
5. previously infected?
6. so, long ago.
7. severity illness
8. transmission contacts

On on. Guess we'll see. ignore anti-scientific positions, medical professionals.  work company makes training tools (patient simulators) educating doctors nurses, right business booming money coming medical schools pandemic. worried it‚Äôs going come crashing students would use equipment train look existing medical staff treated public corporate healthcare system say ‚Äúfuck that‚Äù. going lost entire generation doctors nurses, people lived pandemic want make difference it, get ground dust garbage capitalistic system working designed - extract maximum value labor destroy laborers process.

Possibility immune evasion, extent unknown.

Possibility spreading rapidly even delta.

Either/both result new waves back overloaded hospitals. really hope happen, better prepared. [South Africa obesity rate higher almost We're fat. actually mainly lack information point that's scaring people. heavily mutated variant far. concerns mutations could potentially allow evade immunity, transmissible, cause severe illness.

But moment, know. People going little jittery scientists give us concrete answers. know CDC practically overruled FDA first round boosters, self-own many could see coming miles away. Maybe different low demand states, Seattle metro, adult boosters like 2+ weeks approved nearly simultaneously 5-11s there's throughput problem getting groups satisfied. approved late September like WH Covid task force wanted, would evenly distributed demand vaccination, never easy thing, we? country one getting bonus kind healthcare work, ‚Äúhey, look things, bad, lucky job‚Äù. doctors nurses earned less money pandemic 
I don‚Äôt really care recognition, would like people shots. 
Granted, almost 90% vaccinated antivaxxers minority, talking infuriating. Dec 2020 simpler times, would take early July 2020 tbh bit balance hate wfh can't wait back office. back weeks summer massive boost productivity. Zoom fstigue real Well, article words it. Got it. here, conspiracy theorists use term. ‚ÄúA prophet honor country‚Äù Spoken like someone doesnt wear glasses ü•∏ voted appreciating someone explains something; ::roll eyes backward::   We‚Äôve done (as much can), thanks.

Spoken like someone doesnt wear glasses üò≠ rarely see masked people outside Manhattan tho number increasing, mostly it‚Äôs cold. rarely see N95s street.  Exactly. time meetings increased exponentially ~4	hours per week 25 hours. Workload change working hours went ~45 ~75 (that task switching cost REALLY drain). health first. get page consistent? 

Not us that‚Äôs sure. can‚Äôt even get provinces /territories board approach. We‚Äôve got 13 different strategies, can‚Äôt even agree vaccine passport national. Every province different one. We‚Äôre wasting resources place. way hell convince whole world act consistent can‚Äôt even get act together. panic! read news stay ahead anything might coming. know like surprises like prepare; even news potentially bad, least blindsided. important thing read past headlines, hope best, prepare worst case. nothing else information helps inform decisions make risk level taking precautions day day life.

We know yet things get bad. There's enough data yet. Hang there, keep informed we're at, try patient new data comes in. Get boosted, mask up, keep keep loved ones safe scientists figure out! Same. So‚Ä¶ Twelfth ‚Äúconcerned disease general‚Äù part adult human. Also, according article lot hospital admittances occurred likely precautionary. Agreed. I'm North County, Southern part US. Hearing SD called extremely conservative city definitely eyebrow raiser. know liberal Bay area, c'mon! Someone correct I‚Äôm wrong understanding COVID present fairly significant animal populations, even shut whole world waited burn humans (which would difficult itself), long animal populations still come back. eradication ship sailed time ago. 

As kiwi grateful basically full year close-to-normal life pandemic reality COVID stay need find way live best outcomes possible everyone. Difficult problem solve. Yeah SA hardly vaxxed Yep feel :( Mine get better soon now! Cold weather driving Americans indoors. holiday season prompted wave travel, generating new lines covid transmission. delta variant pushing hospitalizations.
Now, adding potentially bad news, ominous new variant emerged: omicron.
But nearly 21 months covid-19 restrictions, little appetite country kinds school closures, indoor-gathering bans restaurant restrictions defined early days pandemic, according health officials, say political push unpopular ‚Äî effective ‚Äî mitigation measures waning.
‚ÄúIt exhausting,‚Äù said Ezekiel Emanuel, physician bioethicist University Pennsylvania President Biden‚Äôs covid advisory team transition. ‚ÄúThe American public rightfully exhausted, therefore amount risk we‚Äôre willing take goes up. People willing take risks accept challenges, they‚Äôre willing accept restrictions.‚Äù final one then? want get shot makes feel like crap every six months. yessss......it's better getting COVID, damn. everywhere issues stamps. Many issue arrival cards printed slips paper fueled real estate boom rural areas. I‚Äôm sure sitting $4 million dollar lake front home ski ski mountain home telluride something hate. Ah, that's good news. Hopefully Omicron evade antibodies like say, though. got booster help avoid infection, die. 13% two flights infected. makes think would less flights? 

Don't worry, we'll wait. 30 new mutations spike protein may make escape protection vaccines (to degree least). told come back office May. 

Now I've done WFH in-office feel like positives both.

The one thing like office: Comradery coworkers. able laugh someone's joke, talk weekends, ask quick question someone - nice. Since live alone, WFH means literally see human faces week, kind something mentally think even realized back office felt bonding again.

The nice part working home: Time efficiencies privacy. Skipping commute saved well hour day. 

The switching back fourth causes anxiety messes schedule/routine. hassle set things switch. recommendation push mandates, despite listing exactly backfire cause issues long run? ask /r/covid19 you‚Äôre looking studies Well we‚Äôre going see guess. Last heard Israel, infected Omicron vaccinated assume boosted, either asymptomatic facing mild symptoms. mentioned while, might well. Cyrus:

4.79 Million shots last 4 days.

1.42 Million first shots, 2.75 Million booster shots.

70% Americans, specific age groups, least 1 shot.

40 million Americans gotten booster shot.

Says Omicron arriving point, key get first second doses yet, two doses, schedule booster, period. Yeah saw Lambma variant entering action It‚Äôs 88% one dose, hopefully get second shot 90% end year. 

I personally think change vaccine requirement two doses. original title normally shit outside something? No. Bars restaurants require vaccinated. Pretty much everyone see walking around vaccinated. city feels lively fun. doubt they're going shut anything down. ""The sky blue""

""Source?"" completely disagree. There's pointless meetings ever wfh instead quick 5 min chat whole call set low vaccination rate? Israel generally head start trigger happy IMO--likely authoritarian regime such. prefer reading whatever comes UK. Chris Witty one better health officials IMO. Vancouver Canada also bad.

Apart countries pretty useless various forms. barrier entry nursing high. associate's degree get community college. doctor's I'd agree significant things could done lessen barriers entry, really buy nurses. I'm looking study/article/graph clearly shows percent efficacy fully vaccinated + booster pure infection separately severe illness (by delta omincron). Preferably broken age. Anyone links? early reporting cautiously relieved, I'm getting concerned now. already scaling back spending time crowded places due normal winter surge we're country, think I'm going even cautious. obviously want get Covid anyway, even vaccine, really want get strain much still air. 

Hopefully get confirmation soon Omicron worse already dealing with. then, I'm bunkering house. Tim going WFH sick, he's kind person would worked sick office option.  may factor perhaps factor. Politicians gotta move money around announced lol notes line actually, like EEOC TITLE 7 (double underlined)- Unreasonable accommodations e.g. Daily testing couple thoughts -

1) Many companies seen ""mental health"" healthcare costs skyrocket course pandemic. everybody happy wfh, suddenly miserable?

2) Everyone thinks productive home, like everyone thinks better drivers average. However, management lot companies seeing things slip - tasks use get completed hours take days. critical tasks keep enterprise running still getting done, many cases becoming obvious important critical functions starting suffer. treatments men women. 

Women tend overexpress certain toll like receptors chances mediate autoimmune. men disease expression. New Orleans full steam ahead canceling last year. sure compare countries take amongst 30s slow, there‚Äôs also lot complacency amongst older folks booster timeline US doctors reminded whatever access best. That's key. planned mix-and-match suddenly urgent reason get booster went first available 3rd batch Pfizer antibodies look amazing following (I'm antibody study) know protection body working right. hate shit. encourage unbiased thinking, encourages media illiteracy. Good luck recovery. reason variants become milder. new variant outcompetes previous variant means contagious. contagious replicates more. replicates patient, greater virus load may lead severe disease. get part. Delta current, serious, threat facing public health country. 

What I'm saying urgency calling boosters referencing new variant inspire lot confidence vaccines going work well it. least infection. 

Hopefully work well severe illness death. Many already have. read post showed people getting 3rd shot higher rate others getting 1st 2nd. me. need colonoscopy year ago. I'm supposed three-year plan polyps Family history. unvaccinated keeping getting proper care.

Things calming enough I'm hoping get one jan/feb. US get Booster 3 mos 5 mos effective? gets worse, threw insults provided evidence contrary.

All get like Ding wants paint ""neo-colonialist"" something. thought working travel nurse months? Live lean crank hundred k, invest index fund like sp500 could probably retire good... Hm I'm sure mean 90% people.

I pretty sure could lied said either immunocompromised work high risk occupation, seem right time. Vaccine's free bub I'm interested going happen space. I've go absolutely massive buildings DC government employee completely empty right now, people want go back. 10 days infection enough.

The ""90 day"" wait people received monoclonal antibody treatment. not, good 10 days. Im know seasonal habits like...

Generally people go inside temperatures reach either extremes. US, long getting second dose get booster dose?

Where live wait least 6 months booster dose.. Yes. UK saved life pandemic I'm American. I'm blood cancer survivor pandemic started, texted survivors let know shield. warned risk bleomycin (a chemo) toxicity told avoid oxygen mask. terrifying see cancer survivor support group light people freaking us Americans idea risk. following UK medical guidance, able mask early, shelter immediately come care plan ASAP case got infected. able reach care team (I'm long-term survivor oncology team longer sees patient) inform turned idea risk. group international audience also helped inform vaccine antibody studies T-cell studies I'm part of. helped plan boosters everything. national healthcare, immediate data outcomes risk conditions updated regularly. 

Living country state I'm in, one going protect me. one cared died high risk. really truly believe I'd followed timid US guidance, I'd mask-free months, infected dead. agree, that's want get vaccinated lol Hopefully get punctuation back soon Well generally stating incorrect information good way appear way claiming lorry drivers impacted travel restrictions France claiming 22nd December peak UK's winter wave wasn't.

Number cases hardly factor this. Even ignoring potential new variant reduce efficacy vaccines, cases SA gone 400% week whereas prior EU's statement UK cases gone 11%. yes could definitely say situations similar one SA far worse. 

However, point serious new variant found countries implemented travel bans, nothing Africa, racism thing want claim. Trying claim case numbers makes situation different EU's statement says due rapid spread new variant travel restricted similar situation SA.

Well UK centre spread alpha variant I'm sure banning travel EU would done. However, SA banned due Beta variant around time (didn't actually happen later December). yes another good example make point, thanks that. India still older lot African countries. Median age India: 28, Nigeria: 18. Could give ELI5 would lead mutations? think it‚Äôs people used governments irresponsible waiting data rather taking precautionary measures norm throughout pandemic. Governments proactive people spooked it‚Äôs different, people assume must ‚Äúknow something‚Äù else would making responsible decisions. Canada, certainly America too. Mostly this. Plus may yet test Omicron.

On particular issue, agree US. think EU countries making superficial quarantine effort real impact.

It's already everywhere, may even started SA.  Hopefully wife‚Äôs family move back. plan moving back December 22nd Japan. Missing article, included Dutch language news: ""Quarantaine vrijwillig, maar als je je daar niet aan houdt, dan kunnen overgaan tot dwang. - Quarentine voluntarily, abide move enforcement"" 

So order quarentine enforced, need break first? strain sends half number people hospital, twice contagious, actually get lucky. means healthcare systems collapse exponential increase patients. 
  
For now, soon tell. Things look for: 
\* Transmission rates 
\* Immune protection (both vaccine prior infection) 
\* Severity symptoms omicron could saviour... least mutates again.

But think ""mild far"" probably enough evidence moment, good start least ban meant making unvaccinated getting vaccine, protect countries getting vaccinated mutations.

You cannot honestly tell unvaccinated contributed nothing mutations.. 75% total population? seems little harsh‚Ä¶ even countries reached 75% given countries vaccinating kids yet? So, community spread already UK/Scotland. Elderly end ICU hopeless case I'll say once, I'll say again. US third world country wearing gucci belt. pre diabetic, well that‚Äôs awesome measures lifted variant bad. is, they're going buy lot time. best protect people long term? rn new variant already everywhere travel bans questionable efficacy. hand‚Ä¶ discouraging countries, especially poor countries heavily rely tourism, sequencing find new variants (and reporting early on). could delay important information future variants cause harm good wanna Debbie Downer here, literally reason theory Omicron milder even exist one single claim one single South African clinician referring younger patients, would mild symptoms anyway. 

It's literally hot air right now, yet everyone's building castles sky this. Well, America even testing / tracking Omicron - makes travel ban even less justified.  feel like media latched statement provided one guy (without evidence) ran it. evidence variant less deadly, regardless vaccination status. know people still hospitalized. Thus far variant looks even dangerous delta unvaccinated. 90% effective. 100% could take vaccine took thsn countries like US, UK, France, Germany ETC would solid position. issue ICU already strain unvaccinated people atm, even small increase vaccinated hospitalisations due immune escape results problem.  Every time hear think sounds like transformer. Cool name variant. Makes Delta sound like little kid. right theory Omicron probably developed idividual infected HIV/AIDS Botswana, easiest explanation many mutations, hard evidence exist support theory yet. Hindsight 20/20. time wasn‚Äôt bad call. Problem still end hospital. wish people live happily, cannot skip vaccination pretend find place ICU there's magic pill take symptoms become super evident infectin risen dangerous levels. Glad hear travel lanes OPENING. move forward. closed! ‚ÄúSome protection‚Äù boosted individuals still 90% Delta. it‚Äôs anything like literally every variant we‚Äôve encountered past 2 years, it‚Äôs already it‚Äôs widespread enough us see without genome sequencing. shovel snow. Anybody remember 2019? Kinda blur honestly.... checked yesterday six flights per day direct Johannesburg landing Atlanta. Like countries? Like... USA better say ... SA 24 percent vaccination rate new variant? 

USA worst? one country giving away vaccine parts world? country? one worst? 

Get fuck here. Yup. US burned hard COVID mostly weekdays-only thing now. Unfailingly polite end. think bring us back March 2020, markets worried. kind feels like magical thinking. would ""just end""? major epidemics ended got vast majority population vaccinated (polio, measles, rubella, mumps). Things like flu mutated less virulent strains/killed lot people/natural immunity built up. 

What's say covid strains become less lethal? clearly mutating natural immunity likely work like diseases pretty stable target. says sorry become infected surprise. virus infection trigger autoimmune disease. diagnosed Type 1 late 30's (pre-COVID), we've seen huge upswing new adult members T1 support groups since COVID reared ugly head. Yet another reason get vaccinated! article seems assign lot blame. I'm sure agree conclusions. far remember, South Africa rejected AZ vaccine back Feb low effectiveness symptomatic disease South African strain time (B.1.351) vaccine require special cold storage cheapest one approved. UK used extensively. thought time delay wait alternate vaccine foolish protection serious illness seems important feature AZ vaccine had.  Delta South Africa? Someone complaining cancel flight 2 days ago blessing disguise. Hopefully stays away New England awhile then! Ugh Ahhh thanks correction. one US stock on? :) Can't wait see many people think make infertile, magnetic, autistic dead 4 years. Fucking derps. Get vaccinated, wear mask. isn‚Äôt something panic over.  inevitability I‚Äôm concerned getting sick. I‚Äôm concerned testing positive getting quarantined 14 days. treatment would always effective irrespective variants directed towards virus towards controlling cytokine storm responsible severe disease Possible evades antibodies better immune system still able knock quickly. way people supposedly ‚ÄúDelta‚Äù strain right despite specifically testing it? I'm not, either. father stage 4 cancer I'm everything keep getting sick. could mean things. could mean low testing capacity. could cases smoldering hit massive exponential inflection point start overwhelm population. could contracted transit somewhere. population may risk unidentified reason. I'm assuming someone know difference omicron Omega lol 1 please I‚Äôve commented several places since it‚Äôs usually ‚Äòtough guys‚Äô want deny Covid get vaxxed. one exchange learned purported medical professional like Covid toes, Covid dick thing sick patients icu. Covid messes circulation, root cause ED. ‚ÄúWorst Ever Strain‚Äù post seems like it‚Äôs representative sample. guess frustration articles. I'd get booster again, even told symptoms would 10x were.

I would, too. Getting vaccine (1st, 2nd, 3rd doses, etc.) protect me. helps protects everyone else serious illness death, too. pretty rough reactions 2nd 3rd doses. two days life time, survived permanent effects. I'd - much worse - heartbeat. 

I'm sure getting downvotes this? easy report lying ass bullshit comment. Ireland may many shootings, anything like England probably lot drunk patients attack staff. IIRC, crazy people like man story known problem already.

Ideally, hospitals need security personnel. beginning look like least need couple big blokes deal idiots/criminals. never quickly get past virus. 
Imagine selfish, arrogant, disrespectful would fellow humans. currently trials underway results expected soon publicly announce everyone wants flee spread disease three days so? Predictable result? lessons learned? Got mine recently luckily injection site soreness tired. One coworkers same.

The idea society needs cater complete assholes wrong. Democracy nice justice systems *not* created cater assholes. declare people outlaws. Pfizer first two, Moderna booster. 

Felt minimal symptoms. Bodyaches lasted 24 hours, fatigue. low grade fever. hope turns like Halloween episode came face face Gachnar: Bringer Fear. suspect Westerners get convinced 50 centers, especially said Westerners spend lot time partisan arguments already critical US government dealt virus.

They want show US bad light, perceive China's critics among enemies (the political right), defend CCP.

Although think it, ""convinced"" might right word cases. Maybe pragmatic ""enemy enemy"" situation?  Ashish vote replace Fauci. need fresher voice credibility.

Fauci good get wrong need rebuild public health community. jealous you. hate fucking country. You‚Äôre one crying post lol Pfizer, Pfizer booster. felt achy, tired feverish 1 day 2nd dose. 3rd dose achy tired, fever. got booster Friday evening work, felt perfectly fine aside sore arm Sunday morning.    flights Africa Vancouver all. links Delta vaccines? heard anything really done area.  i'm boosted work place require masks/vaccinations. mitigation measures substance right (when get fast food sit people usual bars anything, that's unusual time year). 

going forward though foresee conscious decisions limit shopping trips, nothing major  We'll know came Canada hear say ""aboot"" end sentences ""eh?"" BOS flights South Africa, anywhere Africa matter. South Africa barely got hit delta. talking about? allow irresponsible reporting! want street street counts! really misleading. soon lockdowns much implies soon since know enough yet. another pundit making living pandemic...  need skip class (assuming US), go normal business. maybe study alone instead group, maybe less late night mcdonald's runs, generally need anything different US omicron numbers released data serious cases among boosted individuals comes  Yea, saw AIDS: almost always need use cocktail virus mutate main protease evade single protease inhibitor. Agreed. link info G7 meeting? Yeah buying everyone couple weeks actually quite helpful. Unfortunately holiday travel could totally overshadow efforts currently underway. right now, early predict anything. know Omicron evades current vaccines cause concern not. 

Worst case basically back world without vaccines even Omicron evades current vaccines highly doubt means 0 protection instead lowered one. rock says.... yesterday behind circulated much less effective originally publicized... roller coaster ride.  Exactly, we've used protease inhibitor (with HIV) before. I'm aware HIV patient growing 3rd ear yet. üé∂I caught cron AAAAAAffffriccaaa

but think 2nd dose wearing out, get booster decide omicron release data it. Ireland generally pretty safe country. like USA, hospitals semi-militarized constant shootings. probably much security. Freud Lol. Ok. news people love it....vaccines work expected, shields. Ugh Duct tape bullet wound. Source that? believe wanna see proof. think due Delta anyone US ever successfully avoided vaccine mandate without getting fired?

My parents hardcore conspiracy theorists/anti vaxxers I'm afraid dad lose job IP attorney major company get vaccinated. saw notes written plans avoid (like website apparently instructs write religious exemption even though he's Lutheran church like 8 years lol).

Only argument see convincing one ever successfully 'beat' mandate, information would appreciated. often vaccinated population skew vulnerable. Hey source ""three winters"" thing? Genuinely, sounds quite hopeful would like read that. Cool thanks! Agreed, many syllables, better take want call that, sounds larpy Eurasian clumping ""partially vaccinated"" unvaccinated time. Since delta hit, know first dose provide real protection likely fades quickly.  data would really help ""Covid cases persons least 2 weeks 2nd dose Covid vaccine."" really tell us protection time. also need stop considering single J&amp;J dose vaccinated.

this fucking true needs serious consideration statistics. mention go approvals take months again. sort catch 22. open release data get it. course change recommendations wildly leads people feeling confused unable keep up. hold onto data see enough picture make educated synopsis people distrust telling data sooner. Oh, BTW, criticizing government xenophobic? criticism longer valid? means swallow words people offended tiny stuff. Maybe right *South Park: Post Covid*, future suck. Working home probablybably cuts lot sexual harassment. Honestly money world...and burnout real, matter give 10-15k weekly nurses now, nurses sick dealing shit :/  booster tomorrow. Would gotten 2 weeks sooner CDC opened general population sooner. Good bot Probabaly masks effect, would triple enforced. since doesn't, mere attempt baseline enforcement. Live life risk, expense others. Well course start mild, people discharged taking hospital beds could seeing revolving door well. Bigly. 6 month time frame around 6 months started noticing substantial drop circulating antibodies and/or overall resistance, based large samples. mean get booster earlier something bad would happen, likely need one yet extent limited (they ended being), would better let people go first. got current booster today, turned Omicron needed complete recode, there's reason take one three months. AFAIK, known safety issues. Russia Asian European? Anti-mask nutters shambles They're part innate immune system part first layer immune defenses.

Personally, welcome explicit caution like make statements, suggests we're learning something new (or working learning something new potential threat), better safe sorry, especially ""being safe"" literally piece paper cloth face wearing past 20 months.

For folks masking getting vaccinated, advisory going anything. Statistically illiterate people still understand vaccines masks *eliminate* chance infection. They're reduce infections make less serious occur. asking people grasp tall task, ""advising"" act way seamlessly fit binary view world certainly ineffective tact. Get vaccinated, get sick cured die. one three accomplished move on. 100 days get back square one global roll-out new product. 100 days get everyone vaccinated. 

Basically 100 days get us back December 2020. Northern Hemisphere hasn‚Äôt seen happens combine winter either Delta Omicron. Covid Omicron - False Hope.

But really said lot there, lot stuff direct research. I'm happy give relevant sources anything else I've said though.

The danger people misapply studies. Luckily, physicians risk averse, tend rely consensus many decisions. thinking thing. countries freaking this, I‚Äôm sure governments know right now. UK encouraging boosters 3 months 2nd dose now. imagine they'll test low dose times. 

I imagine benefits outweigh risk, they'll advise Omicron booster taken soon released.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes rush vaccinate South Africa. major outbreaks.   think like rather safe sorry. Lol, thanks that.  People vaccinated (such myself, I'm guessing you) also spread disease others. Vaccination reduces susceptibility critical illness stop spreading it. 
So yes, mindset. that's works. Rapid tests thrown bin. 

They don‚Äôt provide real security, especially vaccinated people beginning infection. Damn probably one immunized now. real defeating part see reason believe cycle going repeat years. Western countries vaccinated they're going get, developing nations still high unvaccinated (and time, ever) ie variant factories.

I think future variants going come substantially better circumstances this, means we're probably going see reactions. 
 
Well, typing one thing think Omnicron ends giant pile nothing, could free us cycle since it'll cause people view new variant skepticism. guess light end tunnel still. Maybe. background all. There's discussion avirulence hypothesis fell favor. There's also bunch criticism trade-off hypothesis since around decades, mostly trade-off hypothesis incomplete.

So first, second third order effects:

First order: tradeoff increasing transmission increases virulence things equal (Delta).

Second order: host immune evolution (vaccination lowers hospitalization death rates 10x-50x compared naive immune systems)

Third order: immune escape benefits avoiding host immune system vs. costs mutations fitness.

I interpret saying instead third effect, clear virus actually getting worse transmission hypothetical immune naive population (because immune naive population exist pathogen forced adapt). Stating law also restatement avirulence hypotheisis. third order effect may may happen.

Ebola probably example, Rabies another, viruses mostly animal reservoirs cause high virulence though. There's examples paper history criticism avirulence hypothesis. seem like influenza whole gotten less virulent since 1918 there's human pathogens tended towards less virulence, although treatments gotten much better time, difficult tease effects apart. Maybe indicates hopefulness towards long term evolution towards less virulence coronavirus well.

The virus could freedom mutate retain Delta's level transmission virulence even face need achieve immune escape. There's pangolin sarbecovirus spike proteins higher binding SARS-CoV-2 human ACE2 might indicate there's still lot room virus get even worse, achieve immune escape still bad. T-cells likely remain effective persist.  least could make somewhat scientific make everyone answer get people want complain Yeah that‚Äôs I‚Äôm thinking, that‚Äôs fuckin stupid IMHO.

Probably good time update vaccine code nonetheless... completely different antigen; almost every antibody binding point changed. ""More"" antibodies help they're wrong ones. B cells recognize new antigen still protect days. Oh god, real? aren‚Äôt talking symptomatic not, we‚Äôre talking hospitalization. need Google hospitalization means? LITERALLY said hospitalization hospitalization. Get grip.  schools universities still busy final year exams. parties belief music festivals planned Desember. 
Last year 2nd wave kickstarted similar music festivals. wonder ratio patients COVID need infect 1 case turns severe average. majority cases severe asymptomatic right? probably depends variant someone aware chart somewhere. Would definitely help way could draw extrapolations severe could be. Sure, new variant seems push get stabbed. Easy say tho, area heavily vaxed. right, things black white. Best judge. Safe say politics things Omicron still COVID-19, already mRNA vaccine makers primed ready update vaccines need be. Back March 2020 even know vaccine would made within 5 years. think alone makes comparison 2020 bit misleading.

Remember also current vaccines/boosters use made first run COVID, even mutations gone through, whether Beta Delta Mu, vaccines may varying degrees protection symptomatic infection still strong protection severe outcomes/death. mind understand vaccinated/boosted people relatively confident bear time. hope well well you.   I‚Äôm glad claim mostly retracted though. 

Has it? They'll look forward reinfection poor medical workers deal idiots like that. previous comment gave impression opinion vaccinated reasons wear masks anymore. showed CDC still asks vaccinated people wear masks. Y'know since groups every like disregard health authorities guidelines still recommend NPIs. Omicron‚Ä¶.hold beer. Remember started folks...""2 weeks slow spread""

Yeah, let's call safe built mini hut outside restaurant smaller restaurant pack everyone into. stupidest inventions history. guess depends definition ‚Äúfine‚Äù. You‚Äôre still alive kicking, got fine - doesn‚Äôt mean didn‚Äôt fucking suck though. 

Plus course need boosters. hey exactly here! sudden onset shivering, also went away hours. moderna 2nd jab. like giving people money get vaccinated? many countries actually want doses? take shot. Vaccination recommended even infected. think they‚Äôve said dropped 20 percent year states. hope I‚Äôm misremembering made want nice cold beer frosty mug.;) meant help, mandate.  it. Thanks finding it. care anti vaxxers  Detroit‚Äôs airport‚Ä¶what? I‚Äôm Twitter. linked another Reddit thread. point need accept covid always lives us vaccinated people need learn live virus. We‚Äôre point graph bordering misinformation presented context. isnt disease youre contagious youre symptomatic, problem. absurd people dont understand now.

If someone started bleeding eyes contagious starting point, pretty easy contract trace lock down. sick people would also go work carry like nothing, either. Theyd rightfully worried wtf going on.

If people sick week, infecting others, show symptoms, yeah... going worldwide time identified. even factor people think ""its flu"" overtly dont care social responsibility.

Literally anyone, anywhere world, small handful exceptions, literally anywhere else world 40 hours. Ive flown remote islands Indian Ocean USA less time.

So yeah, time omicron named already everywhere. feeling havnt met final boss Covid. data flawed. someone like reach conclusions based targeted sequencing beyond me. probably irresponsible set tweets I‚Äôve ever seen. Please get Twitter think might stat you‚Äôre referring UK: important note it‚Äôs measuring degree immunity - anyone antibodies present basically. includes people who‚Äôve one jab two-dose sequence, people mild case start pandemic, etc.

We already know people still able contract COVID - people fully immunised, albeit much milder case. However hospitalisation rates dramatically lower last year, infection rate previous level. yes, it‚Äôs still spreading still infecting, it‚Äôs lot less harm. 

What don‚Äôt know yet likely people still get infected 2x vaccines + booster + previous infection. whole population 90% that, might see kind dwindling numbers we‚Äôre looking for. Yup. listen people like well being.. seriously something wrong you. really, next time potentially dangerous variant emerges, unlucky country may quick share data. AKA asshole fat business man starts fights survivors opens door lets zombies in. 2nd moderna shot kicked ass. days side effects, arm soreness, swollen lymph nodes. sleep feverish move arm all. Lymph node stayed swollen like week.

Booster sucked day still swollen lymph nodes, much manageable. half-dose (as far I've read), side effects nearly bad. sure Pfizer J&amp;J. People even mask overall shut white collar jobs. Winter coming Lack education. 100% isn‚Äôt necessary. main point Delta burned SA Omicron appeared. time low cases coming Delta peak late July. kind fast decline without much vaccination suggests large proportion population immunity Covid, maybe lots undocumented asymptomatic mild cases. immune escape waning immunity, Omicron gained foothold. didn‚Äôt say crappy boss. asked. surges one city declines surges another. add things gets little flatter.  NY Times write headlines scare people reading articles? 

Narrator: yes Pandemics tend last what? 5 7 years? globalization wasn‚Äôt big couple years back I‚Äôd say we‚Äôre still start thing. depend virus mutates good creating reasonable treatment. sure hell hope 3 years time. shit caught late 20‚Äôs/now early 30‚Äôs, want fun maaaaan.  even hilarious - walked quarantine hotel, guard *advised* legal justification stopping them, already boarded plane (Spanish/Portuguese nationals) time head police found legal measures possible. Yep. Even ‚Äòmild‚Äô delta cases younger age groups, symptom affecting everyone. hopes what?

as stated above: keep variants out. think rest us want keep lockdowns restrictions home new variants keep brought travelers? want talk ""fair""... time western countries could prevented making sure rest world access vaccines

Can stop parroting bullshit? Vaccine availability issue majority world. Covid hardly affected us all. Keeping borders tight kept life basically normal last two years. 
And result mining north still going keeping economy going. Terrible analogy. paying taxes effect everyone worldwide unlike vaccinated does. Taxes life death like virus. couple weeks ago, Dr. Gottlieb saying we‚Äôre pandemic hump #cnbc patients seeing showed different symptoms delta.

The fact none small sample size saw lost sense taste smell is...interesting well. Hardly dramatic---Japan allow immigrants refugees anyway, new step exactly giant leap reaction concidering large chunk thier population vaccinated. magically breaking vaccines either news always tries push variant. fact Omicron looking less deadly spreads faster. natural course virus. travel bans toxic nationalism. better get quick mean tourism still limits? thought tourists allowed last month eased restrictions?

I tickets late March US thinking backup plans Seems racist Republicans office

&amp;#x200B;

What changed? 
Oh, wait. know Narcissism overload Goddamnit Wrestle Kingdom suffer this.

There important things worry course NJPW rough time COVID. yet social media absolutely flooded ""Omicron big deal South African minister said so!"" posts ü§¶ go work country cares healthcare workers prioritizes getting us shitty debacle. 

Lol that? Nowhere capitalist world sure. It‚Äôs much better Europe - well better US bar incredibly low it‚Äôs pretty much meaningless absolutely idea long variant spreading, idea originated, idea fast spreads. found cases linked travel Africa first that‚Äôs started looking first. 

Honestly, looking cases *from* Africa far spread across Africa already, logic dictates it‚Äôs spreading everywhere awhile. likely didn‚Äôt start first outbreak recognized. conditions perfect first outbreak noticed - Delta, cases really, higher normal monitoring HIV prevalence area. 

These cases would blended places wouldn‚Äôt noticed. Fucking sick shit. I've waiting get student visa since December 2020 finally anounce long staggered process entry students 8th stop halt processing new related documents time frame.  Alexa, play : üé∂üéµ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt start fire‚Äùüéµüé∂ Yeah, discourages counties honest if/when discover new variant. everyone waiting around someone else make announcement, that's long time circulating without proper response.  I'm pretty sure global push jab application effect new variants evolution. sucks able go, government mandated travel bans always refunded least given option rebook

Also depending credit cards booked with, could claim cluded travel insurance Oof. slow? Germany, look Nah mate renounce Aussie buy American media. Guess see soon outcompete Delta. Covid makes B SAD sad. sensible policy.

Secure homeland introduce additional chaos new variant.  place quarantines everyone coming country, combined strong contact tracing, might effective strategy buy time. banning flights South Africa (or places) useless. know everyone edge Omnicron news, tone people posting past days really concerning. sad reading comments straight suicidal, especially know anything new variant. give us want, raise temperature earth one million degrees day, five days I‚Äôve read might (or least neighboring countries). theory virus might ‚Äúincubated‚Äù immunocompromised person.

But doesn‚Äôt matter either. Closing borders viewed punishment.  Yes, finally arrested already seated plane ready depart. intentionally put people danger face criminal charges. Good point, good point.  Eligible population sounds reasonable. Kids 5-11 eligible countries yet tho may yet test Omicron

That's nonsense. process sequencing different, outcome.   I'd venture say real leadership federal government much longer. think become glaringly clear past 8 years. Futurama friend, always Futurama. NZ lot tourism Covid? now? curious folks stay afloat one suggesting viruses ever mutate less deadly. since COVID continues spread people symptoms likely evolve less deadly.  Nah it‚Äôs true, masking isn‚Äôt going forever thing. can‚Äôt be. Crowd size restrictions, distancing can‚Äôt won‚Äôt either.

I guess see impact new strain has. Initial observations seems point incidents severe disease vaccinated people. Maybe vaccine escape, generally less harmful. Maybe not.

Where live, indoor masking since October. Vaccine passport since October too.

I think that‚Äôs honestly do.   Nice, that's roughly 20k passengers per week least 10% positive Covid compares Dutch numbers... 2k infected people week... no, that's problem whatsoever.   MaDe FaSt, FaUcI pUt 5G    necessarily true spreads anyone knows infected‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ US could better vax rates, argument there. said, US vax rate per capita double South Africa (24% v 59%). it‚Äôs lack supply; SA stopped shipments coming due lack demand. No, they‚Äôre probably people aware there‚Äôs selective pressure virus less severe *if virus transmissible symptoms appear*. 

HIV, example, still nearly 100% lethal untreated. Also keeping mind vaccination rate Israel one best world - might make sense avoided severe cases covid. Japanese scientists recently theorized reason cases dropped dramatically likely due delta variant mutating extinction chance. 

If indeed reason drastic drop cases, think want take chance omicron. Oh I‚Äôm following. Thank you. SA vaccines. 
Their people don‚Äôt want them. Wow wow wow! Wow. bothers me, perhaps irrationally. Original shots, booster shot, flu shot, potentially another months. want 5 shots year. lot.   Agreed. unbelievable far behind booster campaign compared neighbors. France already opened enrollment anyone 18+ getting nursing home residents. ""You count Americans right thing, exhausting possibilities"" - Winston Churchill high cross immunity natural infection. However, cross immunity low COVID could fork two strains!

Also flu still bad. Also mutation still possible.

Get vaccinated already get boosted able. article Japan tightening restrictions, implying commenter can't see grandparent due this. they're likely saying even though would able see health wise, can't. It‚Äôs vaccines work? It‚Äôs getting people vaccinated. want impose travel ban countries unless 75% vaccinated. hopes what? 

That‚Äôs going convince population get vaccinated developing country majority people jumping onto plane traveling abroad.

Vaccines available, locking unless healthcare system near totally collapse. [Ah, Omega Ignorance? Vaccines work. Countries low vaccination rates breeding grounds variants. Variants spread countries travel. Therefore allow travel countries high vaccination rates. logical approach. link dead can't access website... weird. Might end tho..   hierarchy goes:

Hybrid immunity (infection + vaccine) vaccine natural infection Yeah SARS like covid-19 would screwed.

Firstly Chinese government way incompetent back 2003. would never even know Wuhan. Let alone get RNA sequence within weeks.

Secondly MRNA technology quickly produce vaccine. 

Finally, remote working would impossible significant scale. internet slow software good enough. question. Omicron strain proves much milder symptoms, would best encourage strain become dominant harmful ones? Kind like selective breeding.

Sorry, resubmitted without link got automatically removed. Looking ‚Äúa reliable source‚Äù now, preferably raw data.

Even Japanese citizens returned negative tests isolate 10 14 days. Non-citizens can‚Äôt enter. 

They high level vaccination help. downvotes. may wrong. inconceivable South African government may ask veto information publicly released? 

What advantage making information freely available severely punished punishment almost scientific standing? Politicians make call, scientists. Well lockdowns worked well every time country, definitely try again!! Fucking idiots Futures green. Lol. happened Friday anything worry about. 

Lots options sold/exercised sold Greeks wanting decay occur weekend. 

Fuck spy gonna keep going up. can't ways. say, already everywhere, sounds like even without burned bridge catch fast enough. cares takes extra week two next time still going hit whole globe anyways.

Sorry, resubmitted without link got automatically removed. Looking ‚Äúa reliable source‚Äù now, preferably raw data. Agree. overreacting better reacting. allows us gain time answers. sad vaccines actually work (and variants) subjected phizer‚Ä¶ playing money games lives like it‚Äôs nothing birth new conspiracy theory ... maybe.... Yeah, certainly does. 1918 flu incredibly dangerous first time swept through, one normal flus. pandemic lasts everyone infected 2-3 times. point, people made good adaptive immune response risk severe covid reduced. need another Animal Crossing help IMMENSELY spread. Dear lord people desperate vaccines less effective are. 

No vaccine 100% effective. mask 100% effective. always covid risk, it‚Äôs going away. It‚Äôs time vaccinated people live again.  necessarily. idea yet omicron triggered antibodies effective strains. plan add infections omicron without reducing available hosts older variants. make sense, official guideline german RKI, evidence based vaccination recommendations. shown myocarditis 30 year olds happen frequently moderna vaccine compared biontech/pfizer. ""not much can/are willing do"" 

Willing key. 'gig' Saturday yet. Delta's flaming up, this? ""Can't social distance mosh pit"" moshing seems really really ill-advised, even omicron.

Because people can't chill thing actually dead never going over. Self-fulfilling prophecy. rush 'back normal' going delay actually getting 'back normal'. Fully agree. New variants inevitable. Media went crazy crazy articles, no-proof statements. many breakthrough infections.

Efficacity gone 90+ 13 Delta kinda manageable (read priveleged) countries

Funny enough severe strain ones contagious nothing done.

This one extremely mild symptoms yet close borders want stop article, half patients vaccinated.

In country 25 percent vaccinations would mean vaccinated get infected twice much.

Which proves first point breakthrough infections.

Don't panic, Omicron free cure replace Delta.

Only ones companies profitting vaccines.  realize animal population trumps human population... right?

Yep. I'm pointing nuances. likely cull industrial-level farming livestock? Nope. chance. I'm hopeful better farming practices living conditions livestock would result less disease, I'm optimistic considering sheer number farm.

I suspect likely people get vaccinated reduce pool humans virus infect. also need consider COVID-19 here, now, primed infect people strains commonly hosted animals still need make jump humans, like COVID-19 did.

Anyway... wrong. I'm pointing additional nuances. That's all. Kids rarely get sick virus. long you‚Äôre vaccinated you‚Äôll fine link showed even US CDC recommends using masks even vaccinated. point?
If conclude happens countries thats problem.

I understand emotional NPIs, nobody likes them, science clear needed. tourism industry SA begs disagree there... Also detected Israel, HK, Canada, Belgium, Netherlands. travelers came places like Nigeria Egypt, probably countries well. certainly USA already, holidays happened, may hear couple days. 

Pause air travel 2 weeks. countries honest enough capacity sequence large amounts data. large countries like USA, pause domestic air travel well slow seeding regions. 100 percent success rate. take liberals According article, future: ""A preparedness plan would reach globally next situation like COVID19."", ""The international community work together ‚Äútowards new international treaty pandemic preparedness response‚Äù build robust global health architecture protect future generations, world leaders said commentary published March several newspapers around world."" realize real consequences ignored vast majority people. Physical health impartant mental health yet mental health considered even little. going whole generation young people permanently depressed, traumatized, low social skills, actual, real effects last decades come. important? lives young people done everything asked last two years lives people refuse take vaccine. 

This choice need make. What's bad grammar random capitalization? say ""all football team \*are\* sad"". No, back early 2020 people dying virus. prevent spread, that's old news. *help* prevent spread still spread it. Plenty posts literature /r/covid19 interested. possible new variant takes that's easily transmitted mild. Maybe answer big question African covid outbreak went advice make sense, reason 28 year old stick another vaccine compared someone 31, Moderna widely rolled people ages making even non-issue. Anyone thinks ends way everywhere, community transmission beyond naive.


We're back point needs physical distancing, masking, high vaccination rates, importantly mass focus testing/tracing stablize. Trump locked it.  trying keep borders open implement border measures? sort treaty talking? wait til graduate, get live debt lengthier shitty experience.  kids aren‚Äôt old enough vaccinated OK massive negative effects?

The tourism industry suffered lot 3% economy actually thriving travel bans.

Businessmen use zoom calls postpone meetings.

Politicians use zoom calls well.

People wanting return home South Africa impacted quarantine process available? We‚Äôre speaking Europe. We‚Äôre speaking US. link US CDC. early call variant affect vaccinated though, idk youre harsh 5s extremely unlikely get long covid. logic, wearing mask constantly protect kids whooping cough RSV. Beta also never became dominant variant countries restricted travel SA. can‚Äôt say sure travel restrictions reason, I‚Äôm sure didn‚Äôt hurt. shiny new variant, travel restrictions, ""everyone stay calm plz"", new season Tiger King. Whoever running simulation must dark sense humor.

On serious note, right I'm actually worried omicron could society, sense community, misinformation intake. They've decided even prosecute them, let alone give maximum possible punishment. both. Sending vaccines places without vaccines something protect people waning immunity... hospitals germany, european countries fine. Vaccines prevent spread. Stop spreading misinformation. Covid zero never happen always risk. NPIs feasible long term solution we‚Äôre pushing amount time we‚Äôve using them. 5s aren‚Äôt vaccinated yet get long covid. Omicron looks like spreads easily vaccinated people care risks babies little kids? Places prepare, high risk, close borders Southern Africa.  Hospitalizations far important cases. hospitals area fine. Vaccines prevent illness we're seeing good preventing spread. science evolves, we. virus care policies, gonna gonna do. best keep up. apparently isn‚Äôt common knowledge. got weird fixation lol.

Tell what. I'll continue vaccinated masked distanced, things focus obesity. Let's see one us gets hospitalized Covid first. see need airplanes social contact?

People returning home countries, still can. need quarantine. 

This travel ban going last years. couple weeks see dealing here.

Surely people wait couple weeks travel?

I suppose worried impact tourism industry think many tourists going South Africa pandemic anyway? thanks keep protecting yourself. Czech ""deniers"" (pop√≠raƒçi). word used Holocaust denial. want say that? I'm sorry took lives alternative let people run free spread/kill others. We're lose/lose situation here. Nobody winning. Oh look, thing thing years, now. opinion drop NPIs solely rely vaccines unscientific also radical. ""im vaccinated dont care anymore"" bubble understand.

CDC quite clear masks even vaccinated incidence higher 50 positive rate you‚Äôve fully resume activities prior pandemic. reduce risk infected Delta variant possibly spreading others, wear mask indoors public area substantial high transmission. areas high substantial incidence say that. said media frenzy relation lambda. ""verge of"". calls quite number politcal scientific figures getting loader loader day. working student visa, would recommend finding backup plan tourist visa omicron sure less lethal transmissible makes sense us want spread like wildfire become dominant strain.... US acting like covid gone already. I'm starting see people wearing masks (myself included) get silent judged/ridicule looks right thing. say warn people. coming together. Please tell six friends I've lost via taking lives suck up. Wait, can't. they're fucking dead. agree. Redditors fucking unhinged lmao get boosted. It‚Äôs hard. 100s places go you‚Äôre worried. 

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. I‚Äôm playing going South America end December I‚Äôm going get boosted before. Nothing worry about, nothing paranoid about. acting like adult. 

The paranoia comes media people nothing else afraid something Irn bru prescription think so. sane government would try limit spread omicron test citizens it?  vaccines. Anyone wants one get them, don‚Äôt want mercy covid. someone unvaccinated gets sick, that‚Äôs damn fault. Vaccinated people punished.  Oh get it, don‚Äôt test it, won‚Äôt there. Although seems continually getting worse. 9 deaths/week/million 3 long ago cases another 45% week.... Canada now, too. UK Canada, USA, thus pretty much everywhere already. Naah... country proven way many cases average country, would do? Would keep gates open try shut them?

I understand loosing lot money, instead raising pointers SA try vaccinate citizens Countries also slapped travel bans UK alfa found. India delta. normal. Oh it‚Äôs Canada US anytime now. I‚Äôm guessing New York sometime today. Damn. Pro se Maple syrup.  That's release bunch storage. two extremes. That's personal responsibility important factor largely determines laws regulations put place, people continue lack integrity. Society cannot function people think social framework designed help keep society run smoothly. Vaccines way out. one, aside radicals, going mask rest life. Society you, us. Wish people realized that. pandemic convinced public health officials need take least communication classes. course, douting effectiveness vaccine purpose prepare body similar threats. worried Omicron might indulge harsher symptoms weaker bodies myself.

I hope Omicron dosent become big thing Exactly. doubt it, cats bag now. She‚Äôs going back in. might 14 day quarantine though Problem punished politically seems like overreacting right. cynical, fact. countless articles circulating beginning discussed studies lockdowns 1918 pandemic, found strict, early lockdowns far less damage every way piecemeal, half-assed approach we've done covid.

If actually want cynical, let knowledge affect view humanity extent decide ability learn past societal level illusion. Because, knowledge experience exact thing occurring, well case studies avoid it, still took exact same--or arguably worse--approach, ironically led conversation whether we're cynical thinking known better. goes.  try use time well, think life. gets chance get stuck room 7 days? gift! Quarantine negative, there's also positive aspects

My parents got Taiwan, mandatory 14 day quarantine, regardless vaccine status, nationality, etc. think there's test clause. They're enjoying big hotel room right now, supplied meals. Hotel staff also brought wifi booster since standard wifi great. course it‚Äôs here, it‚Äôll dominant variant Christmas. plenty cases happening delta. long vaccine still preventing symptomatic severe illness there‚Äôs need panic. anyone know means monoclonal antibody treatment would ineffective? Hopefully means Omicron spreading throughout Nigeria, symptoms causes mild people seeking testing/going hospital. yet article ends vaccinations still work basically. Lol. We're fucking tired. Sadly disease give shit feel it.  Antibodies: archers wall
Virus breach wall
Tcells: knights keep slaughters invaders  What? vaccine preventing symptomatic severe illness it‚Äôs exactly it‚Äôs supposed exactly it‚Äôs already delta. Source? First I'm hearing Next time country discoverers new variant think twice reporting this.

I hope real possibility. 

Hey wait‚Ä¶ make mistake before? Spanish flu. need qualify financially free legal aid. worldwide scale 2 years mild. Death common. 2019 Covid 58.4 million deaths worldwide. large number people died Covid people would likely died comorbidities short order.

Based hysteria level generated people think Covid leading cause death, yet increased worldwide death rate less 5% think point government pretends know. Fauci, Trump, Biden, Harris, CDC, contradicted earlier statements ""certain"" of. believe lot people would vaccinated would honesty get go.  Oh gee golly wizz. would expected this?? judges kinda people dont want piss off. I‚Äôm waiting someone show difference fatalities variant vs delta one‚Ä¶. ,at point, African countries ones still travel ban list. Yea, 35. Also 20% HIV-positive. ok thanks clarifying

""elective"" would normally something kasse probably even pay - voluntary could live quite normally surgery performed. Might also apply style surgery solve real problem somehow unusual covered kasse (ie style surgery would elective common approach would solve problem).  

this sounds like ""necessary treatment"", say, immediately life threatening ok putting off? 

I dunno - surgeries scheduled months ago anyway? can't think type cancer could comfortably wait months, even normal times.

What word German kind surgery look details? India yet South Africa surplus vaccines. thing outside country go war South Africa force everyone get vaccinated choose death gunshot. 

Any solution must come South African government itself. Outside countries place this.  buy time? variant clearly already every country ban comes place. Delta also rocked Southern US earlier summer, wrecking states upper Midwest (Michigan/Minnesota) states NE high vaccination rates (like Maine). Anyone else burst laughing bad news comes out? 

At point we've original Covid, seemingly improved 2020 summer/fall followed fall/winter wave, hopeful vaccine announcement... Massive vaccination campaign super low numbers Delta variant smacked us soon start handling Delta Omnicron pops may potentially undo years progress.

This absurd awful even energy get upset, exhausting. anyone insure plane tickets due Covid shut downs? Customer pays x dollars service. Due unforeseen circumstances, company longer keep promise provide service date requested. Company issue refund. No, it‚Äôs company y‚Äôs fault also didn‚Äôt actually anything money received. theory residents still come back honestly even procedure come back pain I've heard enough horror stories people denied entry I'm willing take chance. humans dead. heard radio 35% SA vaccinated? Tl;dr Rapid tests still work. feel hypothetical architecture part proposal. group created stop one deal become another power grabbing hand? happens time. quaratine hotels usually leak real security mean would point like use passport without quarantines/testing/dealing travel bans yes care. fewer fewer people unvaccinated never infected. Look Delta wave UK - hospitalization death rates way lower past. US less vaccinated still saw pretty high levels hospitalization death, infections wave plus ongoing vaccinated reducing number people immunologically naive covid. substantial Jewish communities Israel S. Africa lots travel two. macrophages example? also allowed business people in

Nope. students allowed olympics

Only athletes coaches. open basically every country

Literally japanese residents.

So yeah, open all. Might impact different geographical areas differently too. people US I‚Äôve seen ICU past several months aren‚Äôt picture health exactly, ditto people declining vaccine time (significant overlap two groups) omicron might hit pretty hard. 

I‚Äôm talking old fat Americans refuse get vaccinated wear masks - wasn‚Äôt clear. Japan going back edo period  Depends much higher transmissibility Delta. Hospitals inundated predominantly unvaccinated x2, X3 10x transmissible, even less severe. 10/10. fear ""Lrrr, ruler planet Omicron Persei 8.

Rather simply continuing ""wear mask"" blanket statement areas 85%+ vaccination rates, I'd argue need answer two key questions:

1) supplementary estimated benefit mask usage top protection infection, lower rates symptomatic illness faster viral clearance vaccinated individuals?

2) increase large enough justify policies mandate mask usage?

In unvaccinated population, obvious require mask usage indoors. incredibly highly vaccinated population, becomes much trickier assess. Optimal public health solutions may odds realistic expectations compliance, proper usage realities everyday life. separated plastic barrier different part plane, also everyone wear n95 masks. can't forget little information point, rightfully assume even people symptomatic may positive.

I believe enough info **model CoronaVirus behavior** predict infectiousness physiological impact. capabilities point, NIH, CDC, infectious disease agency utterly failed us preparing whatever future variants occur Alpha definitely Delta. 

Therefore, see heavy-handed measures go effect global scale quickly, something conspiracy brain says something up.

I've moved country several times suddenly stopped moving country 24 hours absolutely devastating. People scrambling homeless. funds many cases, relying starting new job study. Completely heartless move. Oh, makes sense Japanese nationals can't carry omicron.

:( Oh look, another clickbait headline. Covid variants sure good selling advertising. late that. done Corona Virus first hit didn't.

The proverbial cat bag try keep up. matter do, Corona stay. set Covid sanatoriums unvaccinated. concur? Thank information! trouble googling terms make helpful. Original article [here] caveats study. convenience sample 108 people showed post-covid clinic. results might reflect bias women might likely follow clinic men. comparator group, like non-COVID post ICU clinic, suggest women likely seek medical care men.

Additionally, study assigned phenotypes patients clinical gestalt. I've done phenotyping work, approach lacks rigor. possible clinicians assigned phenotypes might subconsciously biased assign women fatigue.

Additionally, inflammatory markers assessed systematically, meaning clinician bias could driven decision test inflammatory markers, leading ascertainment bias.

Another limitation study account censorship death. Men [more likely COVID women. possible men might become ""long haulers"" died chance manifest symptoms.

I think study misleading, authors acknowledge limitations, educated reader infer rest.

This another problem science journalists taking small study context. study, itself, provide sufficient evidence women susceptible COVID long term symptoms. don‚Äôt know everyone acts like lockdown even table.

Because Fauci talking another lockdown due new mutant strain appeared Africa. point, do? everyone that‚Äôs still unvaccinated point much time many incentives get it. I‚Äôm vaccine mandates that‚Äôs takes - anything get travel restrictions masks. 

Let ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù die that‚Äôs takes. can‚Äôt let hold rest us back living. deserve live full lives. Anything get ASAP. Sigh, sadly turned political football. Politician's knee jerk reacting introducing bans willy nilly, drop hat, probably going years come precedent set. mention far new variant showed mild symptons... Interesting way analyzing things, although per follow tweets we‚Äôll still need wait see know means Ok....so mild hospitalizations also turn lower...even upon unvaccinated  guess I'll wait longer visit beautiful country accept I'll never able go. Crickets... I'm hoping vaccines come soon 5s. I'm everything keep little guy safe feel like can't comfortably breathe gets vaccinated. total NUMBER cases South Africa also rising quickly. hospitalizations percent total cases actually rising? matters. MUCH HATE.

ITS FACT !
Jesus guys start researching basic statistics.

But yeah... thats woke right ?
Gtfo We'll confirmed cases US within days. worries. Easy mistake make - ya learn something new every day! Colorado checking in. ER's longer allowing walk-in's I've heard stories people call 5 hospitals finding one room deal non-COVID related injury. point lockdown, know is... Uhh annoyed ü§î There‚Äôs guards yes, didn‚Äôt legal right prevent leaving. Legally speaking, one detained quarantine requires special new laws Netherlands. 

They arrested mayor gave special decree. convenience sample 108 people showed post-covid clinic. results might reflect bias women might likely follow clinic men

yeah study might saying women actually go doctor think we‚Äôre far gone years say ‚Äúeventually wont care anymore‚Äù cause almost 2 years still care it. really thought time everyone already wouldve moved on. see even years still pandemic care :( person also posted  
so maybe great source Again, good chunk others, recall specifically headed. correct, really know severe couple weeks. lab techs allowed time off.... until...lol thus last weekend.  perfect storm. correct. would work better confirmed pre-departure post arrival testing mandated countries going forward. Setting PCR validations end connection cross check. stop covid nope, blunt travel aspect yes. whole goal slow spread. Nothing do. Locking work 1 member family unit could take months fully burn said house. genie bottle now, build safe guards around it. shut travel south Africa, no. mandate sort cooling period entry yes, monitoring due variant yep. huge unpleasant pain ass us. Ya'll ""piece fabric face"" might easier time it, us unbothered it.

Basically wear glasses ten times worse, sort skin sensitivity worse again.

Don't judge everyone's response masks point view. I'm glad masks issue many us are. I'm justifying anything, way oversimplifying issue gotten worse 40 years people like refuse accept solution shit work. need find something new, stop treating fat people like shit. pops may potentially undo years progress.

Check Chise twitter. whole square one thing complete bullshit. reminder, South Africa starting seasonal wave Covid. cases increase actually delta. I‚Äôd like see breakdown hospital numbers possible.   would effectively quarantine long enough know pre-symptomatic. thought headline written kid bad grammar realized name team. Dont get got much hate... frikkin agree whole another level. jabs alone wont make it.

Got 56 year old smoking big heart surgery all. Stopped 3 months smoking.

Now saying.. got vaxxed right need worry stuffin mouth best choices fried culinary. 

For real ? Can't go back, quarantine? Oh, broken system horrible someone trying save life. horrible. Early pandemic, masks beginning worn US, people intentionally coughing grocery job like mask. One spit face. something even horrible things someone trying save you.  PREPARE QUICKER TRANSMISSION, MILDER SYMPTOMS, 50% DECREASE NETWORTH, WORM Oof. looking good ""mild"" variant. 

Now essential questions... Age patients? Vaccination status (SA 24% vaccinated sadly)? vaccine long ago last dose? Anyone previously -infected? Co-morbidities? go war. hope everyone prepared. Countries wouldnt suspend travellers South Africa based media reports, know know. Go explain 12 monkeys thing? We‚Äôve five day weekend government holiday that‚Äôs US specific. Public health departments getting going week. sample 2 severe symptoms first couple days since diagnosed. saying people obese deserve die COVID? That's stupid sounds. restrictions UK deaths heading down. Secret two jabs Astrazeneca, 12 weeks apart, boosted Pfizer 5 months 2nd jab. long gap mix-n-match vaccines really works. side.. confirmed death due it. 

Down side..  yet.  sticking together. like take pandemic seriously time telling everyone else take seriously 6 months say 5 doses!

Said Guy forgets know new vaccines varying levels efficacy Influenza literally single year similar reasons... It‚Äôs state level decision end day anyway. I‚Äôve said elsewhere, lost aunt bowel obstruction er full. sent home three times died. still makes blood boil.

A dear friend mine life-changing surgery delayed notice, unending pain isn‚Äôt reason enough get right now.

I‚Äôm mad unvaccinated, sure. I‚Äôm also mad for-profit healthcare system. Capitalism killing people we‚Äôre nothing.  someone inside answer: nurses try negotiate contract leaving? Like ""If increase wage X% I'll quit"" quitting without negotiating? Would interesting know.. think level restrictions China achievable and/or desirable United States rest Western world? sacrificed youth protect old sick. It‚Äôs time flip that. wear mask? piece fabric face. harm way. Might well wear even benefit small  Yes, us vaccinated. Protecting willingly unvaccinated lost cause point. 

We asked youth sacrifice much protect old sick, vaccines it‚Äôs time old sick take onus protection onto themselves. vulnerable protect n95 masks distancing, vast majority population protected able live fully. Think safe say variant everywhere now. Shocked confirmed cases variant found US yet. Tldr: try close barn door horse bolted. COV-3

Well that‚Äôs fun think strongly discouraged majority family/friends want meet up. However, really wanted (go see play, listen live music, go fair) shut down. Gtfoh Fucks ""News"" reliable source information  24 hours me. rough! initial shots Moderna second one knocked too. justifying simple curable issue.

Seems stuck 'have vaccinate stop spread' mentality can't admit possible. read comment responding to? Got Moderna booster yesterday. Moderna first two felt bad second shot expecting time. felt tired afternoon bed got intense chills shakes hour. finally calmed got sleep woke mild chills body ache. Now, 24 hours later, feel mostly normal again, little worn out. T-cell ate many shoplifters. feel sorry you‚Äôve faced have. 

 Covid locums, starting NYC March 2020. First assignment horrific. Saw 2 patients leave Covid ICU alive three weeks constant rotation 33 beds. never get things saw. year later, worked Covid step unit majority patients actually recovered went home (not even going mention long Covid). therapeutic me. 

I also work local icu initially, quickly found far harder emotionally helping different community. 

I wish best I‚Äôm searching new field finding peace this. Thats point, variation going make mRna vaccines ineffective. work way, maybe need booster worst case otherwise vaccinated people fine. way much fear mongering going on.  Increase hospitalizations children 2 years old bad itself. Right back ya ;) Fackin FACK I've time now. Biden says doesn‚Äôt plan using lockdowns winter. Sorry title, Omicron, Omnicron, naming starting get pretty confusing virus Exactly. really wanna cry cant seem anymore. much even worse 3rd world countries kind never gotten taste normalcy since start covid. Like we‚Äôre open schools next month new variant comes out. really words. csnt describe feeling anymore. think Japan bad example travel restrictions founded science. closed borders nearly foreign entry. I'm sure people could argue that's going far something, impossible deny significantly restrict chances omicron infected people getting Japan. 

Other countries immediately banned travel South Africa surrounding nations only...and completely founded science. South African scientists *detected* variant, best world DNA sequencing. like South Africa hotbed variant emerged spreading South Africa rest world. *That* thing that's founded science. variant everywhere. Punishing nation discovered sequenced first reactionary craziness. FACK!!!!! one reporting cases US yet, wouldn‚Äôt surprised discover it‚Äôs US end week.   Every obese person America knows still obese, obviously many many outlying factors involved. information common knowledge decades problem gotten worse. sure. Whatever helps feel better fat people. Good luck  sounds like already lost containment battle.  

UK good surveillance quite well vaxxed. Wouldn‚Äôt 10% passengers tested positive covid literally dispute though?

And global air travel industry minister health informing parliament researchers found infections likely caught wild?

Enlighten me. article exist? worrisome isn‚Äôt omicron. It‚Äôs vaccine efficacy. Virus mutates time people getting omicron variant, matter time mutate again. need buy time get ahead virus unds mutations. thought might case.

I personal dilemma (admittedly making). announcement makes eligible now, officially 5 months since 2nd AstraZeneca does. would make no-brainer get booster ASAP.

But less 3 months since totally record third (Pfizer) dose.  3 months would mid-December. appeal (perfect timing maximum protection Christmas). hand current protection level theory already higher most, perhaps time wait little maximum long-term effects. Oh, well, thanks correcting me. Glad put straight. one way find out, go lick doorknobs lol. Unless friend test antibody levels  think South Africa amazing wastewater monitoring. detecting Pretoria also Nelson Mandela bay Metro 1000km away even spike. excellent quick response.  logic, international community charge CCP 5.2M counts manslaughter. I'm work can't look around recall couple people Australia asymptomatic. others that's one remember top head. stated Mr.Winters.

Yes that's correct one said it. false equivalence drawn choosing unvaccinated obese. attempt point out. Delta go away limited territories, went away everyone still vulnerable caught tons people died. South Africa nearly 0.5% excess mortality course pandemic.  60% urban seroprevalence *before* delta wave, wave (despite vaccinations available then) increased tested death total 50%. 85% population immunity (similar Mumbai bit lower due population density) combined summer (non-AC country) Delta steadily dying off.

Delta still steadily dying off, even Omicron growing prevalence 5-fold per week. Delta Omicron cases scattered every city, every part Johannesburg. said, mitigation techniques regardless strain. Vaccinated, mask up, social distance wherever possible. Countries implementing measures decreases cases matter variant surging. much variance application protocols surprising neighboring states countries could wildly different numbers cases without new variant cause. believe so. scenario... someone FDA approved vaccine granted priority non FDA approved vaccine? another countries vaccine? 

You see muddy waters. cut dry draw first line. What's best course action then? I'm guessing travel ban like meme dude slaps band aid big water leak lol areas South Africa low numbers still, true, think it‚Äôs safe say spread rest country too.   got swollen lymph node well side injection arm. wonder that‚Äôs common side effect booster  parent small children, agree.

I tell you, lockdown kids NYC 2020, winner screentime. Screentime won. I'm panicking preliminary, yikes so.

If Pfizer's data readout age 2-4 vaccine study comes year planned, FDA CDC accelerate processes authorization.

Some age group essentially spent entire lives status unvaccinated restrictions entails. Sounds like even may soon enough stop Omicron infection. adding significant disease problems...

(I'm still angry Boosters slow walked FDA/CDC here, relative peer countries believe evidence strong good amount time already every vaccinated adult should, may, get booster)  one visited new Zealand ever again, sank sea Well, one powerless citizen world along Mr. Bat's Wild Ride another, appreciate country sorry response governments.

Abstract 
Background: aimed establish acute treatment protocol increase serum vitamin D, evaluate effectiveness vitamin D3 supplementation, reveal potential mechanisms COVID-19. 
 
Methods: retrospectively analyzed data 867 COVID-19 cases. Then, prospective study conducted, including 23 healthy individuals 210 cases. total 163 cases vitamin supplementation, 95 followed 14 days. Clinical outcomes, routine blood biomarkers, serum levels vitamin metabolism, action mechanism-related parameters evaluated. 
 
Results: treatment protocol increased serum 25OHD levels significantly 30 ng/mL within two weeks. COVID-19 cases (no comorbidities, vitamin treatment, 25OHD &lt;30 ng/mL) 1.9-fold increased risk hospitalization longer 8 days compared cases comorbidities vitamin treatment. vitamin treatment decreased mortality rate 2.14 times. correlation analysis specific serum biomarkers 25OHD indicated vitamin action COVID-19 might involve regulation INOS1, IL1B, IFNg, cathelicidin-LL37, ICAM1. 
 
Conclusions: Vitamin treatment shortened hospital stay decreased mortality COVID-19 cases, even existence comorbidities. Vitamin supplementation effective various target parameters; therefore, essential COVID-19 treatment. 
 
Keywords: COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; acute respiratory failure; cathelicidin-LL37; cytokine; vitamin D.  Unless missed something, Pfizer point, right? Last heard, 90% cases region O, Delta decline. Seems like pretty reasonable jump armchair conclusion omicron causing hospitalizations (people make policy decisions obviously higher standard evidence recollections twitter graph days ago + less napkin math).    10% hospitalizations though, high age range compared waves/surges, mean little  transmissable may also mean people get sick time, even though less lethal. Thus becoming even larger problem.   covid experience less mirrors mine, although terrible body aches addition 4 days. Appreciate response booster.   No, minimum interval still 6 months US. Unless you‚Äôre willing lie say it‚Äôs first dose health insurance won‚Äôt official record etc. many people Twitter pushing preventive actions pursued supposition.  Nah, they're year old independently mobile they're pretty much toddler. 18 month old already around often talking. They're really infants point. look chart Mina posted, relation wastewater lab confirmed cases see summer wave cases followed quickly wastewater, lot seem (so far) wave. population. completely safe warranted worried side effects. Men 30 arguably get smallest dose allowed anyway rare mrna myocarditis side effect. 

Don't get Moderna, bigger dose Pfizer. J&amp;j measurably less effective booster still many *times* better nothing. Back sure anymore vaccines widely available.  Today bet actually means lot. means hospitalizations rise. That's shows. Makes sense. Two things possible. government SA speaking truth variant severe. Let‚Äôs forget case covid, mild includes pneumonia etc  took full 72 hours (nearly exact) time got booster felt like veil lifted immediately fine. 

I don‚Äôt say scare, rather comfort case you‚Äôre still day two. Everyone told 1-2 days kinda panicked woke day 2 still 100%. guess that‚Äôs hoping for. Hospitalizations South Africa truly skyrocketed last couple weeks, doubt variant extremely viable threat public health health care systems. Yeah I‚Äôm arguing that. I‚Äôve seen thin 25 year olds sick get covid. two ends spectrum.

But people see fat 60‚Äôs antivaxxers, also masking up. Thin people better, I‚Äôve seen. would imagine they‚Äôre overall healthier like said. well said Nassal vaccines researched variant article although similar trend occurred third wave delta dominant say I'm struck seriously Omicron taken.

Personally think ability work remotely important especially people get sick. easily one key factors preventing another pandemic really concerned similar case like ""Delta"" variant? Yeah, honestly, I'm ""blue"" area fwiw think people would agreeably go back lockdowns, masks distancing unless really drastic turn events (like, tons kids started dying something). collective elected officials know that. One last question you.

Are multiple fully FDA approved vaccines yet?  asked date registered Walgreens.com pharm tech looked vaxx card assume checking date put third shot data.

If really want get third shot 5 months, there's plenty ways. lie say immunocompromised folks currently authorized 3rd shot initial series. could also lie identity get initial shot (not recommended Moderna initial shot larger dose booster).

But pretty much stick guidelines see much need jump ahead even countries things slightly differently. Headline bit misleading irresponsible. SA pattern surges, due new one. variant driving it? Maybe? Would surge rise hospitalizations happened without variant? probable.

National emergencies usually mean special laws circumstances. One Feb. 2020, knew lot virus transmissibility? 

Another found handful modeling studies Ebola SARS, nothing evaluated impact actual ban implemented. 
 
Some evidence suggests travel ban may delay arrival infectious disease country days weeks. However, little evidence suggest travel ban eliminates risk disease crossing borders long term. 
 
Our ability draw conclusions across different studies reviewed limited small number relevant studies. urgently need research area understand whether travel bans control measures truly effective.

And first article relevant, concern bans work-- rather stigmatizes countries report honestly. 

Countries like NZ implemented works one going misreport data get NZ. cell immunity escape showing computer simulations. much lower county US, excuse are.

Guys, there's lot needs parsed make conclusions whether ""scary"" ""just plain bad.""

I know sucks, wait actual experts (re: epidemiologists public health statisticians) get data. run around twitter looking truth. expect WSJ CNBC NYT provide truth right now.

The truth going take time.

The good news far appears vaccines remain effective least reducing risk severe illness, get vaccinated get boosted. read specific data point much matter right now. noise. actually 8 page PDF document, 2 web page suggests.  So... clickbait title. enjoyed Heavy Rain well enough. think senior managers thinking ""well go office life, everyone else too"". Oh, got it. actually read everything ignoring whole part discussion say line important.

Okay, regarding line(which irrelevant never took Hippocratic oath), FDA approved vaccine would irrelevant. FDA currently recommend people EUA vaccine go get FDA approved vaccine. basically, nothing new. Please note: article include proper linked sourcing data, detailed hospitalization rates information beyond alarmist headline also notes ‚Äúalthough similar trend occurred third wave delta dominant‚Äù  Absolutely. see years administrative pay skyrocketed, number administrative positions skyrocketed Healthcare provider staffing decreased stagnate salaries. administrations rife nepotism complacency towards struggles staff actually make money (the doctors, nurses, respiratory, xray, etc...) what's putting patients danger. Germany's cases increasing reason believe Omicron cause it. Different areas get hit different times based sorts variables. Weather, lockdowns, etc.  I'm still angry Boosters slow walked FDA/CDC here, relative peer countries

Depends peer country, suppose, least region country. Quebec currently public plans boosters anyone except old, immunocompromised, others particular high-risk professional roles exceptional situations. vast majority us would gladly take one offered, time way so, slowly otherwise. Sonny Cher? Vaccines still widely available there. Like delta...that worked well. Sounds like children 5 getting 3 ug doses trial, compared 10 ug 5-11 30 ug 

In terms progress idea unfortunately. Pfizer investor chart said ""4th quarter 2021"" data readout 2-4 trial. research done J&amp;J booster vaccines? mom got 2 doses Sinovac back march-april J&amp;J shot July act booster, wanna believe could effective 2 j&amp;j doses found anything using J&amp;J booster receiving 2 doses another vaccine. here. Seems pretty common post-booster Unfortunately think going outbreak unvaccinated. Delta, vaccines gave us solid protection infection *and* slight protection transmission infected *and* high protection severe outcomes infected. could completely losing first two third one now. since highest-risk groups vaccinated, infections group could end high that's group (despite vaccination) account hospitalizations deaths.

It's sort thing see Delta already. 95-99% 50 vaccinated, rather 18 vaccinated. end hundreds thousands cases 1/90,000 death rate unvaccinated under-18s, cases 0.8% (for people 50s) 15% (80+) death rate vaccinated older people. People 30-50 largely vaccinated, accounting nearly cases *or* deaths.

But Omicron could back seeing case rate across vaccination status. severe delta breakthroughs (we still idea, though there's good chance less), general requires level hospitalization breakthroughs reinfections, we're going problem. sure mindset comes deaths NYC still lowest point they‚Äôve point pandemic. want wait for? Lockdowns *followed inaction regarding antivax anti-mask morons* merely delay inevitable. Mandate vaccination individual home quarantine ending fully vaccinated.

Ramp vaccine production much possible, enact ban international travel transport kinds following preparatory period commerce industry. Roll vaccines globally. already there, letting people leave help much. People seem realize scientists say vaccinated people suffer mild symptoms become infected, means get hospitalized.

That's pretty important piece. worries youth cases. Especially since fully understand long term effects yet. What's also concerning unexplained neurological issues reported long haul cases  I'm explaining again. Focus. look like omicron less, same, severe? would think that? Oh saw this. can‚Äôt stand Ding.

Omicron mutations less competitive compared variants would likely outcompeted. know Omicron competitive general transmissable/or additional advantages current environment (like ability infect vaccinated individuals). know spike protein heavily mutated without terribly compromising virus...... Yes remember empty stands? Japanese citizens weren‚Äôt even allowed attend. 

They made special rules athletes regarding testing masking well limiting allowed travel. foreign athletes closely contained Wow. point exact conversation say this. seems like happened made claim omicron transmissible hospitals slammed asked transmissible relates severe disease don‚Äôt know answer. actuality don‚Äôt know hospitals slammed made up.

This dumb soft recommendation doesn‚Äôt help clarity messaging. That's case cousins. There's particular person family want vaccinated therefore holiday plans completely thrown off.

I hate it, too, one graduated, two others becoming teenagers, it'd fun see see grow spread wings they're held home particular family member who's part problem world right now.  problem remains unvaccinated

Aren't problem one themselves? vaccinated, they're problem you. People wearing masks anyway, maybe need wear places now. going work restaurants bars? lol, okay... concerns me. Earlier month family got sick kind nasty respiratory virus, sick varying degree like 1-3 weeks straight. youngest (he worst symptoms), husband got rapid test, since that's available area without 10 day wait. figured whatever one family member had, (We 6 young kids there's plenty germ spreading happening, despite best efforts). tested negative COVID rapid test, went got tested days later, negative, assumed seasonal cold, stayed home, limped it. Sent kids back school started feeling better. 

Cue following week: One one start getting letters kids teachers notifying us close contact/exposure confirmed COVID-19, need quarantine. Thanksgiving get notice there's large outbreak school, grades 4K-6th grade (every classroom kids in), they're shutting school weeks contain it. 

Now I'm wondering...did COVID? source school outbreak?? would beside myself. wonder possible retest rapid test samples provided, PCR test instead? Really sucks learn rapid tests (barely?) accurate. ‚ÄúAdvisory‚Äù, mandate though. big deal, better proactive businesses want require cover fire (assuming I‚Äôm reading right). Sorry, ridiculous panic porn. New York City data bad all. 7-day average daily hospitalizations low ~30-40, positivity remains 3%, cases hospital admissions even remotely previous winter surge current increase transmission rate slower late summer Delta. two variables play here: transmissibility loss sterilizing immunity (NOTE ALARMISTS: LOSS PROTECTIVE IMMUNITY). Assuming 5-day serial interval, 85% population immunity Johannesburg, 5x weekly case growth makes simple 2d line. assume 0 loss sterilizing immunity get 3x transmissibility. assume 100% loss sterilizing immunity get 50% transmissibility. reality could anywhere between, number breakthroughs we've seen (most European cases breakthroughs) points toward 100%/50% end spectrum. Hard pass. Vaccines available, time return normal. wear mask flying, wears want. Keep strong firend. still best years ahead done! turning bit nothingburger? laws cover citizen entry detainment condition entry. 

They camp outside airport front door arrest got warrant out. 

The US would need make quarantine evasion illegal happen. there's enough Democrats happen unvaccinated individual want vaccinated that's choice

And employer private public institution want put customers workforce risk due unvaccinated patrons/ workers require proof vaccination continued employment/ access, that's choice! know, seems quite relevant knowing done lab much faster billions years random mutations.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* No, necessarily good thing. It‚Äôs another step towards endemic, it‚Äôs *more* infectious, potential overwhelm hospital systems yet due fact people becoming infected chances hospitalization, even it‚Äôs LESS likely hospitalized (if Omicron less deadly) still balances hospitalizations, since people become infected reinfected chance hospitalization. 

Even it‚Äôs smaller chance time around may less deadly, way people rolling die may infectious, end surge hospitalization anyway.  understand y‚Äôall acting like recommendation means nothing meanwhile trump reamed recommending .  great sign stopped announcing vaccination status new infections. Call local health department. Correct I'm wrong, think that's think happen ""long term"".

A virus likely become endemic becomes less virulent contagious, kill host population, keep spreading.

But mean possible outcome. There's chance could turn super deadly contagious version, would wipe big part humanity.

It would disappear years, everyone would dead, less lethal version could stay around centuries, like flu.

But we'd still dead. Worse that- go back 150 years+ 1 5 live age 5. don‚Äôt know everyone wasn‚Äôt crazy grief (or maybe were). Eh, maybe -- lean hard direction. Health Canada formally cleared mRNA vaccines third dose, stopped short actually recommending doses yet (though they're expected eventually). 

The biggest tensions kind policy decisions federal vs. provincial level; absence recommendation directive Health Canada, provinces charting path certain extent. understanding third doses already cleared anyone 18 older Manitoba wants one, Ontario seems likely make widely available January.

Choosing different path new Quebec, though. example, back start vaccination rollout, province broke others (and federal, international, manufacturer-provided guidance) prioritize first doses impose three-month interval recipients eligible second rather three weeks whatever standardized Pfizer US. Similar practices would eventually end adopted provinces, varying degrees, Quebec alone this. 2% case positivity rate overwhelming majority mild breakthroughs‚Ä¶sorry pure alarmism point. course we‚Äôre going bit jump colder months - ground zero COVID US last year‚Ä¶and even last winter managed get surge better most. dunno, seems pretty alarming  Selfish virus fuckingover life? Yes others might worse diminish struggle make selfish upset it. though? Delta currently makes almost 100% cases Ireland (where I'm living). unfortunate get hit one others.

Is looking like Omicron might something similar short period time? look data. complete joke. bonus nothing done pandemic ""raise"" cut bc inflation. early see statistics, seen far mRNA vaccines effective vs variants, understand mutations already seen variants. guess serious illness/death efficacy stays roughly same, antibody response decreased. Thus breakthrough cases mild asymptomatic. Welp, much ""contagious harmless"" variant many people trying cope on.

for unvaccinated people. anyone weird smell issues?

I sick month (vaccinated) sense smell come back. smell Italian restaurant mouth water. gross smells still kind weird.

It totally freaks dog's poop smells same. bad smells similar gross stench. like musky oily smell. sound salty it.  sounds mostly correct. think doses micrograms instead milligrams though. data, going zero tolerance omicron fear-mongering.

As /u/adotmatrix said, ""This article include proper linked sourcing data, detailed hospitalization rates information beyond currently reads alarmist headline. 
It also notes 'although similar trend occurred third wave delta dominant'.""

There sufficient number cases justify even alluding demographic breakdowns, age otherwise. mean get it. Perhaps EFD alarmist but... early say anything. 

Even he's wrong alarmist lol. unvaccinated people Could variant formed 100% unvaccinated population? Thanks! love foresight strategic national reserve maple syrup PPE.

Well seeing person talking states (specifically said ""state""), talking washington state, Austral states far know.

Even banned purist definition non essential travel, would get everywhere core trade / technical travel. 


Air travel safe, caused this, would've filled different process anyway. 



The real defense vaccination, distancing, masking, contact tracing, testing. Forcing people go back half-assed, shitty zoom happy hours slap face fully vaccinated replacement real socialization. Yh theory likely due omicron makes sense. They're probably afraid 2 doses enough fight omicron alone know booster significantly help protection Delta. 

Not mention also help keep Delta bay. Given cases sky high Delta imagine idea may dealing Delta/Omicron time they're fearful could significantly increase hospitalizations. boosters could hopefully help bring Delta Omicron truly bad they've got lot free beds deal omicron. hope variant isn‚Äôt bad feared

The fear matters regards restrictions. also don‚Äôt know alien virus grow head consume you. mean, it‚Äôs possible, right?

But scientists trying signal public media months thing describe zero percent chance happening. 

Why people still act though it‚Äôs real possibility beyond me. scientists talk ‚Äúimmune escape‚Äù, mean maybe knocking points efficacy infection, crazy never-before seen thing like describe here.

I‚Äôve really built symptoms head I‚Äôm nervous tomorrow. covid December (mild symptoms) full vaxxed March (no symptoms) reading bunch Reddit posts, I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôll feeling sick. 

Any suggestions/stories calm bit? is, probably while. US known variant sequencing, many cases everywhere foregone conclusion everywhere big numbers. vaccine passes use. SA heading summer, winter. I'm surgeon, want thank done pandemic. nurses basr large brunt stress ‚ÄúThis PEN‚Äù process intuitive people, body get exposed Covid vaccines, make antibodies custom-tailored particular spike, makes whole range antibodies, sort ""anticipating"" future mutations.

Source part? I've always assumption vaccines induce antibodies t/b cell immunity based spike protein KNOW about. 

If spike protein changes enough, I've always impression work well gonna hope body normal immune system fighting thing. Tcells, b cells relearning new spike though even vaccinated. US can‚Äôt get shit together digital pass talks medical centers verify like I‚Äôm Europe. Regardless think digital pass right not, real verification want real nice. Honestly understand US ever lifted mask mandates (well actually do, political sub); much harder put measures back justify leaving place bit longer. 

Most Canadian provinces still rescinded mask mandates public places, neither many countries; I'm exceptionally happy didn't. viral spread approaching trivial levels, leave damn masks carry life. really hard wear one. Likely info publicly released yet. Money keeps lights friend. shut everything people would *die*. term seen often ""planbare Operationen"" (any surgeries scheduled advance).

You correct cancer surgery, got two different news reports mixed up, one cancer patient whose tumor surgery postponed clear alternative date, one person different condition whose surgery scheduled far advance. Sorry bad wording. Masks make sense indoors. getting vaccinated. Combine two end whole thing. 

Until see numbers way down, wear mask, even vaccinated. reminder, diseases there. Flus, colds, coughs etc. serious bout flu put people ER. areas high Covid rates, anyone raspatory diseases going take lot resources would normal year due COVID precautions already stretched thin health care system. However, even mild cough, spread, really devastating effect families kids day care schools. schools allow kid school even mild fever cough. Suddenly, would day home chicken noodle soup parent needing take 2-3 days paying doctor's visit Covid test + waiting results symptoms clear. 

So, wear mask. keep safe, stop person wearing spreading diseases. Triage common medical practice.

Thank much What's complicated this? I'm confused would government do, sounds like friends coworkers confused regardless.  Cotton... Good news even current vaccines end working well new variant, mRNA vaccines easy change need go whole approval process again. could new vaccine little 6 weeks. Exactly. part, everyone I'm constant close contact with. I'm mostly vaxx'd area.

Stop trying cheer up, I‚Äôm trying get doom on. hundreds thousands medical epidemiological experts region, somehow managed keep opinions themselves.

Literally everyone worth paycheque said ‚ÄùWe don‚Äôt know‚Äù.

Now comes along says nothing burger, literally everyone ran fucked opinion piece.  Delta still around. totally agree. actually ridiculous written. Damn guess get go home year either. Damn sucks news. lot talk 2019 Bushfires American media well. political leaders urged citizens get vaccinated. think people lazy arrogant. government provides free healthcare social welfare programs people African countries completely shocked see. Everything comes easily. 
I asked one individual got news reading mobile phone. showed site OAN.  really spreads fast many get targeted solution shipped current vaccines good shot something.   lol numbers ""doubled"" 1% positivity 2% ... rich, mean people well off. So, probably like upper middle class so.  actually know Omicron going associated immune evasion, even does, guarantee tailor made Omicron vaccine effective already have. Moderna tested Beta specific booster developed, found effective original formula: (Slides 28-30) effort direction. Beta also genes associated higher immune evasion, sort like Omicron. 

This process intuitive people, body get exposed Covid vaccines, make antibodies custom-tailored particular spike, makes whole range antibodies, sort ""anticipating"" future mutations. called antibody affinity maturation one reasons vaccines made Wuhan original spike still work well newer variants like Alpha Delta. clear, process happens natural infections, too, vaccine give important head start. think sides speculating much right now. Seems lot epidemiologists happy source information OPs post. Meanwhile also news articles [like quoting doctors ground Gauteng province saying vaccinated individuals overwhelmingly experiencing mild symptoms.

We know sure situation couple weeks. Early indications suggest vaccines continue work well. real. Anyone thinks masks going come back full force places paying attention 24.1% South Africa vaccinated. yeah. end day, (each country's) weighing risk vs benefit (mainly $). tough call, every country. Jam packed people showed fake vaccination ""proof"". That's inequality vaccine distribution. feel like EVERY TIME stories/numbers posted, leave numbers out. It‚Äôs annoying - super important context. Victim blame much? deal you. miserable 36 hrs turned corner Love downvotes. Exactly said article. Also delta-driven third wave, hospital admission age 19 jumped 43%  lets loo like something respond also really anything respond going piss people (like mandate). eh, headline might rest article explains nothing alarming. remember 10 years ago high school hearing nurses, doctors, others medical field would needed retiring boomers. supposed job highest rising demand natural causes, pandemic. Imagine hearing 5-10 years ago become nurse take care elderly day. Instead, work education face international pandemic overworked, underpaid, risk life, people regularly die. feel sorry we're sold false future. feel sorry need sold they're passionate. Whether still not, nobody wanted left paying bill fair. fault? Again, clear giving observations transparent population. law conduct says someone ground emerging situation can't relay experiences news outlet? Nobody respectable said, ""Oh, well one person experience small sample size let's move on.""  


The official, scientifically correct, line enough data say anything definitive. Nothing changed front, nothing get data. Couldn‚Äôt said better  sign Pfizer shot CVS 2 weeks instead next week.

You gotta careful schedule way ahead. Man feel this. nurse 8 years, healthcare 10. worked way telemetry high level step units travel nurse, left bedside year half try corporate opportunity (not fan) went back bedside ICU Jan. 2020. critical care nurse, getting CCRN, going NP always goal. dream clinic specialize telehealth medicine reach risk underserved populations. 

Fast forward almost two years working covid-19 ICU I'm quite simply done. I've seen things able unsee, manage intubated patients' sedation OG/NG oral meds ran IV sedation meds (e.g., Propofol), witness death almost two years encounter lifetime. Thing is, that's broke me. tragic, could rationalize it. public's reaction (screw applause nonsense shift change wearing masks), management's reaction (here's granola bar), family's reactions (let's trach peg 98 year old grand dad history COPD, CAD, three heart attacks, CKD II, local support network since live side country time yet) eventually got quit. I'll put front quite bit help others, refuse risk family's safety people blatantly disregard care notion others health safety (or matter) directly affected them. used humanist heart believed everyone capacity goodness empathy; now, I'm sure. shaken me.

I'm working 100% home case manager perfect, put family risk risk physical safety flipping proning 400 lb. patients two flat sheets instead proper proning/lift system. One day maybe I'll go back finish NP program I've already spent thousands on, maybe I'll suck learn decent programmer learn python something.

FWIW far alone I'm sorry situation. i'm ya'll. 

states lock lock regardless biden says year, like trump administration like would potential hillary bernie bush presidency.

unless think world exactly almost two years ago, one president reamed something another one something. seen ""raise debt ceiling"" discussion one side ""reamed"" two years ago. 

whether that's right wrong somewhat immaterial since anyone ""reaming"" biden right locking looking science anyone ""reaming"" biden right considering lockdown recommendation going listen anyway ever recommend it. Maple syrup reserves never expire.

We PPE reserve got set promptly forgotten SARS pandemic I‚Äôd suspect long UK lot variant monitoring nothing detected past days. 77 available Omicron genomes South Africa Botswana. **This yields median estimate common ancestor Oct 7** (95% CI Sep 19 Oct 21). seems consistent first detection sample 11 Nov. Maple syrup withdrawal symptoms national crisis bosses going pick work employees refuse settle shitty jobs?

My work adamantly working remote long time. pandemic hit, went 100% remote... Efficiency increased, productivity increased, KPIs went roof, revenue record-breaking... work fortune 500 company. Since then, company done 180 remote work - We're remote-first company, new hires hired remote employees. 

Bosses want whatever want, unless they're able work dozens underlings, matter end day. guess don‚Äôt feel like getting vaccinated, sure. I'm tired Tim. least people boosters, probably going bad; it'll like 2 shots instead 3 maybe. terms symptomatic infection, could bring us back WT without vaccine levels, terms severe disease still order magnitude safer thanks vaccines Omicron WT. antibody treatments update new variant Pfizer pills approved (if already been), we'll even better terms severe disease. 

If scary seems, we'll likely variant specific boosters rolling March (at least places like US). point, we'll back ahead even terms risk infection. 

 
So reason get upset (unless &lt;5yo children... although still early upset even case; still need data) even reason upset, upset change it. make sure gotten 3rd dose vaccine continue wearing mask. OTOH pandemic continued getting worse refuse vaccines... vaccinated/boosted, *fit, young* likely big deal.  doubting intellectual authority Sailor Roo Scout? Majority unvaccinated it‚Äôs issue supply since country turned away shipments. lot doing, sadly. Yep. I‚Äôve seen one many grifter already threatening ‚Äúsinister‚Äù spin omicron solution full scale lockdown stay home order probably helps, better alternative, don‚Äôt know better alternative become available. Except indoor bars restaurants jam packed.  right- worse lol can't man. can't fuckin it. can't really socially distance middle mosh-pit. 

Then one else fuckin mosh pit right now. Plague Pestilence.

What? üòÇ

We‚Äôre definitely currently looking. 100 percent guarantee they‚Äôre going arrivals Africa looking PCR tests dropout like every country. Gauteng province. densely populated province South Africa. plenty townships there, place township. people least likely get symptoms. Super athletes, incredibly good shape, young double vaccinated. start seeing surges medium severe symptoms people like would bode poorly general populations. South Africa incredibly young population. Brilliant. basically pointless discussion. can't bothered communicate ideas effectively come sounding like new-wave holistic wellness nut wants replace vaccines exercise. immunologically naive unvaccinated population without kind precautionary measures, gauteng climate density? Probably R18. 

But don‚Äôt know. SA high level past infection don‚Äôt know immune escape is. Based wave seeing Gauteng, R15 population. 

It higher lower populations depending impact vaccines, climate, density factors. 

In China may HUGE R0. police said people, claiming get fine? Yeah this, watching us lose kinds staff since start pandemic location. Coming area that's still hard hit 4th wave, end sight point we're understaffed, far behind waitlists/patient care going get worse.

Pretty straight forward ya dronie  Proof countries bad geography, USA. live 3rd largest city America. We‚Äôve back masks since summer time I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs 95% followed close 100% grocery store. guess depends upon whether community cares one another. I‚Äôm glad live place takes seriously. COVID-19 burn out, shithead management burnout side Covid. Hospital admin among worst people planet. paid, qualified. jackasses suits reason healthcare system need handle this. Unless could lock effectively eliminate COVID planet altogether (something became impossible March 2020), see anything would helped. We've already seen many regions across world get COVID cases almost zero strict lockdowns, rebound thousands shortly lifting restrictions. supposed work? see clip discussion mild cases, uses limited, anecdotal data reprimand various governments limited travelers SA?

The former heavily reported on, latter points making not. overall agenda absolutely relevant interpret intentions. I'm sure men likely either tolerate long term disability without speaking it, roll die. What's plan variant evades boosters? Tell everyone got vaccinated asap sucks suck wait 6 months get new omnicron booster? Force everyone keep getting boosters every months perpetuity? even safe? let us vaccinate infant-4yo fucking done this. Vaccines infant-2 supposed coming spring *COME ON*. vaccinate son done shit going vacation I‚Äôm ‚Äúafraid‚Äù Covid way I‚Äôm ‚Äúafraid‚Äù drive drunk. respect others, don‚Äôt take stupid risks put lives danger. That‚Äôs fear lol really know go making less thankless. Dickbags going dickbags. Nice people going nice people. is. dim fearmongering bit: vaccination rate really low South Africa especially young adults. quarter ages 18 34 South Africa vaccinated. plays large role too. system unenforceable it‚Äôs bad system. CDC saying adults get boosters asap. 

Not inspiring lot confidence regard protection infection, honestly. 

Hopefully transmission much worse protection severe illness affected. 

Thankfully I'm boosted well family. Hopefully means mild illness us if/when get it. worth, sources stay still get booster shot, rush. doctors still say get booster seems. unless received Monoclonal antibody treatment, free get booster ""recovered"". 

We know hybrid immunity provides stronger immune response, regardless, waiting time getting booster.  


Best article find Depends look it. Temporary travel trade sanctions return global community sends need help sustain within country. keep people inside, chance spread beyond country drops significantly. know could real world paper makes sense. Ok, Sonny Cher, humanity hubris, aqueduct, sanitation, roads, name iconic duo. got 3rd Pfizer shot (booster) oh well, come may. psych called someone like this? mean, survive treatment. problem infrastructure deliver doses, apathy amongst populace believe order officially say it‚Äôs effective vaccine 50% effective going talk talk, made legal unvaccinated sign waiver chosen vaccinated choice foregoing hospital care event Covid? unvaccinated fucking health care might need future. B

This happening RIGHT NOW. know people denied care hospitals full. They're trying find opening states, still able to. 

I'm sure others know people died waiting care unvaccinated clogging hospitals. Sadly, also know bunch unvaccinated people would hurt policy, they've almost 2 years come terms reality. God's sake, actually read two links posted?

Both said data know severity Omicron.

Stop spreading misinformation don‚Äôt therapist meds. It‚Äôs bad it‚Äôs mainly meds make emotions less severe, makes sense. 

ICU passion don‚Äôt see going les critical settings. 
I fighting it, least trying to. 
We many people quit rest us picking extra shifts almost every week. 
I working 4-5 12hrs shifts week that. 

Hope staying safe. obviously take eat drink, rocket science Maybe pay proper wage? I'm convinced lot upper management pushing return office past 2 years, they've around wife kids ever can't stand virus politicized. Disinformation aimed public social medias allowed it. keep moving goalposts? Unless want disagree sake disagreeing. eagerly wait see current booster protect Omicron. Honestly i'll turn 27 next year, technically holiday working visa 30... know 30 situation change better. doubt.  
I knew since 20 whole climate change thing would fuck future like... really hoping pessimistic. guess not. Chicago, we've mask mandate since like August want say (?), wear mask restaurant, wear table, take off. think supposed wear interacting server, *some* restaurants may tell ""please mask interacting server"", experience 95% servers even care 99% patrons even bother 2 drinks so. 

So there's argument ""mask mandate"" restaurants merely illusory. definitely get that, still favor mask mandate general public spaces, I'd rather keep mere illusory places opposed carve giant exceptions allow people exploit wearing mask really be. Ask doctor source saying similar things re. children happened Delta wave? due new one? even get half long low baseline delta surge... incredibly unfair characterization individual‚Äôs credentials. also variant South America emerged one shouted ‚Äúracism‚Äù. 

So many emotional ignorants can‚Äôt see forest trees.  defence, thought part Italy Look criminally misleading headline. Literally says Moderna says current vaccines effective Omicron. Article proceeds say moderna‚Äôs senior medical officer said Moderna vaccine MAY evade vaccines. absence word ‚Äúmay‚Äù headline outrageously irresponsible. Triage? legit component healthcare system. going protect change triage system provide lower priority unvaccinated? Lots firms QT, internal audit external audit requirements. does, metrics show thing. Higher amount work getting done fewer errors, remain less critical- 2020 2021.  young population vaccinated gets cold I'm good it. Although could require months exclude quantity long Covid problems new variant bugs  What's bad news? hospital corporations paying shit wages nurses support staff many restuarants mandates exist: table eating drinking, rather walking around wear mask. perfect, mitigation reduction rather prevention. You‚Äôre right - nothing won‚Äôt work either. we‚Äôve scratched two extremes list, maybe it‚Äôs time add nuance explore spectrum possibilities exist in-between? Escaped wrong way looking it. variant probably circulating months identified recently. know look it, finding right? 
Would surprised retested dating back early October Got couple friends there, think biggest complaint fact happens, causes interruptions, mad anyone particular it. Mindset seems be, ‚Äúhey, people staying healthy, get told stay gone week sudden, is.‚Äù  Judging comments here, people rushing confirm want hear: significant threat (in terms severe cases). we've learned chill dismissive takes new variants really know point. layers. applied relief lower courts first district court asking relief Supreme Court. think issue way lot travel restrictions implemented always seem exceptions. making exceptions, may well restriction all.  I've worked home years cool seeing friends used commute 2-3 hours per day suddenly much free time themselves.

I mean someone tried take away would super resistant well, mental health benefits slog way city huge. call ""jabs"". Use word validates antivaxxers message. Insanity Tell fda. It‚Äôs supposedly spring next year we‚Äôre parents pissed Yeah, doubling time week, 10 cases buys 3 weeks ish time vs 100 cases Exactly. even California variant one butthurt it. Also South American variant ‚Äî didn‚Äôt get butthurt either. Another RT here. haven‚Äôt seen nearly much rest since going PRN know terrible last two years (and everything before; burned long pandemic, first wave broke me). hope find way put well-being first. therapist? reduce hours move sleep lab somewhere less Covid exposure? scheduled go back 3 days week January 10th. Really hoping pushes back April/may. can‚Äôt imagine flu season omicron management continue stick going back month‚Ä¶ Yeah group friends look Israel/UK data point. 

The FDA/CDC usually steps behind them. orgs weren‚Äôt designed pandemics scale need act fast. surgical technologist considering career change. thanklessness field tiring reached top mountain. 

The hospital work giving employees $1,000 ""bonus"" (really please quit incentive). three years never received bonus desperate staff. 

My previous hospital said give ""financial well being"" payments whatever, money year worked there. amazing, though, found million dollars give CEO. pandemic doubt culture changed. Couldn‚Äôt agree humans world proven selfish lot unfortunately Fear feat redditors lmao Ah understand saying now. initial statement plaintiffs rejected SCOTUS ""because required federal statute"" kinda nonsensical referring reasonable accommodations (because fact federal statutes require reasonable accommodations really reason SCOTUS reject case). That's cause confusion, glad we're page now. us Delta breakthrough case full vaccination? 

Can‚Äôt seem find information handle (if still need booster, long need wait infection it‚Äôs safe get booster, etc.) also time SA's summer wave. Almost exactly time last year.

Just something keep mind extra variable this. Yea, ""mild"" covid. 1 week 104f fevers, chills/rigor, loss taste/smell mild delirium, walking challenge. another week feeling like shit I'm lost 15 pounds. 2 weeks missed work. 

Granted early on, vaccine time, work healthcare. point is, classified mild, sickest ever been.   checked today. it‚Äôs five. live too. wanted die flu 

My whole body hurt...hell HAIR hurt (obviously hair roots)...I get bed almost 24 hours finally literally crawl bathroom pee. one go long without peeing?! virus actually differentiate like that. occlude 80% travelers getting country statistically reducing spread rate significant degree. Technically strategic provincial reserve held Qu√©b√©cois. People always justify high executive pay bonuses hard keep good experienced talent ( /s case), never seem prop actual in-house workers logic. Another thing note, South Africa going summer uptick, regardless variant currently driving going seasonal trends. Unless several super-spreader events last 4 weeks caused trend upwards, definitely ***potential*** indicator something infectious spreading there. shift behavior, provide enforcement violating mandates. creates overall shift many people wear masks, limit overall community spread. think people get wrong end stick there. Closing countries, open travel others achieves little.

Closing *every* country quarantine measures move obviously achieve lot.

People read something disparaging first, say countries attempting latter playing politics, no. That's right - least perspective Western Aus, we're still 9 deaths pandemic, borders large part managing particularly without restrictions internally. Cannot say serious joking. poster correct; point restricting traveling sort lockdowns. booster yet Moderna 2nd shot knocked 2.5 days (avg. Two days social circle whoever got Moderna. Biontech folks really mild reaction like one day). Drink lot fluids try eat time. gets better! Yeah.. nothing transmission rates death counts. Yeah, right. Even companies said 100 days development something, head still foggy.  global industry air travel, zero attempt dispute it.


You're simply failing see forest trees article exists. Forever masking insane. Sometimes diseases sometimes they're inconvenient even deadly, endemic cold flu viruses worth never seeing faces again. happy mask Covid novel, happy mask [100 days Biden asked I'm happy mask visiting elderly feel sick still go out. no, forever indoor masking absolutely much ask everyone. point they‚Äôre making doesn‚Äôt trigger secondary immune response data that. Saying would trigger secondary response pointless. Nurses work clinical trial management pharma. Way cushier job imo unvaxxed still disproportionately choke hospitals still account majority spread. would call ‚Äúa variant panic.‚Äù KF94s Korea popular long time. see people walking around standard streets Seoul. Almost absurd getting flu shot every year. /s Delta still far dominant variant US still main culprit driving hospitalizations deaths. 

Reducing effects Delta make whatever omicron brings manageable, even ends bad delta. Plus current vaccines likely still effective Omicron. UK said thing narrowed window 3 mos. Israel France 5 mos. Like poster touched upon, waiting 6 mos effect new booster even safe? I've done two six year olds. went well prepared games, books, movies. All-in-all bad, I'd rather again. :) SA people go stay (AC) summer? one friend tested positive Covid three weeks ago, tested last week got result ""Equivocal"". I've never heard result before, know means case tbh...

Other friends got (12 total outbreak), one thing common- initial rapid tests PCR's first started feeling negative positive week symptoms getting worse getting tested again. Omicron variant coronavirus appearing likely detected New York City day now, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday strengthening city health department‚Äôs standing advice New Yorkers ‚Äî vaccinated unvaccinated ‚Äî wear masks indoor public settings.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doubling it, basically,‚Äù Mr. de Blasio said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time re-up advisory make very, clear smart thing point.‚Äù

Masks already required aboard mass transit hospitals schools, Mr. de Blasio stopped short making mandatory indoor public spaces. said indoor dining would continue before, vaccinations required guests, city‚Äôs plans New Year‚Äôs Eve celebration Times Square would still move forward.

The Centers Disease Control Prevention recommends everyone wear masks public indoor settings wherever high rates community transmission. New York City suburbs category. I'll gladly protected perpetuity. another shot every 6 months takes, cool.

If would prefer immunity wane think getting poked every 6 months much, that's choice. Seems case. [""Boosters rapidly restored memory B cells cells important long-term protection  said times billion!!  NU Part testing modified vaccine, required, included testing mixes current iteration vaccine. may necessary currently vaccinated people wait modified one tests well recently vaccinated people. Generally UK population pretty good comes vaccinations.

Our anti-vaxxers loud, nearly big group think are. No, that's works.

Only four justices needed review SCOTUS. get four needed here. fair, open 90% general population two months ago, people know it. (31F healthy) double vaxxed (Pfizer, 4/8/21 &amp; 4/28/21) got booster 11/21. Covid positive NEXT day (last Monday, 11/22, also birthday sucked).

Let tell you, last 7 days SUCKED FREAKING HARD. 2 trips ER 105 degree fever Tylenol/Advil bring down, every textbook symptom, received Regeneron monoclonal antibody treatment day Thanksgiving luckily kept fever returning. symptoms changed I'm fighting severe headache/cough/chest pain o2 levels like dip 92% reason, along really low blood pressure strange neurological symptoms. 

This whole experience thoroughly sucked really hope many days left. cannot even fathom bad would unvaccinated. blowing mind sick I've been. Ok thanks! great idea restrict new variant found. exactly scared Omicron? makes worse Delta? Ontario currently sequencing positive tests. still headache feel zoned loss appetite. got booster Nov 24th. symptoms stared 25th. Detecting Omnicrom requires sequencing antibody tests.

But omnicrom detected PCR, thing know coronavirus PCR won‚Äôt tell strain unless sequence it. phrase questions like absurd, data shows overwhelmingly inverse relation number shots likelihood hospitalization, so... yes. 1000 times yes.

Unless want terrible illness huge medical bills. Even concerns new Omicron variant arose, China refused calls loosen border restrictions, among strictest world.

Now Chinese researchers offering data support government‚Äôs decision maintain extreme ‚Äúzero Covid‚Äù strategy.

A recent study published country‚Äôs Center Disease Control Prevention website found China could face 630,000 coronavirus cases day dropped zero-tolerance prevention measures lifted curbs travel, way Western countries have.

That would five times many total number cases reported China, population 1.4 billion, years since virus first emerged central Chinese city Wuhan, according New York Times database. outbreak would put huge strain country‚Äôs resources, including hospital system, said report, published World Health Organization labeled Omicron ‚Äúvariant concern.‚Äù

The authors report, scholars Peking University Beijing, wrote findings ‚Äúraised clear warning‚Äù country ready open up.

‚ÄúMore efficient vaccinations specific treatment, preferably combination both, needed entry-exit quarantine measures Covid-19 response strategies China safely lifted,‚Äù wrote.

While China vaccinated 75 percent population, questions raised efficacy country‚Äôs homegrown vaccines.

The Beijing government staked much political legitimacy controlling virus better countries. strategy, far, worked: China reported fewer 5,000 deaths since pandemic began managed quickly tame sporadic outbreaks severe, sometimes impractical, measures. Monday, China reported 21 locally transmitted cases, reported northern region Inner Mongolia. seems likely Omicron evade vaccine, exactly like variants (Beta, Delta). Could little, could lot.

It extremely unlikely means going back square one, protection.

Meanwhile, boosters already proven greatly improve protection far better every evading variant, far.

Would Omicron targeted vaccine become necessary/safe/repeated? Literally impossible answer, course. Omicron discovered last week so. questions unanswerable.

Related: Personally, worry annual flu vaccine? even little.  deserve get fired get vaxxed Given limited resources South Africa, amazingly good work sure save lot people's lives. Yeah. Vaccinated people largely problem getting booster. Agreed. People think ""oh well RT ultrasound better"" go back school same. work codes, spend hours day rooms too. honestly healthcare general. system breaking real time. ""Why get shit current job $50-$75hr go contract work make $125-$200hr I'm guaranteed OT etc work leave. People going travel droves straight leaving healthcare together.

But yes, everyone quit. rate fully vaccinated adults NYC currently reported [81.2 interested contentious here, enjoy precision.

Nobody needed unnecessary bullcrap. first like, ""okay relax chill, going last months"" tried blame China hard them, 2 years things seem improve, every single effort world seems improve things, like we've dealt quicksands past one matter much progress can't escape quicksand, stated numerous times even two years things seem way distant end. I've lost numerous job offerings, I'm stuck shitty part-time job. still say ""rooted ignorance xenophobia""? Ideally want less severe compete delta terms transmission.

This would best-case-scenario IMHO therefore it'll never happen, lol. anti-Vaxers, anti-maskers, non-social distancers gonna dropping like flies U.S.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Vaccine efficacy severe disease still relatively high, even boosters. don‚Äôt think anybody raising alarm this, issue drop, risk reinfection people die. 

Ultimately point vaccine ensure covid doesn‚Äôt kill you, protecting infection months added bonus.  see that? first wave delta wave. 26 thousand cases day. Florida Florida 40 million less people. might feel bit sick. might feel weather. really want hit Covid again, especially like sick. Start that.

My booster gentle earlier shots make tired. kind nice hard weeks prior needed rest given permission. Offering rest comfort food gift, like something good health gift. PTSD chronic illness reframing gift focusing control things really help. Maybe feel little bad time. prepare? Maybe plan good delivery meal order comfort foods hand ahead this. worst side effects 2nd shot muscle aches fever made sure hot cold packs ready case. really need nice feel better. Also remember vaccine symptoms end time. Mine exist really worst hours 6-30 suddenly starving fried rice aches gone. gentle giving chance rest recovery even easier. what? 

People taking masks 10% vaccination levels. I'm saying community spread could eliminated prior delta, thus making messaging far effective. Imagine much impact story would ""covid returned"" vs ""covid gotten worse"". We‚Äôve created whole class flunkies essentially exist improve lives actual rich people. Rich people throw money people paid sit around, add glory, learn see world perspective executive class.

It's hard show entourage flunkies they're zoom. name, really fitting.  know that. Ahhhh! &lt;flies vaccines also elicit B cells responses. hear antibodies lot they're much easier study. That's standard word UK. fault American anti vaxxers made weird. Also, wastewater analysis South Africa suggest - also indicates rapid surge. vaccine. tweak vaccine deal Omicron reason doesn‚Äôt. 2020 vaccine. won‚Äôt thing. appetite US going back whether masks vaccines individual. trying embody entire conservative response pandemic two sentences succeeded marvelously. Vaccine immunity least good natural immunity, better, according immunologists. Quebec track reach 90, possible 92% population that‚Äôs vaccinated kids done.

It doesn‚Äôt really get better unless start strapping antivaxers chair force vaccinated kick scream, never happen.

Honestly there‚Äôs way South Africa better position Quebec. Overreacting look like something, get people vaccinated. Force employers schools so, virus endemic forward. survival rate icu may vary greatly age assuming current vaccines 0% effective variant, evidence implying that. look towards CA? feel like al ot people hate rule, means following:

1. Risk COVID still serious enough minimize outings restaurants/bars. want go restaurant, think carrying out.

2. Bar personally no-go, restaurant, still enter mask, keep order drink arrives. I'll take sips here, re-mask. I'll fully demask meal food arrives, I'm done, re-mask waiting check chit chat end. Maybe I'm masked 15-20 minutes hour, bit helps right?

I feel like there's honestly mentality Reddit system perfect, must stupid. We're trying walk fine line know risk always there, shift risk people--it's eat home day go restaurants also know extreme shutting everything forever work either. try something between. guy doesn‚Äôt want there, endangering everyone? poor souls. ‚ÄúThis Reddit thread confuses infuriates us!!‚Äù could potentially watch, monitor ensure patient isolating. Yeah, husband 40 given initial dose summer, we're Scotland called appointments rather booking seems right back queue--he called (35 yrs). 6 months January.  heard Work?

It sounds like something would title anything! think partly result poor messaging (especially US). Government using messaging vaccines thing would ‚Äòend‚Äô pandemic, hasn‚Äôt happened people ill-informed therefore assuming vaccines aren‚Äôt working since day pandemic hasn‚Äôt ended.

It‚Äôs really interesting even reading difference attitudes online (I‚Äôm Scotland) US. Seeing lot people latter saying they‚Äôre fully vaccinated they‚Äôve done part shouldn‚Äôt widespread assumption anyone getting ill isn‚Äôt vaccinated masks would protecting unvaccinated stage.

It‚Äôs brilliant academic paper/case study unintended consequences communication strategies anyone motivation know Delta still exists right? Delta still currently dominant variant US. Also evidence yet Omicron completely evading current vaccines. Brought Lrrr Unless open large mass vaccination sites again, barely anyone get boosters. Pretty much ""In terms cases numbers we're seeing South Africa, think possibility look data, oversampled initial early cluster Omicron. presuming new variant, fact, feeling one circulating quite time.""

He back data. variant distinct signature detected current tests fairly easily, hard that.

I trust guy one bit. He's often quoted paints all-too-rosy picture pandemic, frequently disproven things turn worse.

For example earlier year said pandemic likely summer, ended higher numbers dead 2020 hospital system turned away patients available beds. selection are,  we're dealing bunch stuff right  invite try kids. Arguing point unlikely get far. I'm reminded 9/11 truthers movement. argument endless. Fundamentally emotional reaction dealing - usually extreme distrust establishment - represented government &amp; scientific consensus. indeed.  offer facebook medical advice parking lot. can‚Äôt also acknowledge masking isn‚Äôt talisman. got people acting like end all‚Ä¶ one complaint people wearing masks concert‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sorry masks aren‚Äôt much you‚Äôre shoulder shoulder‚Ä¶ PPE great limited consistent basis . far 100% N95 works better clothe ‚Ä¶ surgical decent ‚Ä¶ 

Rant really work way. recently get infected one unlikely get infected due non specific intrinsic innate immune defenses switched on. second one much likely abortive infection -- even omicron achieves level immune escape compared delta. means compete hosts. Death negative outcome. Many people get chronic heart, lung kidney diseases Im purely speculating could said wants country travel bans instructed politicians say that. 

Again purely speculative. Exactly. Asking everyone stay office entertain management backfire. 

I understand manager times boring depressing don‚Äôt get micro manage much, companies perhaps invest therapy people suffering, instead hurting enjoy working home? people mild side effects. definitely appreciate severe ones getting third dose anyway. Taking one team, were. Individual priority Individual A(sic).

The things listed listed there. Except impact likely recover given treatment would likely suffer without treatment.

But direct factors? No, obesity vaccination status relevant triaging care. think it‚Äôs implied booster doses going forward dose 3 would longer intervals between. Maybe either due immunity works possible new formation vaccine. mean point it‚Äôs Canada travel ban South Africa doesn‚Äôt even really purpose ""lets continue using current vaccine new variant killed going cause surges cause issues places even severe disease"" panic inducing? way suggesting people buy 5 years food supplies, start farm, build arsenal apocalypse. 

Even without vaccines, risk death low unless like 70+ yo already life threatening disease. Many people care severe disease themselves. many, things like spreading elderly immunocompromised family concerns long-covid significant factors played decisions things like get booster shots despite extremely low risk severe outcomes 2 shots. 

Edit: downvote, like smell chicken farts. cannot possible reason downvoting specific reason list definitely downvoting nonsensical accusation I'm making even downvote. Also actually edit. head 35% shot, others unvaccinated (there double vaccinated patients). There's evidence mixing mRNA Adenovirus one gives better overall protection initial thought this. trying downplay risk lacking time information back statement, really, really needed clear media confuse message. one afford message garbling right information experts. cut half would half bad delta quite apparent travel bans nothing. thing going spread already spread. Buckle we'll see variant capable of. Thanks reminder. posted text comment. 

I tried linking MSN originally (which syndicating bloomberg's article) removed MSN. seem drawing false equivalence obese choosing unvaccinated. Sure, obese reversible cost reversing obesity vs. getting vaccinated one's volition different. believe people vaccinated recieve priority care unvaccinated.

I'll throw one right back believe vaccinated entitled care vaccinated. I, however, interested seeing hospitalizations reduced whole comes hierarchy actionable steps, vaccination mitigating steps immediate effect attempting control obesity rates (which subject multifold variables socio-economics, genetics, side-effects medical treatments, injuries etc.). Fine, cut half... still unacceptable #. would lead infections, virus millions opportunities mutate every new infection, hospitalizations, deaths.

Understanding unvaccinated pose risk literally everyone else even bigger step, know...
And still evidence vaccine poses risk getting virus unvaccinated. Well looking like I‚Äôm going back office til 2023 rate anybody else drawing conclusions :) New York City may already seeing signs winter spike Covid-19 even though holiday travel, gatherings colder weather getting started.  
 
The city‚Äôs positive test rate rose two-month high hospitals admitted 100 new virus patients Friday, contributing 25% jump hospitalizations two weeks. 
 
The city 463 people hospital Covid-19, 370 Nov. 12. seven-day average residents testing positive virus -- lowest state New York -- climbed 2% first time since end September. metric doesn‚Äôt include rapid antigen test results. 
 
Governor Kathy Hochul declared state emergency late Friday countries including U.S. began imposing travel restrictions southern Africa stem spread new variant. variant known omicron hasn‚Äôt found U.S., Hochul warned, ‚Äúit‚Äôs coming.‚Äù

On Saturday, also ordered nursing homes adult-care facilities make boosters available residents hospitalizations across state spiked.  
 
The governor Saturday reported 2,696 people hospitals virus, 2,249 week earlier. 
 
Several parts state reporting higher positivity rates: 10.2% western New York; 9.4% Finger Lakes; 9.3% Mohawk Valley. 

‚ÄúWith emergence omicron variant abroad warning signs spikes cases winter, need basic Covid safety procedures New York important ever,‚Äù Hochul said statement. 
 
Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden‚Äôs chief medical adviser, said Sunday new variant appears transmissible ‚Äúinevitably‚Äù arrive U.S.  
 
Biden last week restricted U.S. travel links South Africa seven countries region starting Monday. president returning White House later Sunday long holiday weekend U.S. health officials gauge risks new variant. 
 
New York City may already seeing signs winter spike Covid-19 even though holiday travel, gatherings colder weather getting started.  
 
The city‚Äôs positive test rate rose two-month high hospitals admitted 100 new virus patients Friday, contributing 25% jump hospitalizations two weeks. mitigation techniques same, severity different country different trend ones (like UK, India, SA) something's weird One widely misquoted statement one doctor South Africa talking small sample size patients, mostly young people. still prepare scenarios without knowing scenario actually yet. time. plan point then? make sure everyone vaccinated new variant breaks out? hospitalization severe moderate? hospitalization mild? Past 2 weeks only? Ugh. go hopes nothing really people. Sure, also means vaccinated can't shit help unvaxxed anymore. 

Vaccinated people wearing masks indoors good idea, going make meaningful difference transmission. Masks drop bucket compared vaccination. Especially vaxxed people wearing masks. 

If vaxxed, get booster. Wear mask prudent wear mask. Enjoy life. 

You cannot help anyone else point. unvaxxed need fend themselves, whether choose remain unvaxxed not. picking nothing. point still stands - MAY ways strategically schedule around work schedule. never said works all, friendly pointer consider may get mileage it. Seriously wtf?! Thank pasting in! go around them. trying figure worth try convince get covid tests. They'd probably refuse anyway. Omni = everywhere

Cron = time

Saw ;-)  make point lockdowns US. I'm agreeing technically correct everything love shutdown I'm sure call it. However, want keep going back forth different experiences this. Asking everyone stay office entertain management backfire.

I'm even sure managers though. I'm manager hate office. peers talk to, boss, boss. executives problem companies. I‚Äôve saying years gunboat diplomacy never hold long run Yep, makes absolutely sense. China‚Äôs domestic response done lot right, many places. You‚Äôre right. China‚Äôs diplomatic response, especially early on, left lot desired. mention approach ‚Äúwet markets‚Äù caused first place.

Not saying there‚Äôs super villain, Chinese government ingratiating rest world pandemic, especially earliest crucial stages. amount cases starting spring without corresponding increase hospitalizations deaths, going assume much transmissible, holding vaccines highly effective preventing serious complications death.  


Likely already community spread like Delta was. think significant vaccine evasion. think mean reduced transmission vaccinated reduced. I‚Äôm one them, 2-4 dose likely different need data looked at. Pfizer could please submit day FDA could work quickly review despite holidays, really appreciate that. saying someone works pharma regulatory affairs. study moderna 

The figure bottom want look at. sure sinovac compares moderna pfizer though. tiny sample size well Boise also canceled yearly Carnival celebration Anyone else trouble getting booster shot? I'm going crazy, every place I've tried walking turned away, every cvs Walgreens within ten mile radius fully booked week. want keep waiting really feel like giving point. anyone knows get Pfizer shot near LA please help  hopeful notion went door yesterday. based misunderstanding fact sampling university students, generally get severe illnesses.  

Right starting see surge hospitalizations, including, unfortunately bunch sick babies.

You got figure lag time. takes week two average go symptoms hospital another week go hospital morgue. Omicron long enough go whole process show bad is. true, yet tell us anything Omicron's ability evade vaccines not, since there's negligible number Quebec cases. Quebec starts become place high community spread, could use compare South Africa, can't yet. Thank you. without question seeing winter spike starting - question much keep following protective measures. executives office anyways. pro lockdown anti vax person Covid us sub days ago. mutates much current spike would ha e way harder time infecting hosts effectively counts rising certain communities, beyond that, actual degree sickness yet seem worse standard covid, incoming rates vaccinated/unvaxxed patients suggest major vaccine evasion *yet.* 

I saying variant cause concern--just alarming observations *yet.* articles potential dangers that--potential, rife language like 'may' 'might' 'can'  Vaccines required pretty much function socially professionally NYC - masks already worn uniformly non-eating/drinking public settings like transit. place could maybe affect offices it‚Äôs discretion. last job called us last Nov things bad point trending way. transitioned seemlessly WFH, never understood it. never go back *one* aspect departure filling vacancies I'm sure plan compete organizations adopted WFH. getting taste, never go back office five days week. I'm hybrid 2 3 employer great hesitate look around year two full WFH last child things settle. oh shit oh shit oh shit

cruises still legal? thought Great Pandemic, legal.... take mom ER non Covid related emergency.

It first time I've physical building doctor since Feb 2020. booster (@a full dose suggested health issues) days before.

They short staffed, stuff normally used blood draws using new stuff.

Everyone nice caring apologetic. nice kind terribly sad working loss.

I can't thank people enough... kind terrified mom. let's face it, scared too. Glad see one. felt like person alive got absolutely abused booster perfectly fine vaccine side effects think month slow late? New antibodies. Antibodies attach particular location virus. part omicron variant sufficiently different covid classic, antibodies part virus work.

But B cells recognize multiple parts antigen. covid, recognize 78 different locations. Omicron 30 mutations spike protein. Assuming worst case scenario, targets antibodies, mutated sufficiently away original covid antibodies longer work, B cells still 48 different sites work with. think businesses downsize. office presence want collaboration, significantly less space day day operations. 

Yes, fight tooth nail back fully, many adapt. assuming ever reason current vaccine 0% effective. wont be. Spike protein still exists. going level protection. Also said thing Delta. I‚Äôm willing bet many people faked vax cards altering photos phone   get it. Thanks taking time send meta-review."
