Saudi’s EU vaccine allotment finished relax enjoy rest globally funded vaccines yourselves. carnival two weeks ago. course, public events, lot people came together private, drink Beers friends on. Maybe reason.  health care workers vaccinated first though? general, ones risk severe illness death. certainly good arguments vaccinating front line health care workers early, shouldn’t kid ourselves; prioritizing health care workers vulnerable populations like elderly, going see deaths would prioritized vulnerable population. Seasonal employees considered human beings EU Commission's people

EMA less experienced. point

Yes article ""this point"" custodian job gave everyone $25 gift cards beginning pandemic started chastising anyone took work get tested. boss gave shit taken time 4 times last year tested. 

Due job located can't come I'm showing symptoms illness, I'm deep shit military. yeah, suck it, I'm getting tested every time show kind symptoms. 

Sorry venting, I'm getting tired shit. seems quite clear Europe still blaming Astrazenneca terrible vaccine rollout. Maybe invested infrastructure better instead bargaining cheapest price would able make target.

Not mention vaccine makers delivering, yet kick Astrazenneca every time it’s invented British. Yes, still use 60 lower age. true man, main vaccination site verify health care worker all. put show up, long name id matches application, get shot. drive thru spot literally cars going day really fast pace, bother checking anything beyond name. Ask anyone bay area got vaccinated main mass vaccination site, tell thing. hate want, fact anyone get it. Anti-American bot. Bad bot cash money Curfews totally pointless. opposite. Open essential businesses longer people crowd. Spain everyone goes good shopping time. It’s stupid.

The 22h curfew Madrid lead everyone going onto tube time. lines metro stations 21h onwards. freaking stupid. Yeah think overanalyzing things bit looking bigger picture. Today 55k, 65k week ago, 75k week that, 88k week before. That's pretty impressive. I'm strong enough that. Kill even without cheat code tbh. code, put health care worker. main vaccination site area, many vaccinations day bother checking application. look name application matches ID. verify even health care worker. honor system. article sovereign nations told can't protect citizens border restrictions. UK longer outside authorities priorities UK. 

Further, UK *invested* vaccine development EU stood by. EU citizens paying price decision. 

Solely lens COVID-19, Brexit appears good choice UK. suspect we'll see additional benefits path Germany lesser extent France bear burden crushed economies across EU. 

In way 'leavers' consider prescient here. COVID changed playing field EU made suboptimal choices, member nations--pressed economic forces--have contributed infection rates closing little opening early. mentioned masks, say masks everything.

I mentioned TTI, say TTI everything.

I NEVER SAID EITHER EVERYTHING!

Sweden limit anything. recommendations. wear masks. TTI. very, ignorant. satisfy representative, would manufacture hundreds millions doses ready go soon approved. 

Fauci asked using Defense Production Act answer order would put things place months ago. started would get additional capacity set around time existing production capacity vaccinated everyone. 

Buried reply word ""months.""

Months ago months now. Take pick. Imagine coming pandemic subreddit lick bloodsucker's boots.

Leeches get **earn**. Nothing. got batch vaccine appears produce common-cold like side-effects resulted people missing days work, crippling hospitals. 

It's batch. vaccine works like that. [It found 50% reported fatigue, headache, 1/3 feverishness. Since may symptoms, quite possible 2/3 vaccinated feels ill cold-like symptoms vaccination. 

So error vaccinating workers bad luck, similar effect batches. need first sort vaccination delivery. large stores unused people want get vaccinated certain vaccines holding back Second dose. also need start UK auf try give people first shot vs trying give smaller number people doses.

In Germany group one run 65th vaccinate AZ nobody noticed while. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Neat. 

Do know yet got real shot placebo? Alexa, play Game Changed Daft Punk. That's it? Lmao I'll take that. effects probably intense becuase vaccine immune response even better mRNA trials 1-shot 2-shot doses. think phase 2 3a. Later phase 3 focused 1-shot.  ...wut?

The flu vaccine good year might crack 50%. MMR around 80%. No, close enough average citizen. Oh good, part ignorant American redditors lecture world warped idea ""freedom"" nothing say police state, agents government right murder literally reason. always comedy gold.  Origins United States well documented even talking Yes parts country. There's bound supply chain outliers. vaccinated people already told continue hiding.

The messaging real bad. fully vaccinated people told wear masks start wearing them, people vaccinated start taking prematurely too. Social pressure everyone wearing mask around effective. That's main reason vaccinated people asked continue wear masks, stay 6 feet apart, etc. 

I agree vaccinated people confident going world fearing health. think messaging vaccinated people asked continue enforce measures what's wrong. keep saying things like ""Vaccines cut transmission"" makes people question ""why getting vaccinated begin with?"".

I know right time tell people take masks people is, quite yet. back summer peak's daily infections/deaths. continue crater, fully expect mandates relaxed. suspect probably April-May timeframe? vulnerable populations first shot end March see deaths hospitalizations continue fall. point, probably open season general population get vaccine appointment back normal. suspect mutation rate come people get immunity. Immunity seems lot better people get flu anyway natural infection think vaccine. that's case probably need new vaccines every year... depends much waning is. would guess every 3 5 years generally that's total speculation part. bet catch cases children. Let’s say adult brings Covid home, gets sick, tests positive, passes wife three kids. get sick, symptoms, don’t bother getting tested A., know is, B., one feels packing three sick kids car going get brain poked swab tell already know. Couple minor symptoms didn’t bother... I’d guess it’s small percentage ever actually get tested test positive it. Thee needs Life photograph nurse fire fighter kissing. Lol already read someone Twitter saying ""this they'll give poor black brown folks."" rolled eyes brown folk. still seeing significant number outbreaks primary school settings pre-school settings. Given that, it’s wrong primary schools don’t really contribute significantly transmission.  data Office National Statistics shows primary school children England twice likely adults first case household infected twice likely infect contacts.”  Gurdasani added: “We know children likely asymptomatic, test symptomatic you’re going miss lot transmission happening.  less biased like Office National Statistics survey … really capture transmission show us lot transmission picking studies.”

Correlates recent study Science showing closing schools universities ""very effective"" cutting transmission overall. 

This major point contention even year ago, experts asserted reduction contagion closing schools. country half million dead inoculate first. 

Especially considering typical American greater risk dying even poorest citizen third world country due dearth co-morbidities like advanced age/diabetes/obesity/etc. save lives inoculating Americans. 

By fall U.S. population inoculated properly able pump hundreds millions doses world supply. mean time, let Chinese export doses. apparently figured tame virus keeping economy growing, clearly far less need and... failure regulate wet markets *twice* led deadly coronaviruses slipping national boundaries century would proper type reparation. always many like disingenuous strawman arguments like people upset getting haircuts Teachers California fighting school all. rest country school degree. Plenty schools open safely without vaccinated teachers. kids California suffering far worse state.

Massive high rates failures now. don’t think California understands rest country session! need fight kids. essential indoor dining.

Acquaintance mine 41 one comorbidity type 2 diabetes died April. know three others ended hospitalized... One hospital 12 days icu four five days, one three days ICU one week ICU. one older significant comorbidities, second one 23 years old comorbidities, third one 60s comorbidities. yeah totally random.

also know percentage people mild illness getting cell immunity. cell immunity seem protect severe illness pretty well seem highly robust variants including South African one. suspect time become less severe need course need take seriously Ultimately want kids back school. that’s takes agree follow that. perhaps misunderstood schools open next Monday. It’s hybrid schedule drop off, the. Pick 2 hours later school home. Complete nightmare parents teachers assume. School year 60 days wait go back like normal? next years school year isn’t full time mask free I’m going lose mind! Even get it, it'll probably like common cold die it. politics made sense could forgive even economic standpoint half-measures compromises corporate/financial interests made ""save economy"" really prolonged pandemic.

It's like they're even acting interests more. Healthy 20 year olds vaccinated shouldn’t requirement return normal. I'm pissed I've spent last year watching people like argue allowed kill others actions. basically arguing RIGHT drive drunk responsible crashes cause deaths cause driving drunk.  


It's fucking disgusting see callous, uncaring, socio/psychopathic sentiments far many people.

Grow spine, safety health others, wear god damned mask! I'm certain, think 60% number gotten better additional data came today? Like time look cases? Ah yes, light end tunnel.

None ground-breaking controversial.

She points idea children don’t transmit virus based flawed seeing England even one five children primaries, primary age children highest prevalence across groups,” told BBC’s Sunday still seeing significant number outbreaks primary school settings pre-school settings. Given that, it’s wrong primary schools don’t really contribute significantly data Office National Statistics shows primary school children England twice likely adults first case household infected twice likely infect Gurdasani added: “We know children likely asymptomatic, test symptomatic you’re going miss lot transmission happening. [We big deal, enough people talking it... least currently studied.  
It's honestly biggest hesitation behind J&amp;J vaccine. push j&amp;J ""you might still get covid, it'll basically mild illness"", bad... unless 'mild illness' lasts months, years, even rest life.  
The upshot (I'm still waiting someone else crunch actual numbers) appear efficacy still way 28 days (which 65% figure calculated) possibly getting close pfizer / moderna get 60 days post vaccination.  
Another scenario matter vaccine get, end mRNA booster protect variants. case, end point ultimately high, broad protection infection. One reasons use 7-day averages remind people get caught day day fluctuations.  


The latest uptick great, we're still 33% time last month.  Many less advanced vaccines prevent moderate severe illness. cover enough still require wear mask, social distance, etc. cuts risk hospitalization. Unless everyone know gets mRNA vaccines, others effective enough us stop wearing masks. 

Third world countries without access pharmacy freezers advanced medicine need vaccines. begging everyday. send vaccines instead sticking people West less effective less advanced vaccines? paid enough tax money?

tl;dr mRNA vaccines less likely need boosters new mutations emerge. short term gain long term problems good trade off. South Africa's 10% effectiveness proves questions asked Whats countersolution highly unlikely scenario happening inside another highly unlikely scenario? 
 
To clarify- dont care either way long dont lose gun rights it. Probably better spend $1B better entertainment.

/s really hope joking, vaccine already developed clinical trials ongoing time Biden became president. wear mask. now. Even vaccinated almost 6 months  Uh, no. previous immunity population year several areas US decided going follow restrictions. past summer bad areas. plenty laws abusing killing others far many people comply laws... logic then, laws 'a bad law'.  


Does show stupid statement is? Look percentage cases coming back gene target failure PCR tests. It’s proxy new strain since barely sequencing cases. 

Doubling rate 10 days, 30% cases last data point Helix covid dashboard. 

With less contagious strain dropping contagious strain increasing exponentially, won’t really see reaches ~50%. 

I suspect that’s happening Sweden now, back envelope calculations put mid late March us. Modern Pfizer got job done last administration way ahead J&amp;J. start praising Trump that?  What’s reasoning? many think allowed even end it. Utah, apparently. Something dropping mask mandates 8 weeks low spread areas reach 1.6 mil first doses.

It's odd system. Also clue 8 weeks comes from. What’s two shot jj vaccine? always one. pro-CCP. recall hearing exact thing, time year, last year.

""It'll Easter"". this, epic we’d see ocean accusations inferior vaccine given certain socioeconomic demographics. That's works lol. many factors. Look Asian countries new Zealand Australia idea could've accomplished early missed opportunity for. Also saying social distancing, lockdown. lol, try looking actual data study. shows opposite. Ah. Today’s “I feel expendable” complaint. 
Who tomorrow? It’s politics. It’s necessity many parents kids school. Yes, per document,

""The endpoint COVID-19 requiring medical intervention defined participant requiring hospitalization, ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and/or ECMO, linked objective measures decreased oxygenation, X-ray computed tomography (CT) findings, linked molecularly confirmed, COVID-19 onset least 14 days least 28 days post-vaccination. ""

Niceeee, even okay half normal summer lol :D first wave NYC horrible world ending? know since we've distanced masked, florida example seen exactly scenario? different variant? Even numbers fudged 300 dead two days MN's 2 dead. 150x death. 15,000% death. Factor per-capita they're 4x people ""only"" 3,750% death. that's FL under-reporting deaths reality even horrific propaganda. Given relatively inexpensive could see used countries short term give protection get access vaccines. protection better nothing especially high list countries getting better vaccines. Oh new tech used moderna pfiser used custom cancer treatment design cancer cells two days. Get married courthouse, postpone big party ceremony til later, imo.

Why risk it. It’s emergency. later it’s safer. again.  Fortunately, Utah (and every state), getting whole shit ton vaccines next weeks. remains seen large shit ton, next week's delivery total already slated double sent January. US sluggish rollout though? think emergency use authorization shortens approval time - normally drug trial phases take years. believe anything vaccine administered patients. would put surgical cloth help fit better. tie elastic behind ears better fit. can't get good fit, layer 2 cloth masks make sure solid contact nose bridge sides face. Walmart understand question. 

I would imagine incidence long haul would drop well. information seems indicate long haul may caused cytokine/inflammation/cell fusing lung tissue. 3 these, factor long haul, minimised vaccine would keep viral load low thus physiological response minimal. 

The problem emergency use answers long term benefits things while. get indications we'll still need data verify effect. think one sentiments sounds good say ""The occupying power moral obligation provide vaccinations COVID"" - reality two parties made arrangements years ago PA managed healthcare system. like Israel makes vaccine, buying bunch doses population like everyone else. clear Israel particular obligation buy vaccine Palestine versus things typically provide asked to. effective preventing hospitalization death death rate without already low. diabetes vaccine? fully prepared get bombarded apocalyptic headlines whenever chicken sneezes factory farm next 5 years. point feels completely unavoidable. inferior. relevant part hospitalizations death, it’s same, preventing transmission, data isn’t clear yet going make claim, provide source  physical health shit, barely eat enough comparison before, low activity comparison (haven't climbing gym year) Germany showing rise part France, beginning variant spreading becoming dominant, fuel next wave? J&amp;J’s request emergency use. eat many eggs think unlikely there'll suddenly enough vaccines offered people like us, us able choose get. likely, think, first however-many weeks we'll take whatever vaccine available.

That's people who've already gotten vaccinated; choose Pfizer Moderna. think that's going change everyone including us already opportunity get vaccinated.

Yes, given supply numbers, probably likely first opportunity Pfizer Moderna it'll J&amp;J. think even less likely first opportunity let choose. right... pay 100 tables filled guests get vaccination lot places able receive vials distribute. I’m sure every CVS Walgreens HEB month two. inferior. science factually states that. 

It use cases point dont luxury picking one given choice id go one efficacy 90% range. thing UK.

People love shit Oxford/AztraZeneca around percentage. Ultimately, stops hospitalised dying, cares? That's what's straining NHS right now. 

My dad got jab, assumed would get Oxford/AZ one friend said ""he die now, that's good"" ultimately, that's important part - that's gives peace mind. bluntly put it, that's matters really. saving face. intention one notice DNR updates disabled patients' profiles. became big news. unravel eugenics program. keep eye next one. Same. Except one grandmother physical freak dose want one. cloth masks thinking using two kids. surgical masks though adult sized.

1. surgical masks intended second layer fit properly large still better using second layer kid sized cloth mask? Exactly this. J&amp;J makes many things. Nearly every hospital sterilizer made J&amp;J. Why? fda embedded trail could analyzed approved real time.  I’m doubting you, that’s way lower thought average would be. lived higher Denver almost whole life, I’m 98%-99% given day there. assumed people would adapted given enough time.

Eh /r/boardgames shitting someone wanting small board game meet ""all participants vaccinated"", fit story me. make feel smart act like know something doctors don't? Actual public health specialists unanimously endorsed process, yet first thing see opportunity tell strangers savvy think are. 

The pandemic dead, lost jobs, front line workers risk health. you. Stop spreading misinformation pandemic pick something less important use ego inflator. you’re living elderly parents, depending state potentially get “informal caregiver”

“Informal caregivers defined CDC unpaid family member person regularly aids supervises daily care elderly disabled person” least CA it’s considered Tier 1/healthcare vaccinated now. Put surgical/medical masks fine. I've go lot doctors since COVID protected anyone else. feel safer grocery store. Yes lot constituents die they’ll less people convince vote /s ""You act like 10x think negative costs associated it,""

On contrary,. know perfectly well there's negative-costs. negative-costs bad dead. Death permanent. Restrictions impacts not. society goals needs.

You can't achieve things dead. learned today J&amp;J looking second “booster” might durable. back door way saying vaccine really 2 dose vaccine like others? looking forward J&amp;Js I’m wondering there’s point I’ll get second shot anyway. Nope, totally windowless haha. venue ""Synexis""--an air cleaning technology thing. definitely okay mask wearing, would imply cocktail hour, dancefloor, whatnot bigger question Vaccines don’t typically long term negative effects. Covid, hand... done harm good. undermining virus. It’s scary. wear mask social distance everyday. fact many people country fence regarding getting vaccine continues message living sacrifices? needs emphasize get us back normal, live like still. name long term effect (other level immunity) vaccine? Typically side effects pretty much immediate. Essential always meant expendable thought Canadians nice think it’s likely you’re going offered J&amp;J? storm delayed shipments vaccines, meaning states short doses. Expect huge spike vaccinations near future. Someone help here. seeing lot people claiming lack flu cases proof COVID fraud. ""logic"" behind idiocy? seems taken unprecedented steps limit spread illness, are, fact, limiting spread illness.  national health care provider administered COVID-19 vaccinations people deemed ineligible scarce vaccine local health departments, including people connections company leaders customers concierge medical service, according internal communications leaked Francisco-based One Medical allocated thousands vaccine doses local health departments areas provide medical services. Ineligible individuals connections company leadership set vaccine appointments, patients disqualified receiving vaccine nonetheless permitted skip line ahead high-risk problems occurred numerous company locations across several states.

....

Wasn’t old TV show called “Royal Pains” kind service Hamptons? amazing anyone would want live society allows people go around intentionally putting others danger bizarre insistence life-saving vaccine violates rights.

One person's rights end next person's safety begins. putting ego ahead everyone elses health

What ego? past 20 years work person available work. I'm there, work done. Work ethic also comes play. taught growing upper resp symptoms = stay home. way boomer parents. nobody denying natural immunity exists need get lot people sick reach herd immunity. nursing home herd immunity even worse high death rate  wear mask activities may get mask wet, like [swimming beach wet mask make difficult breathe may work well saying opening good idea (I know anything area.) , wearing mask waterpark, assuming actually riding rides whatever going much good. also like waterboarding get wet haha. people find less painful since bigger muscle walking guaranteed using it, help fun Wait, source virus western countries?! Twee woorden, negen letters serve Karens' happening everywhere. It’s unfortunate consequence. Heroes save children burning buildings old grandmas getting hit bus, right thing do, people told ""go sell useless crap middle global pandemic lose job"", certainly Walton families Bezos families world, either. Well, Bezos might get Blue Origin sort competitive aspect SpaceX uses company expand horizons humankind remain glorified merchant useless trinkets Amazon. Walton heirs redeeming qualities whatsoever. real answer.

Winter brutal Northeast, snow cover gone temps hit 60s consistently, LOT people going outside enjoying life again.

Probably late March April. 6 months production. delay 60% estimation delay based issues encountered.

For example, imagine go leave work car starting, call say probably going hour late need get public transport.

However, 5 minutes call them, realise issue something fix quickly end 10 minutes late.

The EU reacted AZ saying ""my cars starting"".

Whilst responding. think best reasonable efforts means?

The UK plants divert supply contractual obligations met. EU contract say ""UK plants must give us supply now"". health experts fear new variants outpacing vaccinations, many highlighted need double safety measures like wearing face masks, social distancing avoiding crowded areas. Home Generium Pharmaceutical, contracted scale production Russian vaccine, Sputnik V, vast high-tech complex Volginsky, 70 miles east Moscow, one seven new factories across country. Dr. Charles Chiu, associate director clinical microbiology lab UCSF study's lead, said mutation might make virus efficient docking cells, increasing infectiousness. Oh man, “arming teachers” thing mindblowing.

“We know love children want change lives, Desert Eagle .50 ACP case angry little Timmy needs ‘coming Jesus’ moment.” That's experience too. ""Family owned"" means good jobs reserved family members there's basically chance promotion. family members usually rude arrogant. suppose huge companies family owned affect average employee. example, think average shop worker Ford needs worry someone Ford family cussing out. job requires active contact family owns company hell. completely disagree. consider medium risk individuals according profession. teachers, day care centers, factories, grocery stores, etc.

If don’t get exposed. Weird. 

Sure, let’s assume I’m totally oblivious. Wouldn’t make sense tell percentage instead leaving passive aggressive comment? 

Yes! I’m totally dumbest person world. So, please educate me. percentage? Hehehe friends, y'all talking like bad corporate treatment ""lower level"" thing throughout history. expect much ""War"". Maybe skirmishes twitter lockdown lovers gotten lot eyeballs clicks doom posting.

CT pretty ""blue"" we're opening vaccines age group spring. March 1st 55-64 group gets it, every couple weeks younger age bracket opened up. May 1st 16-34 group able get shot. expect even things pretty ""normal"" state. Yup like too. People money power abused privileges expensive us proles? Color surprised. almost makes think care self interest rather mine. Understandable, guessed either since seems crazy utilize vials fullest get go Thank you, lol. Also want add, “treated expendable since beginning” means “since beginning time” “since beginning pandemic.”

I don’t work retail anymore but, even though worked good teams, I’m never going forget little power deal belligerent customers general. Whatever goodness result franchisee decent person rather corporate anything useful. confirm. family seen 18 months. anticipate we'll vaxxed then. still (business) curfews effect many parts country, like NC, places close 10pm likely one behind surge calling national guard help required lockdowns quell it. measuring sequencing. ""Now""? essential workers treated such, making half wage essential worker does. Sure: reading.

Best reasonable effort that. Reasonable. reasonable break prexisting contract. one mention ethics ... Let's forget, hero sometimes dies end story heroic deeds performed life. Sorry disagree. curfews here. happens people meet earlier day. Cram places allowed meet end infecting other.

Numbers started going banned private meetings together. nobody polices distancing mask compliance. 

I Spain btw. find amusing wrong reports yesterday AZ responses 

AZ shady company

AZ purposefully EU

We put import bans everybody...

AZ vaccine ineffective... Pfizer only



Truth is, commission fuck investment vaccination schemes behind. data supports facts. hope AZ achieve Q2 target EUs sake world's. proving cheap highly effective genuine win humanity.  I've spent 2 months Korea. most, maybe 10% people would masks air quality bad, that's stretch. like everyone walks around masks time like people trying play as.  people take care first.

At agency clients staff got time. Oddly enough many people refused vaccine through. ""There’s epidemiological endpoint new cases 28 straight days there’s got practical end vision we’ll get lot sooner, make serious adjustments,"" said.

Basically nice way saying “zero covid” complete fantasy.   Yep. Always remember - person pays work friend. one seeing commodity. I'm pleased insider information know 'unlikely' happen.. speaking ass like AZ? bad news Europe, though. British crowd gleefully upvote. science based admin science based things. great. We'll overall better understanding virus. Stubbornness hubris kills Vaccines already mandatory plenty countries herd immunity - protect cannot get health/allergic reasons.

This nothing new, least Europe. tell fomite transmission extremely rare. initially disinfecting everything came house. viable form transmission really way avoid infection. Everyone would ahd now. Don’t forget triple mask! Several EU countries, mostly France Poland, fought buying AZ. EU came along wanted buy together negotiate prices better. show strength unity. fucking pandemic. negotiate better prices also read contracts signed. Also most, least big part companies could produce locally, closed sold due fact producing medicine make much money costs lot due taxes things need paid average worker EU. 

So companies working medicines course delivering home market first. US. 

US solves problems throwing money EU frugal nice words. Also US negotiated way vaccines ready secured deliveries. EU waited released sat ass might EU wants pleased companies instead showering money deliver medicine. 


Long story short: EU fucked bureaucratic reasons showing unity important solving pandemics. Disagree, think lower 2019. Czechs? Nah.

The government? Absolutely. Corrupt, lying basically everything grossly incompetent. mean absolutely, totally incompetent. dog would better work. ok? cause jumping baseless conclusion ultimately good news. I’ve questioning value “hero” since 911 💯 

Excellent post Got sources back up? Wow, yeah that’s horrible, live MI allowed quit job collect pua unemployment. thankful grocery store workers didn’t quit MI, we’re still getting paid less people unemployment.

Corrupt, short-sighted incompetent. Buy gme 6 PM curfew likely making things worse, compressing hours people go business,

Here Belgium, government decided reduce number trains order mitigate spread covid. HK-47? better speed vaccinations.

They'd lot Pfizer doses Macron insist Sanofi instead. Remember prioritizing vaccines. main thing I've read EU approached negotiations like trade negotiation well developed product rather procurement urgent basis new product led several issues

Didn't start work infrastructure production much later places (The UK started several months advance, know things hit 100% UK supplies AZ yet) also withheld money later stages earlier stages shown complete, meaning things done parallel

The UK US taken precautions protect supplies, UK writing specific amounts specific penalties contract US restricting sales completely EU contract essentially left able delay payment non-delivery.

As supplies go AZ EU sort situation UK late November last year regarding supply, issues significantly delayed numbers doses UK received, look

&amp;#x200B;

Essentially EUs negotiations would appropriate well developed product line times costs well understood global supply. difference new biological manufacturing process unpredictable start up, global supply back given timeline based best estimate assuming problems occur many people, day already past. Northeast, think it'll come first real thaw. happening Czech Republic compared neighboring countries? corrupt? AZ delivers, know fact EU lying. AZ deliver, know fight AZ lying.

Will interesting see pan out. sure, am. I’ll still wearing anyone strongly suspect (or know) covid anyways. don’t know even blame AZ’s anonymous EU source spreading lies them. 20 percent like that. consider luckier side. paying attention? Like, all? you, insist I’ve got hunch 4th July big “We’re back!” party. anonymous EU source

aka EU disinformation campaign plausible deniability.  I’d gladly give mine lmao. I’m 100% ready done it.

Can’t wait switch back disposable ones. started vaccinated surge, even peaked, places like US UK started vaccinating basically right cases seemed naturally peak. go first. slightest. question is, people vulnerable virus? not, bet preferential treatment. get vaccination like everyone else always washing hands going bathroom, especially eating afterwards.

&amp;#x200B;

the fact took covid start worrisome. Fear mind killer. Seems likely people avoiding going doctor flu symptoms either might might get corona. Many people side effects.

It’ll vary state, rural vs urban, red vs blue. lot anger frustration I’m sure culture war it...but summer going pop year! competent Prime Minister government would also welcome. Czech government messed badly winter  Lots people forgetting Southern Hemisphere (which handled COVID exceptionally well whole) reservoir Northern Flu season vice versa. 

Because air travel stopped, big places like Thailand, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan, took measures would stop COVID (and hence Flu), Northern Hemisphere places like UK fucked COVID, aren’t importing it. Heat Moment Asia Yup try eligible relatives. 2 15 able get far. talking personal anecdote.  testing flu high numbers tests largely negative. ""attribute flu case COVID"", test COVID attribute COVID COVID. Realistically probably are. There's still ton covid cases either way, bet someone tests positive covid even suspected covid treat way regardless co-infection flu. someone quarantine home covid really matter flu flu addition, treatment would same. ... excuse forcing come work everyone else shut down. mean, *are* essential, that's words tell. state [New looks like [a lot free flu shots flu season. things scientific, incredibly important note difference ""X shown"" ""X happen.""

...and right _large_ amount people understand. Science absolute. Sometimes science _learned_ gathering data. Children harder infect, get less sick spread Bingo - warning sign people started suggesting teachers retail workers consider heroes. phrase substituted 'sacrificial lambs'. 10 year old michigan lost limbs mis-c probably cares 2000 kids got it. mask people, wear one, dont inconsiderate towards others Lol lots people already say agree 48 hours lag, every week. crazy thinking someone non-priority group US able vaccinated early April? Roughly 65 million doses already given, another 140 million promised next 5 weeks. means 100 million people fully vaccinated 2 doses April. 200 million people 18 country, seems reasonable motivated could get vaccine then. think one thing acknowledge horrible illness feel sadness lost lies, another extremely paranoid. Like people still scared death vaccinated, that's ridiculous view. like COVID deniers, think people even presented hard cold facts (cases going vaccines work), deny. Dude called ovarian cancer link baby powder ""dumb shit""

Nope. Yeah, I've seen people advocating lockdowns completely eradicated. Uh, thing stay. point future moratorium lifted, unpaid rent that's accumulated still due. Article weak - spend 3 seconds look images. No, viruses Covid coronavirus flu influenza virus. completely separate families viruses happen similar symptoms. examples corona viruses ones cause common cold, SARS MERS. Examples influenza yearly variations influenza B, bird flu, swine flu etc  Monday Tuesday data really lagged Saturday Sunday data - that's always low

With storm backlog, I'd expect 2m/day next week so. Username... Checks out? Lmao effect James (sell team) Dolan it’s permanently banned Yup! tell insurance use tobacco!  point called herd immunity. easy tell area reached point, case rates roughly zero. We're far right thing. ideal world, bosses sending people home flu symptoms.

Instead, ""Got sick able call work three days"" exception. places either give sick pay make go doctor get note infect people way. 

Hopefully much culture changes going forward. Well, bright side faster reach point supply bigger demand, they'll keep pumping send rest world. vaccinated?  Deblasio today said non-existent variants wear TWO masks least June.  admitted lied attempt preserve mask stocks first responders.

A panic caused run supplies could undermined entire medical system made MUCH worse rest us.

The honesty missing come former president far content insist would magically disappear one day. Failing procure PPE advance left Fauci others choice lie. Sadly jobs are.  simply true, I’m moderna clinical trial I’ve tested covid every time visit research lab, even symptoms. get fat lol got fat fuck :( Well start wearing variant cuts thru vaccines. don’t need wear masks case. could flu variant kills us too. can’t live like Nothing envy looking way ireland to. vaccine roll extremely slow seemed sanitizer production took 6-8 months ramp up, dozen weird brands taking shelf space everywhere alongside Purell Germ-X. imagine LOT going go waste. 
“WASHINGTON (AP) — COVID-19 vaccine makers told Congress Tuesday expect big jump delivery doses coming month, companies insist able provide enough Americans get inoculated summer.” that’s nice lookin chart  someone chronic halitosis, too. I'm never brushing teeth work ever again, mask mask mask. 65+ good level vaccination needs go public. First come, first serve. Shots arms fast humanly possible. restrictions slow things down. Serious question someone ate bat? actually seen anything conclusive last saw theorized bat thing. advocates like say “Twenty plenty” illustrate busy urban areas never speed limits 20 mph. look low fatality rate speed, it’s easy see good idea. 93 percent people hit would survive crash 20 mph.

And that's struck pedestrian..... Orange County schools opening March 1st. Why? 10 weeks going do... scientist seriously considered possibility vaccines wouldn’t cut transmission seen anyone saying virus ""just flu"". least anyone upvoted. comparisons seen flu valid ones: e.g., enough people vaccinated covid less dangerous flu, covid less dangerous flu kids, true.

Perhaps referring increasing desire sub get rid restrictions? Cases, deaths, hospitalizations declining, vaccine, people given year lives already. blame people wanting end? also gets shit ton death threats needs security detail. I'm pretty sure would taken anonymity this. sure removed comment said, top comment thread clearly violates sub rules (avoiding politics)... also lot talk US much kids spread virus. states lax enforce masks first. sure general things going state enforcement univerally, region strict seems person didn’t say anything mandates comment. confused  Southern california origin new COVID-19 shows rapid global spread Southern California COVID-19 Oh okay cool, influenza maybe covid.

That's tough thing overcome, mentally, conversation public health messaging, calling virus devil probably much convince anyone already growing apathetic towards whole thing. Quick! It’s call anti masker, vaxxer, schooler, thinker run North Dakota think like protect monsters!!! Nope, realistic “Pfizer Moderna -- two companies Covid-19 vaccines authorized emergency use United States -- pledged make combined total 220 million doses available shipment end March. Meanwhile, Johnson &amp; Johnson, could secure emergency use authorization Covid-19 vaccine US Food Drug Administration later week, pledged make 20 million doses available time frame.” Great question. guess near end year it’s anyone’s guess really. got shots think ""mutant strain"" referring dominant one CA since fall. So, even transmissible, cases going spite it. think people getting tired restrictions they're pushing narrative suit want. Pretty sad though people ignore science. virues super infectious put many small children true hell, when..it detectable like that. make sense. 

This measles, considered 'super contagious.'

This influenza either, considered contagious.

The scale two massive. SARS-CoV-2 sits (and halfway, get confused.) 

Don't make sound like there's two levels contagiousness concentration, world ain't simple. Okay? sky blue granola bar breakfast. What's point?

The vaccines distributed states fairly evenly population AFAIK, ZERO BEARING states choosing distribute them. California vaccinating anyone 65 mean nobody 65 vaccinated USA. still means months young people giving lives protect elderly. general, deadly viruses tend mutate less deadly versions superior strains. goal virus spread, kill - killing generally reduces ability spread.

I've seen several sources thats given.  Pa getting smoked Ohio wv. disappointing Guy gave sounded dumb think you’re fine. Ugh first thought old quarantining far greater rate young.

They also dying far greater rate young.

Look, get it. want vaccine. want mine, too. fact matter people need us. sure vote agree sad is. Ps. Up. Oh good know! get worse? probably figure speech express people countries wear masks outside pandemics Since Reddit seems love clickbait, based estimated March delivery J&amp;J's one-dose vaccines, would total 240 million doses across approved brands true.   Lol collected samples people reporting medical clinics hospitals. Right study skewed. That's needs time. break age (60+ year olds vaccinated first), start seeing Awesome! Getting round two week still gonna wear mask make 100% sure transmit vaccinations picking up. Aren’t process sued oblivion baby powder causing cancer? Basically, big surge infections young unvaccinated, cancelled dramatic fall cases among vaccinated elderly. thing happened hospitalizations, new hospitalizations among 60 age group outnumber 60+ age group first time. Graph: 

Full study: American here, school new case today. get one month average. Different grades K-8. 

This bullshit narrative schools safe enraging. Schools safe. fuck anyone kidding? asked show one link (smugly) told shit.

i showed one right front face says reduces transmission 90%.

why still talking? honestly NEVER thought even second cpvod numbers inflated lumping flu sufferers calling covid ... saw article. honestly thought laughable people believed morons. ... honestly know feel right now. zero percent chance flu entirely eradicated England. Zero.

So means something wrong way data gathered, that's case hard time trusting Covid numbers accurate now. Fuck, sucks. even worse, someone like feel way, KNOW going make whack jobs completely sure right along. Goddammit. least, need stop bullshit acting like fucked statistic try publish like real. Buying literally bad morons buying anti-covid restrictions. Proper triage two potential strategies, could easily quarantine vulnerable vaccinate likely spread it. Instead choose let young suffer, old want quarantine.  Well yes, we'd see drop cases deaths happen sooner instead giving second doses, gave somebody new first dose. It’s clearly due testing issues last week 7-day average deaths also increased today. 

Deaths lag cases. There’s way increase day like unless there’s something wrong testing. sure. Texas case, since one girl known tested positive party. remember occured fairly early pandemic, things started getting really serious first lockdowns released. got vaccine (i heart disease) people told ethical lie smoker Tbh number bullshit. Noone actually really gets tested flu even flu season. flu deaths calculated surplus deaths. Saying ""there zero flu deaths"" complete bullshit, even somehow chance true. Take Texas mix look 7-day average states. still stalling going up... also helping sequence tests countries, helping 26 currently.

The big issue numbers process (about 27,000 week processed 400 scientists, last saw) fact takes 5 days test result. need boost 36 hours properly effective. Oh, bother testing like US then? companies mRNA exclusively? vaccine flue jan, 3 days er Well fuck. 10 year old. can’t imagine pain. heart aches them. subscribe times online headline bad cable news Grats! would even confirm 100%? 

Besides, obviously taking fraction post context. 10 things address secondary causes spread knocks spread percent, yeah, lot lives. Exponential growth nothing sneeze at. 

Would happily sit chair used confirmed covid patient hours well ventilated cleaned? sitting sneeze droplets sweat? charts Worldometers shows gentle downward slope active cases Israel showing sharp drop metric. like there's entire planet full countries buy food anything. EU wants make poorer abandoning UK trade surplus go right ahead. lot talk amongst scientists variants might rise immuno-compromised patients harder time clearing infection, allows virus opportunities mutate. infants problem would concerning, immuno-compromised people scheduled get vaccines. Dude, going able pull ""everything sucks people age"" card people older \*literally dying\*.

You're expendable; bit selfish asshole, expendable. contrary, fact much, much likely live makes prioritized.

Proper triage care feelings. guess is, public health perspective, that's exactly he's saying that. enough vaccinated yet justify opening them, pretty hard right verify who's actually vaccinated crowd. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Also healthcare workers get vaccinated primary age children get nasal spray inoculation.

Plus costs £9 local pharmacy obviously universally accessible still fairly reasonable price imo essentially happened measles. 

If masks prophylactic influenza vaccine measles, expect low rates transmission. influenza, like 80+% world suddenly went hiking solo months end. might still able infect 20%, meet chance transmission window. odds slim. I'll raw dog bill imagine half-ass precautions be?  Could effect way flu virus mutates next year? Right announcing nightly curfew Purim festival weekend :(

So... It'll take time. guess cases really low. CDC guidance 6 weeks behind entire pandemic. would variants cause delays now? know vaccines effective them. 

Partial escape evolution resistant variant happen matter weeks. Look long took variant even incur partial escape! unknown, immune escaping going pop nowhere. Even so, variant ends causing severe disease, cares? We'll learn live it, adapt it. whether adjusted vaccines, etc. 

And really still long COVID? Spinal cords? Really? long COVID possible asymptomatic people? Sure. rare, unusual complications COVID possible? Sure. go many viruses vaccinate for, perform risk compensation them. way, know far risk greatly decreased disease less clinically severe. theory enough money time sort are. Say unlimited testing equipment people sacrificed huge portions time test, cancers would detected early stages. 

In reality , no. noone thought reality would lead us staying home 18months. normalized like everyone wears forever, like Asia since SARS someone sick go grocery shopping take train somewhere, culturally agreed upon wear mask prevent spread. bet fun parties

I say you. formed implication life matter wanted crap another person, even though said implied. I'd much rather hang urge poster you. Yes, course, areas, get 3 4 days interruptions, 7 day average smooth out, 14 day average would better smooth out.  Yeah? already Teachers. EVERYONE deemed essential except medical profession turned punching bag society. :/ Well yeah, eventually, better things happen faster happen slower. Source? curious want read this. whole population re-vaccinated 6 weeks well? point, development-time. least affecting countries hard hit others.

Source: ever happen though (i.e. FDA approve this)? We're quickly approaching point vaccines 2nd doses essentially add immunity masses. know manufacturers ramping up, yet. 

It's frustrating watch date get pushed obscurity, realize nothing new completely expected lol. We've always known mRNA vaccines 2 doses, I'm impatient. that, telling work expendable. two options, vaccinate old people quarantine young people work. Turns young people expendable society, surprise one.  doubt actual rise, last week exagerrated drop. horrible weather throughout country, bet lot people waited testing delays results. So, would expect small bounce level week. I'm in, saw weeks ago. dropping, plateud week, continued dropping. least, hope that's case    us ""Essential"" workers get watch rich people, obese people, politicians God knows else hop front us vaccines. Well time read things then. UK decide approve vaccines emergency use still transition phase (pre 2021), thus still following EU rule. EU law allows individual member states approve vaccines emergency use w/o waiting EMA approval. fck Brexit. Jesus Christ. pay taxes. I’m sick paying taxes whole fucking life never getting benefit it. crash market, foots bill, do. global fucking pandemic, foots bill, do. problem bailing investment firms reason never help people fuck over. fact matter elderly - even ones quarantining - dying much, much higher rate young retail workers.

So, yes. need protect them.  know mate, square insanely disproportionate amount Republican lawmakers died covid-19. make sense would affiliated Black Lives Matter. late 30's ""youngish"" friend 35 died scary. Speaking ignorant got real shitty e-mail one student's parents shut another week. angry school closing snow last week covid week. can't make stuff up. plenty peer-reviewed papers studies immune system works regarding ‘hygiene hypothesis’. . take time review sources evidence. Google scholar good source begin searching information. already going happen, soon American public fully vaccinated. jobs essential workers replaceable. supermarket brand equivalents America? clorox something specific it? UK Dettol cleaning product brand find brand/cheaper brands show I’m tired shit incompetence country EU wish would donate vaccines Canada United States 9th world terms deaths per capita. We’re middle stretch. 

South Korea isn’t island. Neither Vietnam. took scientific approach beginning. Vietnam argue communism able dictate policy, South Korea capitalist. 

Our culture selfishness coupled federal government intent spreading virus performed poorly. 

I think 250,000 would case federal response whatsoever. 

Europe got hit first, advantage us, even getting hit hard everyone knew treat STILL half deaths per capita. 

250,000 additional deaths accidentally setting nuclear bomb ourselves. Insane people try rationalize anything historic failure. job done

It true though. Cringe. like Europe much better. accessible anyone, happened get cheat code Maybe missing one arm missing one leg. Missing hands legs? fuck kind life that? That's effective vaccines \*DO\*.  vaccine reduce transmission, would ineffective failure.  

Who pays stuff? Yep. Positivity rate new hospitalizations lowest ever Indiana. Yep- way way off; in-between. Cozy steam heat breeze. Best. nice lasted “experts” say that, “experts” article posted disagree. Experts opinions dime dozen days. point? cities close ICUs Dunkirk Nice really reaching capacity maintaining rate contaminations risky terms hospitalisations know hold much longer. Help get straight, please. I'll try layman terms:

(1) common story Germany is, ""kids get Covid"". Looking USA, quite seem right.

(2) Covid commonly known respiratory disease there's pretty good chance taking damage blood vessels' linings [a recent headline passed said people dying Covid died due internal suffocation, i.e. organs receiving oxygen would needed].

(3) organs receiving enough oxygen kinds strange things except we're expecting normal circumstances.

(4) taking arms legs measure last resort keep body attached alive; would make things even worse.

...each steps reason enough keep Covid routine even numbers low there's reasonable amount people vaccinated regional population.

What quite get linked article (well, may tabloid quality journalism): claims MIS-C linked Covid people near people Covid ... either ""you're near someone transmitting SARS-COV-2 catch it, implications"" ""it's Covid"", right? Doubt it. What's happening today baked happened 2 weeks ago. Mobility up, cases up, UK variant up, people thought wanted reopneings, looks like beginnings resurgence. likely bad last due vaccines, trend clear (not anymore). confirm. Live brick apartment built 1925. Radiators keep TOASTY chance without windows open. California still dropped cases today week week. Florida did, lot.  states get snow-wrecked would good check. Fuck Walmart. They’re paying partner $11 hour risk life bullshit Quick comment -- there's big difference ""reduced transmission 10%"" ""reduced transmission 85%"" -- saying ""We knew going reduce transmission"" failing note IDEA MUCH would reduce it. comes anywhere near 85% reduction infection nearing god-level vaccination, hoping for, think ANYONE really expecting.

So, please stop gloating ""we knew would reduce transmission"" -- none knew MUCH would reduce it. GREAT news, mind you. new science (and, noted, still peer-reviewed). I've told store manager ""you replaced"" many times well COVID hit US  America, can't that

Who can? Cringe. Masks super common Korea pre-COVID. wear masks they’re sick, also air pollution levels high. Asia recent pandemic experience SARS MERS, whereas last real pandemic US hundred years ago. might explain mask culture existed prior COVID.

By time get vaccinated, 70-80% rest population (that wants get vaccinated) vaccinated well. that's wearing mask.

At bottom ocean question all. It’s $1.5/hour heroism Children literally need vaccine able reopen  people give them. Distribution hard. Plus can’t figure eligibility. Always were. I’d take one right Unless governor we're supposed like, like DeSantis Gianforte.  EU plants failing. US plant well, US plant helping supplement failed EU plants.

US AZ trying help EU. going continue social distancing mask wearing entire world vaccinated? aren’t. counties CA can’t get heads ass figure proper eligibility. still 75 plus category. don’t give shit news, politicians even doctors say: it’s going long time get done. can’t even get medically risk younger groups done yet. mean they’re literally even testing  Orange County edition? Fair point

But vast majority Americans aren’t overweight due hormonal issues like yourself

It’s mass consumption crappy foods coupled inactivity causing people die diseases overabundance

Doesn’t mean crucify shame folks widely educated upon helped; especially it’s degrees habits running family generations think yearly, maybe every couple years. even better, hopefully gives lifetime immunity. knew restaurants boxes food like that, like CSA produce $$$. Helped local restaurants good food California failing big time. live central California it’s hard find appointments, nobody knows who’s eligible. It’s fucked. I’m losing faith political medical communities right. Fishy  LOL waiting 90% herd immunity open anything back point may lacking bit nuance, optics telling one block deliver 90 million less 3 months telling deliver 40 million doses per month different block good eyes Europeans. That's called ramping production.

The increase quantities produced resemble ramp. state vaccinating anyone 60 unless they're healthcare.

its ""parent gets coworkers sick. get family sick. kids get classmates sick. classmates get parents sick. parents get *their* coworkers sick...""  6 PM curfew likely making things worse, compressing hours people go business, making stores streets crowded would people free spread things longer period time. Yep, Connecticut grocery worker here. rational person wants support this, internally know another way society showing much don’t give shit people profession. gladly take new timeline smile though customers agree stop treating us like garbage, won’t hold breath. EU large vaccine production capacity, many countries gotten confirmed deliveries producers make within EU. It’s important remember time Covid - banning exports, cutting countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan nations South America, almost certainly ruin relationship countries many more. true US currently exporting lot, countries depend much, much less US supply chain EU one. US mints global reserve currency. increased rates would bankrupt Europe overnight affect US one whit.. could pay debt single keystroke. keeping money cheap sake, avoid collapse global economy.

The virus running rampant - see stimulus deployed. 

Meanwhile, Australia scaling back stimulus near zero result policies. Real money saved. Good lord non-story. cares???? fair, people social distanced like month two economy would able begin recovering. Instead ""open economy"" people extended pandemic cost people jobs. Damn, really frustrating. guess assumed Biden going wave magic wand make stimulus happen first week office. never would thought would nearing end February concrete word stimulus coming. vulnerable already, protected focus needs mass vaccination.

My point ages 55-64 significant risk group, 45-54 non-trivial. need mass vaccinations robust supply, sudden abandonment focusing high-risk groups. Yes balancing act. balancing act leaves citizen's lives economy precarious position, make sense keep sticking doing.

Do think would better confidence EU amongst member countries plunged point countries started seriously considering exiting? accounts, France Germany handicapped EU, would made agreements vaccine makers much less lethargy, utterly fucked right now.

Also, first duty sovereign state protect citizens. failing that, matter great relations countries world?  nearly definition, cosigning idea ok keep years. cannot get 70% without kids vaccines even trials yet.

Covid19 infectious spread unintentionally stiffled spread regular viruses everyone put lockdown, wearing mask maintain social distancing.

This good put regular flu even measles extinction. Thanks Covid, might harder flu spread Unemployment collapsed social structure costs lives, aren’t fickle. Jobs schools social services preserve life, loss kills.

As far overrun, lots states try different tactics. harsh lockdowns (by US standards) quite minor. correlation exists strict lockdown low death rate, casual high death rate. strict states high deaths, casual states well. visa versa. problem think we're dumb easily manipulated, probably true, dumb think are. hate it, too. believe ability government solve big problems garner resources so, continued mistakes frustrating... Stop treating us like children persuaded eat veggies threats know empty. bring home bad unvaccinated partner, shot mask symptoms get super sick won’t? Wtf?

None true. amid pandemic, grocery chain making money, they're forcing managers cut hours. Like bro, need pay rent eat lol yall say fauci one moving goalposts says lot character.

It’s mainly Arctic blast fact lot people snowed weren’t prioritizing asymptomatic testing last 2-3 weeks. Can’t get good recovery rate unless higher infection rate first place... add factors dying? acceptable you? main point is, prevent get rid care one another follow common sense rules.

Aa happen, screwed thing God knows long. vaccines coming fast do, care Covid exists countries, we'll treat like Measles. would case, ones insisted visiting infection rate control.

And point start caring, it’s strange.  making promises regarding COVID-19 stupid misleading? called statistics. There's reason trials length were. totally unqualified making statements making. /r/enoughmuskspam could wait another two weeks get one reduces 7%? Teachers shown perform duties living rooms, never needing building student. 
We’ve also seen somehow society chugs right along teachers (entire school districts) snow days. 
How exactly industry historically shut entire week need society still functions despite viewed “essential?”

Give tradesman truck drivers across country snow day see happens. article says think enough resources required meet goals - state critical resources shortage of? I'm curious Yeah, “introvert” become sort shorthand “basement-dwelling shut-in”, that’s accurate all. I’ll bet dollars donuts poor communities (black brown) get lower efficacy J&amp;J (66% efficacy) vaccine, wealthy (white) communities get Pfizer Moderna 95% efficacy vaccine. Part reason California rich areas Beverly Hills received vaccines South LA hardly received much. I'm claiming same.

I'm saying acting like like normalize sacrifices bit far.

The best countries world dealing COVID due collectivist culture able selfless comparison individualistic cultures want sacrifice greater good. Yes... that’s idea. improved. heard something this. think going somewhere UK Maybe live 3rd world healthcare country 1 3 chance serious symptoms many folks trouble affording insurance find loophole pay bills gamble want take. euromomo excess mortality round line 2018 flu, maybe little worse.

What don’t understand vaccinating 1 hundreds thousands people make difference? children able spread COVID despite teacher vaccinated? teachers’ insistence vaccinating yet student body anything self serving? stop talk while? becoming increasingly clear true.

Despite sub singling extremely rare horror stories risk complications Children actually extremely miniscule. kid likely wind ICU flipped minivan COVID Nicely done! isn’t charitable, it’s critical prevent vaccine resistant variants.

If end epidemic means zero cases, may mean end, can't keep society closed indefinitely. We'll live risk. hospitals danger overrun, certainly now, need open society up. Behaviour shapes attitude, way round. probably strategy getting people maintain behaviour order understand reasons afterwards. example separate recycling bins. places don’t actually separate properly recycle, it’s better keep behaviour lest forgets reason importance green initiatives. words, yes, it’s desirable people continue wear masks even they’ve vaccinated signal behaviour becomes norm. Pfizer seems reliably track point probably even able deliver extra doses. J&amp;J leaves kind unsure end American company (although production facilities EU Janssen European) hope shitty AZ. AZ might also able cover losses.

If everything goes planned, we're July. remember transition, never made connection.

(Here's example young remember world 9/11:  Scotland data said AZ prevents 94% serious cases first dose. difference 94% 99% pretty negligible. second dose included, see 94% figure could anything get little bit higher, see dismissing research ""only"" observed effect one dose.  mom works grocery it’s deal. attempts enforce anyway, hasn’t confrontations gotten caught mgmt. She’s older high risk tolerate assholes. Hopefully mitch doesnt get covid business liability law passed. Hes trying since started. Oh look twister comes.. comes twister. guess you’re right. two things depend moment Pfizer deliveries time J&amp;J deliver somewhat expected. happens, even lacking deliveries AZ enough vaccines vaccinate 70% EU residents fully end Q2 cost whole world someone claims, thank confirming point. got expected ones two months later. 40% six months. results Scotland indicate vaccines excellent. People refusing AZ one. 14% AZ doses available Germany right used. bigger problem supply issues. buzzword

no, used ensure could travel work essential travel only. Germany used 14% AZ doses already has. point, delays even matter? highly effective vaccine huge image problem EU now. People refusing take it. image fixed, going sit warehouses. got measles likely another kid class infected pretty much entire school. I'm remembering correctly, shut couple weeks (this 70s). Virus traces showing PCR test, actual ""living"" (cultivable) virus? article even say. so?

The plan still basically same, Curevac small part would delay campaign week so. Q2 worth noting China also closed many caves blocking access scientists want check caves viruses.

They block scientists, blocked reporters. seems make lot sense, can't good idea load reporters trapsing place. Yeah deaths dropped everywhere though. may good idea give people 1st shot AstraZeneca 2nd shot CureVac months time. CureVac already working booster shot specifically new variants, EU Commission talking manufacturers converting current contracts orders booster shot. Biontech's CEO also opinion Covid vaccines likely mixed future. could easily - numbers would happy see do. Indeed although great excuse, even Swiss standpoint.

* 8mio people
* We've got plenty money
* We're country good health/pharma infrastructure
* We're EU thus bound process. 

Saying nothing could done there's enough dose bullshit. Here's Switzerland done:

* Understand beginning supply issues problem. Anyone could predicted that. 
* Spend per dose negociating contracts (like Israel did)
* Buy doses, supplier get go insure availability doses Q1. 
* Make sure Swissmedic ressources fast track vaccines homologations. Right take damn time even approve AZ one. 
* all, bite fucking bullet, spend 1 billion (which have) make sure get vaccines fast. 


But reason, pat themselve back saying they're target better EU (France etc.). Sure we're better France vaccination wise, Switzerland best worse good enough. 

We top 5 worldwide, that's expected.

Me: Shows person years, number events, CI link source:

You: Cries ""misrepresentation"", goes study entire population Scotland, shows reduction hospitalisations **from several thousand** 2

In source see subset makes **521** compared **700'859** person years unvaccinated, fewer thousandth.

So adjustments authors make (and mentioned comment thread), would expect around ten events, several thousand.

Why you

1. comment idea and
2. go exactly falsely accuse others of?  COVID likely beat HIV deadliest pandemic past 100 years. COVID’s still 200k short expect death rate collapse soon vaccines. AIDS unrelenting antivirals came full swing. never really cared getting it, concerned spreading hurt sit? got 2 doses Moderna local muscle soreness lasted least 3 days, felt significantly worse compared say flu vaccine. sleep left side first 3 nights getting vaccine, surely went butt would hurt sitting office chair? There’s lot angst article published December Pfizer sent unfinished vaccines Kalamazoo fit finished approved EU. person talking about, US producing finished vaccines house actually preparing export AZ moment everyone’s panic gets what. US gets approval, EO technically doesn’t apply. Vaccine companies largely like US dollars overpay. Same. ways love extra space &amp; distance, worry commuting work time lots things caused day day anxiety. ways, years depression trained deal well crises. 3 months hadn’t seen friends, coping spaces online suddenly filled videos people getting murdered racist rants, state caught fire couldn’t even go outside... broke. summer one worst depressions life couldn’t believe “all head” - pain coming outside, idea cope feeling like hope left.

I forget I’m writing this. Oh yeah, don’t feel bad coping well. coping different ways, people pick denial costs avoid pain &amp; anxiety. Others get stuck pain &amp; anxiety. We’re best.

Btw getting back antidepressants helped lot lol. You’re 100% right. general messaging culture negative actual outlook don’t want everyone goin back normal enough people vaccinated. think used variants another narrative tool too. vaccines 100% effective death hospitalizations variants, talking points were. restrictions France? cases dropping last weeks months? seams super stable high number. mobility up? figured it'd even lower last month storms  130 million 130 million total? Dutch news reporting company declared definitely deliver promised 180 million doses Q2. canceled mine anti vaxx covid forever get AZ EU plants EU already, Pfizer shipped out, EU open legal battle Pfizer that's case. (Moderna shipped thats Switzerland)

AZ plants US, India, UK fine EU major problems AZ-EU plant novastep read whole paper findings experts study doesn’t contradict anything previous findings experts. Let explain. 
What Hong Kong study pointing that: “the effectiveness certain nonpharmaceutical interventions might differ viruses (8). example, face masks shown efficacious blocking release coronaviruses influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, exhaled breath (9). addition, enveloped viruses (e.g., coronaviruses influenza viruses) less resistant lipophilic disinfectants nonenveloped viruses (e.g., rhinoviruses)”
It’s warning, measures might need considered avoid type outbreaks, current ones effective types infections.

Additionally, distant learning social distancing children still building immune system indeed problem. also pointed study linked before. Children congregating many months social distancing. short, may susceptible respiratory viruses likely fewer exposures people outside households thus fewer chances contract build immunity. immune system learning device, birth resembles computer hardware software data. Additional data must supplied first years life, contact microorganisms humans natural environment.
But again, even home, people still get exposed viruses bacteria, adult immune system doesn’t forget everything learned. immune system really interesting quite fascinating learn :) Fuck forgot thinking coronavirus killed Americans ww2 Physically impaired people fulfilling lives. hope find ways manage issues. mean, that’s even true. Coronaviruses generated 3 pandemics past 15 years. Ebola definitely gone away generated pandemic, though we’re ignoring currently. Zika spread widely awhile, Smallpox, Polio, Measles still killing tons people 1940s, you’re forgetting scourge planet: HIV really entered pandemic phase 1980s. someone proposing skip at-risk age group move general vaccinations. anything people refusing vaccine. nationalgeneralstrike.org Yup. started issues management talked useless rep. couple times vacation. Look hospitalizations. 55k that's peak 130k little month ago. Yes variant something keep eye things still disastrous states, steadily improving now. I'm telling you, Utah jazz playing packed arena come playoff time May, case counts deaths super low. going lit state opens vaccinations tomorrow #1 now?

No state done Florida Florida consistently screwed every chance get. governor **threatened withhold vaccinations** justifications complain incompetence last week. 

To find Florida done wrong ask Florida officials DeSantis threatened let residents die keep quiet. true point pandemic; never enforced. am, technically still allowed—the limit like 10. much lethal virus spread like one would ultimately trigger martial law. virus sits right edge considered acceptable order lose freedoms fight it. Vaccine efficacy become important people I'm surprised checked childhood shots made sure get ones highest efficacy. Don''t kinkshame Yeah missed part give shit sniffles. Covid issue matters anymore. think you’ll seeing people masks (even mandates expire) quite time, help. Somebody's store plumbing problems. literally devices read mind make actions happen thoughts now. time kid grows up, I'm sure still able plenty. needs voted. Best case 80% adults get this. means enough supply end april. state governess say ability get arms NOW. 2 month wait. Holding aside +100M people antibodies actually getting disease.

To clear, end pandemic USA real quick. US received news multiple different manufacturers J&amp;J going significantly slower expected Pfizer/Moderna delivered December. difference US prepared go online moaning shitty Pfizer Moderna underdelivering. ever cases still dropping hell lol wild supposedly nonpolitical sub fun brigade comments days. wearing mask actually burden threat LiBeRtY  I'm current UFCW member, nice opinion validated. contact also limited twice-yearly newsletters?

Hardly shocking news, people like summer holidays hospitality scheduled open summer.   Big news, remember testing vaccine tested height pandemic. rates lower.

April-May/ whenever weather starts getting really good. think anyone wants shot get one June 20th? testing two doses believe. know we've preliminary results though. You’re insane think this.

Feb. 5, seven Covid-19 related deaths placebo group none vaccine group.  researchers counted cases 28 days vaccination, zero hospitalizations vaccine arm 16 placebo arm.  new documents, Johnson &amp; Johnson said South Africa, vaccine reduced severe critical Covid-19 81.7% starting 28 days vaccination, efficacy moderate disease 64%. company said vaccine efficacy affected high prevalence another variant Brazil. 

This seems like good news.  European countries? suggestion politicians one region country. Sweet.

Better say end summer everyone wants one get reality bit better say everyone get one May something miss mark. It’s really weird situation. Toronto, issue occurs here. Wealthy foreigners China (mostly) purchase properties let sit empty, enough city looking vacant property tax. 

But time, investments helped propel Toronto global city cases. lot thank wealthy investors for, bit upset about. racist sentiment Asian people (almost exclusively Chinese descent) long building here, beginning COVID push many people needed explode.

But current moment, think slightly tapered off. Chinese-dominant neighbourhoods Toronto among lowest infection rates city, people notice taking COVID quite seriously. know father choice words March, immense respect cautious are. Anyone else frustrated slow daily rate doses administered? realize last week's storms factor last week. 

Yesterday, least according site, 854k doses administered.   
And, average last 9 days 1,248,323. storms lasted couple days (outside Texas) Fauci said make difference now.

What gives? Game Last November. Like think people still locked home?

That's science says. Unlike vast majority viruses, appears kids big spreaders coronavirus. There's literally news story today UK they've restated there's scientific reason treat teachers differently anyone else. Gold liquor longer illegal. Delusional thing expecting situation improve.

They need outright illegalize - stringently control access carried. tried yet, absolutely fucking pointless say work. reading data right 28 days one received actual shot hospitalized vs 7 hospitalized placebo group? Less people getting sick period great numbers matters most. MS governor announced yesterday teachers eligible vaccination March 1st. applauded. word grocery store workers. go flyers everyone able go straight home ventilator longer required stay ICU; still required care hospitalization. 

I understand logic placing people nursing homes came - there's staff nursing homes used treating people oxygen taking care people.

However, sticking people recovering (and often still positive ...) highly contagious deadly virus CLOSED BUILDINGS great circulation highly vulnerable population ... criminal part. single shot vaccine way less side effects need special storage definitely game changer (even though quite effective) Memorial Day well, masks hitting trash cans know plus nobody take another summer bottom sitting well. Plus lbh mask burning/bye forever Zoom bashes. vaccinated, that's bottom line. variants show evidence infectious, deadly. caused terrible outbreak UK, already careful. caused outbreak among children Israel, vaccinated all.

Pick anyone want guess... it’s propaganda boost spirits slaving away $8 people getting paid stay home. everyone capability. know lots people US don’t sick leave work. don’t show up, can’t pay bills.  staff report meant brief FDA’s Vaccines Related Biological Products Advisory Committee, meet Friday review J&amp;J’s request emergency use. come subreddit afraid, truth!!

^^But ^^seriously, ^^this ^^is ^^awesome! definitely comes bit lower I'd expect. know they're modeling that, based estimate Dec 31 latest estimate, based number confirmed cases time, they're modeling we're detecting 50% infections point. sure buy that. fantastic news. Thank you. grounds though? hospitalisations deaths low, would this? health officials often want us manage expectations, hence sometimes appear negative. 

For past month, UK officials warning Britons book vacation abroad summer, day Johnson came said international travel could resume early May.

They present worst case scenario imo, mention data receiving Israel promising expected.

Also it’s middle winter USA already dropping one restriction other, would justification bring back later? Masks might stay though. efficacy severe disease 85% interval, efficacy seems increase time. seems like shot reaches maximum efficacy somewhere around 50-60 days. Always makes sad homeless teens US. know probably choice, otherwise thing. sound like conspiracy theorist far mutations news seem like fatal blow. Something keep eye truth news latch onto negative headlines clicks. They've talking months numbers mostly looking better Yes... office year.

And top handed 60 paid childcare days (3 Month) impacted covid need watch kids(Also worldwide) bumped paid PTO death family.

Those 5 days roughly 3100 years vacation based 156.000 employees  drugs approved, want sign subject matter experts obviously related subjects.

Take example: ski safety team comes guidelines staying safe slopes, avoid dying avalanches. snow science experts forecasters look it, different types survival experts involved, everyone basically agrees recommendations sound. talk radio experts recommended radio protocols, think one points might get useful feedback. lack feedback could cost lives fundamental misunderstandings limitations radios minutiae technology involved. 

Having broad spectrum people look something costs time money, often worth it. Next week especially following week it’s probably certain hitting 2million days. Maybe even following week. latest CDC study recent international studies directly contradict statement. Children certainly get COVID spread it, low risk getting anything serious. 

People arms Wisconsin study came saying ""WE NEED OPEN SCHOOLS"" got real quiet comprehensive study far showed closing schools universities contributed massive amount reducing R 1, CDC deep dived Georgia school district showed certainly outbreaks schools. Excellent! That’s great start!! Sweden weird. Yeah word ""now"" heavy lifting post title. Ngl, point I’d wheeze juice Brandon Frazier 7/11 style that. get measles room person measles been, even two hours person left. infected person spread measles others even knowing he/she disease—from four days developing measles rash four days like almost biological dirty bomb. highly unlikely aren’t great stopping transmission, even weren’t, going start life summer. I’m going bars. I’m going hang friends. I’m going see family. No. numbers synptomatic disease. got first glimmer hope rite aid got end said someone got slot signed signature pad. Covid killed half million people already. think we're well past ""it's different"" threshold.

Of 80% retirement age whole third 85+. I'm discounting lives implying they're people, throw general statement ""half million people died"" kind irresponsible LARGE portion deaths reflect SMALL portion society, least US though imagine rest world much different, especially areas multigenerational households prevalent.

So, disastrous disease, really much different literally 85% US society. produce enough data make sure older people protected can't use people needs most

Don't Scottish spring month

Most Western Europe peak deaths April last year - there's plenty time vaccines save thousands lives ""But big message same: right now, variants all, *we’re winning*. vaccines work, whole list them, production increasing watch. countries gotten faster starts vaccinating populations already seeing effects, bad safety signals yet complicating things. seeing evidence far antibody-dependent enhancement (worse infections recurring people already vaccinated). keep pressure keep ramping vaccine supplies rollout around world, going beat virus. Good riddance it.""

\-Derek Lowe Get young man. 2 weeks risk greater driving friends house catching COID there. CNBC terrible news source continues lie. Melissa Lee worst newscaster reporting much fake news needs Fox.

Many cited failing limit capacity. policies generally effectuated change behavior throughout state. example mall failing follow state guidelines, people going malls caring, indicative total effect orders state.

I'm sure argument state succeeding ""despite"" Newsom actually comes play things. I'm sure even know whether interested attacking California political ideological reason. Really depends interacting with, young people live young friends online school basically interact older people. ask isolate everyone entire year personal risk risk contact low ridiculous. I'm famous! Jesus. I’m sorry hear that, tried see doctors anything? like 95 percent employees work home? earth able get another one later, proves problem?! 6 months probably get/buy covid vaccine anywhere.  Doesn’t matter. don’t make laws 100% compliance. make overall positive effect. LOL Saying anything people gay sex would seen veiled homophobia

You say that, ""gay people need stop sex"" *was* prevailing public health messaging early days HIV/AIDS epidemic. know troll post actually believe either...

Well, still bit much. safely go hike, bike rides friends outdoors. I've year literally everyone fine wait second dose. isolated long wait shot maximum efficacy?

I mean would think could leave house go walk....like though? think need prisoner house gathering people might well wait.  Christ, point Puritanism. group friends vaccinated definitely allowed get together. Jeezuz, people fucking insane yet, certain states Iowa Montana removing mask mandates. others, like Florida, never implemented one first place. anyone says vaccine rollout mess actually idiot doesn’t know they’re talking about. We’re better even thought could. lock don’t see anyone weeks start developing mental issues, cheat see friend, spend week going “omigodomigod sick cough” go back locking again, cycle repeated throughout past year.  Hope best. Plan worst. listen *actually* know they're talking about.  hopeful. think people naturally pessimistic, people want gets hopes dashed long, terrible year.

Some people jerks. heavy lockdown paper. reality lockdown fatigue settled 4 months light lockdown people dont really carr anymore ""list shopping""? Also say waitlist, outside current vaccination categories put list case extra dose becomes available got call up, something else? Try clearing cookies. Newsom adjusts reopening guidelines

the threat recall vote might help motivation reopen. Thanks man, following Czech news coz since last year March waiting Czech borders open get work visa. intern Prague lovely country lovely people. Planning move appreciate good wishes  Eh, sucks, law.

It probably worth event organizers hold events usual times anyway risk getting trouble, wait even instead. Especially vaccine Emergency Use Authorization. Could ignoring precautions primary reason state experienced massive outbreak around holidays?? Hmm... positive 48 environmental allergies, 5 foods 3 medicine taken shots Pfizer reaction won’t lie taking Benadryl second one helped lot, glad It. Hubby history osteosarcoma didn’t feel thing. hope two teams enjoy it. Fauci saying can’t pull back 2022 Gottlieb saying we’ll likely need input measures Fall again, chance doesn’t mean cut capacity winter sports. Sure guess. know we're matrix? larger gallons cleaning solution originally meant janitors they're getting us cheaply possible. assume ill intent top list worries, data available inquired upon. That’s part matters. Fluid mechanics stand point, don’t think age/use effect effectiveness (maybe electrically charged). get damn gross bit. Good. I've looking appears 28% couple weeks ago margin error going either way Upset scroll far see question. want know well. Furthermore risk variants could merge something even worse.

??? know getting downvoted. Hospitalizations deaths still falling fast. people attended exercise classes “on day received positive test result,” report said; others attended exercise class day symptoms began after.   

Dumb fucks inclement weather caused bunch shipping delays led temporary vaccine shortages pushed back bunch appointments would happened. we're mostly constrained available vaccine doses rather say nurses jab vaccines people's arms, means vaccines administered later catch going anyway. sure long take though. nation conspiracy theorists think they’re smarter everyone else 😬 Pfizer what? took risk german company really, Americans vaccinating higher rates almost every country. can’t get appointment quite yet, it’s demand high. don’t see problem next two months going trajectory doses expected shipped. comes pairs

I think mean Paris. called Eiffel Tower. get you’re coming from, longer plays poor countries, longer death devastation occur impact even USA. I’m saying don’t vaccinate Americans, course every country prioritize own. However, needs eye towards immediately expeditiously addressing global problem coordinated global solution NOW. bounce okay okay, working, working, working out, working out, drinking, drinking, video gaming, plain ready break cycle. alone, ""not alone"", thats damn sure. news, long take begin sending quantities?

I'm guessing say hyperbolic shit every thread sub need push conspiracy theories. 

Go back r lockdownskepticisim first 2 months things actually kind nice. considered hero’s felt good appreciated once. people walking thanking job. man must used luck that, holy shit. Death threat death threat wanted safe. want tad bit safer asking wear mask wouldn’t even get that. sit watch us move list. supposed vaccinated healthcare workers along high risk people. teachers chain smokers cut front us. Who’s going cut us next? Amusement park employees, people work gun ranges, people go skate parks? apparently we’re assholes wanting vaccines right now. want actually safe once, want go work worry day catch spread back family. teachers get stay home get vaccinated essential workers show up? school essential. I’m whining. California students way behind rest country now. I’ve lost much respect teachers told personally sick babysitting think parents tired kids. degrade profession statements. reality would find another reason masks work.

Blaming Fauci silly, going side Trump GOP politicians matter what. 25% vaccinated may Meanwhile Canada we've received less 2 million doses total pfizer moderna combined. Sad life true. grocery store work ZERO signage wearing mask. bosses don’t even allow us ask customers wear masks properly. go give customers mask cases enter store maskless. still serve samples deli. Hell, even employees don’t wear masks properly. don’t “Social Distancing Pies” floor. periodic PA safety message, damn Sirius XM playlist everyday weeks.

Racial desegregation would never occured federal government force country. federal government must provide equitable distribution state governments refuse to. look way Missouri severely underdistributed vaccines St. Louis, predominantly black city. possibility “you could dead couple weeks” always exists minute risks accept every day life. deal them, don’t hide bed them, either. Covid is, be, different. think people stop qualifying decisions making ""because pandemic"" ""we pandemic""? Obviously depends region I'm curious hear people's thoughts. put fake email bloomberg Ever pandemic... continue punish kids this? Really. 
We figure everything else schools volumes science saying work still no-go. 
Fast forward Sept 2021 still sounds like masks plexi glass 1st graders bars full-go.  
Get ready people bearing brunt social distancing 1st graders.  joined recently cautiously, I’m pleasantly surprised. 
I thought going pessimistic poo poo party . Important question vaccines. come transmission rates long haul safety? long haul rates amongst vaccinated get covid - whether asymptomatic mild severe?

I believe rates go across board, seen data unclear would go zero vacuum maybe, far worse existing vaccines. meet existing standard care approved. Well happening going age range drive thrus etc. soon lines start die (i.e. soon drop below, say, 95% utilization spots), drop age range 5 years.

This effectively prioritize at-risk slowing process.

Drive thru's, show ID prove age. That's it. trend continued, we’d less month. trend never going continue. 

Be realistic. least somewhat. Fuaci said masks 2022 probably say masks 2023 beyond even 100% population vaccinated. already stirring variant scare saying vaccines useless need lockdowns and. Maybe person low oxygen saturation. several elevated heart/breath rate. Two vaccine related questions: Right I'm ineligible vaccine, General Population months so.

When get eligible, who've choose? understand today, two providers, looks like Johnson Johnson approved, excellent news. time get eligible there's possibility could even more....there dozens development (though may eligible US). also possible choice likelihood large rollout. may also know be, right there's limited vaccines country (the US) even many 'front-line' workers yet eligible states. Plus might different two three months too...

Secondly, I'm wondering there's vaccine tracker that's good follow showing world/US/state vaccinated numbers. loved Bloomberg this, often updated day late, always used updated numbers (as vaccines constantly change). others course, NBC, many states, set time early. liked Bloomberg updated. Unfortunately 'register' it. really want bombarded emails stuff. anyone know better source that's free accessible Internet? wonder many anti-vaxxers US. messaging makes sound like vaccines nothing, reality extremely effective enough make risk covid negligible summer 2021. I’m anti science whatsoever. believe many epidemiologists fail weigh economic, social psychological factors decisions. person probably whole life, think everyone else can, Yeah agree strategy completely. Go likely super spreaders... Many/most already virus though still give additional immunity likely. Let’s see....I lost job (although part time), church, close group friends, plus random events attend last year. Yet, know I’m one lucky ones. live Spain I've heard this. Seems like sensationalised story. PA asked Israel provide vaccines made arrangements drug makers WHO. Yeah, uh, GOOD NEWS? Epidemiologists study epidemiology ""the branch medicine deals incidence, distribution, possible control diseases factors relating health. ""

So kind weird generalization making epidemiologists going sound like anti-science nonsense. jealous CT happy Dude good meat cutter hard find. honestly can't train easily. Ive seen meat cutters worked underpaid. making more. Fair enough store never treated essential I'm sure asking? saying originally nursing home residents? 

&amp;#x200B;

In case, sticking recovering people places, yes. keep forgetting places restrictions. live Florida. haven’t restrictions several months now. might exceptions South Florida, I’m sure. massive state really three states. 

Personally, I’d rather get covid even though I’m naturally low risk people struggling lingering symptoms despite mild infection. Brain fog fatigue would kill job quality life. 

So I’m waiting Pfizer/Moderna. said, Florida already 100% open, doesn’t change equation anyone else meaningful way. 'or' there, could one first 2 conditions still 93%+ oxygen saturation. Let's turn Cathy Shooter Steve start getting shots arms. Mild pain, swelling, redness, chills, fatigue, tiredness, headaches usual side effects I've read. seem mild J&amp;J single shot vaccine. Although I've heard side effects really bad second shot Moderna &amp; Pfizer vaccines obviously everyone experiences North Dakota Europe. exactly Florida done lambasted for. Actually, many states started first weeks rollout, well UK countries. risk death extremely stratified age it’s dozens hundreds times effective vaccinate age profession. Also, elderly people infect others well, they’re likely infect elderly essential workers even transmission standpoint makes sense vaccinate age. partner vaccinated it’s us :) things, unless business requests it. done. guess depends whether means actually know someone know died vs ""know"" necessary aware death.

Like know everyone went high school tell certain none died past year. fellow Germans: @ “I won’t take shit, it’s 85%”. Better dying COVID. realize real way eradicate flu would close schools colleges mandate distancing capacity restrictions every flu season? Masks alone won’t shit Huh? sucks rest world medical research advanced United States. good news herd immunity come rescue. Dude, going wait 5 fucking years, can't materialize answers thin air. Get it. authoritarian government make w/e fuck wants regardless laws existed before. 

Your logic baffling. There's things world stupid ""slippery slope !"" wonks. 

Diseases coming back anti-vax idiots exactly caused stupid thinking like yours.

Mandatory vaccination protect people, ""abuse rights"", again, authoritarian government wants abuse rights go fine, care preexisting legislation. definitely tough issue. way grocery store workers treated shameful. problem sort approach many industries make case they're essential things turn political nightmare lobbyists, scientists, activists talk what's fair terms class, race, gender, age, etc.  


The perfect plan might take account, seems like complicated plan gets harder actually put play. Working age seems option gives best balance fairness, damage mitigation, ease application. never ""new normal"" begin with. ACIP meets tomorrow, looks like approval may w though. current UK gov, I'm sure made decision even still part EU. Since framework allows individual member state make decisions, countries led anti-EU govs take every opportunity show electorate they're better (or least cause friction within EU ""going rogue"")? mean sub literally ground zero type talk long time. clear ""UK variant"" first isolated UK. mean originated there. time UK almost 50% worlds genomic testing Australia &amp; NZ making much rest.
The US massively behind much else. Thankfully Biden charge might see change now, prefaced here.  scientists one year really deserve kudos.

Not even year. vaccine developed around May/June last year. time since spent trials. Agreed, twitter nice follow live events also occasional funny viral trend, covid discussion wall happens shut borders pandemic. write anything controversial here? second time voted.

There people site get upset suggest kind inequality exists Israel, people get upset fact people elderly get sick die COVID brought up. They're silly course  flu fear behind like virus. first wave vaccinations bet raise price unimaginable levels high school. caused immense depression anxiety. would anything fully back.  People pass vaccine available wait month 2 something think better *are selfish making things worse rest us*. States making decisions dropping restrictions based many vaccinated. arm chair scientists think know better going delay reopening. Selfish level though gotten past country. Yep wanna pay insurance. deal PR Epidemiologists would everyone stay indoors forever. balance risk snd benefits  largest burden put least vulnerable? expect face worse consequences willing quarantine longer? Instead almost certainly negative effects told life matter sacrifice. Developing countries depend fda ema approval resources approve vaccinations. approved fda approve based that. still significant. Pfizer moderns gotta make thier $$$$$$

Vaccines really profitable pharmaceutical companies. governments throwing much money one, vaccines would taken years develop. ready $3000 shot like insulin

Yes somehow makes sense, look mega expensive regular flu shots, right ? 


Wish vaccine stupidity could get immunized. “We know vaccine prevents **85 percent severe disease. . . . 100 percent effective preventing hospitalization deaths, that’s really what’s important,”** said Nancy M. Bennett, professor medicine public health sciences University Rochester School Medicine Dentistry. “Those facts important thing recognize.""

What, stage, definition severe disease? estimation severe... basically bad case flu? Awful otherwise treatable home? expires March 5th. Considering every restaurant I've picked food full new capacity already, I'm thinking people comfortable ditching masks. guess government mandate expires stores enforce less less point early April signs 50% people wearing masks anyways. Lysol wipes would great actually. I'll take cylinder. I've read countless times fomite transmission extremely rare.

Maybe sources information somewhat Public health officials staff Christchurch facility carried extensive investigation, including viewing CCTV footage. rubbish bin identified common factor.  dissimilar case Rydges \[hotel\] Auckland believe maintenance worker may picked virus pressing button lift shortly someone Covid-19 used it.""  cases confirmed tricky virus could be, Ministry said, transmitted via well New Zealand government controlled virus, think safe assume pretty good idea possible, told us least two separate cases transmission via contaminated surfaces. Way less side effects? side effects I'm missing? Yang wins NYC mayoral race may get wish. wants host borough borough celebrate ""end"" COVID. Yes. Johnson Johnson supposed 20 million doses March, it'll take April get people's arms, J &amp; J really mean extra ~4% vaccinated March guess.  rights people infected stupid selfish assholes?

Can name another disease ""the right"" infected?

&amp;#x200B;

\~Stockholm 45% immunity already. 45% need take experimental vaccine, already virus? 65's vaccinated, anyone else need vaccine?

Vaccines reserved old people / healthcare workers Flu rushed unknown long term effects. Working grocery seriously sucks right now. Feels like people get impatient rude goes on. 

I’ve gotten cursed multiple times enforcing mask policy. 

Got COVID Christmas Eve, still haven’t received sick pay promised Whole Foods. 

Hero pay long gone. WF actually changed 30 min lunches paid unpaid, they’re shortening shifts. Effectively ~5-10% pay decrease. slap face. mass vaccination sites spinning place, ready go supply longer much issue. smallish state one already, another coming online weekend planned. doses many right now, infrastructure place doses. Arabs (whether Muslim, Christian Druze) Israeli citizenship get vaccinated like everyone else. Palestinians living Palestinian Authority get vaccinated government. Worked California 8 Washington 21. California 8 lot better thought. yeah union sucks. You’re downvoted saying facts. Take humble upvote! that's curfew, lockdown. I'll start saying I'm bad place morning, apologize confrontational.

I think could use compassion love other. many suffering COVID, fear COVID, effects COVID.

There also many suffering mental health anguish, depression, job loss, destruction lives, etc.

There many suffer both.

I understand frustrated see people willfully disregard fears, sacrifices, willingness contribute.

But think tone taking dismissive pain others, lacking human compassion. tone, matter.

I hope get together without tearing apart. know struggles too, working it.

That's trying say, acting like asshole. changing game Yeah know. lot countries happens. hope every country realizes teachers making successful society. need paid well. Hang mate. sure things improve  live 1970s? guess no, fun paying $1000 loaf moldy bread dont grab keys, get car, drive nearest rite aid, stand line, turn get vaccine .. SHOVE BUTT Less risky still risky willing kill somethings. world experts want young adults shoulder burden this. Unknown currently, long hauler symptoms well understood current know theories underlying issues/mechanisms post viral diseases conditions without understanding driving would anyone's guess. marginally increased (not coincidentally) time testing centers states affected storms reopened major testing centers reporting numbers. It’s disingenuous (bordering fear mongering imo) point data evidence things getting worse  70% effective strains Pfizer 85% for. 100% effective hospitalization, 100% severe 56 days. Also broadly, getting long-studied vaccine techniques approved state probably laid groundwork similarly fast possibly faster response next unknown disease found.   you’re* Sleep apnea well Umm, testing eventually found unsafe? There's reason process is. virus stays system mutates build resistance antibodies. don’t think vaccine effective 90 days. guarantee effective 90 days, based reviewed data. Time flat circle sub opposed re-opening schools?

It's... not. comments see sub relating subject people saying person activities including schools open, comments say tend get heavily downvoted. think we're fully done variant storyline yet. They'll bust every couple weeks, make sure we're good terrified despite mountains good news get buried headlines. 

But they'll milking Covid next 10+ years, like 9/11. Yeah I'm here. I'll waiting Pfizer/Moderna (or novavax ever approved). don’t know reinfection common uncommon. can’t refute points classified. isn’t worth discussing you. don’t care facts learning things hadn’t considered before. PA NY rough.  wasted equivalent 2 workdays trying. got 500k doses Astra Zeneca India yesterday usually, takes gew days quality control distribution.

Poland's promise that, promise.  know sure? rehashing random people reddit say? laughed way hard this... thank hope comes true, strains seem getting immunity vaccine (there's apparently new California strain, unreviewed paper). believe claims huge delivery happening vaccine maker see tje shipments. That's exactly hesitation one

Same selfish going back office every day need to? family 60's staying past months need get focus work. rented office complex that's fairly quiet. People mostly okay mask use; use common areas/can take rooms

&amp;#x200B;

I stay office door shut run portable air purifier quite liberally. Although can't crack window, landlord (whom I've known long time trust) assured change HVACs air filters regularly necessary. I've wearing mask around common areas house part event catch anything.

&amp;#x200B;

My biggest fear catching spreading, feel like I'm taking best precautions can. family members seem mind all. I’m sorry, hope improve soon.

Is loss smell/lack appetite Long term effect you? One cousins still hardly eat everything tastes like grainy cardboard gluey slime. pretty much situation makes sense unless referring getting booster next year potential variants. really really wanted to, could probably pay supply longer issue. dad's lung issues past year so, I've doctors nurses standard measure applicable everyone, there's still significant portion people lower average O2 SAT perfectly normal them. long dad 90 they're happy he's oxygen. drops 88 get bit concerned overmuch even full oxygen he's normally managing 94 consistently, he's always measured way, years. Proof? listen closely hear alarmists shrieking flu mentioned Nothing brought ""irrelevant."" difference ""we know person previously covid exactly 87% lower chance catching covid 6-9 months infection"" ""we know reinfection common."" Iceland. Iceland could done it. 
But nope. Israel. It’s kind funny think it. started beginning December. finished giving everyone vaccine every region phase 3 trials. phase 3 interim results come earlier. still expect later Q1.

Take NovaVax example. released phase 3 interim results, still recruiting US phase 3 trials. think finished recruiting US phase 3 trials. mind asking, long booking appointment actual appointment date? family CT well. Yes, think b117 much concern US. Yes J&amp;J definition moderate includes everyone else calling mild. broad definition moderate. hospital US right - least news about. people working Covid still working Covid patients burned exhausted. 

Despite good news lowering cases risk getting Covid still extremely high NYC, one example. Cases still much higher summer, falling post-holiday peak. supposed database people who've gotten it, really hope open sort API actually verify things vs little paper cards thing now. True Freedom^TM ! parents boss orphans around virus hoax! ^/s Damn ineptitude world leaders especially last U.S. Administration. US reacted differently believe world would followed tragedies would avoided. Ok....

If partial herd immunity, b117 variant smaller concern place like US? would nice, likely steep decline due holiday season over. need mass vaccinations robust supply, sudden abandonment focusing high-risk groups.

We're currently supply bottleneck point transition distribution dosing constraint. That's open everyone. 55-64 there's enough doses group go around, point extra verification steps might actually mean opening everyone would actually mean get *sooner* higher overall throughput. point think Scott Gottlieb making NYC early global epicenter many reasons tens thousands infections even noticed locked masked up. Comparing directly Florida idiotic spread/contract covid less 15 minutes, though haven’t seen data five minutes. also depends factors like masks, distance, ventilation. Study: [The National Football League observed SARS-CoV-2 transmission &lt;15 minutes cumulative interaction, leading revised definition high-risk contact evaluated mask use ventilation addition duration proximity Maybe school age kids then. Personally kids favor kids returning long community spread crazy. Mine returned weeks ago relief, 6 year old enjoys school learning again, crying computer.  Vat covid, good band name... ever see bands fucking bring Geez sounds difficult. lot dollar stores live also Aldi, Walmart discount/less expensive grocery stores. I’d say Wegmans maybe ShopRite probably fanciest grocery store have. There’s Costco, Whole Foods Trader Joe’s. Personally experience consoomed less last year like make wait weekend make suspenseful, probably Monday. There's people CAN'T vaccination. Herd immunity also them. Thank you! I’m excited! reason CDC NYS feel vaccine effective 90 days? go data use quarantines we’re kinda screwed? vast majority experts field call stringent business closures mitigation measures, Gandhi — professor medicine UCSF — called ""harm reduction"" approach also considers risks beyond COVID-19 infection making public view popular one among policymakers experts city state. Gandhi confident one day, she'll vindicated.

I believe vindicated 2 3 years long

It thing. Go read history book. spring 1918 basically unnoticed issues going like WW1. 

It bad fall 1918 (remember Philly v. St. Louis graphs), places hit hard fall 1918, impacted nearly level fall. small 4th wave spring 1920 (I know great grand parents died SF 1920). But, also know SF...there restrictions fall 1918 6-12 weeks restrictions. restrictions place basically sick - health quarantined everything open. 

It less year US. Restrictions 3 months. Period. Awesomely informative, thank you. also trying figure could get ""severe"" hospitalized, seems answer. one county 5 months ago. 0.02% deaths literal video posted counted covid deaths actually covid explain go remove deaths.

That's definition misinformation. linking video, giving misleading information it, assuming watch it, misleading people false conclusion. Kissing strangers spitting EVERYWHERE probably keep banging this, much interpretation here.

Do goalkeepers hockey soccer prevent goals scored? Clearly, prevent *some* goals scored; merely goalkeeper sufficient ensure clean sheet.

The vaccine might awesome goalkeeper mean one, whether asymptomatic mildly symptomatic, ever transmit virus vaccinated. could possibly think HIV severe Covid?

HIV still killing keep killing Americans. There's cure may never vaccine. stupidly expensive drug cocktails make manageable. COVID likely like Polio year out: Something think traveling third world. would ideal works, honestly last 12 months....you poke J&amp;J twice year end time. 3: bunch Swedes convinced nothing done prevent virus spreading people agree people category easy disprove looking society large changed. friends forced work home since pandemic started. Universities gone online. Stores see decreasing numbers customers.

The idea plenty people Sweden saying Sweden nothing

And can't disagree know country reality different authorities say

In Romania example strict rules... applied unevenly Got first dose Pfizer today I'm suddenly thinking buying Zune. Really wish would trials Pfizer moderna one shot doses.

Lmao Oh alerts Apple news made sound like Hispanics South Asians top head. Sorry, may misread that.

My point percentage matter here? seeking equate children?

It's FACT huge surge October-January due holidays.

It seemed like questioning whether actually happened. Yeah. flu shot 95% effective like covid vaccines. get flu shot end getting flu, symptoms usually lot less severe. 

Simply giving population flu shot every year significantly reduce number flu related deaths year. huge especially people stop wearing masks social distancing future covid eventually contained. People likely get covid shot nightmare last year, would also get flu shot much better off. I'm predicting international travel back much longer go bars stuff again. don’t need 30 40% get vaccine. It’s estimated 20% population already infected Covid. Add 50 70% getting vaccine 70 90% population mostly protected infection likely protected severe disease death. Yes. efficacy % reports place. Every scientist involved known vaccine safe effective weeks (probably months) FDA authorized use yet. Meanwhile thousands die daily. 

It's guaranteeing death name ""safety"". Teachers country, always needing time money, UK 16 weeks per year, plus countless training days yet enough. must credential able play martyr. guys think next big “spike” gonna gets hyped doesn’t happen? Last time super bowl, what’s next? Saint Patrick’s day? We're damage kids now. ones told ""selfish"" depressed completely isolated friends, milestones like prom graduation high school sports, staring screen ""school"" day, true college experience still paying nose education., etc."". That's new story.

I would assume eviction homelessness crisis big story summer reopen moratoriums lifted.

Then fall winter roll around ""WORST FLU SEASON CENTURY"" one exposed germs year. still concern think important thing remember difference experience body does. 

Mild symptoms without vaccine may partially due body fighting back fighting back hard. would mean virus time damage body figures fight it. 

Post vaccine body knows fight virus sees far likely attack faster keep spreading far. may still get mildly sick body fights back virus less time opportunity spread damage. 

Obviously none guarantee either way imagine mild case post vaccine far less likely able spread way cause lasting damage. actually know that. one, we've documented infected people retain antibodies least months memory cell immunity persists longer that. know least amount immunity present people covid. Then, US alone documented 28 million cases, nearly 10% population, continues run million tests per day. scenario, reinfections common would documented many cases reinfections. much data, absence evidence evidence absence. Documented cases reinfections like one newsworthy uncommon. badly want avoid answering simple questions? Join us. Thrive.

I swear ConcernedApe must worked Walmart point. completely nailed painfully sterile empty feeling three words. I'm talking k-12 college. Yeah medicine terrible field US since COVID. need single payer Won’t somebody think landlords?!?  COVID, yes. everything else, no. Seems aggressive. doc diagnosed told there's treatment, comfort care. mild case little congested fever cough. Like poster said, additional lab work? There's test blood clots show elevated risk blood clots. I'm curious ran it. extra doses shouldn’t much issue cold storage stringent. 

Before, giving doses left right clinics anyone, otherwise they’d thrown away thawed. Now, stored normal freezer. definitely great see multiple vaccines .. think go long way stunting spread. 

It's gonna interesting though see 2021 2022 pan out. 

* think we'll still continue see ""hotspots"" randomly spread situations community-spread. (and deaths due that). prevalent is.. hard predict. 

* Mutations (and spread) also going put interesting spin things. 

* poorer countries may information/education resources effectively vaccinate.. another factor. 

I think fair say:.. simply know yet different factors going play out. overall trend month still massively downward. weather last week certainly put halt lot testing, also hampered spread. really concerned fast vaccinations going out. Covid running places run. Interesting, usually find thread pro school reopening since lot people tired paying lots money zoom school. see anti reopening threads. Maybe times visit 🤷‍♀️ absolutely agree. (first world countries) put big dent least now, seems pretty evident need global effort curb everywhere, otherwise given globalized world we're gonna stuck rut lot. unless fucks incredibly less dangerous dominant variant emerges, really bet it. better prepared. Won’t ship CVS doctors offices? CVS probably jab hundreds per day, people go routine checkups get covid shots.  hard man, pay us enough make hard find job willing match starting even though low, I'm person store knows receiving can't take vacation, strict ""you must take vacation, pay out"" policy, they've handed check past two years instead giving someone week train them. I'm 6 days week going two years, want days row. Covid made everything worse add want vaccine-resistant variants? High case rates partially inoculated population get vaccine-resistant variants. 

Total eradication necessary: there's always going pockets infection. driving case rates gutter worthwhile goal. ""Gee, act like freaking dire wolf ordinary timberwolf, like every winter. threat sick, fat, old.""

/s trackers evolve, one thing would love see option see vaccine rates/percentages population approved receive vaccines rather simply total population. 



I think would nice see countries tracking terms completion. You’re downvoted you’re spreading irrelevant facts make sound like vaccine inferior, isn’t. actually explains little better:

It's 66% effective SYMPTOMATIC illness 85% effective SEVERE illness. Changer game a. way understand (and I’m expert, please don’t take fact), it’s there’s A) many, many different strains flu infect sorts animals (birds, pigs, horses, humans, naming conventions), influenza viruses incredibly unstable, often switch swap genes mutate rather quickly. one vaccine protects variants flu: flu vaccines target protein changes often, need one every year.

That said, believe there’s serious work going “universal” flu vaccine would protect types flu, targets part virus mutates much slowly, much all. That’s still well it’s early phases, however. Thanks heads-up. definitely possibility, last time get tired around day two later. heard impact within 12h. shall see, either way, regrets! case haven’t noticed really surprised haven’t Trader Joe’s workers can’t work home, servers also can’t work home Medical workers also can’t work home. Teachers teach home option available die teaching would incredibly dumb take option. children essential teachers shouldn’t put lives risk simply due people like compare essential workers can’t jobs home say “see it, teachers!”. California isn’t place we’re year behind, say schools states get around reopening stay open, schools schools make 1 week max shut another 2 weeks rinse repeat due infectious COVID is. Academia experts come conclusion every states kids lost entire year academia, California. Many states tried failed reopen there’s reason wasting money something reopening you’re gonna shut day two. reiterate point California isn’t unique kids lost year teaching. It’s every state union. Stop spreading misinformation please educate yourself, don’t shout “open schools now!” without understanding cost actually takes. Governor California already ensuring 10% vaccines go teachers ensure school reopening takes place quicker. force something willing?

Asking friend don’t inject baby powder post last month shows 66%.
I wonder changed? Since results 100% hospitalization, would rule vaccine group except for:

* Clinical signs rest indicative severe systemic illness (respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/minute, heart rate ≥125 beats/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤93% room air sea level, partial pressure oxygen/fraction inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &lt;300 mmHg)
* Evidence shock (defined systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;60 mmHg, requiring vasopressors)
* Significant acute renal, hepatic, neurologic dysfunction

? nice... It’s effective others preventing hospitalization death, matters. messaging around awful. article never said happens everyone. fact, said it’s exceedingly rare. They're still impossible find area, I'm really glad small stock (about 6) husband caught it. think he's turning corner although I'm looking forward disinfecting everything, I'm glad little bonkers last year get small stock things. really useful bunch masks, new thermometer extra strength tylenol bunch frozen shelf stable food. thing go oximeter, dragging feet getting one. Funny Biden says Christmas Fauci says people might wearing masks 2022.

Also, seem plan live world variants. slow roll outs. must nice. Well conspired ramp production.

There meetings rooms, year ago government captains industry. 

Then hatched plan figure fastest way develop new vaccines expand manufacturing.  ONE THING, ONE THING Trump right, told head FDA fired approve vaccine end day. Sure, June 1 (or whenever) get choose immediately getting J&amp;J immediately getting Moderna, I'll choose Moderna. think that's unlikely situation. first (and only) daughter Ashlyn born August immediately taken NICU. died 30 hours later.

She never got meet family besides wife hospitals allowing visitors. Dam diplomatic immunity didn’t apply here, must serious Germany half deaths per capita. 

HALF article says J&amp;J given 66% efficacy. related 100%/85% severe cases/hospitalization prevented.

Numbers alone lower protection pfizer/moderna one shot I'm sure robust/prolonged protection remains single shot vs J&amp;J. really moot point though neither manufacturers recommend support giving single dose vaccines moment. possible think people still safe... multiple strains actually know vaccines protect despite claims pharma companies good. approved, one shot thing big thing. Double amount vaccinated people compared two shot vaccines. game afoot Yep, live 7800 feet usually top around 94-95% pulse oximeter. isn’t phrase present argument. say “there still risk”. 

Covid spread present foreseeable future. enough people protected sever disease ends medical emergency . want boost vaccine resistance? Tell people getting vaccine doesn’t actually change anything hit nail head gotten lost shuffle, particularly news media.

Some unions moved goalposts wanting go back even teachers vaccinated.

Some (me) members smaller, less intense teachers' unions, OK going back normal ish, maybe masks safe, teachers vaccinated. good prioritize them!

Then others 180'd ""how teachers OMG tough"" ""fuck whiny babysitter bitches better martyrz."" mind flippancy, think louder unions vocal flip side trashing teachers alleging working outside brick mortar school. Yes fucking been. Iceland bit small. need population rare illnesses. Yeap video presentation testing lol according yes forced according WaPo! Wikipedia article commercials turns out. changed 2002 9/11. imagine Twitter existed back then, would changed October. Man, you’re getting ripped here. returning normal.

Kids wearing masks...

But understand trying say.  I’ve lost track what’s happening Europe guess. cool! there's three fucking vaccines can't get.

they sony handle distribution. Yes!! first concert outfits mind already! 😆  act like get J&amp;J today. time get vaccine enough supply superior vaccines..... two kids need see pediatrician tomorrow long due regular appointments. wife fully vaccinated taking them, received shots.

While want take unnecessary risk, wondering kids potentially exposed lingering aerosol office, adults susceptible taking virus kids indoor location? words, since going anyways potentially level risk higher getting are?

GATES Lol literally came post exact thing (Video) anything 95/96+ using cheaper 02 measurement devices basically full saturation. Unless obviously feeling breath etc. True, coronaviruses targeting time last year different. public large seems fundamentally struggle lack conclusive data != data against, fast moving risky situations, actions conclusively justified data necessarily less-risky course action China pretty straightforward here! 33% chance get “mild” COVID-19 joke.

This bad math. 33% chance get mild COVID; 67% reduction likelihood moderate severe COVID. whatever reason chose advance study protocols measure efficacy moderate severe rather including mild, know much reduces mild cases unless get data.

Incidentally, also comparing J&amp;J's global data includes SA variant, exist Pfizer Moderna trials. 72% efficacy moderate severe COVID US quite idea long term effects “mild” COVID-19 is.

Not really sure would expect be. mechanism would expect someone mild cough sore throat really likely experience debilitating illness ten years later?

The thing is, fundamentally agree Pfizer Moderna vaccines effective, would rather get one J&amp;J given choice. protection J&amp;J seem REALLY good, would rather take feel protected right away wait Pfizer couple months. judge differently afford choice, think risk perception probably off, I'm going cajole that.

Anyway, importantly, J&amp;J help reach populations might trouble getting keeping second appointments strict schedule - homeless, people can't take lot time work, parents, etc. bullets flying around randomly though.

People killed stray bullets every year. Haha definitely feeling something similar! first started, would always say “this 31” eye roll. Hopefully it’s here! Thanks! much denial. Despite western propaganda wants believe, china actually helping poorer countries going global domination right way. Instead bombing countries trying act tough, china establishing presence expanding/deploying culture, technology money countries. smart enough recognize war make colonies hate you, path control subjects want support also benefits themselves. words, china giving opportunity people, left rot west. 

You dont believe watch see happens. agree

But pedantic, divers bring oxygen dive. bring air. (Deep dives usually much complicated gas mixtures). Pure oxygen becomes toxic around 30 feet. Thanks wanted coffee nose morning. Careful! They're ruffled! Israel small country logistics big hurtle. Israel's vaccination plan also competent they're focused saving lives instead promoting social justice. 

Despite bigger logistical challenges woke roadblocks, America still track reach nearly 50% Spring due production capacity. we're far behind. would news way around. Consider people go work much ""dangerous"" conditions this, still take care family.

Yea plenty schools open many schools teachers die teachers frustrated don’t want die online learning option. (Hint, it’s lot.) kids California aren’t suffering worse state, pretty much every single academia expert agreed entire year online worthless would well restart year due little kids across America learned retained. It’s California, it’s entirety America. Teachers absolutely ashamed, said kids shouldn’t told Nail Salons important school correct agree Teachers also vaccine priority order get schools opened well rest staff including janitors supervisors. college admissions tests? It’ll show? Really? That’s completely false reason due lots reasons mainly California doesn’t get education capital world reason. literally rigorous universities rigorous preparations rigorous teaching mention fact college waived test past year grades get colleges. Know why? understand it’s simply “open schools” people die. essential dining staff come agree receive priority vaccinations well staff open up. California isn’t way behind, it’s every student Utah Texas Georgia Michigan New York behind, thankfully California teachers union help ensure teachers don’t die reason people shouting “open schools now” without modicum sense knowledge it. Thankfully union ensure better pay strong benefits unlike Texas go strike lose teaching license. it’s “open schools” “teachers ashamed” it’s “let’s vaccinate teachers staff open quicker ensure everyone part”. ashamed ready put others lives stake putting nothing own.

What fucking sacrifices, send $840 Billion year get almost everything either free subsidized. work retail companies couldn’t give shit less you. union harass every step way give us anything extra, spread positive pr like idea. everyone pretty much acting like pandemic companies back usual crap us ridiculous tasks waste time sure you’re getting downvoted, could like “Spanish” flu formed Kent many people mixing could come mainland Europe. Ultimately doesn’t matter though. I'll tell value. ABC's ""world news"" spent 13 minutes already limited broadcast Tiger woods injured.

This love affair athletes entertainers cancer country suck everything today. seems 50 million new generation vaccines specifically targeting variants rather original vaccine (which article based on) many.

I’m NoDak brother big political player there. real push behind efforts try get schools back open, they’ve tried safely since Christmas keep getting slapped utterly control teachers unions. “Can’t go back cuz social distancing!!” Ok, we’ll stagger classrooms make arrangements. “Now need plexiglass front desks!” Ok, done. “But teachers need vaccine priority!” Ok, done. excuse little kids won’t wear masks day, even vaccinated otherwise extremely low risk teachers suddenly newly terrified, they’ve found way keep ‘working’ three hours per week ad infinitum.

Worse off, neither carts registers cleaned. Ever.

Whereas, day, local target store wipes everything, registers use, carts baskets prior entry. even see staff going around wiping handles hand sanitizer stations everywhere, including register. monopoly labor doesn’t different result monopoly. Ah yes, situation different case. AZ meet ""best efforts"" agreement EU sells doses countries plant EU paid set up? first 300m doses produced Belgium going EU. 2020? RemindMe! 3 months Things change. don’t ride buggies pulled horses anymore either. started April 2020, according press releases. know understanding transmission lowest priority.

Highest seems lamenting masks counting cases. well, I'd reckon. EU say export allowed (export ban) 300m order filled, it? fact exported kept domestic use. difficult identify export ban. narrow rapidly closing window opportunity effectively use vaccines potentially prevent thousands severe cases, hospitalizations, deaths next weeks months,"" report said. Pfizer partner BioNTech submitted data FDA Friday showing vaccine safely stored temperatures higher currently required long-term storage. Recent data shows Black Latino residents collectively received combined 19% state's vaccine doses accounting nearly 60% California's Covid-19 cases. However, places even testing flu get sick. Many people never go doctor hospital sick flu. Sounds good yeah ok. capitalists job essential, worker not. Vaccinations stand opening things up. It’s covid either. choice shut things restrict people political choice. ready throw freedom, misinterpreting, also refusing logic people who’d want things open. philosophy behind trying get jumps several layers hypocrisy get conclusion. There's upward trend US moment. Yeah UK started helping AZ local protection far proactively earlier EU did. ""Heroic"" shareholders forego buying 5th home next year.  Well yeah, wear masks pool either

Good thing transmission low outside No, like all. 

You realise AZ run manufacturing EU, run contractors. 

That's much control processes. EU company seems teething problems.

This rehash already talked problems. new story, respin get people angry EU seems like. What’s terrifying people read guy wrote thought good enough thought upvote. Anyone thinks giving teenagers guns even defensible idea, never mind good one, teenager fucking century forgot like.

If I'd gun middle/high school decent odds I'd snapped one day shot one bullies, that's assuming corner empty hallway kill first.

A lot, lot lot lot, teenagers barely less sociopathic average 3 year old. Many fine, many not. Stop baiting. Sorry UK Brexiting, would vaccine strategy currently have. would situation France Germany, Spain Italy, etc. would drip-fed vaccine supply based global deal EU.

Hungary gone Russia bought Sputnik vaccine got tired EU's handling vaccine debacle.

So yes, may right, every EU member could pursue vaccine procurement rollout, Hungary getting shit EU did, larger countries France/Germany/Spain/Italy go EU go alone vaccines, could spell end EU's legitimacy (what's left pandemic appauling crisis management).

So yes, Brexit UK favour far vaccine strategy goes, anyone saying different bad faith, true strategies, know stubborn EU countries would done it. mean quoting comments, start new line use text. test' would look test would happier moved China work k-12 school. person 5 days week since August. time year normally crusty noses, snot dripping, hacking cough...

Education voluntary vaccination worked well UK plans change that. better messaging would less need mandates. support guidance recommendations mandates whenever possible. It’s healthier less polarizing. think relax zero tolerance rule adults carrying school tbh. 
 
Especially school resource officer Florida straight chicken shit stayed outside. teacher/staff member I'd carry regardless rules take chances. FWIW, lot grocery stores Paris previously closed Sunday open Sunday spread shopping load little bit. Cases stayed around 20k/day seems like forever now.

Beep boop super spreader beep boop America bad Recommended wait two weeks second dose reach maximum protection, that's current data says. Murican's buh muh freedumbs super-spread! soon UK's order finished, UK facilities start producing doses EU. may well Q2.

The production sites UK produce 2 million week, that's gonna take while. They're probably also using plant Netherlands, maybe expanded either them.
 aware preproduction although US production certainly geared approval given.

They've said they're ready deliver 50 million doses US end April. EU already gotten AZ vaccines US (which probably AZ managed get 8 million doses ""extra"". Jab vs free lead-antiviral, easy choice. Yeah Pfizer anonymous EU sources spreading misinformation able hit Q2 vaccine targets yesterday? 


How much press news get compared correction today? Sorry don’t enough Pfizer Modernna like US does

This incorrect. UK's rollout mostly Pfizer far. got Pfizer first dose yesterday. care got Pfizer AZ proving excellent. people eradication may goal it’s going take hundred years. People still get plague US!

The fatality rate covid still pretty high, isn’t like 30% smallpox managed eradicate. We’ve polio vaccine 50 years it’s still around. 1918 flu still floats around, likely scenario learn long vaccinations actually last for, get yearly flu shot transmission reduced manageable level. What?

Lives danger? retail workers 30 little risk unless underlying conditions. Thank you, detailed. Israel shows Pfizer 99% effective preventing hospitalisation two doses.

Scotland shows AZ 94% one. 94% figure anything get closer 99% second dose? say Pfizer ""far more"" effective (99% vs regard, also saying AZ ""slightly effective"" (94% vs 85%) single dose?  go, PM announced ask parliament prolong State emergency so, going full lockdown... Bad Meatbag. Bad bad Meatbag. UK 100 million doses order, UK production 2 million week. time get Q2 25 million doses AZ delivered (and that's overestimate). 


I somehow doubt 75 million doses delivered UK less one quarter production facilities aimed making 2 million doses week. broken various scenarios UK series contracts AZ Government funding going back far March. earlier than..... earliest 21st june. 

However main thing lift lifting everything. Even nightclubs. much given. Whether increases 95% 99% don’t know now, take weeks due 12 week interval. appears 1.7% Ohio right now: 958,000 cases, 16,972 deaths. Never trust anyone makes claims things ""for greater good"". 9 times 10 lying 10th time looking fatten wallets expense. Welcome Army! prevent companies ever investing building critical infrastructure EU ever again. whole pandemic obscene amount asscovering part experts officials. 

The media always asks random surgeon something like “when comfortable visiting x relative”

The answer outdoors, masked, 30 feet away, we’re vaccinated. can’t say oh know saw grandma last weekend. don’t know anyone that’s gone entire year without visiting single relative. Meanwhile UK still waiting 30m doses due last September There's kinda interesting thing business. Small businesses try look large meanwhile big business try look small. related note, anyone success scoring vaccine end day without appointment? I'd love hear experience!!! keep hearing good news pfizer moderna. sinovac shot with. 7 days week.

That's all. look demographics, I'm assuming Utah ton young people, due large families (Mormons bunch kids) offense guys, I’ll thrilled actually find dust masks I’m working attic particularly dusty work! even states, rate decline hugely slowing. indisputable 7-day average cases dropping every day months, except last 2 days risen, even due snowstorm, rate decline still clearly slowing.

One sign recent increase cases may partly due snow death numbers. They've suddenly surged last day, suggesting there's reporting backlog they're going through. natural increase cases, rise deaths would lag rise cases 2-4 weeks we've seen past, suddenly increase tandem.

But even explains part rise, connect line cases snow rising to, still clear decline cases significantly slowed. given variants, likely cases either stall increase coming months. Probably that. country, sometimes get diagnosed Covid flu-like symptoms, practically dont test many times tell stay home. half doses AZ, way yesterday's news broke out

Half Q1 Q2? delays Q1 old news. agree 94% figure increase? think difference comes one applied CMA rolling review, may right. 

Does 82% figure adults receiving first dose end June exclude Curevac? AZ contractually obliged complete order UK, reasonable AZ divert supply EU. Therefore AZ going EU contract best reasonable efforts include breaching pre-existing contract. 

This interpretation. Best effort also includes using UK plants support EU production. 5000 deaths got nothing covid, 7000 covid deaths week.

Would like see combined measurements A+B=5000 less 1.

You right strange way count deaths Stockholm number regions across Sweden abandoning earlier skepticism advising people rely face masks, country braces third wave coronavirus infections. development marks reversal Sweden’s previous doubts regarding face coverings, coincides increase transmission rates. Tuesday, Stockholm authorities recommended use masks public transport, rush hour times. also want coverings used shops offices.  smh.

you staying home know sick absolute idiots Aside treated regards pandemic UK also rapidly phased automated tills. honestly remember last time went supermarket went till shop worker scans items. always self-service checkout. must suck watching jobs removed around still there.

At one time, teenager, job paid salary. crazy automated quickly here.

Of course, jobs supermarkets besides running tills, still employ people. still going require fewer people overall. much good news past week. Everybody excited end distancing masks better get ready line “remember, kids aren’t able vaccinated yet.”  Last estimate kids 12 get vaccinated around mid 2022 need worry frontline worker Covid ward. promise you, one ithat sees leaves thinks good one situation. 

you sound like ass. eventually everyone gets virus, 0.6% population dies.

Then maybe mutates way past immune system, people generally get less bad case, people die.

In end, lose 1% global population world keeps turning. went school girl arms legs could lot things. Shes news time time. Humans either give adapt situation. video put make on, write, use cell phone, wrote book, motivational speaker etc.  wait.... expect restaurants continue maintain space outdoor dining covid over...? places already patio seating? surely something necessity. think preferable everyone eat inside allowed. Could personal bias lead equate sub fear mongering based false information sub bad news? One best things ever work start telling sick people stay home, even kicking office came in.    That's great, them. 

But definitions ""very fulfilling"" unfortunately completely different, life without arms legs anything would want part of. I’ve never worn mask never will, u about? well also due air quality (in places) EU official

Maybe wake call action one step further, clearly need allow waste dumping serve another countries economic benefit (1) common story Germany is, ""kids get Covid"". Looking USA, quite seem right.

""Kids get COVID"" never case. true kids seem much less affected COVID adults, particularly 10. Seasonal influenza actually dangerous kids COVID, far people tell (the US recorded [30 deaths compared couple hundred annual pediatric deaths (2) Covid commonly known respiratory disease there's pretty good chance taking damage blood vessels' linings 

[Yeah, seems disease blood vessels that's transmitted respiratory claims MIS-C linked Covid people near people Covid 

IIRC, MIS-C *not* COVID, seems inflammatory reaction kids happens time get SARS-COV-2 infection. Patients MIS-C generally test positive SARS-COV-2, bodies cleared it. something happens later. Early on, analogy [Kawasaki somewhat mysterious thought immune reaction past viral infection (e.g., kid gets virus, gets without anyone noticing, similar virus causes immune system go overdrive sometime later). would even get involved that?

I'm even claiming small number reinfections occur. I'm simply saying paper worthless, sweetheart. Unfortunately, country's local economy often depends it.

To wrong approach. Mainly anonymous people Reddit make far claims time start verifying. impossible know advance easy find source verifies claim. much easier person made claim presumably already found source attach link source typing response. That's try make claims. 

The problem claims without source yes, sometimes find source easily, sometimes difficult find case either try dig deeper conclude claim true. latter, usually get response ""you can't google"". problem claims often made vague manner. lead finding source would verify claim, one would interpret made claim. case, I'm sure found source used make claim (and claim maker misinterpreted source) want right source. claim maker gives source, immediately verify exactly he/she claiming.

-Your media strongly biased fear-mongering 
-Lots people simply decided Covid thing/an issue decided ""fuck you, I'm wearing mask"" Africa, hang there, 2023 got you.   Seriously? That’s awful. Man, think would tell parents let die. That's terrible :( hope whole industry survive. there's something good pandemic brings, let that. However, know happen. (and many others) used work environment people prided going work sick sneered took (unpaid)sick days.. hope step closer toxic culture's extinction.

Safety afterthought Florida. raise concern, troublemaker. slave state, slave state. somehow inform much infectious COVID regular flue - real risk. COVID isn’t necessarily dangerous *one* individual it’s infectiousness creates real risk it’ll overload hospital capacity dangerous *every* individual, even ones never catching infection, makes *everyone’s* problem. yet variant already 45 states numbers still declining. want investigate origin prevent thing happening man. Well said. America overcome this, got bailed first privilege. allowed enforce mask policy....we get write ups grocery chain. even state senator state representative day chairty event still we're enforcing mask rule.

All someone town, different store, pulled gun person enforcing mask policy there.

They say safety. BS. last Juma man knowledge ways hunting, artisan ways people

The tribe losing vital teacher definitely noteworthy. That's pretty much exactly ""fear"" well.

What country in? happening slower. run trials single-dose intended give booster shot 6 months later could nearly twice far along (and probably E484K pan-coronavirus booster needed).

But want trials fail, made safe choice. turned better expected really something get upset about. Good luck convincing country give standards living non existent, hypothetical threat. Everyone wants get lives nobody even thinks bunkering rest lives anymore. thar drrrrrrrrrrty dimmy*crat* mayors done givin theys jabs g-d-fearin' patriots livin Denver too, Cletus.  False negative rates high, 20% 100% depending get tested. get tested immediately getting infected, false negative rate 100% virus time replicate airway yet. get tested perfect day, day symptom onset, still 20% chance test miss it. Texas's freeze, causing neighbors huddle together room keep freezing death, could turn problem. either troll, angsy teen, completely rocker. tracker doesn’t show vaccines given today. shows vaccines entered database, numbers lag days cases.  *thinks Measles, gets infected * Go ahead, man. Exactly. done nothing public 12 months aside go grocery store. I'm fine wearing mask vaccination feeling safe go fucking anywhere indoors again. go restaurant fucking eat support local community person (I order occasionally pickup). 

The mask way major issue. reducing risk quarantining. think noble thought, isn’t EU problem getting vaccine rollout going? Wouldn’t make sense get things going quickly member states move serving 3rd world / underserved countries? Immunity probably max like 6 months something.

ABC7 (New York) article fans coming back MSG Barclays Center Dude called ovarian cancer link baby powder ""dumb shit"" Reread conversation. get sort apologist them? get people would skeptical company like rushing find vaccine? This, got 73 F. We'll still grocery stores restaurants takeout. certain things worth spreading COVID. would also enough vaccinate American adults. find 254,000,000 adults United States. many people already infected, majority getting vaccinated might enough effectively kill local transmission. It'll almost certainly bring deaths extremely low number since vaccines mostly targeted age risk factors. Worse California much better New York sounds like can't keep forever. Way considerate towards others. make plan family quarantine beforehand possible. Wear mask something outside needed. guess really needed see friends family would find way. say going go even another variant comes along sounds pretty inconsiderate. Maybe go tell family michigan who's 10 year old lost limbs mis-c. Get f outta inconsiderate apples Say COVID-19 2x infectious influenza, measures reduce 1x level influenza. measures reduce influenza well, influenza may even pop-up radar.

I understand argument. I'm trying point-out plausible reported cases.

That's another thing: influenza cases serious enough required testing. measures reduce number people contracting influenza, lessened symptoms smaller viral load, plausible. Here's reality... leverage would put another virus 'adenovirus' body Astrazeneca vaccine? Viruses ain't healthy human body 

You know vaccines are, right?  probably attitude especially beginning coronavirus. BUT, case point it’s ignorant comparison say least. I'm sorry, hope stay well dude tweeted people stay home holidays.. literally airport waiting board flight Mississippi. tells need know much really cares. sure think talking somebody else, said thing. yeah new strains vaccines work people say God's whatever happens happens  Really stopped caring point. It’s kind like boy cried wolf. Unless new variant literally mortality Ebola coupled r0 measles doesn’t justify headline “the devil already here”. That’s clickbait bullshit. Every year complain people copying Japan using masks flu season arrives.

I wish vindicated way, I'm afraid people learn go back contagion get vaccinated instead sticking mask habit every winter. Fear mongering distinct differnce seriously hyperbolically.

One cool, one mock worthy. don’t think comparing covid AIDS epidemic smart move. What?! lived Japan super common, especially train stations flying. know common long term effects last definitely thing. work friend mine died yesterday covid complications days shy 41st birthday contracting covid year ago. almost certainly extreme outlier, went healthy 40 y/o year ago dying respiratory failure one year later. probably caught within day sick three days. one, lowering speed limit 20 mph doesn’t guarantee deaths car accidents. That’s asinine claim cannot support proof whatsoever. Regardless, told could guarantee I’d I’m selfish prick. 

I’d also willing wear mask cure cancer because, again, I’m selfish prick believes without kind fucking proof masks hurting people. narcissistic belief know shit use justify asshole. already reclined chair Frick Yet again, twisting everything. people care enough take precautions mean wishing go forever. complete opposite.

You seem understand virology all. Viruses mutate, yes. viruses deadly pandemics long term side effects people otherwise healthy. compare pandemic viruses. common cold killed war year. Covid has.

I wish good health, spreading misinformation purpose downplaying seriousness disease left countless orphaned widowed, struggling new lifelong illness before. still serious. *not* ""last leg"".  

The fact deniers like proven wrong still continue deny serious pandemic absolutely baffles me. Az neither needed wanted point I’m sorry typo hilarious considering work specially said production numbers vaccinations arms misinformation.  Unfortunately here, despite political leanings state. Congrats! Canada still lockdown. fully understand statistics. taken excelled college. fact, aced second term statistics. I'm also old enough know sometimes numbers without consideration behind numbers tell portion story. outrage would appreciate would stop presuming feelings this. disappointment. I'll glad stop washing hands evertime use restroom eat. Yes, Hancock definitely going homeless vote.

Communities color long underserved suffer *significant* health disparities, including **during pandemic**.

The point guidelines get vaccine vulnerable. Communities color suffering worst effects pandemic. mayor responsible people city. 

It’s way unreasonable mayor city different viewpoint governor get vaccine vulnerable constituents. 

Comparing governor trying vaccinate rich donor friends laughable. reason answer New York wayyyy worse California Florida comparable despite totally opposite approaches lockdowns. I'm sorry, that's crappy.   herd immunity influenza cases? It’s amazing. Government dangles end lock pushback time still includes masks distancing well beyond June timeline.  Absolutely international travel locked totally WORLD achieves 80-90% vaccination immunity. would seen earlier moderator took comment optimistic nonsense remains. worry folks careless malign actors report nonsense comments moderators. think we'll end worse others bad are...though right: entitlement, obstinate freedom anything else, frank stupidity bite us butt. Love avatar name describes completely...nice worried. 220,000,000 Pfizer Moderna, two dose regiments. Worth noting. Regardless, pointed elsewhere, would enough vaccinate majority American adults.

[If done age, would prevent incredibly large super majority 11,421 people 45 died this. 21,251 people *between 45 54* died this. take step saying 36,672 deaths people 55 died it, 54,134 people 55 65. trend continues next ten years, too. deaths dramatically skewed age kind mind blowing.

This big reason I'm coming think might best vaccinations fully age ignoring everything else. know sounds cavalier maybe disregarding towards certain professions getting hurt others, would simplest method far- everyone knows old damn easy verify kind thing. Ideally we'd setting aside vaccines people comorbidities well trustworthy network get people doses, we're talking terms efficiency probability preventing deaths, think age needs fundamental backbone distribution plan. don’t think people get upset others taking seriously *now*. people talk crap vaccines commonplace, well indeed infuriating.  wash dick, super clean. really excited get flu cold life solid year. got covid. They're trying vaccinate voters. think coincidence mayor disregarding advice medical experts vaccinate groups overwhelming vote party I've got bridge sell you... evidence support time money beat cancer. animals life expectancy eventually taper cancer inevitable. lived long enough eventually get cancer. may get turn 100 managed solve issues magically lived 200 years old would eventually get cancer.  49 states aside California, vaccination policies. What's true California necessarily true everywhere else. lol clue talking about.

i worn mask every time i've gone outside entered public place last year. live seattle fucks sake

now assuming i'm anti-mask, wrong 🤣🤣

Especially you. Good advice indeed. I'm certainly glad linked original source, even though misrepresented contents source.

Here's another way thinking it: vaccine 100% effective, would've zero events. would've fair point low baseline number hospitalisations non-vaccinated group. might occurred study's sample size small. case [the recent showed poor efficacy Astrazeneca vaccine South African variant. People got excited fact zero serious cases deaths test group, sample size small also zero serious cases deaths control group. would similar if, hypothetically, researchers studied entire population New Zealand rather Scotland. sample size would huge, would still pretty meaningless since covid cases begin with. contrast, study huge sample size (the whole population Scotland) \*and\* many thousands hospitalisation events.

If study entire population Scotland, shows reduction hospitalisations several thousand 2, really big significant enough you, really know say. Like you, could urge people check original sources rather random redditors misrepresent them. specifically said ""The adult population vaccinated right now"" ""The majority population doesn’t fit within age special conditions range.""

Both factually incorrect. changing story talking eligibility broader vaccination count production lagging. case like always going happen. backlog vaccination appointments people want vaccinated something wrong. also everyone already got children gettting vaccinated low transmissibility anyway. isn’t good bad

Interesting claim ok. acknowledging place better others expense others.

Isn’t better definition good? look  XD Sure, horrendous mass polluting industry. need rethink things, perfect opportunity. fear mongering. bet learned R0 year, COVID warrior you.  Gotta love people demanding socialism can’t basic research wonder fall variant booster shots work. Would require manufacturer's previous shot, could mix match? Example: get AZ J&amp;J available.

Well yeah, capitalism employee resource, like electricity heat, always get different provider new-employee discount.

That's unions historically transformational, force company use employee investment instead. No, unions perfect, default without pretty terrible. don’t disagree you, communication. AZ announced news using global supply chain news got supply cut half. One month ago AZ blaming one EU subcontractors EU supply shortfall, subcontractor later stated met every deadline. spooky communication. They've yet held accountable lot food US highly processed full excessive sugar. people middle class below, foods affordable efficient. Working 40+ hours relatively low income make food prep chore, availability affordable food less. Add spouse kids, gets harder maintain. Grabbing fast-food way home work, frozen pizza/microwave meal lunch work.  

Then issues like children brought ""clean plate"" matter what, forced ignore bodies eating limit instilling poor eating habits. Mental illness eating coping mechanism (yay, dopamine!) fight boredom. Mental illnesses reduced impulse control. Eating disorders.  

There lot factors (in US) lead obesity. issue highly nuanced lot systemic problems society. lot people overworked, underpaid, depressed, anxious, ""easy"" foods full sugar over-processed. Well yeah essential everyone got grocery delivery sorted needed. Unless wanna start delivery case essential figure autonomous home delivery expendable Canadian. reduced rate transmission 1.

In words, 1 person infected influenza, fewer 1 person infected. case, mathematically, disease trend zero. disease goes zero, tends remain there, herd immunity.

The rate transmission dependent several factors:

* Disease characteristics (infectivity)
* Population characteristics (density, genetics)
* Population behaviors (masks, distancing, hand washing)
* Percent population susceptible (immunity)
* Seasonal effects (weather, vitamin D)

In general, influenza tends R0 fluctuates 1, depending seasonal effects. Thus, population infected individuals grows flu season, shrinks summer. Depending side equator on, whether ""flu season"" December June flips.

Due population behaviors, possibly increased adoption flu vaccine fall, reduced influenza's Rt 1 *despite* seasonal effects, influenza infections trended zero (UK, Ireland) all-time lows (USA, 1,387 cases since Sept. 27).

Thus, we've achieved herd immunity. However, permanent state; depends population behaviors mitigated disease transmission.

You could make similar argument that, lockdowns, achieve temporary herd immunity SARS-CoV-2, total number new cases currently dropping. However, open things back up, inevitably, allow Rt exceed 1.0 again, virus begin spread again.

The seasonal flu specific mutations make less deadly virulent Spanish flu. Spanish flu actually several strains different properties (one spread faster deadlier among certain age groups).

In general, deadly viruses tend mutate less deadly versions superior strains. goal virus spread, kill - killing generally reduces ability spread.

This deadliest viruses almost always come species jump humans - evolved thousands millions years host's immune system, developed strong counter-measures, time succeeds jumping humans deadly form. humans, mutates less deadly form.

There many, many studies Spanish influenza's mutations. better chart simplified one illustrating important people panic avian flu swine flu - 'human flu' strong environmental pressure mutate less deadly form always becomes dominant strain deadly one. avian swine flu follow rules previously described reasons (they trying balance mutations mild birds pigs - ends deadly humans). Same. especially hated commuting job paid little able afford commute, LOL. literal EXACT situation occur classroom pretty much non-existent Australia winter ~7 months ago also.

We always wearing masks socially distancing ~13 week flu season. one going work flu unless can't breathe going doctor either. I’m sorry like “new normal” upset prevalence natural immunity cutting lockdown short.  Portugal Portugal things, allowing Brazilians others EU frontdoor lol thanks.

Portugal currently ban flights Brazil ... Ugh 😩 would know since seem expert it.

Look burying head sand ignore different diseases different transmissibility rates.

The flu Covid-19 matter much want pretend is. you’re offered it, think it’s fine. (Like maybe work healthcare, patient facing setting) going way lying wrong. Still, can’t wait widely available don’t conversations. “friend” got pissy 66 69 year old parents got dose 70 year old dad. Well gave Biontech 400 Million dollars well seem matter. Neither specifically - money supply chain. Loads info found here: relevant section is...

""Rasmus Hansen, chief executive Airfinity, data analytics company working life sciences sector, said EU failed invest scaling-up production plants.

(and public health officials) get make determination. You’re optimistic then. Yeah, agreed. time FDA switches course, though, ever do, it'll well half country first vaccine though. question imply that. that’s meant say, would clearly said it. merely asking original commenter that’s implying. 

I guess asked wrong question. Someone could replied “No” instead accusing spreading disinformation asking questions. Yeah, pretty great articulation major reason 2020 shit show. world essentially giant probabilistic model - like game every outcome every detail every situation chance true, factors make less likely different scenarios. People naturally weight experiences much much higher statistics, even though deeply understanding (and making decisions with) statistics much rational leads better outcomes. They've already said expect US give approval April, 50 million doses ready go go US end month. yep. wash hands, touch face stick fingers mucus holes Kinda like rabies shots.for dog, every three years booster.  Well know sharp we're talking, course cases go without restrictions. That's point restrictions. hope over, we'd become like Asian countries wearing masks sick becomes commonplace. 

I kinda like wearing masks extra barrier random interactions strangers unless everyone else wearing masks, it'll probably get weird fast. whole thing went drive through. drove big barn (at fairgrounds) got shot, drove another big barn wait line. time allowed read card windshield. person walking around clipboard, watching, honk problems. time up, asked felt, said felt great, went way. 

It wonderful setup. super impressed. R value relative public health measures. examples, countries less safe drinking water reproductive value Cholera higher. like physical constant relative microorganism itself, think along lines *more infectious strains diseases measurably higher reproductive rates within population*. 

In general, comparing diseases different populations epidemiology leads lot confounding useful. US giving everyone two doses right away instead delaying like UK go big mistake. could've seen coming, though, late change now. Life tough. actual friends this? teacher probably 25 years older still patiently awaiting turn vaccine, absolutely words. possibly friends think cool? JFC. open everything use masks flu season, enough suppress virus without restrictions? I'm sure. use masks regularly Japan China, flu numbers comparable/worse ours.

That's number Fauci uses threshold. Again, agree it, that's keeps using. It’s crazy think it’s February we’re already well terms vaccinations. there’s still multiple great vaccines way! weather gonna helping us soon too. end sight!  They’ve already done that. It’s called phases  mean crying wolf probably good there's pack wolves running rampant killing people. Lmaoo thank sharing talking specifically people, that’s responded to. Nice walk back. Yet California's cases gone down. Kroger? Studies actually implying opposite said expendable, edible.  Stop misleading. don’t need vaccinate 70% people criteria return normal. emphasis originally decrease deaths hospitalizations vaccinating risk that. You’re also ignoring 25% Americans already contracted COVID immunity. retrospective, Canada ordered 80 million doses every single vaccine sure. don't, well, sorry, people around world going stand another year restrictions. Vaccinations not, thing latest end summer, least America. No, I'm not. I'm asking specific group people seem believe saying covid problem worthy ridicule feel way. there, I'm talking directly them. feel way do, know others don't, make problem exist. fucking hasn’t. beginning, “two weeks flatten curve”. it’s turned “indefinite amount time reach probably unrealistic vaccination number corresponds variable uncertain guesstimate herd immunity threshold may be, ignoring immunity reached natural infection real-life hospitalization metrics”

I mean think smart thing would look death hospitalization numbers haven’t smart things start take seriously. don’t think speak everyone lives like  currently don’t empiric data average viral load per sneeze, also, sneezes standardized across humans. dude waits 1 week second vaccine shot, couldnt keep mask little hour, surprised caught it? second dose wasnt nearly close fully affective reach 95% lol!!! fool. Seriously. could see 30 days later. would throw alarms. 7 days second dose nearly enough time. cmon, people keep masks 8 hrs day didnt WANT keep mask on. fault, vaccines. can’t get unemployment reject job. realize I'm talking happens vaccine resistant mutation takes place? course grown cause enormous amount death sickness. I'm arguing that. I'm saying people stop giving shit despite that. believe people care despite past year anti-maskers protests showing otherwise? anything, I've already seen evidence care admit people take virus seriously enough.

I guess question goes way too. ones refuse acknowledge move forward pandemic responsibly without pearl clutching lockdowns, would ask question original comment. Go why? evidence ""long covid"" still inconclusive lmao. work company pictured. give zero fucks us. “Feeding Human Spirit” ass distinction someone vaccinated versus unvaccinated? there’s almost point vaccinated bring home bad unvaccinated partner, shot mask symptoms get super sick won’t? Wtf? always   includes \~82M doses already delivered. problem going forward. **terrible** messaging everyone throughout made anti-restriction crowd *worse*. misinformation Trump, ""tactical"" misinformation Fauci, CDC, WHO, ""we love restrictions thee me"" politicians, *refusal* certain politicians even hint end-goal, contributed what's going happen nationwide.

I’d hope people keep back minds things easily go back direction long wear mask bro Fun Fact: ever see beer commercials salute Real Men Genius? Originally, called Real American Heroes commercials, 9/11 happened firefighters cops became big heroes change it. comment chain bringing back repressed walmart memories thought I'd forgotten... Really? you’re currently arguing get vaccine, can’t transmit virus anymore. Even though link clearly says can. You’re asking people die can’t bothered wear mask. Shameful. given non AZ vaccine - available. AstraZeneca expecting fucking *what* April?

We're actually going authorize shit-ass vaccine? UK nurseries after-school clubs fully open usual, Primary schools near us around around 30 percent kids many people key worker status. agrere reduced numbers could help reduce flu transmission. cases 7 weeks peak flu season? Tomayto tomahto 70% much half. wrong. There's literally cost wearing mask aside cents physically costs purchase. Nice assumption, don’t know life like, step back cancerous attitude towards mental health. haven’t gotten vaccinated? Maybe try harder. Maybe change job. Maybe better. Maybe don’t care others. Ice storm happened east coast Thursday. got snow Sunday. Ah hero use me, buck fifty, CEO getting hero pay, talking bout millions. really useful me. 

I think term ambiguous - there’s American Thoracic Society patient handout mechanical ventilation says “the mechanical ventilator also called ventilator, respirator breathing machine”. There’s lot stuff masks specific kind called respirators, don’t think I’d heard before. 
I don’t know it’s regional thing - call ventilators ventilators Australia- think jumped conclusion used mean ventilator, mask. 
Thanks everyone commented. stores city (bay area) first months. slightly contagious, resistant vaccine. usual news fear mongering still wear masks people limiting time outside home interactions others. 

The ski shop manage could shut tomorrow, single bit business rest season, we'd still double last year's sales total. kick people daily wearing masks. I'm jealous wherever live, people come small town kinds covid hot spots, act like assholes people expect take simple measures protect people live here. untrue. results 12+ expected months. smaller kids, end year. younger kids are, lower risk. get great deal marginal benefit vaccinating 12-16 0-11. Loving vibe ❤   run flu covid vaccine studies. incredibly difficult find candidates didn’t receive flu shot year enroll flu studies. Almost Everyone— even people never get flu shot, got one year. Moderna’s Phase 2 comparing antibody response 50 100 micrograms. Data second shot antibody titers basically half isn’t “high quality” Backlog dump snowstorm shut things down.

If they're still rising couple days now, worry. LA Times isn’t fit bum’s toilet paper. never been. AP NPR close you’ll find actual journalism.  think so, people probably stayed indoors instead getting tested cold. also labs probably didnt report cases due power outages, overall cases still following descent problem is, I've seen first hand Ohio, restrictions have, slower rollout is. yes, older people are, higher death rate. vulnerable already, protected focus needs mass vaccination.

We need get spread down, would bet lot spread caused get people working public facing jobs. Allow start getting immune let's get new case numbers down.

Coincidentally, also people would hide zombie bite pretend everything’s fine it’s late, infect loved ones. people wait 15 minutes make sure bad reaction needs medical attention? EU large vaccine production capacity, many countries gotten confirmed deliveries producers make within EU. It’s important remember time Covid - banning exports, cutting countries like Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan nations South America, almost certainly ruin relationship countries many more. true US currently exporting lot, countries depend much, much less US supply chain EU one. worked small town grocery store 5 years, owner give fuck employees. entire basement flooded got yelled came store halfway shift look mop bucket mop broke.

Where hell get number from? entire argument based that. nonsense. vast majority people vaccinated right now.

Yes, agree, 80% people vaccinated wear start said seen info claiming vaccine helps prevent spread Covid told provide source? that? 🤣

No, making stuff point. argued vaccine makes can't transmit virus. ""helps prevent spread"". started saying ""The current data suggests still spread virus even vaccine"", said ""i've seen many articles suggesting otherwise"". Maybe suck english? forget smokers homeless people! Also due amount people buying negative test results, think people would find way say they're vaccinated - start going back normal right vaccinated None anything OP said. OP said need know SARS-CoV-2 arose: came from, animal reservoir is, intermediate host vital pieces information utilized potentially prevent another pandemic scale COVID-19.

Understanding origins outbreak purely scientific endeavor—this isn’t issue placing blame keep returning to. Even theories lab leak somehow proved true, knowledge reality isn’t grounds blame rather wake call scientific community regarding dangers gain function research, serves highlight importance shoring laboratory safety protocols around world. Knowing virus arose bearing prepared individual countries future pandemic.

The epidemiologists focusing China virus almost certainly originated. fail see geographic area *would* focus investigation origins SARS-CoV-2.

This science, geopolitics. Grandpas probably racist elderly people without kids lol Canada can, literally, hold Pfizer vaccine hostage people start getting dumb vaccine nationalism: Outside Moderna, every mRNA vaccine using tech Canadian Biotech company. again*

FTFY Water wet. Things touched become wet. Look Wetster's dictionary. This. California obsessed gatekeeping could get vaccinated forgot actually figure vaccinate people. think hit head. know can’t get vaccine yet (I’m immunocompromised blood cancer, completely failed me), allowed people go ahead like I’d raise hell. wouldn’t fair. care fairness anything else now. want ingrain bitterness rage? it. aw :( interesting point out, folowing precepts last year, cases started skyrocketing two days ago superbowl. remember used one two day. Sometimes none Trying small part light sea ignorance. feel like would hilarious got reference. child's mother, turns out, enrolled vaccination trial, fetus placed placento group. “Oops played myself. better say something think cool actually really lame.” still massive back log elective surgery

And guess people stupid shit free wander Essential expendable mutually exclusive. I'm amazed people understand concept. Cases declining Reality true. flu miraculously go away. testing flu? Covid tests also false identify influenza COVID. that. Wear 9 masks seeing grandma, killed remember said wear 42. head company suggest another product. They're treated expendable unions. sister worked unionized grocery store negotiated deal new employees get LESS minimum wage first 6 months. brother works unionized grocery store minimum wage, store recently cut hours 15/week, irregular changing every week. union even talk it. fact, grocery store two unions, one part time employees, one full time. Neither give shit employees. Fuck unions. Ages 55-64 54,000 deaths covid far, 45-54 21,000. make much sense skip groups emphasizing age risk point. Yeah, work essential. workers expendable teacher, got first dose Pfizer today Louisiana! Can’t believe Louisiana actually smarter states allowing educational faculty staff receive like healthcare workers. Shocked happy time! ""People die flu every year need wear masks.""

Well die year something tells dont really care lives saved. Don’t feel bad taking Tylenol stay away NSAIDS. aches chills kick take shower help. you’re saying it’s lethal based people already sick. could thousands upon thousand strain totally fine. doesnt make angry people taking covid seriously, taking covid seriously.It makes angry messaging behind vaccines still complete shit actively dissuading people getting it, even intention. Saying still can't see friends, hook up, travel, type person fun even vaccination indefinite amout time giving people gumption get shots.

It makes angry Covid caused toxic shaming culture take U.S done WAY harm good, people's mental health, also virus mitigation whole. people honestly think calling depressed restrictions selfish plague rats deserve die covid, saying depression valid need stop whiny actually convincing people follow rules? news flash, ain't.

The attempts lock us even mass vaccination, people going allow indulgences. flu billions poured vaccines every year many times Flu often would counted numbers likes this?  pregnant 55+ level? state 60+ level believe everyone younger considered general public here. I've taken pamdemic seriously followed reasonable precautions. I've far knowingly contacted members family also careful. social contract (most) undertook outset thing conditioned need prevent overwhelming hospitals. would happened (much seriously did) taken public health measures. point indications signal risk waning. We're yet, think soon know sure. point, going continue mass public measures nebulous risks. point diseases pose nebulous risks (dangerous mutations possible), yet take measures. course predicated real, hard evidence showing hospitals longer risk. flaw logic? Florida does. Open everything open schools, pretend nothing going on. Seems worked...for folks die. Good hear. figured individuals reckless, found funny nonetheless. reality reason believe vaccinated people still spread virus, fact studies show opposite. course virus go away, eventually get point longer pandemic level threat. one believes 91k cases. may legit control now, beginning though utter shit show. We've seen Covid globe seen hospitals bad China beginning, suggests way, way way people infected there.  rate, you’re probably right detected, mean cases flu. Pretty funny looking back times I'd see tons Chinese/Japanese/Korean tourists wearing masks think weird kept even abroad, always assumed due smog issue major cities 

Then read Sars outbreak became form public decency prevent colds flus spreading wearer, still thought bit weird

Now turns out, weird Yeah, family works higher-ed really rough lot students (and professors). idea would done student. It'd tempted delay semesters, imagine finding job instead would difficult say least. fine, cell uptake vaccine, hardly fat around deltoid even vaccine went fat cells would still work, would slower uptake. give injections time common lose bit medication ooze out. love wearing masks. Less people recognize public avoid small town midwest chit-chat 
US track 2 doses per person plenty spare. would mistake?

No one going go without wants it. bet India. I'm gonna make bingo board game job essential. worker expendable. ever was. offered vaccine, take it. lie get vaccine, unethical. Lol one surface detection thermometers things fucking irk -- there's businesses I've gone use those, pegged ""fever"" sun bit. Without fail, wait little bit, maybe blast AC car, boom, ""fever"". Africa reach herd immunity given countries barely locked anything down?  might even turn frogs gay! Yeah, like AZ spokesperson promised beginning December would deliver lo behold didn't. Landlords salivating. Ugh, 70k cases US today. Still improvement want better now, dammit. I’m practically stomping feet here. End June end first half 2021. What? That's untrue, even immunocompromized friends can't get places even appointments elderly. I'll believe see sad unacceptable. JFC that's terrible. think someone would check make sure COVID person donating. always say it’s either get vaccine get Covid. literally options. 

Either way, time get 60% vaccinated, new cases non existent. literally showed quote article sent shows still transmit virus get vaccine. Yep... brother died 2010 19 flu virus spread heart. wear mask flew plane weeks maybe given flu.  also they’re fucking morons We’re opening stadiums summer city. may case friends, agree /u/knitandpolish people want give 15 min fame money associated cases. presumably getting paid Vox CNN anyone else opinion, profession that's there's potential conflict interest. Yeah. guess closing schools might okay March, hindsight probably could've safely done hybrid masks many districts instead whole ""all schools close rest year"" nonsense. schools opened *at least* hybrid September, October statistics quite yet. 

Yes, online learning improved, many ways (the ""education"" offered school district live consisted worksheets Google Classroom Zoom sessions September—talk bare bones), always going limits. Sometime another, we're going get kids teachers back classrooms normal. need emphasize *temporary* solution *temporary* problem, permanent way teachers slack pay.

Man, kid one really-reluctant-to-reopen school districts, I'd freaking whole way. Can't even imagine burden put nation's youth mishandlement education. guess goes show little government cares next generation.  I'm shooting anyone, I'll wait things like vaccine escape confirmed worrying - yeah, escape needs bit lower antibodies labs.

If happen, yeah, I'll thankful mRNA reformulated six weeks.

Also, yay cells. Frankly unforgivable knew staying home / wearing mask sick would reduce spread flu. Exactly. People like many people going convinced get vaccinated health reasons. might convince told helps go back normal. 'challenge trial' works confirm participants already vaccinated? admit wrong move lol  I've already covid months ago, yeah definitely dont care anymore. lost track variants week  got hit fatigue now. Sleepy little warm. Bless him. Yep, many people conflated rollout vaccines drop cases. amazing astounding we've able achieve vaccines, doubt continue see successes like death rate vulnerable people decline. folks going huge shock cases steady even increase despite vaccine rollout. ever though double-down getting vaccines arms prevent pain next surge. Yep - see point reopening schools we're still going contact tracing closing classes case positive result. reopen, reopen zero options shutting again, even 100% kids test positive. controlled planned pandemics prevent general diseases.

Of course pandemics even close total mess now. I'm talking highly planned shutdowns warning long time ahead, support governments. Right now, toiletpapers, masks antibacterial sold resold 10 times price. Poor people left less had, rich actually benefits this. scenario you’re describing extremely unlikely, almost feel like it’s worth debating becomes reasonable possibility. AstraZeneca disgrace Again, what’s point? I’m saying light exposure effect transmission, it’s physical fact light exposure increase winter solstice, could plausibly effect transmission

I’m really confused you’re acting like increased light exposure winter solstice ridiculous, made-up astrological phenomenon? It’s... not? mRNA vaccines exist capitalism. second shot today! I’m sure said UK version, article:

Denver preparing play bigger role distribution COVID-19 vaccines setting priority list rather follow dictates Gov. Jared Polis.

**The big picture:** Mayors across country demanding direct supply vaccine, currently allocated states. Hancock raised issue recent call Vice President Kamala Harris letter Thursday Biden administration.

The city's goal reach populations hit hard pandemic, including racial ethnic minorities, immigrants homeless, well groups trouble accessing vaccine.

**""We better perspective** challenges communities \[facing\] every day ... know fact overlooked,"" Hancock told Axios.

**Why matters:** Hancock's push represents high-profile challenge Polis' pandemic response comes weeks feuding two Democrats.

* He's alone: Colorado Springs Mayor John Suthers argued cityis shortchanged, too.
* Hancock careful directly criticize Polis. comes difference vaccine priorities, said ""neither one wrong — need dig little deeper regards demographics.""

**The side:** Polis want relinquish control. recently said Denver's plan inoculate homeless would ""cost lives"" take vaccines people age 70, Denver Post reports.

**What watch:** first four new sites managed Denver Health opened Thursday Montbello, historically underserved neighborhood predominantly home people color. three planned similar communities northeast, west south Denver. thought process months ago, need go office 5PM, traffic? cares hopefully traffic would nice change scenery. Yeah Belgium known conservative government Vietnam Southeast Asia textbook examples left wing politics. true covid like 5 times likely kill someone like flu plus long covid shit happen flu. That's mine started. Sore throat mostly. even thinking calling sick work considering mild symptons were. Glad afterwards.  sounds awesome. That's need clear opening guidelines America, contingent vaccinations following current trend. set goal, really encourage people get vaccine. Demand high enough need encouragement like vaccines open general population assume studies scrutinized substandard? Either way, best showing worst results western vaccines. Somewhere around 65% effective, even Johnson &amp; Johnson better. worthless merits cheap easily transported. 

I know people loyal it. I'm guessing something cultural pond. think going make huge difference worldwide. wish they'd chosen make open source like originally planned, fuck capitalists, Bill Melinda specifically.

I planning fly Nepal several weeks. Hopefully give necessary visa. Even can't, partner least able visit there--Indians even need passport enter country. However, can't stay indefinitely, it'd put us back difficult situation knowing we'd able see again. 

We considered getting married Nepal (lol), apparently massive pain ass get India recognize it--to obtain marriage certificate Foreign Marriage Act 1969, need bunch goofy stuff like publishing fucking newspaper advertisement allow 30 days objections, partner add spouse passport, etc, etc. 

Oh well. hope restrictions way out. Countries need start opening elderly vulnerable vaccinated. I'm amazing folks willing work weekends approve stuff, wait Friday actual meeting??? documents ready start meeting it. Bad bot Got second dose Moderna yesterday. Mild moderate symptoms including fever, body aches, fatigue, loose stool. fun glad done it. Bad bot Bad bot No, said ""1/3 get long haul since covid cases mild""

Ok. :) Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose still offered 100% protection hospitalization 85% protection severe disease, home feeling me, severe illness started paying attention COVID-19 first place. Otherwise, would never even noticed odd stray cold virus came Wuhan.

Excellent point. makes feel better getting J&amp;J that’s what’s available time. guess play sound good me. think daily cases soon settle 50k 60k slowly drop coming months. Oof agree raising minimum wage, business COVID relief package. exciting. happy you! I’m going today first Pfizer shot. 👍🏽 jail place somebody held arrested awaiting trial (and places short sentences, usually less 30 days).

The average jail stay US 10-12 days. So, yes, it’s pretty unlikely average person still 21+ days later get second dose, it’s unlikely they’d voluntarily return jail it. That’s hospital.

Dad went work, brought back home, tested positive, symptoms symptoms, quarantined three weeks, bother testing taking resources people symptoms. constantly surging.

Whose head actually buried? sounds like Czech numbers we're less random 5000 10000 last 120 days.

But wrong. Look 7-day average, smooth weird spikes due weird communication daily cases. went beginning December 4k average 12k beginning January (small opening/Christmas) . went 7k beginning February (harder measures) , (probably new mutants) shooting 10k again. kids get it, see anyway realistically house would get it. would love hear others able keep 2 toddlers away 10 days relatively close living space.

You'd think would work way, whatever reason doesn't. buddy took week long road trip wife. got friend day two (symptoms show last day trip). Despite confined small car next 5 days, wife never got it. Imagine middle pandemic hundreds thousands people died saying ""nope weekend, ain't working today! "" much 64% risk hospitalization reinfection? still need cite 0.3% fatality rate covid. got one sweet, sweet vaccines? this. CDC estimated 25% US already covid end December. We're somewhere closer 35% now. It'll another two weeks, I'm sure. parents grandparents. Tear restaurants school buildings! use extra space widening sidewalks allow pedestrians socially distance better!

(Actual opinion heard Coronavirus Discord) :( I'm sorry. people who've separated across national borders whole time saddest stories I've read, think. Especially might last restrictions lifted. 

Fingers crossed see soon. Thank Biden! That’s simultaneously interesting somehow gross (picturing viruses mixing matching cells). Thank you! Spring break, least areas usually see increased tourism time. 

I'm already seeing local news pushing spring break superspreading stories. No. I’m not. I’m saying people take precautions pre-pandemic. 

If naively go back “doing things old way”,.. fuel yo-yo effect likely end causing us blindly sleepwalk right next pandemic. Even true abstract, I'm sure meaning occupied group actually want asking it. becomes pointless exercise legalism.

Seems like thing me. bullshit conspiracy theory.

There's less cancer diagnosis's right people defer doctors visits etc. People still get it, less likely diagnosed past year. Less diagnosis means less cause death unless there's autopsy.

Lots cancer patients die infections. treatment lowers immune response catch cold, wrecks them. Less diagnosis means less treatment, means less deaths attributed cancer.

A lot deaths comorbidities. may die heart attack... lots heart attacks happen work. lot stress induced. Less working, time home, sleep, lots changes come play here. High cholesterol too. People eating less eating healthier home past year also going impact.

There's less car accidents too. Way less people road driving work, less people night drinking driving etc. etc. means less car fatalities, also means less heart attacks people stressed traffic, getting work late, loved one accident etc. etc.

Even cold raise blood pressure resting heart rate... correlated increase heart attacks. Less cold/flu naturally drop heart attack rate.

Transmissible diseases also thanks social distancing masks.

That's something proud of. better nothing, even effective 2weeks. math earlier, even assuming rate vaccination resumed 1.7M/day increase, 60% shots given first shots (since soon arriving J&amp;J shot one dose, ti second doses), Memorial Day 40% country 2 weeks first shot. Add 35% already infected covid, assume they're randomly mixed among vaccinated unvaccinated people, 60% country either vaccinated, already covid, both. making fairly conservative assumptions. 1.

Bottom line, results study highly significant statistically robust. suspect probably know this. profoundly misleading pick one number (""2 events"") which, isolation, actually tell result significant not, insinuate significance result doubt. time go strike, people say ""But lot young need vaccine"" ignoring fact interact public every day therefore giant vectors reception transmission, also, families. know, people may risk. Considering home transmission biggest source transmission, family grocery store worker danger worker worker gets COVID, whole family likely catch unless basically live like cavepeople.

I one cavepeople spring eased summer little. Thankfully parents able get doses vaccine we're hopefully safer now. Germany went short hard lockdown November “to save Christmas”. We’re still  Lol I'm sure poors get right pay favorite complain grading papers home. Wait, yall got something ""hero""? Ain't get shit ive worked whole time too.  anyone job, that’s works. everything conspiracy theory vaccine

There are? far aware (at least UK) Public Health (Control Disease) Act 1984, applies England Wales, explicitly states cannot require person undertake medical treatment, including vaccination. quarter population then. single dose, offering around 75% protection. going nitpick, factor sums . . .

Weird given newer data suggesting 85% effectiveness 3 weeks.

Plus day two ago:

""found four weeks first dose, hospital admissions reduced 85% 94% Pfizer AstraZeneca jabs respectively.""

- fact remains three quarters protection we're sending schools back days.

Except millions already covid, still immunity course.

So cohorts 1-4 protected march 8th represents 15 million.

You 6 million additional individuals various states within 3 week period vaccine takes effect.

You millions already infected protected via natural immunity.

Doesnt really square 75% protection. Like UK got zero expected Q4 doses AZ? Keep digging please. true. essential jobs aim expandable workers actually. worker expandable, means operating essential job difficult necessary. proof all, head-to-head comparison terms provided far shows AZ effective.

I think probably right, that's opinion. data supporting that. better solution would force refuse vaccine live isolation special ""Covid Camps"" since they're danger society. right happens body, allowed use body biological weapon rest population. According source, 1.4M people died TB 2019. safe assume number decreased stayed 2020, no? 1.5M died due covid, last year, according you. Last time checked 1.5M higher 1.4M, suppose math could off. Imagine room 3 covid positive people. One original strain, one british variation, one SA variation. Everyone coughs hour. 

What happen you? variation win? get tested, strain see? Every three?   - reason made first post someone stated US somehow right get majority vaccines, vaccines made US funding - simply incorrect Pfizer/Biontech-vaccine. correct Moderna vaccine. Okay looking way accounts 20% US deaths year. European countries similar levels dead US account population there’s lot Western countries got pretty hammered. keep trying figure close UK might based South Dakota's (and states/countries) numbers considering population decline cases, I'm bad maths hard going!

Hopefully vaccine kicks ass cos we're going stir crazy Would shame. could still earlier ironically less covid-cases means gonna take longer. might explain surge thankfully ebbing due engaging risky behaviors , willing (like jobs) already locally plus restriction measures mask, closing resturants etc. 

 problem correct already detected across US multiple countries immunity. hopefully local measures reduce spread keep things vaccines widely used call national guard equivalent help healthcare refrergiratied trucks dead :( cost, that's marketing. guess I’m speaking New Zealand perspective community transmission isolated quickly shuts down.

I imagine US vastly different widespread.

But happens get outbreak effective tracing quickly traced isolate (and done) without increasing public restrictions  This. Minimum wage workers always expendable. always replaced. buzzword even benefit, reasonable excuse management owners keep doors open. nothing essential McDonald's. read whole thing, thank you.

I never talked partnerships universities, biotech firms etc. pointed statement US funded research contributed Pfizer/Biontech covid-19 vaccine. Germany did, US not. anything looks like small hope everyone vaccinated end June totally impossible. guess get first vaccine dose June 2nd somewhere July August. mandatory vaccines UK. fundamental principle right happens body. Amazing universal. ""Providing vaccine cost world""

yeah.. scumbags *""Ninety percent members afraid today 60 days ago 30 days ago new variants,""* 

I get this. Cases deaths falling US, means risks lower lower every day. Yet people start afraid NOW??? ""British media""

Macron called ""quasi-ineffective"" Germany started public relations campaign going shelfs getting used media blatant misinformation campaign it.

Yet Irish presented plan yesterday included CureVac Q2? wonder related production, estimated time approval.

Honestly, I'm tired delays. news seem get progressively worse everyday.

Edit: seems 4m number AZ could revised upwards 6.8 manage deliver whole 180 million. right EU! tons mandatory vaccine, adding one list one change anything. 

One freedom stops freedom starts. Vaccine protecting others  saying pointless, maybe places open whatsoever things like contact tracing necessary... ""Essential"" always meant ""sacrificial"" pandemic.

The one-shot coronavirus vaccine made Johnson &amp; Johnson provides strong protection severe disease death Covid-19, may reduce spread virus vaccinated people, according new analyses posted online Food Drug Administration Wednesday.

The vaccine 72 percent overall efficacy rate United States 64 percent South Africa, highly contagious variant emerged fall driving cases. efficacy South Africa seven points higher earlier data released company.

The vaccine also showed 86 percent efficacy severe forms Covid-19 United States, 82 percent severe disease South Africa. means vaccinated person far lower risk hospitalized dying Covid-19.

The analyses confirmed Americans likely benefit soon third effective coronavirus vaccine developed year, demand inoculations greatly outstrips supply. F.D.A. could authorize vaccine early Saturday, depending vote vaccine advisory panel Friday discusses newly released documents.

“With J&amp;J vaccine, we’ll able accelerate vaccine rollout country world,” said Dan Barouch, virologist Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston led much early research vaccine last year.

Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine stored normal refrigeration temperatures least three months, making distribution considerably easier authorized vaccines made Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech, require two doses must stored frigid temperatures.

But access new vaccine could severely limited first. Dr. Richard Nettles, vice president U.S. medical affairs Janssen Pharmaceuticals, drug development arm Johnson &amp; Johnson, told lawmakers Tuesday nearly four million doses would ready shipment F.D.A. authorizes vaccine, far 12 million originally pledged give federal government end February.

White House officials even lower estimate Tuesday, telling governors weekly call around two million doses would available next week, according administration official.

Dr. Nettles said Tuesday total 20 million doses would ready end March. company contract deliver 100 million doses end June.

Johnson Johnson’s vaccine lower efficacy rate vaccines Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech, around 95 percent.

But South Africa, Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine far clear winner. Novavax’s shot efficacy 49 percent South Africa. small trial South Africa AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine found offer much protection all. negative results led South African government abandon plan giving million doses AstraZeneca vaccines health care workers. Last week, government started giving Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccines instead, far administered 32,000.

The newly released documents, include F.D.A.’s first technical analysis company’s 45,000-person clinical trial, presented evidence vaccine safe, noticeably milder side effects Pfizer Moderna vaccines without reports severe allergic reactions like anaphylaxis.

The vaccine’s protection consistent across Black, Hispanic white volunteers, also across different ages. trial indicated lower efficacy, 42.3 percent, people 60 risk factors like heart disease diabetes. figure came large amount statistical uncertainty, F.D.A. noted.

Although several vaccines protect people getting sick Covid-19, unclear whether shots also prevent people getting infected passing virus others, leading debate quickly society return normal inoculations begin.

Moderna’s trial found hints vaccinated people less likely develop infection without symptoms. AstraZeneca found vaccine reduced asymptomatic infections half.

Johnson &amp; Johnson looked asymptomatic infections checking coronavirus antibodies 71 days volunteers got vaccine placebo. new analyses estimate vaccine efficacy rate 74 percent asymptomatic infections. calculation based relatively small number volunteers, F.D.A. noted “There uncertainty interpretation data definitive conclusions cannot drawn time.”

“I think it’s going add growing evidence vaccines really prevent infection well prevent disease,” Dr. Barouch said.   weird part asinine suggestion children untrained teachers armed response unstable people guns.

As opposed to, know, changing legislation reduce number guns available said unstable people? There's news story today scientists UK stating there's scientific argument vaccinate teachers unless they're aged 50 over. 

So, call believing science ignorant. imagine restaurant dishwashers risk? Hosing dirty plates, glasses, silverware that's people's mouths spray hose aerasolizes saliva. sucks. Yes you’re gonna vaccinate children while. argument is: saying it’ll open season July earlier. agree takes time shots fully immune, people getting vaccinated another waits fully immune. Thanks, ugh totally agree. fell apart proper June. Didn’t help stuff going 2 blocks away too. Sitting listening tear gas go “fwomp” flashbangs go shit packed door case heard switch live ammunition. feels surreal. happened fine (adrenaline dopamine ftw), calmly packing essentials, survival necessities, valuables sentimentals suitcases hiking bags, next month awful edge seat. “Is today day happens?” November, January. Christmas surge. year huh? human body isn’t meant handle stress long. needs break replenish stores.

You’re absolutely right, isolation vastly affected support network coping mechanisms. went relatively introverted seeing close friends twice month, spending 2-3hrs day gym, strict schedule diet inactive shut lump never ending kafkaesque Groundhog Day life.

Agreed meds. Adderal Wellbutrin life savers. Wish they’d give something anxiety/sleep though.

Hang there... might getting close. know Greece resurgence virus struggle maintain control even heavy lockdown get point, it’s also entirely possible *truly* don’t enough money. driving car polluting? still allowed, name making money less. find fascinating people constantly putting dates different aspects dealing covid, rather understanding one knows exactly virus going act. guess gives false sense control? Thanks post way Transmission never 100%, looking something like 10% risk getting infected original variant/SA variant maybe 13%-15% risk getting infected UK variant, 17% take upper bound studies. reference, family member infected seriously quarantine them, risk getting infected around 50%-60%, 10% estimate 1 hour exposure probably over-estimate. NFL study found absolutely 0 cases tied outdoor, person sporting events. Awesome. dose AZ batches made longer complex process. Batches sometimes fail restarted. harder accurate timescales lower class best shape life. walking less eat. coworkers except one same. buy less food even higher sugar/etc. Calories still matter end. goal vaccinate least 70-80% US, (hopefully) there’s still plenty first batch vaccines delivered. 

Plus, effects vaccine delivered aren’t instantaneous. Enough vaccine 130 million people delivered March, means 130 million gotten first shot mid-April, second shot mid-May fully immune early June. AFAIK everyone Czech Republic said fuck overthrew lockdown. Many shops restaurants open usual. future? think even North Korea envious much stuff western governments get away time. basically act like dictators claim democracy. Skepticism Fades Sweden

I'm sure why. study reports max R0 \~3 influenza New York winter. 3 vs 5.4 huge difference deserves highlighted. 

Well, R0 flu 3 NYC 5.4 covid, ratio pretty similar R0 1-2 flu (mentioned first comment) [2-3 started whole discussion. main point 1-2 flu ""a bit 6"" covid similar conditions. 

I saying point covid infectious flu. questioning claim made look like 3 times infectious correct number like 2 sources confirmed latest source. new variant indeed change picture, interestingly read paper cited earlier, prevalence new variant first increased UK, started decrease. 50% covid cases short time. So, using R0 *all* covid cases misleading (especially, take New York City value R0 without showing what's prevalence new variant New York). 

I guess someone questions quantitative claim read questioning qualitative claim well.

They'd lambasted investing paying advance unproven technology, we'd reading criticism ""how EU invested old big pharma corps instead local expertise"" on, Europeans demanding politicians' heads, using AZ vaccines laughing.

Point is, EU (as bloc) paid $400 million downpayment 300 million doses August, AZ vaccine (more commonly known Oxford vaccine back day) seen safer bet, since ChAdOx-1 already proven work MERS people certain Oxford would deliver – especially heard news AZ plants producing vaccine anticipation certain approval. Also, supposed ready first, well?

And strategy pretty decent, too. ordered pretty much everything, new mRNA vaccines (200+100 million Pfizer, 160+80 million Moderna), vector vaccines (300 million AstraZeneca), ones, 2 billion doses total. we're seeing worst-case scenario perfect storm failures – Sanofi failed deliver vaccine, AZ cut supply on.

Credit, credit due – EU actually reacted signing additional contracts Moderna Pfizer, taking actions expand portfolio. takes time - cough 300 million additional doses 2 weeks' time. ;) herd immunity mrna vaccines majority recieve effective?

I'm Total Vaccine Posted: Feb 24 2021 2:44PM ET

Yesterday's 65,032,083 argument people use try ban abortion, record. Bodily autonomy unique it’s right others derived boundless.

You can’t forced carry baby term (in sane places).

You can’t forced donate blood, even rare condition could save thousands

You can’t forced receive sort medical treatment sound mind

(You still get vaccine though, it’s really really really dumb to) Almost sames. weren’t hospitalizing 90-93 right away like emergency. Sometimes dipped hours depending activity posture calculus additional risk factors. That’s severe hospitalization different. wonder criteria changed depending full hospitals too. need grand tempting 1 shot + side-effects is, I'm still looking wait get one mRNA vaccines studies show both. zombie apocalypse? I’ve always advocated harm reduction, agree... it’s surprising San Francisco Yes, can't realistically set goal zero risk. could have. could locked hard, ideally right beginning, kept/gotten level tiny outbreaks could dealt contact tracing quarantine virtually restrictions afterwards.

My sense numbers we're quite purgatory phase describe, around corner reckless next month two. big concern allow another surge start, people fed leaders feel empowered implement restrictions, do, widely ignored, and, least areas, surge bad winter's, dragging longer necessary till herd immunity finally puts end it. problem is, especially contagious variants, might herd immunity even willing adults vaccinated. Children, vaccines yet approved for, make enough population thwart herd immunity.

It's frustrating. could unlocked society much sooner half-assed along. really shaken faith fellow Americans. mean, read comments article J&amp;J vaccine. always filled people saying “why would take ineffective vaccine? There’s one that’s 95% effective, I’m waiting one”. Whether they’ll actually follow one thing it’s incredibly easy find people making claims state recovered spite Newsom, him. Californians ignored Newsom’s stay home orders went shopping ate like normally would do. anyone wants get vaccinated option get vaccinated, - it’s simple. government doesn’t allow it, people force would Biden admin force state like mine (FL) standardize? Desantis would opposite (he already). He's refused federal help sort, refused along close anything admit covid much problem. That's living state full terrified oldsters redneks vote GOP you. thing “no risk” argument cites goal completely invalid. 

Vaccines approved 16 trials 12 up. 

Under 18 hospitalization rates lower adults several orders magnitude. NYC 18 hospitalization rate 0.1-2% reported cases (many cases children unknown due mild). amount science communication would've convinced Americans stay home. reach psychological tragedy commons relatively people acting selfishly urges everyone else too. 

Can't get political sub social safety net also failed miserably, amount scientific communication would've fixed either. People could either stay home lose job unemployment go get sick. Except first boosters still 6+ months away strains identified late last year. hope joking. scary rhetoric not. little late? part wonders bother now. really going get people wearing masks? seems like ship sailed we’ll turning corner matter months. feels symbolic me. separate testing, Pfizer Moderna found effective variants. still, based data far, better option right now. Philippines larger population Germany UK.  either spare much vaccine. Possibly ask India. Germany want AZ vaccine has, that's ""a drop ocean"" amount Philippines need. I'd bet $100 ""normal summer"" going happen next year.

""Normal"" meaning everything fully opened up, mask mandates, etc.

I mean doom gloom -- I'm saying temper expectations. That’s losing argument. We’ve already version argument AIDS.  knowingly virus disclosure laws kick in. you’re advocating possibility virus enough. Oh, even transmission cut 90% vaccine, may able transmit virus much certain levels virus unvaccinated person. So, that’s problem. 
And gosh, we’re forgetting 30% blacks say aren’t taking it. Yeah....deny black person seat bus they’re undesirable. Let know goes you. 

Sorry, world get shun people don’t like won’t happen. talking vaccine walking around spreading virus. variants though? Didn’t study subreddit like yesterday say vaccine doesn’t protect it? fundamental difference requiring action order exercise privilege, requiring medical procedure.

Do believe person forced undergo medical procedure good others?

(For record can’t wait shoot hawt sticky vaccine me) anyone know many vials they've already produced waiting shipped? estimate many doses currently pipeline? I'm hoping game changer! Please research. Dr Norman Swans statement incorrect. common flu death rate approx 0.2%, covid-19 3% closed cases. Ideally need vaccine 95% efficacy reduce death rate 0.2% AZ vac 50%-70% efficacy reduces death rate 1-1.5%. Yep, FL there's attempt central organization, wild west. Sign here, sign there, hope something pops earthly idea when. mom barely use web create accounts various places. freaking joke that's going end less people vaccinated, longer time get things done, probably wasted doses. Also much 15-degree difference weather. probably main factor covid seasonal. That’s....that’s literally antibodies do. Heh, dunno sounds like think leaders world let virus run course unchecked, pretended exist watch case death numbers grew 10x approx every 10 days overwhelmed medical systems full anarchy society began break down.

The lasting damage done scenario would likely catastrophic.

If looking back saying 'huh, bad - (half million dead far counting) certainly justify taking muh freedoms' - point obvious massive undertaking starting China trying keep citizens travelling countries closing schools movie theaters , stopping indoor dining taking steps protect populations. 

Wear mask, stay 6 feet apart, groups larger X - things contributed milder feared result.

Had taken steps protect idiots themselves, would seen death toll multiplier ranging anywhere 2 - 10x point depending bad things got domino effect society. 

I remember peak (managed) pandemic crisis, major cities (LA comes mind) - even bother taking hospital heart attack could get rhythm back scene. Ambulances queued hours get ER doors.

Had pandemic unmanaged allowed roll US like tsunami - eventually 911 service - police response ambulances whatsoever many cities. 

It's long start breakdown society itself. hop skip third world hell infrastructure begins fail Texas last week without extreme weather. 

It becomes cascade effect dominos start fall stock market collapsing run banks TP can't find - milk eggs, bread baby formula. 

Bad things happen people get desperate. 

Yes, could much, MUCH worse IMHO look back clarity hindsight sneer sheer arrogance complete ignorance incredible display poor intellect even poorer judgement. 

But go bad self thinking believing ENTIRE WORLD high IQ individuals scientific community Doctors got WRONG dumbass right.

We make Secretary General UN. What's first order business Mr. tilemaker?

All said, welcome little good news vaccines able stop variants severe illness retransmission - looking forward little less anxiety lot optimism. 

Because sick tired feeling sick tired TOO, brother. still running happy hour movie theaters, know I'm saying? people think people going delaying end pandemic. Every time there’s slight uptick cases, even event people think cause uptick, they’re ones saying “we’re NEVER gonna get pandemic 😩” mean 90 percent idea something working. multiple different studies backing idea multiple different countries, assume it’s accurate. Also, what’s wrong saying hey, vaccinated good chance transmit. might capable, likely well protected. 100 mostly. leaves room error backs science. don’t want tho everyone hasn’t able start getting vaccines waiting turns going pissed people getting return normal faster. yes deception. save comment want guarantee get enough people vaccinated, say end March, narrative start shift won’t deal blow back.

Even mild symptoms last several months. surprised people still waiting vaccine go rushing bars movie theaters anytime soon. problems, without enough people vaccinated remain large eventually mutate. 


Seems slipping back dark ages comes science. one hand, amazing things like landing Mars developing advanced vaccines short timeframes....then turn around look huge % public believe anti-vax garbage worse...5G injected mass killer Bill Gates (I wish exaggerating, co-worker thinks he's trying ""depopulation""....) chances though reach herd immunity current strain variants fuck everything up? thought read study yesterday said vaccines don’t protect latest mutations? doubt monitored study, asymptomatic individuals likely similar viral loads ""sick"". bodies crazy response like show traditional symptoms reason.

My original comment giving symptoms response vaccine specifically. Generally speaking, vaccines cause body learn create antibodies ahead time come contact virus later, antibodies produced faster. would prevent virus reproducing much would minimize chances getting sick. side benefit that, odds good virus would also reproduce point become infectious others.

So, less, agreeing comment. would shocking reduce transmission. may still ""catch COVID"" vaccine (i.e. coming contact it), vaccinated would help body kill becomes problem others. 95% vaccine effective for, wiser happened all.

  study also recommended virtual online exercise classes safer alternatives. 
  “To reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission fitness facilities, attendees wear mask, including high-intensity activities (more than) six feet apart,” said report, added facilities enforce physical distancing isolation symptoms begin. “Exercising outdoors virtually could reduce (virus) transmission risk.” 
   Chicago Department Public Health notified outbreak early September, according report, name business.

Yeah, amazing thing MRNA vaccines. takes tiny amount time update, test, change manufacturing. like software update, whereas conventional vaccines would require hardware update

Also keep mind took year south africa variant develop, taking two months update vaccine. top that, existing vaccine already highly effective variant  friends frequent local bar multiple times throughout week. Keeping tight circle easier said done. Maybe responsible 😀 #Praxit  Yeah it’s law I’m sure often broken. case, good news! That’s point - compulsory. 

What take work vaccine side effects? Could psychosomatic? Scott Gottlieb Squawk Box couple days ago. Fauci week. Matt Hancock week UK. UK plan says June 21 target date full reopen clearly states measures need implemented winter. 
The slow transition public comments adults vaccinated children vaccinated public health measures pulled back. 

University Michigan said it. Kent State. Others. Two four times less antibodies peanuts. That's enough substantially reduce efficacy  IMO better slow federal rollout. States better tailor rollout state's unique challenges. federal rollout would never supply channels nuances reach ""last mile"" Wow believe government propaganda huh?

The unemployment number real least decade. old you? Nba Finals full capacity summer lmao Muh common sense That's actually low. People living altitude often sit around 94-95. Walking stairs get low 90s temporarily. Sub 90 definitely issue plenty people chronic conditions live 90-95 range without issue. I'm ashamed state leadership. incorrect: unsure, optimistic vaccines work. lived high risk people like do, might feel differently. judge behavior person make decisions, seeing people inside major contributor spread virus. What, think someone knowledge expertise would come Reddit talk shit something know nothing about?! Surely not... 240 million shots delivered end March, Covid virtually non existent US end May- maybe scattered cases, zero sustained community transmission.

Look, I'm positive vaccines much anybody people really believe scenario going happen? Like we're going wake June 1st like ""okay Covid issue anymore"". want positive unrealistic buddy similar eighteen hours. Fevers tough even feel good, flunk temp check door get sent home. distance

And half country working home, large portion going home necessities, major events cancelled, travel restricted...

I mean masks help ton let’s pretend soap masks take repeat 2020 flu season live Prague see open shops around here... 27 here, agree. worst case, evolutionnary pressure caused vaccine cause virus mutate way bypass immunity. true. take weeks test, updating factories etc immediate Yes, called curve everyone one dimensional thinking tried make company paid pfizer injuries products, yet trust them. California variant vaccine resistant sounds right, first time caught covid Jan 2020 took 4-5 months brain fog, heart palipitations, fatigue clear completely. caught December 2020 mild yet seemed attack lungs heart noticeably worse first one (California strain?). 3 months I'm still recovering I've developed reactive arthritis hope resolves itself. I'm expecting it'll probably end summer everything mostly resolved. fully support approval vaccine, anyone willing potentially sacrifice long-term health short-term convenience receiving able to.

But also think people choice hold better vaccines, particularly since mRNA vaccines form vast majority supply US receiving next six months. 

I've working home full twelve months. wait another two weeks vaccine works significantly better. Honestly don’t know anyone mourning COVID deaths. we’re mourning complete stop everything fun life. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

I think we’ll accounting new variants get spread control, globally.

The biggest thing top mutations. Flu kinda similar regard. Yes, basically approvals given context greater risk. really years data full approval considered, given US lost 500k people disease, grasping straws moment.

If we're lucky virus mutate escape vaccines. reality likely will, point hope happen deadly escape. Common cold coronaviruses escape every year without getting dangerous, unreasonable expectation stretch. Poverty kills too. know little topic, I'm truly asking anyone might know: possibility combination annual flu/covid vaccine one shot? compatible mix manner?

Because that's possibility I'd imagine pretty likely annual flu shots start combo flu+covid going forward. Yeah, people dictionary.com should... read dictionary. Idiots. hurt you? Tell everyone evaluated time, pls. say matter worst symptoms broke within 72 hours starting. Moms spaghetti provide sources this? theoretically possible AZ J&amp;J use adenovirus vector, types vaccines. clearly joke. lot sick, fat, old people around, knew? Often higher.

Exactly, 
Restrictions aren’t people catch mild COVID, it’s people get really sick risk plummets ... However, sticking people recovering

Were ""sticking"" people places, people going home? end epidemic enough weekly mandatory workplace, school public institutions testing

Great, let us hope so! number 65+ group state getting vaccinated day slowed dramatically. “Essential worker” crock BS nobody wanted part Oh god huge shipment delays west coast due east coast winter storm last week. states 90+% last weeks vaccines delayed. doses arriving week, expect numbers trend up. see really easy

Wow, worked! TIL local mask mandate expires March 31. hope does. think people would get angry mayor called shots summer. I'm ditching mask Memorial Day regardless. social distance warriors may never give willingly. worked grocery store, must mean expendable again, cant tell amount times got worst shit possible, worst hours possible, tried moving depts moved all, knew nothing else. Grocery store managers give flying fuck know, working front desk know everything back manager knows nothing? Well need another checker gotta go there, manager know damn thing job. What's that? helping bakery bread orders filling shelves bread? bad need another checker managers finished jerking yet. finally got better job, one fucking person thought could trust, right told I'm putting two weeks, slimy sack shit looks says ""Really? serious? Look man seen work around here, gonna get fired time! Better stay here."" told go shove opinion ass choke it, never showed two weeks. Fuck mangers grocery stores, fuck people grocery stores, frankly fuck working grocery store. Additionally, conditions cause learning developmental disabilities also come physical issues. Syndrome, example, associated several physical issues shorter life expectancy. 

IMO- long term care facility, regardless age, likely part vulnerable population would greatly benefit vaccine. vividly remember Atlantic coming clickbait titles ""you're absolutely going catch COVID"" early March/April.

I know virtually every news source guilty thing remember panic setting NYC scum adding gasoline flame.

Not ounce integrity involved. LETS FUCKING GO Hurrah! Good Ghana!! Lovely country. People addicted miserable. many pessimists record little year ago saying “there won’t vaccine two years !” ? Again, mental illness play huge role. Eating disorders ""starving yourself"" purging. Eating disorders also mean eating. absolutely eat many sweets junk sometimes. used much worse. undiagnosed ADHD impulse control (still always) strong suit. That, little dopamine boost food gives people turn cycle eating self-soothe. That's confirmation bias, there. experience rule millions others.  article:

 ""Scientists believe 72 percent population needs either exposed vaccinated COVID-19 order reach goal.""

but ""Even though data hopeful, mean COVID-19 eradicated let guard comes following social distancing masking precautions. “I think COVID-19 going endemic United States,” Suzanne Judd Ph.D said. “It going like seasonal flu, something tolerate regularly. isolated outbreaks, likely occur populations lower immunity. means that, like flu, strong vaccination campaign needed keep people hospital.”

Course,. (varying numbers due different surveys).. 30 40 percent people said get vaccine. 

So going interesting see pans out.

I'd suspect SARS-COV2 likely ""burn way population"" .. whether actually end-point.. whether circular due mutations new strains?.. wait see. Save less effective Pfizer/Moderna. Teacher here. I'm second largest district state middle high schoolers return week. 

I glad studies, one thing people realize contact tracing, therefore data inputs, kind terrible. 

If case school, students deemed close case stay home period time. required get tested. testing required. majority cases asymptomatic people getting tested visibly sick, data Covid partial underreported. Teachers likely go get tested afraid exposed.

Now could well true teachers primary spreaders (and note article says maskless schools, lot private restricted states), think complete enough data know sure. number school aged kids Covid reported county much higher number students Covid school district metrics. county health department identified clusters two three months happened.

Just aware matter sound study schools methodology, quality input data seriously flawed lack testing. Essentially, choice test disclose cases parents. kids blurt home Covid remote calls nobody reported school. Thanks answer. Reading thread, that's probably last place I'd get info from. Also feels like filled young people wanna go back school. said above, huge shipment delays west coast due east coast winter storm last week. states 90+% last weeks vaccines delayed. 

Expect delayed doses appear numbers week next week. think need clarify mean learning disability. learning disability, I’m fully functioning independent adult. mean people developmentally disabled(Down’s syndrome sorta disability), likely come health issues aren’t related intellectual disabilities.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  one knows yet. UK studying happens mix match vaccines, might know results finish study. Im talking lady posted article lady lol said get able get yours. guess depends live.... Sorry. number incidents small, make interpretation...which even say report. 

Quite frankly report would suggest U.K. policy delaying 2nd doses 12 weeks seriously flawed practically criminal. shows immunity drops 80+% 50%, matter 10 days. makes sense, way consistent much larger studies done. would suggest U.K. heading nightmare.

Anyways, thanks sending across. Apologies don’t think it’s credible. explain slow rate east coast, though. example, entire state New York 24k first doses last 24 hours. time span received 100k first doses. weather fine New York week now. man. I've telling people extremely likely predictable vaccine stop transmission, based past evidence, like revelation everyone. Reddit well mass media make everything bad possible. Naturally acquired immunity already shown protective 8+ months potentially much longer, vaccines prove even effective. Antibodies one part immune equation. Someone could protected severe disease years even possible get infected.

Plus, susceptibility low summer transmission practically non-existent. look NY last summer, that's without vaccines. Yes, working design advantage EU integration. However, also factor UK ignoring common procurement vaccines Commission blocked Germany, France etc doing. surely can't coincidence UK country take option 28. legal option always credible alternative remaining 27 time. mainly poor rollout been. Doc here. Yes, J&amp;J lower efficacy getting sick, prevented hospitalization deaths well. words, may chance getting asymptomatic cold like infection. much concern there.

Also, J&amp;J's phase 3 trial included African strain efficacy, HUGE..(consider African strain mutating 2 3 times evading vaccine protection. need suppress variants quickly). I’ve read somewhere , can’t remember where, clinical line severe case pneumonia. using existence biker gangs example gun legislation work? number available overall guns overall death gun australia paints different picture. always going exceptions one point at. could talking health codes america could say something stupid like ""america, taco bell paradise. one taco bell rat feces meat"". exactly disprove idea health codes WORK extent last long nation without them. Go Amazon search Windex disinfectant spray. let ""Windex"" name fool you, great disinfectant spray available. would link you, trying help allowed here. great /s Wrong. Shipment delays problem. 

Huge shipment delays west coast due east coast winter storm last week. states 90+% last weeks vaccines delayed. 

Expect delayed doses appear numbers week next week. You’re right that, also hindsight bias. You’re assuming knew everything time. Listen, Trump handle pandemic well, pretend uniquely bad innacurrate New York Times good write-ups COVID recently reasonable non-alarmist (and even *anti-alarmist*). breath fresh air making little optimistic. highlights:

From today:

[No ‘Covid Zero,’ Normalcy - New York Times reasonable goal make manageable, much like seasonal flu. Fortunately, vaccines that. fact, they’re better that. fully vaccinated people, serious illness Covid extremely rare, much rarer serious illness seasonal flu...  yet seasonal flu grind life halt. keep people flying airplanes, eating restaurants, visiting friends going school work.  vaccines produce “Covid zero.” pace — eventually, [perhaps even — produce something looks lot like normalcy. rare exceptions won’t change that, matter much attention receive.

Also last week:

[Vaccine Alarmism - New York Times you’re regular reader newsletter, you’re probably familiar [the idea vaccine goes something like this:  coronavirus vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective. Vaccinated people may still contagious. virus variants may make everything worse. don’t change behavior even get shot.*  message basis truth, fundamentally misleading. [The evidence suggests full dose vaccine — appropriate waiting period second shot — [effectively eliminates risk Covid-19 nearly eliminates risk hospitalization drastically reduces person’s ability infect somebody else. also true virus’s new variants.  alarmism continues. seeing real-world costs: **Many people don’t want get vaccine partly sounds ineffectual...** link available? rock! Fortunately, Covid poses low risk children, less main risk covid kids always spreading vulnerable adults (which significantly less likely adults). need vaccinate kids completely returning normal. good amount Lysol wipes available Amazon they're good quality. I'm allowed link whatever reason. Okay mixed Pfizer Moderna receive government funding. Johnson relying private healthcare federal government pay would likely getting ever vaccine could secure cheapest contract insurance company, provided insurance. probably SOL unless government stepped in. 

Also demonstrably wrong DPA used. "" short term, Biden administration said using law ensure Pfizer access needed equipment scale production vaccine developed German company BioNTech."" Studies shown 90% protection 3 weeks first dose. That's essentially immunity. estimate one month second dose backed research. following rules. issue medical community UK say?

Being fed rules disagreeing experts, surely understand ? stop fucking whining.

Why I? I'm allowed dislike stuck indoors another months top 2 months already lockdown 3. 

This empathy thing again, try sometime hoping . I'm trying help people okay weird rule  one said giving me. Maybe take step back considerate towards others give even though can't keep mental health. Cancerous attitude towards mental health maybe drop cancerous attitude towards others lost family, father's, mother's, daughters, sons brothers, sisters. go ahead get vaccinated f it. Try harder get vaccine sorry dude work like obviously lack understanding everything big issue called supply chain everyone get vaccine pal. Sadly, always treated expendable since ~~before pandemic~~ beginning capitalism.
Fixed ya. New studies shown people 90% protected 3 weeks first dose. also overestimate delivery times, doses distributed two weeks production. Great news. honestly confirms little genetic testing previously done. Last time checked US 43rd world this.... I’ll take . dying ending hospital significantly less symptoms works me. locked hard, could deaths NY CT, lax we’d many FL TX? sound scary. kids who've attending daycare without masks past year.

Looking another article read realized may misunderstood metrics going thinking numbers new vaccines taking account already delivered Cult Trump political leadership media turned disease preventive measures “don’t tread me” gambit political outrage one biggest American embarrassments modern times.

That might ""severe"" case company PR would spin needing hospitalization.

Again - spit balling here. Need careful companies say thing going always marketing spin it. Remember lockdown would ""a short circuit breaker""? Would possible get J&amp;J shot followed Pfizer / Moderna later date? racist homophobe, given user name. ego?

Seriously? great work ethic continue go work despite putting others health risk doesnt scream huge ego you?  5-7 cases placebo group? mean hospitalizations?  use word hero describe group person, assume they’ve also taken responsibility make sacrifices, even die. 

Grocery store workers treated horribly since beginning probably even that. school caused immense depression anxiety. I'd considered lucky happened high school. Well I'm glad vaccine currently available administered high-risk individuals almost exclusively point. I'll take slightly less effective single shot vaccine stamp card get chance. Noooo... that's good. Maybe could give EU good enough? We'd happy take OneMedical concierge service offer coronavirus vaccine publicly without people paying $200 annual membership. definitely easiest private way get vaccine since doubt many seniors people clamoring otherwise shot want deal fee structure. many critical components vaccines.

My husband works box line UPS. Record stock profits.... get? little pin says ""Heroes work here"" insulted Sure.. effect random individuals.. still really hard predict. (and likely continue hard predict.. due mutations, etc)

Vaccinations certainly help. Everything we've learned past year help. Deaths trending know better treat severe symptoms. 

If someone refuses take vaccination. .and also somehow avoided exposed (so, antibodies).. road gets exposed newer mutation body's immune system never seen.. could severe (or deadly) them. 

I'm deeply doubtful we'll ever reach herd-immunity. conspiracy misinformation attitudes (I witness daily). there's going significant chunk population simply refuse vaccinate. course right. thing expected, dozen studies support expected thing, studies debunk expected thing, people still wringing hands worrying expected thing won’t happen.

I'm saying good thing childhood vaccines mandated, covid another question might strategy developed nations, leave rest world dust. may well consequences developed nations well point vaccine escape inevitable thing allowed spread less developed nations. people kept telling flu would terrible year? find bit concerning efficacy impacted variants all, tell that's still line immunity natural infection, I'll take good news. think extreme acceleration we're seeing Pfizer Moderna's new supply announcements, Johnson Johnson getting massively large percentage American arms, guess it'll ten twenty percent people.

I think biggest use going developing countries setting two dose regiment shipping twice many doses would logistically unreasonable. definitely lot easier line large number people, give shot, say ""Okay, good"" ""Okay, see four five weeks, please keep papers give us identifying information get next dose assuming available show up."" going make things smoother. good news. know shot prevents transmission vaccinated person yet? amazing thousands dead grocery store workers yet. I’d agree, threat severe disease low it’s time open 

The problem is, sorry take wayward direction, power control going pried away hold it. Fully vaccinated people already told continue hiding. It’s run metric zero risk never zero risk could argue kids can't make decision take vaccine not, meaning forced protected age can't seek vaccine themselves. could result diseases would affect rest lives.



That's case here, unless think state treat citizens like children allowed chose... case that's exactly people type measure first place good. lacking human compassion? keeping others safe trying reduce spread. Please elaborate? come back ""if know know tell you"". gif know post. every right get MSDS sheet cleaning solution, btw. Denmark could provided same. Yeah, we've likely multiple variants much past year, testing them. makes ""X variant found!"" new stories pretty ridiculous. whole time barely, probably due backlog last week's storms. end March, cases deaths going forward might range really bad flu season. 

We're still little ways that. last 30 years worst death total flu around 61,000. averages around 168 deaths per day. Meanwhile, we're still 7-day average 2,000+ covid deaths per day. close 170 since last March.  


Don't get wrong, agree we're far ""bad flu"" covid. end March month away. personally think we'll dip 1,000 deaths per day April approaching 200 June July. would absolutely love wrong deaths absolutely plummet.  Mother Nature works mysterious ways. Keep fighting good fight end. got vaccine well yesterday. It’s hard wrap head around 10% number considering Israel vaccinated 90% population numbers still increasing. guess bulgarians “woke”... lockdowns prevent virus spreading

No politics, seen something.  


There scientific evidence lockdowns tried, stuff coming seems show little benefit terms covid mortality numbers.  


Look graph locked states versus lockdown states. ones without lockdown lower average. youre right didnt even read article theres reason that. would waste time im gonna believe article anyway? im antimask person looks conspiracies facebook like karen breaks whole lockdown thing, honestly personally believe none it. even did, think many people couldve gotten cold didnt go doc theyre scared visit place full ill people pandemic, treated flu like before. theres absolutely chance 0 cases flu. Can't stay lockdown forever 66 percent effective. mean one three chance getting Rona? role letting professionals job peace. Texas warned numbers would artificially low due crappy weather. deaths risen slightly despite indication corresponding increase hospitalizations. Whenever there's reporting anomaly like major holiday see cases deaths move tandem naturally there's guy again. never saw story said would breaking news CNBC CNN weeks ago.  Economy 500,000+ dead, got it. 

Nothing going take 5 years, think vaccines stop asymptomatic spread good evidence year. time fuck up. Fauci says can’t get groceries packages, doubt worry clothes.

And I'm sure said due overwhelming evidence US trying accuse China lying COVID ones openly claiming food packaging vector.

By way, can't catch contaminated surfaces, Fauci et al advocate much hand washing? I’m done whenever I’m fully vaccinated. buying “keep distancing wearing mask vaccination” stuff. haven’t seen good data support stance public health officials taking.

At point, 99% us want prioritize restoring normalcy. Doctors fall 1% want super cautious wait long possible resorting “semblance” normalcy. 

Hell, parents fully vaccinated mid-March I’ll easing several things point. KiDs pRaCtiCalLy ImMuNe KiDs NeEd ScHoOl!   Pfizer Moderna 95 percent effective getting covid all.. vaccine still likely get covid. Get fucked Rona, normal summer come! I've noticed well, lot internal polarization going sub starting like month two ago. people calling daily discussion thread ""only sane place site,"" people happy things back normal... except anytime someone brings news signaling potential road bumps, they're immediately labeled ""overly negative, fear-mongering, pandemic-loving shut-ins never want life return normal."" there's people do, actually, unnecessarily freak tiniest often unverified headlines, claiming masks 2024 oh God we're gonna die. Neither group seems discern sort middle ground, end mislabeling misrepresenting time. weird. Oh meant usa. can't wait see ends. Covid 100% become endemic. talking following covid since January last year. coworkers thought nuts. work disease prevention government. feel come close pandemic soon terrible seasonal thing. Maybe one day we'll notice change life expectancy catch never it. True, however thier second trial months, looks two dose regimen.

My educated guess.

One dose jj similar see pfizer moderna. second dose would likely convey effects.  Second dose vaccines also seem convey longterm memory cells longer lasting immunity. 

So strategy would hope jj would focused hard reach pple likely lost follow homeless population. maybe healthiest individuals like 25 year olds. summer new data released vaccines widely given , approve jj second dose give them. hope take comment criticism store employees. not. I'm critical shitty things Kroger workers. I'm sorry stress. Shock face UK would gone EU.

That's entirely UK's choice. Yes. might also reporting delays due snow. ask kind disability have, insulting you? seem eloquent. curious. Thank you! lower chance hundreths percent. getting vaccine stand way anyone freedom. scared virus wiped 0.1% population, welcome hide away ever more. Long Beach CA, Kroger literally closed 2 Ralph’s stores rather pay $4 hero pay city passed. numbers, covid already comparable perhaps even less dangerous flu children. 

I agree vaccines make completely negligible, even without vaccines kids incredibly low risk covid. would remove 420 million guns circulation tho?

Generally speaking, one time. Almost grocery workers Seattle one big union. quite powerful size.

But still worse worse many grocery store employees lifetime workers anymore. planning working years tend less active union. mom's generation voting strike ages, get voted younger, temporary workers.

Unions far less effective businesses careers. sadly, grocery worker jobs went solid middle class career 1990s temporary 'lower class' non-bachleor degree job.' fuck sake man educate subject callef critical sources. article refers another article refers ""anonymous source""

People like reason deadly misinformation fear spread Yes, get it, feel need control largely uncontrollable situation. proclamations help cope. Good luck! MN we've two deaths last two days. Mask mandates still effect.

Just south us IA they've hardly ever restrictions place 1/2 population: 64 dead two days. 60 percent effective. anyone reading this, please remember responses trying explain pandemic restrictions vaccine distribution simpletons.

Why Florida Governor screwing vaccine distribution threatening retaliation complain? people like guy vote, too. hired right people accelerate production fix distribution problems. states get 3 week forecast. Pfizer vaccine shipments come special needle need get 6th dose included. American Rescue Plan save schools state budgets. Racial equality distribution become top priority. more. dare suggest also survives frozen food packaging clearly lie invented Chinese cover heinous crimes. opinion, COVID-19 going become endemic US seasonal outbreaks. kinda see due fact latest strains haven’t become deadly, infectious. larger picture good. probably change then? Polio vaccine around decades safety profile well known. can't say numerous rushed vaccines appeared covid. Masks4all seconded. Personally recommend powecom headband style kn95. 99% filtration confirmed CDC independent testing, buy 50 99 cents US need herd immunity vulnerable groups vaccinated.


Do know many healthy people age 65 died year covid?

I feel like lack information this. Brother, I'm without mask, mix much others. care others can.

Wtf? read weeks ago 60 percent effective. Several articles stated number. paying attention winter? Covid seems strongly seasonal. UK would gone EU. 2016 referendum going way would've meant pro EU Westminster likely we'd boat European countries.

I voted remain 2016 pro EU weird twist fate one saw coming. immediate benefit Brexit something one expected indeed benefit UK seriously (somewhat annoyingly) covered Boris' mishaps boosted popularity amongst public. someone whose chance severe infection tenths percent, I'll take one passing up. non covid patients couldn’t find help local hospital due covid patients. Gen Z dumbest group Twitter doesn’t shock me. guys hear things called vaccines something?  US least, looks like partial herd immunity. 1/3 population virus, infections concentrated people social contacts. enough slow quite bit.

Social distancing really make sense explanation, since less restrictions cases increasing, yet still going down. 60 percent effective. you’ll go r/covid19 lot fake news subject misinformation let people believe Israel blame. I'm Israel reading news , good bad lot one sided articles could see SNL news lately.

So I'm writing know based news I'm reading Israel abroad decide yourselves. 

1.Palestinians blame Israel several times coronavirus one top government members needed help sent Israeli hospital (unfortunately died lung transplantation years ago , also Israel).

2.Palestinians says Israel transport vaccines West Bank Gaza Israel filled forms properly - could also send Egypt Gaza , saying.

3.Palestinians receive hundreds millions dollars every year yet can't buy vaccines. lately paid terrorists families amount could buy top vaccines.

4.Palestinians elections soon - Israel help one nominates bringing vaccines gone better scream ""Israel genocide apartheid"" day long.

5.Israel vaccinate everyone Israel including Palestinians also Palestinians West bank comes work Israel.

6.Israel many pfizer vaccines per contract pfizer used get herd immunity donations. Although Israel ones first countries support Moderna given 100k doses right give millions end Q1 half Q2.

7.Israel donate moderna vaccines right pfizer said even 5000 go medical staff countries help start. Israel get moderna vaccines donate use pfizer.

8.Would rather give vaccines wants throw sea give support ? Netanyahu taking trump like actions focus countries support country think way. 

I wish good health Palestinians becoming comical lately, threatened launch rockets civilians give medical supplies covid19. add single shot also reduce transmission. something December, tested negative covid never took flu test. Take mean whatever want to.  thanks, Johnson &amp; Johnson evil company put known carcinogen freakin; baby powder! hell actually believes nonsense? brain cells died lack oxygen? Why?

Obviously can’t predict future, signs pointing universal vaccine coverage among eligible willing population next couple months. think cut transport biggest yearly holiday lil old flu? knew gravity.

China held different standard. Everybody knows will, actively do, break rules. 1) matter CDC says it, CDC says guides states make policy; ""truth"" eventually win out, talking timeline short couple months; 2) resources allocate administration infinite. Administration currently increasing supply (the current bottleneck) increasing. point supply exceed finite administration resources (optimistically around 4,000,000 shots per day - 33% higher peak flu vaccination) administration limiting factor. 

In event, really talking going back full ""normal"" (fans stands, concerts, masks). Things like higher-capacity restaurants, schools opening, etc. probably happen then. told Monday I’ll likely unblinded study come Monday, point next week. exactly decide dont wear mask? wear one, public indoor spaces like mall, store etc.

In beginning media aggressive painting Sweden country takes actions deal virus. led following:

1: people believe Sweden anything, see bad numbers indicative fact conclude bad numbers caused anything.

2: people believe Sweden anything, see numbers actually bad. plenty countries worse. must *something* right. Since media said Sweden anything stop virus must mean virus bad.

3: bunch Swedes convinced nothing done prevent virus spreading people agree people category 1.

But easy disprove looking society large changed. friends forced work home since pandemic started. Universities gone online. Stores see decreasing numbers customers.  Loopholes law (bunch people Georgia pretending caregivers), doctors notes, friends hookups. Hey, too! Hi fellow “willing donate body research want worst way” trial participant. It’s one thing realist another speak empathetic terms best prevent deaths. vulnerable people already vaccinated. people would receive vaccine would wait matter days get mRNA vaccine otherwise. Yes, according government regions variant found 80% cases. Bruh invited? Worst case scenario always cancel get refund. say take it. They've rushed sense bigger budgets test groups quickly organized plenty people getting infected.

The testing rigorous decades old vaccines.

By millions people vaccinated reports bad side effects good reports covid-19 protection recently reports good prevention spread.

We need act quickly get high vaccination rate. variants popping up. wait long, variant bypasses vaccines start again... would hope people would optimistic. 

This vaccine easy store, transport, deploy. requires follow-up shot. keeps people hospital, morgue, reduce community spread. 

I understand people would see less absolute win. Outdoor playgrounds open months months. grocery store clerk resident long term care facility kissing? US needs take care first stop bleeding. point, yeah does, need ready pull trigger opening floodgates.

Still, 3 million day 21 million week, right around 10% eligible population week. Great news. I'm getting first Pfizer shot weekend &amp; drive 3-hours get it. want travel, travel. come reddit asking okay...that's weird  Encouraging news. honestly want able see people person sometime 2021 (preferably Fall). depression burn hitting super hard lately. I’m standing wedding end August think COVID won’t much worry. got vaccine I’m feeling excited! live high altitude blood oxygen saturation normally low mid 90s. Average Denver 95% Summit County (where lot mountain towns are) 92%. Let’s turn Steve Average Joe get population immune! consider 25% population isn’t cleared vaccine (kids) number even exciting. adults form human shield around kids, much forward nearly normal summer nearly normal return school. Czech Republic initally dealt crisis much better countries Europe did. wearing masks governments Europe wide still saying masks useless (they knew also knew enough masks produced March 2020). since they've mask thing longer everyone else, they're less apathy mode caused massive surge cases since October. Live data (usually delayed days): paper: seasonality vaccination, fourth peak really necessary, requires people holding together Spring/Summer.

I optimistic. TIL Sega Channel.

My parents bought AP TRU 10yr old. remember one less expensive games parents could relatively afford. LOL lived China studied before. dont trust chinese government all, never will. really huge assumption assume complicit silencing dissenters. Chinese government reason tell truth, plenty reason lie. 

You think every mention losing taste, smell, coughing, ect didnt get mentioned social media apparatus didnt backtrace Wuhon? Sure maybe didnt realize initial scale. Maybe go talk asian immigrant see trust levels China's government.

Easy proof sure cases like it. :  Sure, agreed, warning trigger /= hospitalisation. Warning trigger means, stay vigilant come back gets worse biologist epidemiologist even don’t agree over. engineer, think you’ll fine August based number efficacy vaccines available then. Knowing someone died isn’t suffering death.

The poll simply know someone died, would qualify[1in No, places state vaccines available. FDA approved company screwed baby powder handle vaccines?

No thanks. VRBPAC meeting Friday aren’t conclusive studies yet. It’s worth delaying vaccination. Take vaccine get. tell every person you’ve ever met same. Herd immunity matters specific vaccine. one year ago, every nurse medical assistant spoke (e.g. neighbors person giving flu vaccine) said thought it’s man-made virus Chinese government. Nurses dumb, too. Yes it’s important distinction. position essential, worker expendable. fact position essential worker die keep position filled, it. Many people, included, impression workers going treated essential get hazard pay such. Silly me, wasn’t many months later figured actually meant essential.  Palestinian authority independent civilian security oversight territory per Oslo Accords responsible local health care (including vaccines). Actually, mean either. interrupt ever say racial ethnic vaccination differences? really lost taking conversation.

We agree serious problem. disagreement see something (in crucial vaccine distribution moment) needs addressed state local level using elected representatives far quicker effective trying get federal government involved. come don’t currently then? human body susceptible oxygen saturation. Anything 90% considered hypoxic. suspect 93% known COVID exposure warning trigger lung complications. susceptible, yes, becomes unlikely whole point vaccine enable body create antibodies minimize symptoms virus much possible. Long term effects still known enough time study them, I'm cautiously optimistic say long term effects happen virus get severe enough create them. That's thought definitions found said twice year, least both. I'm board distinction \*horde wear seatbelts, people still die car accidents absurd expect people avoid driving completely take far restrictive measures tiny risk (""stay home, stay safe"" works avoid car accidents, too, one expects anyone that). people ride motorcycles, drive Top Fuel dragsters, take risks others, that's them. Society whole moves forward, like we're moving towards now. “Look percentage cases coming back gene target failure PCR tests. It’s proxy new strain since barely sequencing cases.”

Is anyone reliably reporting track public domain?

Also, human behavior going play interesting mix here. Weather getting nicer, schools going online, youth spring sports coming, mask social distancing fatigue high. People look real-time data judge danger virus won’t noticeable impact weeks (as point out). New vaccine, Johnson &amp; Johnson's first COVID-19 vaccine released. Current schedule one shot, trials involving multiple doses underway. Math looks good me.

I bake 2 weeks pessimism predictions, cause knows we're gonna get hit another freak weather event face supply chain issues. Hope not. get unemployment pandemic say feel safe work know said many things game changer future, would anticipate annual covid vaccine mixed included annual flu shot. 

The good news might actually get people take flu shot year. know many Americans never considered getting flu shot past. sad tens thousands people die flu every year us despite widely available vaccine. repeated assertion coronavirus transmission significantly lower children one biggest false claims made pandemic

The problem big unknown. [There light study French daycare measured seroprevalence. found intrafamily transmission likely daycare centres, there's basically enough data.

Asserting either way silly. means world 100% going get Rona (you're professional mouth masseuse, ala SNL), 33% chance getting all, 25% chance dropping oxygen saturation, virtually chance needing hospitalized. well vaccine production ramping next weeks little better question survival fabric mean transmission fabric 1) something true, matter CDC says it. still true.
2) administration increasing speak, there's reason believe keep  really missing point took *40 YEARS* HIV reach number and, say, one year + 100 days Covid same.

40 years

vs.

465 *days*.

Even Covid exceed 700,000 dead, already 2/3rd way number. going go down. could possibly think HIV severe Covid? reports anaphylaxis 

Also promising predisposed allergic reactions. UN declaration essentially baseline human rights. Plenty countries human rights taken granted. recommend interacting ANYONE right now, given covid, definitely deserve humiliation, 100% Sure are. nuts merely get near severely allergic person, get sick.  expected end May UK adults least 1 covid vaccine dose, elderly vulnerable likely given second.

Still safe though support it, see people it. Ya, rejection big concern. Also, depending n original pathology, new lungs also become diseased time. Ling transplants really difficult every way possible.  They're going mass produce J&amp;J vaccine get emergency use authorization (just case) ramp extremely fast. That's happened others too. Dude can’t wait Pride 2021. Hopefully we’ll able year. Spain, media politicians parroting whole pandemic children practically spread disease (clinging outdated papers beginning pandemic disproven later) almost transmission school (because contact trace, classmates count ""close contacts"" due masks).

But now, define priority groups vaccines, and... voilà! Primary school teachers priority group! Meanwhile, university professors (like myself) on-site teaching adults age group socializes, parties challenges rules most, priority. 

Conclusion: even believe propaganda. (Most people do, though). guess pretty accurate, follow instructions precisely. main problem probably many people screw sample preparation. I’m riverside opening Monday. I’m schools reopening. However really reopening like people think. It’s hybrid model kids go school morning others afternoon. talking 2 hours school here, parents pick drop go back home online school rest day. It’s logistical nightmare, going get work done I’m back forth school every 2 hours? talking 60 days summer break, what’s point? online whole year, wear masks whole time, lunch, recess, desks plastic around them. It’s stupid open right now.  documented cases someone getting Covid someone brief interaction (less 5 minutes)? someone explain whether Sputnik V adenovirus vaccine's transmission rates way analogue good news Pfizer Moderna?

(serb here, got Russian vaccine, want reassure roommate) Weather bad across much US, Texas. saw TikTok saying COVID last 2024 like 400k likes none commenters challanging trying understand 2-day trend. That's counterintuition. especially true since states still playing catch due disastrous weather last week. I'm expert. guess right insurance possible, I'd doubt it. Post ""mild"" covid 7 months let tell you, gets pretty fucked they'll hospitalize zero low risk factors. thought going die front fiance bed worst night. oxsat 90% coughed breathe back in. basically slowly starving death due long term side effects. point wish slowly, god damned miserable. it’s refundable, I’d book now. not? things good, go, you’re comfortable, get refund! turn tables Fuck off, CNN Good news never suggested would eradicate flu masks alone. would help. would!  Probably before. I'm betting May, late April could also possible Wondering vaccine’s effects (soreness, fever, achiness) be, seeing one dose vs. Pfizer/Moderna’s 2. Anyone link results? I’d imagine pretty powerful dosage seeing it’s one shot. Well, people spread immunocompromised old people might still die even vaccination. look Israel, small portion vaccinated population especially frail still died fully vaccinated.

At certain point comes what's tolerable death rate. suspect vaccinate something like 60% population, we'll flu lower death rate nullify argument extending lockdowns. like annual flu vaccines people. already do. 

But yes, get tag like. time theres actually chance hell true. scare years back dropped 89%. given nebulizer instead admitted hospital. still low 24 hours would admitted hospital.

Basically oxygen saturation alone wont require hospitalization. stays low. Poland promise Ukraine vaccines? think supposed get also India? I'm ""wishing doomsday"". think reasonable objectively aware dumb selfish shortsighted human beings are. (intentionally not). 

The reality something like Covid.. lets say open back Movie Theaters Music venues allow 50 100 people. 

Every. Single. One .. 50 100 people. .has completely 100% honest accurate health conditions want avoid kind ""super-spreader"" event. 1 person lying ignorant (even unintentionally) unaware carrier.. they'll spread 50 100 people (and quite easily). do.. 50 people (who may, days, realize caught something).. go spread too. 

We've already seen (over past year so).. kind expectation (that 100% people 100% honest caring decisions effect others around them).. simply gonna happen. 

I think ""average person"" really understands ""asymptomatic spread"". People prefer things ""easy"" ""convenient"". idea (themselves) hyper vigilant 24-7-365,.. something they'd choose voluntarily do. That's problem. don’t think messaging zero risk. It’s keeping reproductive rate 1.0 accomplish herd immunity. contagious variants circulating, real danger fourth wave spring early summer. It’s individual risk much keeping risk low everyone less virus spreading. pretty steep decline, similarly steep incline cases, isn’t likely continue steep trajectory indefinitely. could natural plateau, decline cases isn’t steep been. Or, could massive delays reporting. would take literally anything Yes.

Social media cancer. realize irony saying that, lot young kids literally spewing popular opinion rather thinking themselves. Low blood oxygen level.

i spent 2 weeks life american Continent. might anger misdirected. Call back ask information, rely Reddit explain doctor's advice you. That's pay doctor for... would call doctor back ask them, sure. im grieving able live life way want even though im vaccinated right now. Look Texas. snowstorm brought 7 day average last week increasing can't apply previous patterns future outlook Vaccines major paradigm shift. massive drop deaths next 6 weeks since people would died protected via vaccine. problem. want able tell people vaccinated, generally super concerned COVID might affect you. single dose shot perfect type people would compliant coming back clinic 2nd mRNA vaccine dose. going boost compliance targeted toward part population  grandparents FL received 2 doses. think depends state. pandemic taught anything, people lie getting vaccine go hang friends. care, think asking proof vaccination unreasonable all. huge shipment delays west coast due east coast winter storm last week. west coast states states 90+% last weeks vaccines delayed. doses arriving week, expect numbers trend up. read article previously Covid one shot need since already antibodies. Regarding graphic, percentage population 0-59 vs. 60+? Probably 80/20? Seems like would useful know going compare absolute numbers graphic like that.  Africa get earlier India. I'd stop worrying cases would look hospitalizations deaths key indicators.   Weather conditions caused shipment delays vaccine manufacturers rest country, resulting temporary shortage doses. Making vaccines everyone needs immunized mandatory ""authoritarian"".

You suffer nothing thinking. Well, 50% population want it, can't jump back normality without fairly substantial death rates. smaller fraction population, 20-30% reasonably approach herd immunity. point we'd cases/deaths.

So right sense problem right tons willing recipients. not. mitigates dental office spread use iodine rinse prior work. Studies show drastically cuts viral load. hospitals overrun warzones right now?

For many American doctors, first extended period unemployment. Unlike engineers MBAs might see fortunes rise fall whims recessions boom times, physicians exactly accustomed laid off. However, doctors already smarting years due falling salaries decreased autonomy, punctuated endless clicks electronic medical records software.

Now, twin shock income loss feeling unwanted pandemic — when, know, medicine might seem especially essential — doctors resorting bizarre array side gigs, ""fun-employment"" activities, outright career overhauls.

Stephanie Eschenbach Morgan, MD, breast radiologist North Carolina, trained 10 years college earning true physician's salary.

""Being furloughed awful. Initially, going 2 weeks, turned 2 months pay,"" reflected.

Eschenbach Morgan surgeon husband, lost full quarter's salary, ask grace periods credit card mortgage payments paid large tax bill right pandemic began. ""We get stimulus help, added insult injury,"" said.

With time spent waiting holding pattern, Eschenbach Morgan homeschooled two young children started putting home gym together. went home organizing spree, started garden, and, perhaps impressively, caught 5 years photo albums.

A bonus noted: ""I set alarm 2 months.""

Shella Farooki, MD, radiologist California, also focused homeschooling, demanding job, veered toward retirement. one work contracts furloughed (""at one point, made $30K month [their business]""), started saving money home, teaching kids, applied Paycheck Protection Program loan. husband, hospitalist, shifts cut. Farooki tried radiology artificial intelligence firm backed asked read 9200 studies $2000 per month.

Now, thinks leaving medicine ""every day.""

Some doctors questioning whether medicine first place. Family medicine physician Jonathan Polak, MD, faced pink slip, turned pink T-shirts instead. girlfriend manages outlet teen fashion retailer Justice. Polak, finished residency 2 years ago, hesitate take $10-an-hour gig stock doc, even finding delivering shelving unit shuttering store physician fleeing city rural New Hampshire ""escape.""

There's escape — yet. Saddled ""astronomical"" student loans, considered grocery store work well. Polak knows can't work part time go teaching long term, might like.

Even so, he's everything patient care long haul — thought would be.

""The culture medicine, bureaucracy, endless paperwork charting, threat litigation sucks lot joy point see forever imagining 5-10 years it.""

Still, recently took 18-month hospital contract force move Florida, he's also turning veritable Renaissance man; composing music, training ultramarathon, studying latest medical findings, road tripping, launching podcast dog grooming master groomer. ""We found parallels medicine dog grooming,"" says, somewhat convincingly.

Also working ruff life Jen Tserng, former forensic pathologist landed news websites recent years becoming professional dog walker house sitter without permanent home. Tserng knows doctors restless unhappy COVID-19, thoughts wandering grass might greener.

As profile grew, found inbox gathering messages disaffected medical minions: students fear failing staring residency application season, employed doctors sick constant grind. recounted de facto life coach conversations (""What really enjoy?"" ""Do you really like dogs?"") phone New York, said matter-of-factly, ""They call COVID. call hate lives.""

Michelle Mudge-Riley, MD, physician Texas, seeing shift time well. recently held virtual version Physicians Helping Physicians conference, doctors hear peers working successfully fields like pharmaceuticals real estate investing.

When COVID-19 hit, Mudge-Riley quickly pivoted virtual platform, MDs DOs huddled breakout rooms honest chats fears tentative hopes new careers.

""There increased interest nonclinical exploration full- part-time careers, well side hustles, since COVID began,"" said. ""Many physicians hours pay cut laid off. Others furloughed. want environment feel safe.""

However, said clashed Trump-supporting colleagues feared might taking pandemic seriously enough.

Together, embraced gardening, Peloton splurge, learning business skills open private practices — solo primary care him; ENT focus favorite surgery, rhinoplasty, her.

Mangiapane considered editing medical brochures also tried apply job county public health officer rural California, received shock learned county intended open schools midst pandemic despite advisement contrary former health officer.

He retreated job listings altogether hearing would-be peers getting death threats — targeting children.

Both doctors felt COVID-19 pushed beyond comfort zones. ""If COVID happened, would working...be 'owned.' weird way, COVID made independent take risk career.""

Obstetrician Kwandaa Roberts, MD, certainly did; took budding interest decorating dollhouses straight Instagram national news fame, TV-show expert ""Sell House.""

Like Doshi Mangiapane, Polak wants control future — even selling T-shirts mall means certain loss status along way.

Pfizer projecting around 60M, enough 30M people.  mean I’ve flu barely sniffles pop say it’s 66% effective moderate severe covid, 100% effective hospitalisation, actually entail? deemed severe covid, doesn’t require hospitalisation (is severe enough require medical intervention)? walked early pandemic make demands. missed opportunity. TBF, used work food desert place get actual food Dollar General Dairy Queen. food half bad! It’s high time people site get damn self confidence stop asking moral permission strangers. vaccines become widespread, refuse take it, problem. blame ocean someone decided dive 300 feet without oxygen. making vaccines mandatory anti-vaxxer.

Not making vaccines mandatory allows anti-vaxxers exist damage others almost everyone gets vaccinated anyway?

Which enough flu Corona Virus, things like measles. cited paper R0 value, sequence prevalence. 

So? saying prevalence numbers wrong? so, say paper whole? that's worst kind cherry picking take one data fits agenda one source something contradicting agenda, bury it. 0 sources 

I best try find primary sources paper cited (and try discredit). could find anything using google almost everything mentioning new variant lead articles month two ago. wikipage leads document says use site data. That's finally get actual numbers indeed show variant become dominant UK. site definitely first page google search. way, page puts prevalence new variant US 5.3%. So, go back favourite example New York, highly unlikely dominant variant there. believe find anything own, think either bother saw simple google search supports I've said. 

You learn [Hanlon's assuming malice motive people's actions. I'm impressed write much exactly 0 substance, 

Well, that's opinion. zero substance, free refute claims supporting arguments facts logic answering questions freak dare ask sources claims. Instead behave extremely hostile manner attacking person (instead claims sources) time, still understand why. done something offend you? problem make claim, ask provide source try best provide source already time writing it, puzzles attitude have. That’s I’m worried although rise vaccinations seems odd would plateauing. plateauing I’d still curious starting plateau? people relaxing prematurely? new variants? maybe random noise data indicative larger plateau? young people free go without shamed. risk taking extremely minimal, experts believe everyone fill isolate complete shut everything down. still go keep society going told expendable doesnt matter consequences that.  Sure.. absolutely. 100% understand (and exactly felt Jan-Feb last year). acknowledge situation nearly dying Covid19 certainly influenced thinking that. 

But ""being worried covid19"" entirely different dynamic risks. want solve Covid19,. can.. going require us ""get front (ahead) transmission/spread"". Since asymptomatic (not showing signs infection) 4 14 days,. unknowingly (and spreading) Covid19. That's thing fix. (literally design) over-react order get ahead spreading virus. 

Other things (like aneurisms).. work way. (obviously could medical checkups take health seriously try live healthy lifestyle).. still bit different highly-transmissible pandemic virus. 

Corona virus quite literally one situations 2x 3x 10x think to. want ""get ahead of"" ""stay ahead of"" community-spread transmission virus.. hyper-vigilant over-reactive. 80% vaccinated resious herd immunity, mention people risk dying vaccinated. Kids don’t die rarely suffer serious cases. point pretty much flu. see countries locking flu? one knows. Trouble is, one knows ""long-hauler"" rate unvaccinated people, either. don’t see data study, last one used impossibly massive amount virus see left certain intervals.

A worst case situation, unlikely non-medical worker (and ventilation hospitals would venture viral quantities still unlikely).

Question, air exchange rate standard dentist office ventilation? people kids lol would certainly help. issue every option helps reduce infection risk. Biden deserves praise vaccine rollout, development. Trump useless even preparing that. Thank god he's out. first disappointed able ship couple days March realized that’s next week. Crazy time flows pandemonium.... earth media focus on? bored politics. run Tiger Woods accident ground. What’s left? Variants! said accurate, young still expected continue absolutely nothing. Math says if, new, contagious variants take hold, increase risk opening faster decrease risk vaccination, get fourth surge levels finally drop sustainably low level. get decide whether current decrease holds not. whether maintain enough vigilance prevent final wave going difference couple hundred thousand deaths. want optimistic, fact fought would take save half million lives couldn’t get enough people board doesn’t give much hope. Well fair become political union lately still you’re right. 

A simple way putting countries make EU give EU power reversed US. US government higher rank state government (I hope I‘m correct lol) Awesome! give time choreograph new tik tok dances.

(That's joke, shoot me. seriously good news that's great hear.) Except isn't, old shoulder burden vulnerability, fall young sacrifice themselves? Especially vaccine available anyone wants it, think asking proof reasonable. Going ask proof flu shots MMR? becomes fault get infected. like 60% shot came out. people talk ass getting shot turn comes up.

i'm curious people like almost seem disappointed doomsday never happened. continued desperate attempts cling onto possible doomsday might still happen.

why cling hope continuous nightmare? even 70% population gets vaccinated, that's herd immunity. factor people natural antibodies, it'll even higher. true covid shot may become annual flu shot, that's reality we'll live in. Yeah good thing nothing US reaches us Canada.

Not like pro-Trump protests Dec Jan. NZ shut (temporarily) cases pop up. Turns likely infection obtained washing flight attendants garments. sure likely transmission is, appear possible. Ha! 9 siblings. crazy growing many around. cannot imagine parents thinking. hell inflicted them! one even hear Perfect Peggy, they'll busy fun Note: Sweden reports deaths death date rather report date. practice means always look like deaths trending zero, even not.

To combat this, either avoid looking latest 2-3 weeks deaths, use predicts reported deaths expected increase. Yup. posted link talked focus covid cause least 400k Tb deaths 2020. Covid spread bunnies yet? Imagine Easter Bunny carrier.  not? prove numbers accurate accounting something else needs double blind tested controlled study ensure there’s another explanation. waited 12 months. can’t wait extra month (2 max) get vaccine prevent possibility long term effects, something wrong don’t value health. isn’t rush finish line kind race.

There enough good vaccines summer you’re picking J&amp;J point eating glue child. tell get J&amp;J tomorrow nothing, maybe point, that’s happening. act like 10x think negative costs associated it, positives. goal life curb virus, right. society goals needs. risk death always acceptable, that's life. one apply diplomat pandemic shown anything, large portion humanity fundamentally unable consider anything beyond short term.

Everyone wants play margins, desperately chasing get rich quick mentality. one less risky food allergies, yes? I’d fine closing schools two days week entire summer. recommendation ""hide closet blanket head, cowering shaky fear!""). That's thing anyone advising. Anywhere.

Sure is. Stay home, stay safe billboards national media campaigns country major platform response many, many politicians.

Noting literally asking hide closet blanket head simply pedantry. no, swap, blood taken. 

Also, im donating blood regulary, would guess blood less okay... husband got first Pfizer vaccine 2/12. 2/15, went home work slight fever. Since then, non-stop fevers, hacking coughs complete fatigue. today, seems turning corner, took seen (on 103 degree fever day) doctor said husband likely already infected got shot. 

My husband wearing N95s face shield work (school bus driver) still caught it. eaten restaurant since last March get groceries curbside, except Costco month. matter careful are, still happen.

Also nurses warned gets second shot, he's going go hell. ""Forced"" Haha ""by March gonna second wave worse!""

Meanwhile here's new measures change lot make lot sense compared countries 😋 Completely it. wont normal humans 16 wont vaccinated then. I'm willing err caution side things get confirmation kids can't spread bring home adults elderly live staff that's monitoring them.

My preschooler masks on, socially distanced, ventilated/max outdoor time school I'm comfortable concern get concern pick bring home unvaccinated family. 

We recently also neighbor whose 6 year old picked died also skeptical people spreading ""kids get affected it"" claims. Maybe relative risk perspective mean zero risk. test Covid, nothing more, blood taken

I guess imma call actual doc tomorrow, since town im studying hometown... get second opinion... *Merriam Florida lockdowns mandates yet many heavily locked down, masked states. Realistically choice mRNA J&amp;J vaccine time. deciding delay getting vaccinated means get 0% protection either mild severe disease interim. Waiting option without costs own, particularly prevalence virus population still reasonably high. month two max delay? You’re willing risk long term effects instead waiting month? already waited year. Son..... wait now?  think politicians going actively try make vaccine less safe? Except part,. choices ""pandemic-effect"" kill people (not way infectious respiratory disease does). decide wrap Ferrari around telephone pole going 200mph... great,. that's you. 

Except part many actions affect people. Driving Ferrari 200mph endangers others, another car instead telephone pole someone else dies -yet ban Ferrari's. ban alcohol despite 10k+ deaths year DUI crashes, many deaths innocent party drunk driver. 

Death part life, fact literally thing certain life. risk always acceptable. also miss most, barely remember taste. I'm that. 
Norway	881 
Finland	947.9 
Denmark	2938.3 
Netherlands	2227.3

Denmark one stands out. Lead example, pretty much brand him. miss Zune! Right?

The sad thing I’ve buying new clothes. stretchy ones. 

To fair though, they’re mainly clothes appropriate Burning Man...I’m building wardrobe case ever happens again. Lol Problem is, America yet enough best stuff. I'll believe everyone wants shot get one. meantime, I'll take not-quite-best stuff get it, that's better nothing. Honest question : percent people can't take vaccine? cant find good estimates quick search.

I found people allergic ingredients take it. (no shit) Pregnant breastfeeding women uncertain, mrna ones good immunocompromised take, though would make sense ineffective.

If amount people can't take work 20%, probably keep restrictions cases go down, amount .01%, say people ""tough luck, please protect yourself""  personal health based sick feel. may feel bad week end better immune system example. didn’t Canada invest vaccine manufacturing capacity back March? Cases ticked little deaths plummeted Sweden. Every four years faint hope optimism people learning even political party absolute power DC, system still slow design promises made probably kept.

I consistently disappointed. SA variant isn’t able reinfect everyone covid already. seems slightly better reinfection variants, mostly people weaker immune systems. headline makes sound much harsher disease become entirely endemic around whole world possible eliminate summer Scottish government approach aim elimination hasn’t possible. reason that...you can’t end international travel forever open trading nation possible looked closely Australian Model, imagine, challenge huge amount goods come short straits come hauliers. isn’t possible without entirely closing instead need replace lockdown measures UK replace protection think end Covid something akin flu, vaccinate it, give protection vulnerable, but...there people die it. sad reality alternative lockdowns forever. second article linked seems focus effectiveness vaccines preventing individual infected, appearing mostly ignore effectiveness provide reducing transmission disease vaccinated individual contract disease. Even doesn’t fully prevent everyone contracting Covid, it’s ability reduce severity disease it’s symptoms going reduce ability spread. article doesn’t seem directly address effective preventing transmission. articles I’ve read seem indicate seemingly effective reducing transmission well (with caveat still quite early say sure, hopefully going forward data confirm this). definitely expected this, waiting data behind it. I'm glad we're starting get data! morning able go TWO pages sub without getting crippling anxiety! You’re complaining, you’re literally advocating death elderly thread. disgusting stance. Realize everyone difficult time. It’s you. think FDA CDC going to, also bureaucratic entities. Thanks explaining:) 
In regards Arab-Israeli community - mean say access vaccines - definetly do, use access (as well groups Israel) due distrust system. cant blame distrust, unfortunate case.   vaccines works years. issue ADE previous attempts. There’s conflicting information issue since release vaccines important conversation proper informed consent vaccinated, need put life hold. sucks people like kids still can’t resume normal things herd immunity reached. normal things, mean travel, amusement parks, eating out. 

We decided let play dates screw it, kids need friends possible could both. Like things mostly back normal masks advised crowded spaces really really control.

Like saw new Zealand months back cases dropped zero. feel that! I’m going need new clothes leave house. 🤣 see people traceable amount. immediate family members either gotten first dose appointments get first dose. either age limit jobs make us eligible  That’s another method. Iodine done UConn dental school study that’s use implications emergency approvals bring up? Like what's done differently review process product thats given normal vs emergency FDA approval? (Beyond time takes) Sweden well awhile now. Especially compared neighboring countries.  Ughhh!! many important events. I’m sorry. Virtual hugs internet stranger. 

I feel virtual last year law school graduation ceremony - colossal energy suck. 

Here’s wishing concurrent fabulous careers mom attorney. Always remember pulled baby 3L FREAKING PANDEMIC...if THAT, anything!!! think politicians political bodies going ensure safety vaccines? think quite opposite. research shows 45 percent Czechs consider coronavirus epidemic media hype, influenced secret organizations.

wow. U.S medically advanced rest world.

Yes are. publish *almost* medical research rest world virus sequenced China.

This might impressive start pandemic first place. Phizer developed vaccine Germany.

This deal exists Germany ability produce distribute COVID vaccine themselves. Also BioNTech used mRNA technology already owned Phizer. AstraZenca developed UK

And far least effective vaccines. Johnson Johnson co-developed Belgium U.S

Same situation Phizer BioNTech. reason U.S administrating vaccines many countries matter medical technological superiority, matter wealth. U.S resources secure hundreds millions doses vaccines currently distributing even proven effective.

You're making sound like big bag vaccines sale world auction decide would get it. reason nobody else produce vaccine quantity needed medicine production technology par US. U.S decides ""come rescue"" parts world sharing Medical Information, though transfer wealth.

This correct. Nobody talking sharing information. shipping vaccines produced US investing new vaccine production facilities abroad. 

And come rescue we've done many times before. something proud of, downplay it. That's good point! Still amazing either way. happened 10 years ago, we'd probably still waiting one developed point. kept telling people time found nothing good. literally TV screaming Trump CNN joking around brother. People seem look loudest person room swoon without actually looking say do. Double blind application here... I'm Boston lot pharma companies working offices.

I expect 4th *wild*. EU please work hard get vaccine  categorization absolutely nothing laughable, bars, restaurants, theme parks still open country, obviously before, things do. personally won’t things least wife parents grandparents vaccinated, already are, based obvious contempt I’m assuming dont risk family members go want long wear mask properly public places Here's info it. 15 minutes risk assessment. magic number. get sick time. dose dependent. call 'em probodies Thank you! real concrete progress reassuring hear. And, kudos helping people get appointments! know troll post actually believe that.... Plenty minimum wage workers bust ass 8-10 hours straight work people making $100k+ year spend half day reddit. really think state governments try maintain restrictions behalf people want vaccine, they're going experience riots make Summer 2020 look like series rowdy block parties. local stores also refuse honor coupons weekly specials pickup items. Placing order pickup means pay half much groceries even start tacking fees. Israel already administered one dose Pfizer vaccine 50% population. Would argue Israel ""advanced"" rest world efficacy vaccination rates? administrating vaccine develop? definitely! Pretty amazing far advancements medical technology come. Double stranded dna believe im taking personally said. pot calling kettle black situation make point article US, backed statement former US president, expect replies US. went comment section article UK made similar statement yours, would fucking crucified. overall point pretty valid, stage chose made point poorly chosen. Johnson &amp; Johnson US. not. *lot* better. lot better already lot better developed countries world. really exciting stuff. it’s mass experiment true informed consent withheld. Science isn’t religious dogma. Important conversations information censored. Saying terms trust science fact anti-science use topical buzz phrase issue  would bother documenting this? probably happened literally 1 million times world. unexpected rare. 15 minutes guideline. like staying 6ft apart etc. say less efficiently, actually given stored regular freezer temperature unlike alternatives, cheap produce, sold cost price (unlike others for-profit) actually performing well based UK numbers, think that's debateable. 

If tinfoil hat type, might wondering fact basically free vaccine competing lots profit-making vaccines part reason criticised. Ah good know! certainly might sell people will. sell someone sell people will. die someone inherit them. get robbed gun stolen someone will.

One reasons primary source crime guns military police armories simple fact can’t walk nearby Walmart pick gun instead (or nearby gun show issues would normally prevent purchase).

Like point isn’t gun buybacks magical silver bullet instantly remove crime guns. idea lowering overall prevalence amount circulation knock effects make things go across board *given time*. oh. huh. wasn't. doctor said gotten 90, that's time worry. steady 92. Ya cases getting bad do. Like wearing mask even big deal. vaccine production country. countries vaccine producers balls.

Our vaccine production EU. slowdown production increase future production capacity. ended week ago. 

During slowdown phizer decided give vaccines EU, threatening ban exports. We're getting lot now, Europe helpfull regarding vaccines.

The US helped vaccines (of course).

We partner Sinovac beginning pandemic, promising Chinese vaccine maker worked National Research Council lot. Chinese government later fucked us that, left customer vaccines.

We're big country, tenth people America has. money fund several different vaccine develoents. Yes, they’re vaccine trials right children age group. saw link thought veterinatians. I'm like, vets really think pretty highly themselves. That’s great hear! glad they’re study. would great somebody got J&amp;J vaccine wanted protection later could get one shot mRNA vaccine opposed usual two that’s needed. perfectly valid question, whenever hear ‘Well prevents hospitalization means you’ll get *mild* COVID’, think well that’s good enough opinion long term effects. Asymptomatic people getting long term effects. reservations J&amp;J company too. 
 
But can’t ask questions here, ‘just get it’ gets 1,000 upvotes. Pfizer vaccine actually developed Germany BioNTech. Pfizer handled global distribution, things need massive pharmaceutical company for. see commonly referred Pfizer/BioNTech. Moderna American ones heard covid vaccine. lol mainline bro Yes, unless actual change policy permit ONE dose, even change guidelines 2nd dose 2-3 months later, still largely 2 dose policy unless getting J&amp;J vaccine. problems earlier signed contract knew honor? seems logical Europe would leverage bargaining tools get much possible within range deal.
Anyway understand ""opposite point view"" never saw blame UK commission media (maybe useless politicians who's opinion matter anyone), shady actions mentioned lame vague statement substance political consequences.
The real controversial declarations ones wanted block exports Pfizer vaccine UK compensate lack AstraZeneca.
The vaccine works fine, less efficient Pfizer Moderna, given at-risk populations, see declaration ineficiency - besides claim provide sufficient protection South Africa variant -. Really doubt UK. 

As soon UK's order finished, UK facilities start producing doses EU. may well Q2. perhaps approval US far away produced vaccines would expire otherwise

Approval expected April according AZ (this nothing new BTW run second, US based trial FDA approval, we're waiting for). I'm aware preproduction although US production certainly geared approval given. live Korea, definitely wear masks time. ever lived Asia? gonna speed million week forever. I’m dismissing all. It’s used compare AZ Pf/B efficacy, used two doses. Lining pockets vaccine sold profit? No, still true. Latest plans EU already took delays AZ account. knew. target still June/July. Okay, &lt;1% mortality virus 'wipe us out'... fun fantasies. extremely good call vaccine standpoint.

Brexit impact vaccine standpoint. [UK bounded EU law, according EU rules regulations thus speed approve every EU member could pursuit vaccine procurement rollout simply chose UK did. realise cancelling orders elsewhere would prolong delays rolling vaccine since EU would back queue new orders? type delays literally every AZ order faced. 

No country experienced delay 60% 6 months. strong effective measure. Keep mind France needed stricter measueres keep things control countries. curfew keeps people meeting dinner French love do. curfew Bavaria certainly kept seeing people, can't even watch CL football someone there's curfew 21h. 

But brutal measure, French locked 12h day politicians talk lockdown. held responsible releasing virus world large without much timid warning.

The study found risk cross-contamination clean items washed traces virus on.

However, Dr Laird said guidance published start pandemic Public Health England (PHE) NHS regarding uniform washing based ""outdated literature"".

Ending public health emergency declarations close get, see mandates continuing people slowly stop paying attention they’ll quietly repealed. Willing bet masking continues stores time still, atleast everyone offered chance vaccine including children. sad countries access far efficient government

Well, one issue yes. Otherwise government absolute shambles. right? Yet one else investigating origin first 6 months. US various European countries moved pandemic introduction dates many months past several months due recent investigations wastewater, blood donations, etc. Double standards much? making huge assumptions there. shut economy save grandma, biggit /s Hopefully UK, Israel US.

It's absolutely disgusting. realized could paid people wage, without making jump hoops first? kept initial $2 offered another $2 incentive. UK attendance linked funding. think sickness okay yes quite judgemental.

I also think schools adapt mix kids zoom calls kids front cope (mildly) ill - want / teach small people setting, maybe could. Thanks!  Meanwhile continue export life economy saving products countries quite explicitly implicitly banned export vaccines us. 

You realise UK blocking exports you? bought first 100m doses produced there. different EU buying first 300m doses produced EU... call ""non-tobacco *hero bonus*"".   Grocery....delivery?  unlikely happen knows, Serum Institute India competent might able give AZ ton doses. Norway: closed borders quicker, preventing lot travel country. solid job high-risk list place unforgiving, goes far singling specific regions. also started vaccines early. easier autonomous economy quite rich.

Switzerland: basically screwed-up big time. lot deaths due measures within country lack border control. far vaccines go, ahead many EU countries.

The UK: got smashed like France/Spain/Italy first part pandemic, hard. got hit new variant home-grown Kent, time react. time announced happening, go full lockdown full border closure less done kept place. one worst death rates scary numbers, thanks aggressive vaccination campaign around 18m first doses given, planning fully reopen internally end July (so cautious Israel reopening already aggressive vaccination policy).

When looking things six months ago, Europe great vs USA/UK, looking now, approach vaccinations lack measures place summer lead things dragging-on even longer, putting strain people's mental health economy. could regardless label it, though. Yea, keeping date aware possible issues come covid awhile, cases dropped, people becoming vaccinated (like myself, got second dose sunday) I’ve become suspect news, something I’m usually thinking. seeming end horizon coming (how long knows though it’s coming) media needs milk cash cow proverbial udder runs dry.  would tremendous!

*I bot, action performed automatically.

However ages 18-65 first group. stop transmission, want do, need stop spreaders first. age group work apt socialize. elderly retired, quarantined without much issue months longer. 
1) stopping transmission fast stop chance variants, potentially making vaccines worthless
2) elderly quarantine, working population cannot
3) younger generation, vaccinated help support elderly (most elderly 80+ need care giver take vaccines errands)

I understand elderly highest risk group, worse immune response, able stay quarantined, ‘working’ generations continue spread virus vaccinated. also don’t know long/term effects virus could another major health issue future. think also important recognise fact government actually well though. Lord knows messed lot think going bash many, many mistakes recognise something well too. I've seen lot comments (not referring clear) fobbing achievement purely NHS ""it went well Gov directly involved"".

Certain people seem invested ""even single infection failure"" narrative see cases drop literally zero (not likely happen) they'll blame everyone else ""unsafe behavior."" may even spread diseases like flu. I'm already seeing friends advocate permanent universal mask wearing. Expect see people complaining many people ""unsafe behavior"" killed spreads flu.  Joey responsible 100k outrage? That’s honestly insane even think about. My
Mind blown measles thing I've asked remember humanity speaking numbers numbers. seems cannot understand regardless phrase it. find lives people irrelevant never find irrelevant sadly, that's exactly saying irrelevant. Everyone afraid it, much people even touch people AIDS. 

I still remember huge news story across world Princess Diana touched patient AIDS. lockdowns? ever lift those? say things could construed suggesting there's sort conspiracy covid numbers. get actually meant opposite, thats anyone understood it.

Also, one incorrectly suggested op exactly talking about. wrong. Lets move on. I'm sure point is. Nobody suggesting going eradicate corona masks. no, would willing wear mask 2 years eradicate cancer believe masking long run fact negative health impacts explored. cancer deaths fact avoidable lifestyle diet. 

You could eliminate vehicle deaths tomorrow lowered speed limit 20mph across board society decided acceptable alternative risk death worth reward efficient travel. lovely people, (not like listen data facts) proves otherwise.  happened Spanish flu.

When? thought ended 1921. flu/cold may mutation nothing close Spanish Flu long infection causes permanent damage no/few healthcare resources, win. would prefer sterilizing immunity actions people, doesn’t sound like it’s possible point. I’ll take gladly vaccine get us there.

I agree long causes permanent damage would lot like flu. point even mild asymptomatic people get long hauler, blood clots organ damage virus (much flu) I'm convinced that's ever going change. [SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related [MERS(Middle East respiratory syndrome–related also coronaviruses seem cause type damage. coronaviruses would prefer sterilizing immunity actions people, doesn’t sound like it’s possible point.

It may possible point, goal? feel like governments care that. Even states lagging behind US average much better countries. 

Could much worse. Thank you! It’s good reminded things! try really hard keep anxiety running amok, tell always successful lol. 

Also, actually didn’t know could tell vaccine different sites giving hadn’t looked appointments yet. But, went state site sure enough listed! Id get J&amp;J one option, would definitely prefer one others. Thanks reassuring response :) guess know better do, then.    find little beyond astonishing.  think ask doctor. :)  Get lies. don’t even watch CNN obvious troll.  initial trial substantial real evidence prove theory. idea, essentially. Looks good decision particular risked delaying second dose. worth taking. Im saying pandemic ongoing 2022 people still refusing get vaccinated yes.

I'm sorry, might sound selfish, people refuse get vaccine non legitimate reasons, go fuck themselves. I'm gonna throw away normalcy dumb anti-vaxxers. missed announcement. Thanks posting link. :) Gimme a, uh, liter vaccine. want us wear forever? means fill vials  excuse hit 2 mil per day average soon   God sides same. agenda neglect certain demographic give vaccine supporters.  many people fully vaccinated end may?? new predictions  Unfortunate, hope doctor gets benefit “just culture.“

Humans make mistakes. It’s inevitable. What’s important learn mistakes—especially situation conditions led mistakes—so prevent future. Checks WWII. Yeah basically. Awwwwww, hell yeah!!!! implied can't. Cases need also, sure. combination. limits entry venues unless vaccinated. ""Public decency"" seem exist US. Yep, kids day care since summer caught one cold (when pre-COVID probably one per month).  wait many people fully vaccinated end May rate??  positive news permitted here! miss memo? R would much higher (think Spanish flu). R 1.3 whatever because, mention, immunity relatively high. Consider using either glory hole, doggy-style parties masked. physically can, try distance much possible. 😂 Breakout strains likely docile future due evolutionary pressure kill hosts. looking 'new flu' coming years, regular pandemic cycle might expect. mum Covid last April, AZ first jab 2 weeks ago Friday. really poorly two days (in bed, headaches, fevers, chills) better Monday. really wish would case, indications, university changing decisions fact.  currently sell baby powder, asked.

It unsurprising yet somehow still disappointing predictably ignorant are. One way another comes back ruling government, fact happy redirect places quite telling. ""only"" Complete misinformation wear n100 respirator. I'll happy one vaccinated wear little cloth surgical masks people somehow manage whine about! flu really contagious (R 1.3), slightly epidemic threshold.  measures taken strong, even though lot people taking seriously, working home, going going bars/concerts/sports events ect. article says it’s already found 45 states, too. extent California, still, it’s already spread bit things still going direction are, seems hopeful. think you’re *deliberately* misinterpreting last comment clear. say “tend to” “they are,” completely false. There’s higher 90% vax rate Hasidic communities (and slightly higher communities), try claim otherwise you’re displaying bigotry. claim “high rates” antivax factually wrong. Well selling cost... know on, whenever I'm feeling well go work store, I'll put mask. *concerned ASKED. Message received... don’t ask wrong questions around here.  understand USA country seems get away behavior (banning vaccine exports private company). Like said, every country behaved way, Pfizer would need open 200 new factories supply world. tell Operation Warp Speed, Pfizer even take money OWS vaccine development. 1st dose sore arm, minor chills aches. fever.

2nd dose possibly worst 36 hours feeling sick life. 102.8 fever, piercing headache, muscle aches, sweating, chills, uncontrollable shivering. subsided 3 days nausea dizziness.  work? major pharmacy chains charge uninsured people flu shot. give away goodness heart. testing flu

Not true thanks playing. sure hell tried minimize importance person's death. Nah, that's unnecessarily rude telling someone put dick pants going draw attention dude.. Maybe dude's purpose, could've also slipped without noticing. easy reminder pull works people. Yeah flu magically disappeared don’t know happened........ ones thought of. I'd say nations earnestly investigating pandemic origins. Italy France probably ones genuinely so. Cruise ships burn 30-50 gallons fuel per mile Right wrong exist, even politicians hit upon chance. Sorry I'd rather mRNA, instead. They’re changing reporting mechanism, it’s reported later. They’re changing actual vaccination schedule. ridiculous? US population less 1/3 today. reminds [people complaining slow testing ramp go, right link time.  know medical personnel saying this...kind scary disconnected reality. NYS much better older methodology. Yeah, remember last summer Czech Republic declared victory virus big cerebration dinner party Prague Charles Bridge? death rate Czech Republic greater even U.S.! Tracking delays end though. Mainly due flu diagnosed covid. thing US. covid numbers got bigger bigger, flu numbers got smaller smaller. isn’t coincidence.

There tons leeway amount vaccine that's injected. really bad math? Reducing transmission 90% reducing transmission 100%. 

You're still 1/10th contagious. wear mask. old stuff great. Today feels like author paid word. Really? many countries analyzed wastewater mid 2020? know like two three... Fauci et al straight admitted lied continue lie people think we’re stupid handle truth. it’s wonder many hoaxers anti-vaxxers? Honesty needed here, badly. yell put dick back pants. surprisingly effective. polite, *draw attention them*. want thwart rules, want object attention, takes empowerment away mocking rather trying authority figure.

Hell, try whole ""throw deep insults one strikes home run"" approach it. Well, long ago evolved socially move beyond allowing types things happen enlarge. evolve socially. making logical conclusion species works together best utilize local resources space survive longest. want ""someone"" wants, objectively illogical act way allow type action occur. I'll bite level crazy, incase genuinely understand crazy. AIDS wrecked life forever basically way would die, death sentence would guarantee cut life short many years. Everyone afraid it, much people even touch people AIDS. matter young, old, anything. 

COVID19 tiny mortality rate, among young people rounding error zero. Many people even know it, harmless people. 

Two completely different things. think we’re going accept something truth: Even achieve immunity tomorrow, mutations eventually arrive find way infect people cause symptoms degree - already have! see vaccine escape, eventually, somewhere world - likely developing world next year. happened Spanish flu every pandemic. definitely going become endemic, means (most) infected coronavirus descendant version point next decade. long infection causes permanent damage no/few healthcare resources, win. would prefer sterilizing immunity across people, doesn’t sound like it’s possible point. I’ll take gladly vaccine get us there. least teachers seem political support. rest us ""essential"" workers any. Plus never got work home all. Add official guidance released day inauguration PCR test high cycle threshold (40) 90% false positive rate... Well almost like flu cases colds viral infection bring called covid. Maybe busy containing century pandemic ones planet face testing, treatment protocol, diagnosis, genome, etc. take smoking jump line.  mean, yeah, way none countries interested even find patient zero. Everyone busy trying manage actual effects spread virus.

Most countries still know patient zero important know things enter infect populace. see anyone making news that.

What ridiculous position take. Holy shit, actually browsed sub (outside daily discussion thread) first time long time, literally half posts tagged ""good news"". also remember US country world. 

If really conspiracy involve almost countries working together secret give fake information.  learned sign language, might possibly eradicate COVID-19.

I saw movie people use sign language communicate monsters would attack whenever made noise. believe movie called Place One Could Talk. work instructions say 10 days second shot. could read data available Russia, Switzerland Netherlands 1. find unusual case
2. sequence genome
3. find mutations
4. publish! idiotic. goal get everyone vaccinated right? Well, tell people can’t go back normal lives even get vaccinated, you’re actively discouraging people vaccinated. You’re giving people incentive get experimental vaccine (it’s safe I’ve vaccinated already) virus isn’t deadly vast majority people. hell wrong idiots? need to. 

&amp;#x200B;

Enjoy summer! *exact* thing.

We lost term ""slacker"" 80's 90's different meaning. Back 1910's punch ""raw dogging"" also vaccines widespread. Widespread vaccination reduces transmission give virus less chances vaccine evasive variants. NOBODY suggesting taking masks 10, 20, even 40% populace vaccinated. However, needs clear masks eventually come get certain point, implying can’t cause people lose trust. Memphis Louisville airports basically closed end last week. primary hubs FedEx UPS, respectively. vaccines simply get places last week, there's less give right now. It'll go back up.

Last week also slow: people snowed unable physically get vaccination sites. (or yesterday, really, since vaccinations lag day two) problem sites goods.  hope sooooo. Mid 20s healthy urban area Missouri. governor decided give vaccines rural area covid deniers voted 🙄 Same, count catching covid, single flu cold year I'm really bad getting sick.

I even work public face face people still get sick. around (CA) numbers really starting decline. decline surely due large part vaccination efforts rolling since mid-Jan. Based feeling around think new variant game changer. bet may make Pfizer/Moderna vaccines slightly less effective, still think we'll COVID summer.  always_has_been_meme.jpg Hear, hear! sub-Q instead IM medication meant IM works well. got mine cvs 5 bucks per capita death rate higher UK. uk locked much harder likely Czechia reach faster UK vaccines.  can’t smart know exactly someone means. us ask questions. mean dang, somehow even knew implying question better me. must smartest person internet. Could people flu thought Corona? elderly Israel already vaccinated, worry masks? pretty sure place. Preach it. Lol Yep. play Ultimate frisbee...and summer, think get vaccine I'll playing. Can't stay shutdown forever. mean many viruses already could catch? mRNA nanoparticles. Read previous article wrote manufacturing process. 1. really overestimating much people receive social security.

2. Saying ""why myself"" great way show got argument left.

3. Since asked nicely, [here's damn bring need work, talking people needing go work; specifically asked socializing in-person people live Among Americans ages 18 29, 45% said past week socialized people live maintaining social distancing, according new survey Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project. highest rate among age groups, ages 30 44 trailing slightly almost two times rate age groups. Among Americans ages 45 64, 28% reported socializing without social distancing. Americans 65 least likely (21%) hung people live social distancing. 

So, yes. Spoiler alert: preconceived notions ""the old give two shits"" wrong. Wow. Shocker.

Now stop ranting online things understand wait turn vaccine like rest us. LOL yeah it’s totally exact thing. Thank wonderful analogy, you’ve totally changed viewpoint I’m sure you’ve changed many minds well /s

But something agree on—get vaccine ASAP! given though. we've seen UK, cases soared last autumn created new variant transmissible. could get see variants covered vaccine. whilst reduce viral load go masks early could create new variant fairly quick. 

Needs take mask vaccinated 70%+ are, cases low. Citation needed. countries kept cases low- exceptions, rule. original LA Times article doctor quotes says ""The Devil Here"" bad strain much worse going become. 

But hey. Absolutely nobody expects people Covid subreddit read anything comment on, assure you. top this, minimum wage proposal getting dropped $11 per hour instead $15, remind grocery workers little care. interesting one hand plays like fear mongering. hand, experts adding biological reason (in addition social, economic, mental health reasons) ending lockdowns mask mandates soon possible. covid control, mask mandates lockdowns may bodies harm good long run. 

Your body supposed catch fight bacteria viruses literally every day. limit exposure may deplete immune response, even wear mask forever eventually exposed “garden variety” germs -and could harmful normal. Uh... scarlet fever twice strep kid. concerned? De Santiago starting make lot people look pretty dumb. good roll pig shit fix this. almost like forcing people wash hands stay away others sick stops viruses spreading! Hey bud, job got 2 extra dollars 6 weeks 8 months ago! No, gonna matter fast government organizes vaccination spots. could *literally* billion doses, speed million doses week, would still get us (Italy) almost two years vaccinate everyone wants vaccinated  Yes, Texas hardest hit, snowed ton everywhere well. got close foot northeast. R value wouldnt go 0.8ish, jump down, jump 1.1 1 week. Looking numbers, 3 days plateu trend. 3 days. Look PAs 7 day average 2 weeks ago. plateauing caused days snow week (and plateu big jump, data dump also skewed numbers week). see testing numbers way right now, indication lagging positives. Im guessing 7 week average around 75 80k now, still bad, worried rise daily average see weeks time.

Edit add: I'm boat April anything like that. think Julyish numbers really really good. commenting there's reason say sky falling looking days. Please follow people listed Twitter learn COVID endemic matter actions take people. Remember COVID-19 originated animals remain long vaccination. 

We learn live whether like not. Calling - they're gonna first lift mask mandate without getting shit it. I'm hoping work remotely full time. current job let might look elsewhere.

My work cryptic it. People asking, feel like waiting see becomes industry standard option industry.

Preferribly allowed work remotely anywhere want I'd flock fast. Instead falling blatant misinformation constantly. Could morons wait see companies Governments say.

AZ come strongly denied this. large western nation even tried?! Provide evidence see old give two shits. can't count work younger generation quarnating either work die, opposed older people social security, quarantine ease.

Basically society give two shits harm younger generation, sacrifice life them? shoot support since would make less likely die? I'm driving find partners outside tribe, genetic diversity issue. article says tribal identity patrilineal. men could partner outside women yet children would still members tribe, perpetuating group need resort incest. That's typically small human groups work; marry siblings recessive disorders overtake us. Unfortunately, last man tribe died, children surviving women considered members. nothing genetic diversity everything traditions tribal identity. liked seeing people’s numbers gradually go down. “It’ll take us 12 years vaccinate everyone!” “Now it’ll take 7 years vaccinate everyone!” “Now it’s going take 18 months give everyone shots!” pls explain us cases gone dramatically practically every single country world imposing lockdown population? one million passengers sailed 30 large cruise ships waters British Columbia way Alaska 2019. Regulations far stricter Washington State Alaska, incentivizes cruise industry dump wastes Canada, said Michael Bissonnette West Coast Environmental Law. ban cruise ships 100 passengers due COVID-19 pandemic would ideal opportunity Canada harmonize regulations US states, Bissonnette told Weather Network. makes complete sense, thank you. last thing drop compared opening schools small businesses. It’s one highest preventative measures impact vs disruption scale deprioritized compared restrictions. yes eventually masks go. going “mutant” clicks? Insane. Palestinians receive health services Palestinian Authority, opted use Russian vaccine. Israeli purview.

Nevertheless, Israel donated vaccines health workers, planning vaccinate [100,000 Palestinians work Everyone take first vaccine available them. Protection better protection later, especially since cases declining (so chances getting covid becoming smaller day).

4 months ago, people would thrilled vaccine ""only"" 66% effective preventing mild covid, close 100% effective preventing hospitalizations deaths. 

J&amp;J couple important advantages compared Pfizer Moderna:

* single dose (good people like needles hard time making second appointment).
* stored higher temperatures, easier distribute. **Can vaccinated people spread virus?**

Any answer get either ""yes"" ""no"" wrong, now. ""maybe, probably not"", going way long time.

In order answer question scientifically, would require ""challenge study"" vaccinated unvaccinated people deliberately exposed virus see transmission occurs.

The ethical concerns deliberate exposure prevent us performing studies humans. reason vaccine trials took long, can't deliberately infect people see need hospitalization die. 

(EDIT: Well, looks like [spoke studies monkeys results look [*really show strong immunity, [sterilizing multiple vaccine types. However, unlikely sterilizing immunity would found vaccinated humans, even get sterilizing immunity all. still good news. 

Also, notice reputable person talking subject always says ""may able spread"", ""maybe"", ""we know if"". that's small chance vaccinated people able spread virus. big chance. Doctors, scientists, regulators careful language subject, would argue they're careful. said, say ""vaccinated people cannot spread virus"", find situations vaccinated people spread virus, [that would end worse hedge least me, way they're framing seems pretty reasonable, put shoes.

That said, seem [saying I've 


**Additional Thoughts/Cool likely cheaper vaccine made redditor.

[Delayed second doses might least though evidence mRNA vaccine trials suggest 6 weeks better least acceptable. problem wait longer second dose, therefore, full protection. says maximum interval doses, [Pfizer says 6 

[A happy may prevent severe [mRNA vaccines 100% SA variant, *doesn't* [mean we'll definitely need like [thegracefuldork's prediction vaccine previous prediction. ""rosier"", better.

**Which vaccine get?**

When someone asks favorite beer is, answer always same.

It's one front me.

So get first vaccine can, differences pretty minor.

**Booster questions think about, answers**

(note: there's difference ""boost"" ""booster"" needs understood.)

(also, what's term mixture sequences, heterogenous? doubt term overthinking?)

(also also, I'm convinced we're definitely going need boosters, fun think about.)

Could booster shot replace second dose prime/boost regimen?

Should booster shot use one sequence mRNA (or identical spike proteins), both/multiple?

For future vaccines, sequence/spike prime/boost different? four spikes/sequences, would make sense two each, four each?

How much trust mutation modeling here? anticipate future mutations include them? good enough yet?

Do need give non-booster doses people recovered infection?

Could ""stretch"" doses mRNA booster priming vaccine that's easier manufacture, maybe less effective (like ChAdOx1), boost mRNA booster? Could better faster prime current mRNA sequence boost updated ChAdOx1? Could maybe [this US?]( vaccines reduce infections, someone gets infection getting vaccinated, fewer reduced symptoms. currently seems also true post vaccination infection known variants. pretty sure reduction indication they'll reduce spread. Why? We're pretty sure reduce spread people truly asymptomatic barely spread virus, people mild symptoms spread slightly more, people go develop severe symptoms spread virus really well. 

In words: reduction symptoms least correlated reduction ability spread virus. Vaccines reduce symptomatic infections symptoms get infected. Therefore, vaccines reduce spread.

If people develop immunity via clearing infection, subsequent variant exposed broaden immune response, likely without disease (symptoms). they'll good broad immunity variety variants, seems likely indication catch spread virus well future. thing happens someone vaccinated exposed new variant. immunity broadened strengthened subsequent exposure, likely without symptoms. remember, many people less likely spread virus, pretty unlikely reduced level spread sufficient sustain virus way seen past year. variant becomes somewhat widespread, it'll hit resistance pretty quickly. become widespread, Yay!

I'm totally willing mind changed new information though, take gospel.

The best links starred. *   First thing thought saw current post. Go figure. efficacy jumped 85%? thought first announced it, 72% efficacy rate (which still good) I’m wondering numbers keep changing? ask someone cautious like Fauci, no. I'm putting two cents I've seen regularly read covid news. (hopefully sound like armchair scientist I'm trying be).

Should vaccine distribution goals put major manufacturers stay are, enough vaccine every adult America summer. Given good chunk people say want vaccine, means could get bit sooner. 

If curious actual dates one; experts still disagree vaccinations vary wildly area. best guess information I've seen mostly normal summer, *very least* friends/family vaccinated - even means wearing mask movie theater, etc. Unionized grocery worker here. union fights hard negotiate health benefits end stagnant wages/other benefits. Universal healthcare would give much power back unions would give us chance negotiate higher wages without sacrificing health benefits. many people getting wrong. Vaccine efficacy *relative* risk reduction. Questions like person's *absolute* risk.

Everyone's absolute risk different. person WFH year, wearing masks, seeing family etc low absolute risk. Front line workers obviously higher risk.

This 66% efficacy figure means get vaccine, risk drops one-third got vaccine. matter absolute risk was, cut two thirds. real world situation teacher killed student friendly fire situation?

No, thankfully - nobody's fucking stupid act suggestion.

The solution simple - make materially harder legally carry gun. mental health checks, restrict carry permits - shit that's already suggested angry, ignorant small penis gun nuts like resistant without counter argument besides 'muh rights!'.

It's coming buddy - millenials subsequent generations tired seeing peers gunned reason. NRA losing grip, despite influx Russian funding. Might well start stocking up! Biannual actually mean both, doesn’t really make sense, it’s true. Biennial means every two years. virus keeps going on. another 5 weeks could well doubled close it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* zune one point, totally loved thing haha get downvote. perfectly legitimate question, taken perspective curiosity rather fearmongering. understand viruses? near future things open, going find theater full 100 people never vaccinated virus. chances randomly collected 100 people fit categories right near 0.

Also, Covid R0 around 4. idea one asymptomatic person could spread every person 100 person theater dumb. well, article specifically references US, statement heard said former US president, figured would apparent comment talking US, globe. Apologies confusion. Always good another vaccine out. crazy even emergency use authorization much bureaucracy Speaking myself, fuck date comes get vaccine. cautious last year get vaccinated mindset changes lot. eat indoors, go bars friends, fly, that. don’t give two shits see another person without mask. People want one done, people can't/won't return second dose. Personally I'll passing (if to), getting one options. enough people vaccinated mask mandates need go. still wear mask want hospitals clear cases deaths dropped mask mandate needs end. think media coverage societal attitude towards St. Patrick's Easter really interesting year. city, first pandemic-related event cancellation annual dying river green St. Patrick's, Easter first ""tHe ViRuS tAKe hOliDayS"" moment, though major gathering outside Orthodox countries. So, eventually, rate decrease cases US needs slow down, mathematically speaking. Even everything right, we're going hit baseline somewhere. suspect baseline progressively get lower slower rate continue vaccinations.

Any thoughts guesses baseline is? 50k cases day? 20k? wrong thoughts baseline trends cases look? Stick me. Loud noises super anxiety inducing, right ya (ADHD/auditory processing disorder here). Still interested see MMR theory plays out. restrictions always stop gap measure interventions could get pandemic control. enough population steadfastly refused get vaccinated, else would holding for? there's nothing else coming pike near future end transmissions/disease severity precautions delaying inevitable. Yeah, 810 SEK/day, people make significantly that. also apply money Försäkringskassan. know, bullets flying around randomly, would probably hide bed, lol, get full body armor delivered. pandemic normal life risk. downside would benefit Covid-19's home country, China. fear-mongering point spend ton time worrying tbh. Vaccines became available public December, means nobody got second dose January, means even tiny population health care workers got vaccine first even affected guideline mid April. summer, data could prompt update guidelines, wider vaccination could make COVID exposures rare enough people even affected quarantine guidelines anyway. think stressing lot something good chance never affecting you. live 10 miles NYC, situation really pretty apocalyptic first month so. literally trucks full dead bodies piling outside morgues. know going happen, hoping praying least keep hospitals overflowing valid response. Remember, Italy even worse. hospitals overflow, many people could otherwise saved died. Well, hate break bad news wishing something thing anymore affects nothing reality.  


How removing mask mandates going end pandemic? NY actually pretty easy - drop new appointments every single day, usually within next week. top it, people know eligible able get scheduled - first shot Sunday There's lot confusing info/nonsense around that.

It seems like hit point couple weeks ago US inject doses faster produced. Overall we've given 79% vaccine shots delivered, really good remember always overhead associated getting doses manufacturer's loading docks injection site.

If start seeing stories significant numbers doses expiring, something concerned about. that's I'm at. We're close everything I'd rather stay course keeping recommended regimen. least stuff I've found concern trying achieve short term gains getting 2nd dose recommended supposed give longevity immunity. I'll patient little longer long term gain. testing eventually found unsafe? 

Then would unlucky. Catching COVID high-risk much unlucky. COVID death rate people 80 like 10%. None 90 vaccines development dangerous that. government official empowered make cost/benefit choice you? choice belong There's reason process is.

Yes, reasons 1) fear getting sued 2) bureaucracy 3) tolerance allowing deaths. 3rd reason apply case, ""a deaths"". lot deaths. Urgency important.

Either way, believe *freedom* general principal, large part vaccine-authorization timeline failure. Honest question... we're heading variant, likely already spreading quite while? seems case variants. point, reporting variants ""alarming"" based nothing speculation seems clickbait-y *at best*. Fair enough! hope right.  


Just clear, mean 7-day average. 


RemindMe! 2 weeks Yeah, actually cure HIV. relatively new, avoid factual information, might heard yet.

The problem covid spreads easily, puts everyone risk. good example wedding last year resulted covid deaths three people, none attended wedding. we're still debating safety precautions year pandemic. heard late March early April would big one use makeshift Covid hospital beds burn wards! TIL   U.S medically advanced rest world.

The virus sequenced China. Phizer developed vaccine Germany. AstraZenca developed UK. Johnson Johnson co-developed Belgium U.S. current viable vaccine candidates, Moderna developed exclusively U.S.

The reason U.S administrating vaccines many countries matter medical technological superiority, matter wealth. U.S resources secure hundreds millions doses vaccines currently distributing even proven effective. many officials put it, ""If lose bet lose money, win save lives"". Many countries luxury risk losing bet invest large amount capital unproven vaccine. 

If U.S decides ""come rescue"" parts world sharing Medical Information, though transfer wealth. I’ve seen claim before, never source.  Hang there. I’m 2L currently.

The team dismissed lab leak theory without providing solid evidence (with exception lab well-run secured, etc.).

However, Director General stated briefing team's press conference, “I want clarify hypotheses remain open require study.” data necessarily meaningful data. many medical regulators don’t problems one vaccine reason. Perhaps it’s case data made available UK countries Depends counting. time everyone gotten second dose obviously same. time everyone gets first dose (which, evidence shows, quite effective itself) would go month US delayed 2nd dose 8-10 weeks. \~260M adults currently. 45M least one dose. Assuming 80% adoption rate, need another 165M doses first dose everyone wants one. \~125M doses expected end March, another \~130M April May, could give everyone first dose mid-April, start working second doses. OTOH keep current dose scheduling, it'll mid-May so.

IMO thing keep offering second dose medical personnel,65+ high risk groups. everyone else, first-dose second-dose two months. 

&amp;#x200B;

This assuming J&amp;J approved, J&amp;J, Moderna Pfizer actually keep schedules they've talking about. floodgates opening, they're full-force yet. Could live, yes close 100% compliance workplaces, schools stores etc, people walking street. Exactly, Squash vaccines chance mutate something that's far deadly. longer people keep passing around, chances get worse. envy y'all. According calculations, I'm due get mine sometime next year 2022 Yeah serious cold streak break. Feeling blessed even option get back person games sooner later. 

12 months felt like 12 years. realise sheer gravity restrictions uk? 

It’s “just mask year”. It’s illegal leave house months without “valid reason”. 

We’ve biggest load human rights violations since Second World War. beat flu? No. all. It’s coming straight back since lives mutates animals too. Pfizer’s vaccine general much effective AZ. It’s case, 4 weeks 1 shot (when Pfizer’s jab meant second dose 3 weeks) AZ slightly effective (within margin error) preventing hospitalisation. data essentially meaningless terms comparing vaccines adult population vaccinated right now. 65.

It’s case, 4 weeks 1 shot (when Pfizer’s jab meant second dose 3 weeks) AZ slightly effective (within margin error) preventing hospitalisation. data essentially meaningless terms comparing vaccines see semantic argument. see you’re saying. I’d add say it’s religious reasons, don’t mean terminal cause can’t tied religion. mean there’s religious mandate vaccinate, Hasidic Jewish religious authority believes it’s forbidden anti-Judaism (except already anti vax reasons therefore believes erroneously it’s dangerous). Witnesses specific dogma modern medicine Jews share. Hasidic Judaism encourages modern evidence based medicine, it’s access education technology isn’t outside community. 

It’s true minority communities well, religious (Ukrainian immigrants, well poor Black communities). 

Fella correct! Right back achya, hope good day don’t mean fight!

FL forced back last sept prioritize them. read story cause know make cry. Anyone know go fund me? actually almost exactly half US population old enough get vaccination (16+, 260m last remember). I'm willing bet vast majority restrictions gone end May. Maybe indoor mask mandates stay, way governors ignore public pressure force people stay inside another summer. It’s like want people stop taking serious. devil already here? F nonsense. Genuine question: teachers always insist making literally *everything* them? way talk, think kamikaze pilots rather people bachelor's degrees making 6 figures time they're 40 (in state anyway).

But doubt anyone involved know upgraded HVAC filters well  said true, finding origin COVID-19 important prevent us prepare next pandemic. another pandemic. scientists understand this. New York Times piece Fauci going 5 shows day, bunch celebrities.    Politics...

Yeah, right concerned. strongly disagree. fact fact developed UK gave huge edge made seem like lot better vaccine actually is, especially data released . best medical regulators world, US problems it. addition African countries halted rollout. don’t see “disinformation” there.

The CA website options sign walk appointment, seems like would better option use.  That’s debunked going eliminate COVID. way eliminate flu. still lots cases hospitalization, nearly enough substantial. Better treatments turn simply annoyance anything else. There's equation that.  Depends are. haven’t able find Clorox wipes since start pandemic. you’re lucky you’ll get one every six months. Probably true, noticed dramatic drop flu cases? It’s really interesting question. found ZDoggMD discusses viral interference. Basically, addition children school (big influenza spreaders—not much covid), decreased hemispheric travel, increased infectivity, he’s saying co-infection viruses happens much less frequently might imagine somehow, infection one respiratory virus causes infection another less likely. knew earlier pandemic evidence suggested covid-19 could spread frozen food packaging. clue research says though. That’s good. Demand high means likelihood herd immunity higher, right? hope get rid masks sometime near future.

- UK allow AZ export vaccines EU, effective export ban per definition;

- fact helping ever vaccine deliveries, costing European lives, despite EU contract vaccines come UK plants well EU plants;

- AZ since trial data submitted they've clusterfuck publicly left right, countries pilling fuck ups, approving vaccines, questioning promises deliver;

- UK practicing vaccine nationalism, per definition;

And like I'm pointing out, better frame nationalist european (what ever means, group 27 countries see nationalist).

They're lying say want deny freedoms. literal purpose stuff deny freedoms maybe people feel justified, many people obviously don't. throw people jail agree plan laid government deny freedoms. 1/4 population already first shot believe, I’ll bet they’ll move timeline even sooner. prove wrong show evidence exports? mean focused wording executive order, reality neither US UK export vaccines manufacture. No. People still get flu. written corona. Wouldn’t cool got mRNA vaccine beat flu killed two birds shit? best vaccine either sure feel.

However I'd like know idiot EU decided buy huge pile available vaccines moment possible, generous amount money. disaster cost hundreds billions euros hey, spared exchange. One reasons evolutionary trade-off killing host transmission bad business. happening here. Also bad business transmissible symptoms develop. fact, transmission occurs shortly shortly symptoms develop, meaning virulence seems little impact transmission.

I'm sure predict virus evolve. transmissible variants likely develop (and already have), know assume eventually inverse relationship virulence see examples.

I'm expert though, I'd happy proven wrong. reading done given impression really something great understanding though. FDA warned pcr tests catch variants:

**Genetic Variants SARS-CoV-2 May Lead False Negative Results Molecular Tests Detection reason well? people help us reach herd immunity way. mutates slowly, also considerably contagious. Deny want, there's reason public health experts inclined err side caution variants potential escape. Wearing masks distancing reopening small price pay, needs done cases drop significantly.

My original undergrad major economics, go lecturing economic impact stimulus. Concerns significant inflation something like borderline hysterical, surprising considering rest people's reactions completely reasonable evidence-based guidance. Hasn’t mutation circulation since may 2020? hired one company federal I.t contract 2018. lost bid long term extension transitioned new company based different state. wanted option work home since used laptops agency strict CTR teleworking. Well covid new company full time teleworkers. suppose thankful still job miss office seeing friends. suppose would lost even without covid hope okay! great able get appointment ❤️ Immuno-compromised people figured exist world can't get flu vaccine, flu exists. Maybe looks like staying home, maybe looks like dying concept like call ""personal risk assessment."" Either way, figure COVID, too. Like fully 100% open NPIs? seems far away rate UK vaccinating, also close. bad! much EU invested vaccine research/development production please (so EU invested contract). Including individual member states investments, count investment EU production well.

In addition this: much research money EU went Oxford University last 30 years? surprise way basically financed bulk research az/oxford vaccine based on. looks you’re anti vax. wasting time. continue human garbage. Bye. Eh living breadbasket states things wide open they’ll kill achieve immunity regardless. hopefully research prove true midly most. Also hope India's massive vaccination effort prevent worst accurate. Remember , said thing back December respect Q1 doses turned around said ""oops"" couple weeks later. known would fall short then. pardon , believe word company says. news folks grappling cash cow mooving onto pastures (forgive series awful puns) burden proof scientific community prove vaccinated people *can* transmit virus substantial numbers, want pretend that’s real possibility I’m vaccinated.

I get first shot Monday. I’ll wear mask it’s required, I’m whatever want vaccinated people two weeks second shot, unless hard research proves otherwise. Fauci, April, nobody wants vaccine: \*surprised pikachu face\* This, add think simple examples like this. R value wildly different every country, viruses wildly different every season. seasonal flu dies every summer places, springing back small 'reserve' somewhere world still survive. R value every virus lone individual stranded far civilization always 0. thing ""intrinsic R value"". definition *specific time place* based observation.  people virus infects regardless whether fucks chances mutate worse strains like South Africa one. goes show damn infection SARS-CoV-2 truly is. 

If one knows anything diagnostics, would know reported COVID cases molecular diagnoses. three genetic regions targeted. cross-react common human coronaviruses let alone influenza. one region cross reacts SARS-CoV-1. Basically impossible explanation. Poll came people likely say won’t get vaccine white republicans. harder group sway think commercial restrictions (concerts, sporting events, flights) might best strategy convince estimates Infection Fatality Rate, which's different Case Fatality Rate. IFR's based estimated actual infections, including people never seek healthcare; CFR's based actual observed cases people who've come contact healthcare. So, IFR definitely lower CFR. COBRA $1100 per month. fucking insane atrocious. hope feeling hopeful fall read shit went spiral Belgian production site producing vaccines exported outside EU, Canada, Malaysia also US UK. British folk became outraged EU threatened block exports. become outraged depend EU's production? 

For big failure, EU's vaccine production sure seems mighty important global scale.  Exactly. failing deliver EU. help lot people call diarrhea vomiting ""stomach flu"" different supply chain costs, AZ legally obliged offer cost stipulated contract Oxford uni. Men children die. saying guy would’ve it’s possible unlike case woman That’s reach phase “remember, kids can’t vaccinated yet...”
The writing wall.  Well that's good..it'll help get sick every year. make concerned post-covid world restrictions lifted, population could ""influenza-naive"" population existed long time. Yup, normal summer please (well, rest foreseeable future) 😅 put shit 2 liter send out. I'm planning wearing mask I'm around people rest life, find report back you. Uh, what? wear mask everywhere look forward getting vaccine, never voted Republican life. Nice assumptions, though.

Impeccable service record multiple pandemics, yet really fucked saying worst possible things people one right front door. Friendly reminder said idiots told narrative people trusted positions authority Jesus H Christ.

Should even respond this? troll, right?

In case not, someone literally 2 years younger cannot deduce meant lessons viruses general replicate.

And critical thinking skills, take information apply related situations. receive enough vaccines vaccinate 75% population end June.

Nope. Keep dreaming. look countries like germany, soooo much worse guys.

We vaccinated 130k people today, nothing comparison  90 degree day stands full fans sweltering masks. Yeah...you’ll sell game two people avoid it. That's early data suggests prevents severe hospitalizations. nearly useless South African variant one really knows effective studies poorly done. Better nothing suppose. Everyone downvoting welcome take it, means. It’s example. gave examples. asked questions original commenter. think mean reply them.

Not sure ASKING QUESTION = providing disinformation. comment didn’t provide information, asked information. It’s pretty funny every “relaxing restrictions” model sharp upward curve everyone going suddenly attend massive orgy restrictions taken away. age 75, 15% age 85. that's high-end estimate. boyfriend met pandemic. entirety relationship other’s houses, save couple times early outdoor dining got cold. got second dose yesterday I’m 2 weeks past mine. 2 weeks actually go “normal” dates cannot *wait*. Lol. 'Greedy' 'shit bed procurement'? UK alone spent money whole EU

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* flu transmissible surfaces COVID? Maybe ""useless"" cleaning sanitizing they're COVID actually helps flu? flu mostly airborne transmission well? Health departments receive funding federal state governments provide services free/dirt cheap, even conservative states. may realize it, lot federal state programs free things like flu shots, STD testing, women’s health screening, etc. state even free PrEP.

For instance, here’s [Florida DOH](http://lee.floridahealth.gov/newsroom/2020/11/2020-11-06-november-2020-influenza-outreach-schedule.html) free flu shots past November.  Yes course, I'm one damned dirty Brits defending Astrazeneca costs...even though never said word defence, fact even agreed made potentially conflict contracts simultaneously keep. also said UK government culpable mismanaging pandemic early on, strange thing rampant nationalist admit eh?

You really reading whatever want posts justify position. end day might 'nationalist European' (which never accused of, matter makes sense, exercise reading comprehension), certainly sound like harbor unhealthy hatred towards British. Looking post history bit obsession you. Maybe calm keep things perspective.  best find fire though. Source please. wonder terms offered Argentina compare offered Israel. Israel notoriously fast accommodating Pfizer secure vaccine, paid off. work senior housing, think it'll ongoing thing flu season work. certainly appreciated getting flu even old last year. mean, say now, information comet confirm this. matter point. [The Wikipedia says roughly average age. certainly might wrong, where're getting numbers? companies face massive productivity losses due constant annual flu infections

Is assumption true? think places, cold flu season worst annoyance, major problem. there’s something “easy” like UV sterilization switch use outside fresh air HVAC system, businesses might go it, anything requires changing way work one day next harder sell. It’s like Sweden. Take deep breath. probably going make miserable. would talk doctor would better picture situation.  Well maybe Germany need close borders morons bought vaccines. corona virus spread Flu Cries Teacher german envious disappointed government  completely agree, I’d take signal intend use global manufacturing fulfill EU order good news. Probably 180 million end, every dose counts! **licensing agreement** Oxford AZ signed May. production level expected Q4 2020 (30m vaccines) delivered Q1 2021 (40m), production level expected Q1 (90m vaccines) delivered Q2, production level expected Q2 (180m) delivered Q3 (170m).

So 0 vaccines planned Q3? Well still 1998 9th grade biology, granted didnt pay much attention im pretty sure didnt teach covid 19 worse seasonal flu, bet either. bullshit! spent lot time money paying writers come fictional ideas got there. Maybe frozen meat somewhere that's China? Maybe ice cream! knows!? Shock, horror! seems face masks work! They’re trying avoid unnecessary increase cases would occur fully removed restrictions early. also lots changes made June group meetings allowed small gatherings. also take several months vaccinate rest people require it. Nah, don’t waste time check profile I’m ready troll hard spy.    Virology vitriol Sure did. Yes. 100% okay jump line opinion. Wait turn. Especially they’re still vaccinating old people risk. Yes, agreed. effective. It’s effective options US already access to. I’m gonna put 2 weeks notice second get second dose. Tired WFH Zoom shit. always tell people compare to. Know someone vapes? Well everything see lungs get around small room real quick.

People seem think breath goes 2 inches vanishes... nah.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Loving recent vaccine news. 

I’m gonna excited day treatments move forefront discussion.  make mind deliveries already  Hmm, funny. checked 1 month old profile, check mine? could wrong. Israel keeps trying flatten curve racing vaccinate everyone. Israel start vaccinating kids age six (which seems long way off) Israel knocked another 15% population contention spreading. vastly untrue removed misinformation. death rate nowhere near 30% age bracket. Contained? No. threat flu(or less)? Almost certainly. idiots trying burn snow attempt ""prove"" snow isnt real. Venn Diagram groups USA, point, goes without aaying... good get second dose, remember [data shows high protection starting weeks first dose, maybe even higher 90% efficacy. feel way less worried Covid even though second dose delayed What? ages 66-79 Germans hope vaccinated, except frontliners? logic behind decision? Well no, low transmission index lift mask mandates” 

That’s pretty significant they’re going based index outright lifting restrictions. Yes, meant large number people would died flu year didn't, died covid first. incredibly clear context. taking control vaccines bought people.

Thats case, EU paid vaccine same. Funny restrictions suppress Covid since flu Covid share mode transmission. wonder relabeled flu? mean, hoard plastic bags?

I done screwed already forgetting reusable, least make sure get second use. literally spent minutes looking it

That's problem...

I'd recommend reading actual papers vaccine, rather making mind editorialised media. Cases today (ever slightly) appears Texas may backlog. Still, hospitals small decline. almost one disease several times virulent other. know, exactly scientists warning early 2020. guys gone mental nonsense. 

AZ denied problems. burden proof scientific community prove vaccinated people *can* transmit virus substantial numbers

My wife fully vaccinated. not. comorbidities likely would poorly infected. me, burden proof proven can't transmit virus.

Likewise, I'm vaccinated, I'm still going wear mask take precautions (unless proven can't transmit virus) least time vaccine fully available anyone. It’s beginning end:) come Lol. I’m virologist bunch virologist friends. 

We really want go margaritas. don’t fuck us spreading virus around.  go back high school biology. Yeah believe AZ also tougher first dose recall unlike MRNAs thought COVID ""short-hand"" disease ""COVID = COronaVIrus Disease"" coronavirus virus?

I could wrong tho! does, used words Already? It’s year. You’re going start seeing optimism elsewhere shortly. death rate literally nose dived within last days. tracking case rate decline anticipating death rate decline, knew early could optimistic. highly doubt COVID. I’ve tested weekly long period time now, haven’t single case facility. Overall, county cases limited risk much possible patients. know nurses you’re describing, however. side effects 1st dose mild comparison theirs. fucking called (not degree) October. Israel's cases rising slowly going 35%+ populated fully vaccinated US cases declining rapidly 5% fully vaccinated. See last US President would treatments move forefront? seems like vaccines make covid longer much concern, thereby reducing need treatments. public know smart enough realize masks don’t need cone now

Hang around thread little longer. aren’t. certainly wouldn’t assume virus would go direction, would surprised strain virus produced milder disease, infectiousness remaining same, didn’t advantage one produced severe disease. said virus mild even asymptotic people. It’s apparent deadly lottery enter catch that’s scary. guess massive variation effects would complicate things.

Disclaimer: also expert. Using logic nothing beyond daily deliveries around 3 million.  got scheduled tomorrow!! Thanks much info! site accurate give second shot date tomorrow? Surely practical ship corners country cold supply chain limited? Plus improved efficacy Janssen probably make desirable. Oh thought literally said claimed lol 9 unlucky number It’s awful, I’m at. 

If got depressed filled feeling every single death...I would probably joined different death count now. 

Humans aren’t equipped handle comprehend massive amounts horrible news, suffering, devastation. Surprised SF list already. adjusted new cades per 100k 5.2, less 7 maximum. Especially we're thinking first dose ~85% effective, rather ~65% like before. Russian friend tole basically anyone Moscow get vaccine want like friends vaxed already. son’s elementary class went back distance learning close contact covid positive person. I’m super worried personal risk, teachers great number staff least initiated vaccination. making wonder - problem rest school year, maybe even next, since kids aren’t/won’t vaccinated? point, quarantine rules change (like next fall)? made three weeks. Yeah. definitely wear flu season get sick future masks kinda pain. know it’s saving lives it’s bad. I’m Asia masks already pretty common pre pandemic it’s gonna accepted US now. concerns address genuinely ask. they're asking advice give piss make dig beliefs. Compare Mondays Tuesdays week week trend look flat increasing. It’s reporting. latest SAGE (UK) report suggests 4m week 22nd March, England alone. Lol ok... pathetic care fellow human beings. idiots afraid everything ""mUh RiGhTs"" luckily still right moron so... Similar. happen work hospital, got mine early. us really lucky. Time magazine article 2018 shows less year decrease life expectancy scientific proof. paper provided peer-reviewed study shows _greater one year drop_ _three year drop_ people color.

The high horse I'm called science. place people like follow science.  Cases, deaths, hospitalizations going irregardless. open things back make booster shot strains suspected possibly resistant vaccines already there. state local health department offered free flu shots forever without insurance. insurance plans cover free. US? so, even realize free places 400M nothing compared overall expense COVID. could given 10 billion 20 best candidates still would fraction COVID spending. 

Maybe could one viable vaccine millions people could vaccinated right now. data ""flu pneumonia"" listed combined measurement. A+B=5000 necessarily imply 0.

I'm sure list data like instead separating two. guess pneumonia usually strong enough indicator flu years worth counting flu separately, change methodology particular data point. COVID diseases could easily caused 5000 pneumonia deaths without flu ever play. Incoming herd immunity Czech Republic? they’re counting people flu COVID cases... idk people still believe this. imagine flu could also highly lethal transplant patient... Pretty much half half country add whose already vaccinated Almost like vaccine production complicated - EU fully aware of, despite silly comments. saying people effectively quarantine likely living social security. work interact people survive thrown trash expendable, 65 year old needs able socialize. think wait bit open enrollment people actually go get vaccine doses. best it’ll still 10 million administered day, ~250 million remaining unvaccinated population still take weeks. there’s weeks waiting immunity well. 

Talking “the minute vaccines readily available” bit early. sure got transplanted lung. I'd think could got somewhere else hospital. amount misinformation comments astounding. cool would accidentally eradicated flu process trying suppress covid-19. MS-Vax-10

I'm assuming standard Microsoft fashion skipped MS-Vax-9. Thank you. think that's makes worse close getting shot. anyone links credible studies suggest vaccines prevent transmissions? Maybe Twitter thread too? people know going vaccines prevent severe disease it’s pissing much, good people can’t stand taking like this. That’s vaccines work. Please reply sources, also anyone advice prove wrong without ruining friendship please tell me. Gawd dammit effectively tells everyone working actually care get it. concern long term effects, current health, suck work 65 year old might die see 50 people day case. ..... close age difference suprised anyone would care. Makes sense. Talking expels lot particles mouth.

Besides, one wants hear talk. one said confusing them. dunno, I'm saying wrong, go 0 50% vaccinated fast, look peak vs now, I'm impressed. Everyone's rates dropping, without 50% vaccinated. I'm convinced Israel's numbers reflect level immunity supposedly have, guess. mad? Get high horse take mean this? Everything's better California would help lot everyone able take antibody test got sense real numbers Link please? I'd like check out. seems interesting somewhat makes sense. best way get many people get vaccinated possible say ""the sooner get vaccinated, sooner things get back normal."" ""In interview FOX 13, UDOH executive director Rich Saunders said eight weeks Utah hits 1.63 million primary doses COVID-19 vaccine allocated, counties low transmission index lift mask mandates. Right now, Utah 400,000 primary doses COVID-19 vaccine administered."" Even NY opening indoor stadiums 10 percent capacity goal upping number near future. would imagine outside stadiums going even numbers, maybe even half capacity summer social distance still allotted for. Last year's Stanley Cup champion started year fans front teammates, front office media. 

This year's Stanley Cup champion started year fake crowd noise win front fans. 

Pretty cool.  yeah, still waiting prove outright... would
definitely help dosing shortage. Right! It’s like flu historically killed thousands people every year since beginning humanity, magically zapped existence year. Right? Right??  anything say it, turn fryer! Wow that’s crazy. paragraph say that? “...but large amount people die flu died covid.” 

That wasn’t thought. original comment. Maybe ones spreading disinformation. ask hypothetical cancerous bus victim. 

I asked couple clarifying questions comment stating large amount usual flu victims became covid victims. didn’t even give examples share thoughts. Good info there, thanks that! know CDC recommending 65+ essential workers, muddy things up. analogy better 60% cars road night one headlight 30% both.   UK rollout, effective, ballpark Pfizer.

In Scotland AZ *more* effective preventing hospitalisations Pfizer. science, experts analysis doubt vaccines reduce transmission. following . . going sky rocket, mutations going spring up. knows could happen? Multply across world, chance mutation escapes vaccines becomes distinct possibility. Even partial escape puts vaccine rollout programs back months.

Is fatalism masked scientific observation. serious, you? think said issues resolved, meant set produce 200 million doses month??

The fact reach goal, needed producing without issues time spent resolving issues. shortfall precisely impact issues, given EU's plans rollout magically line revised figure, pretty obvious informed beforehand. That’s great make choice. Please don’t ask others that. want live. Question people luck scheduling vaccines: time day seen places update appointments? trying get dad vaccine PA. luck far. Viral load something wish knew about.. regards COVID matter 90+% elderly vaccinated. rest COVID usually ""just flu"". thread

Best efforts mean promise english. makes happy. didn’t get baby shower May baby he’s going one hell first birthday party! live US flu shots free every year health plan Staying home sick certainly helps. way country handles sick leave borderline barbaric. people might even aware coming something. certainly thing best answer going one thing instead bunch things done parallel. way none changes make need significant! Worse ours? per capita infection rates WAY lower Israel. US currently steeper downward trend much higher peak. yeah imagine stadiums full every week.... Reddit, ladies gentlemen 🍪 I'm little concerned post-covid society going filled germaphobes create downturn society. I'm sure could word differently sound like total idiot/jerk, let explain rationale.

First, I'm common sense restriction herd immunity possible, hopefully vaccinations. However, consider short-term non-lethal viruses are. consider problems increased due quarantines lockdowns, alcoholism, domestic abuse, depression, anxiety, course there's economic impact closed businesses. lockdown everytime there's minor disease running around, like flu strep, would case harm good.

Basically, want society lock every time bunch people get common cold, might crazy, definitely plausible would year two ago. literally insanity. cult. critical thinking gone. get believe anything.  actually never said problematic, said narrative, know quoting.

It's obvious attempt shaping narrative vocal minority. abusing downvote system accomplish this.

Whether ""problematic"" not, leave open interpretation. I'm pointing happening. People sub legitimately insane. god  fucking A, cases going Texas..  I'm saying point policy failures huge part. go one place shopping. local grocery store fuck see people still take mask talk others, wear mask correctly. Half summer volleyball league set park across street never wear masks. 

Mitigation tools work used correctly. Waiting tomorrow's headline: ""AstraZeneca ship doses Q2"" They’re special. Everyone except donors expendable Republicans. happen. retired uncle (family doctor) fit tied. working colleagues told management fudged cause death numerous times try federal aid. heard similar story paramedic drunk driving wreck. 2x limit cough week covid killed paper.

not denying science, assuming everything naive. news outlets starting run compelling Covid-19 stories. Aww.. thanks. means lot. incredibly advanced prosthetics: could tie shoe laces, play instrument, play video games. flip side advanced prosthetics expensive, exist. 

Another note make, many people missing arms legs quite self sufficient. Sure can't something like reach shelf, armless people play games mouth limbless people brush teeth practice. Losing limbs certainly affects live life, many things do.  dont think ""problematic narrative"" means all, even lot, people different opinion do. need send you? largely did. NIAID could absolutely rolling dough right wished exercise it’s patent proline substitutions (Pfizer, J&amp;J, Moderna, NovaVax use it) proof, there’s good reason believe Russia’s vaccine using well (Based espionage earlier pandemic vaccine companies, definitely would seen advantage conferred)  HEB? think would rather die covid let Chinese government shove test strip ass. ...we learned lesson 670 years ago Plague. turned cities enforcing social distancing forcing doors infected peoples' houses shut significantly better outcomes cities infected people would sprayed holy water go life usual... actually looked this. J&amp;J FAR lawsuits years. isn’t baby powder... hernia mesh really messed people up. There’s pattern releasing sub par products pulling hear problems. way would trust brand new vaccine... clearly willing let customers suffer die instead pulling dangerous products. Depends production lines often start running faster time glitches slow downs worked out, would want see average last 7 days make judgement Lately yeah bit momentum shift rightly so. refreshing actually negativity downvoted. Sure, live bubble next 10 years mitigate risk.

Nice straw man. better. Considering we're likely other, potentially worse viruses one day, certainly hope around try spread them. it’s not. We’ve barely large scale events year now. We’ve potentially thousands small businesses go under. We’ve told see friends family. 

How hell easily avoidable? Yes, getting -- new virus called COVID-xx, would SARS moniker. local news reporting GA opening vaccination teachers possibly education staff “in matter days”. Good. Great. Kemp getting lambasted while. 

The thing is...here quote article read:

“The specifics exactly included new phase, well called still worked out.

**It likely won’t 1b yet.**”

So even phases laid it’s gonna Kemp adding groups try fix image?? time I’m eligible we’re gonna calling phase 1C4.2+ passes journalism??? ""You're boss me!!!"" says tough, overly-masculine manly man, certainly sound like petulant baby saying mama going make eat brocolli.

Grow fuck care world around you. Class response!   Social distancing worked well we’ve 40% Americans get Covid. yeah, let’s keep pretending people unwilling. I’m sure work.  Nice trolling dude, didn’t really read, you’re bore - get sleep. reeks bullshit virus strain 'die off' can't successfully spread one year? always here? exactly ""lot good news"" referred to. Everything said factual people like facts. want info spoon-fed directly brains want match preconceived notions.

There's also issue getting people somehow still think fake. Personally, think send probes Sun people incapable believing reality. people care restrictions always complaining can't anything rn. people around adhere, even closing businesses, requiring masks stores, lot force people comply. Here's article [Forbes discussing pollutants cruise They're welcome Mexico :) Yep, I’m saying end world. I’m referring tough guys top proclamations won’t tolerate like virus gives hoot.  they’ve taken 2.5 months deliver 80m doses somehow supposed believe deliver additional 120m one month? anyone else think fishy? Check daily info dump u/positivityrate mean got tetanus shot ass cheek doc said arm wouldn’t able handle soreness. I’d honestly ok this?? I’ll take flu 10 times winter means chill w homies. Oh go realllll well religious nutjobs concerned microchipped. like company people promote delivery boy position ""executive delivery boy"" extra pay wondering this, almost everyone wearing mask would love know cold flu statistics. high transmission levels deaths since start, testing widely available August. Already posted US? always impression teaching sub 50k year job like person replying said. numbers sound like I'd expect hear Canada, I'm surprised difference huge states. We're starting get lot Pfizer Moderna now. Why? conclude among admitted hospitals, folks CA variant likely go ICU die. known variant begin would go ICU die. biased? Hell nah downvoters, actually thing. making up. people go Western social media, create bot accounts, spam propaganda. person seems spout rhetoric putting blame US it’s indisputable virus started China tried covering up. they’re trying push blame Americans we’re easy target. It’s actually pretty sad. heart goes Chinese citizens deal that. Yes have. girlfriend nurse trust heard stories hospital peak Covid times. remember early on, going find masks goggles hospital any. yes, take seriously.  healthcare system capacity basically done bare minimum.

Deaths per million tricky, many top countries city states tiny populations people willing get vaccine. knows when, future unknown. '11 times deadly' certainly reasonable estimate.

It's estimate. results study. Granted huge sample size big enough reach significance. Screw hero pay, pay humble CEO give ""hero"" pay that's sub rules man Thanks, Fauci! neither needed

What? miss news another supplier?

Seriously, trying argue here? guy reddit said 1) Wearing Mask, 2) planning getting vaccine ASAP, 3) staying away large gatherings, guy obviously discern anti-covid nutcase. point projecting inadequacies. nice day! (I sincerely hope grandmother able get vaccine soon. Quebec experimenting vaccine distributions unethical ways, wrong.) thing you’re hugely disregarding even eventually get vaccine mutant won’t truly novel we’ll degree cell immunity. square 1 means. average redditor fits neither category. That's PCR tests unreliable give false positive Flu, people Covid. 

Please telly guys dont believe flu magically dissapeared due restrictions, Covid somehow didnt? Lad making assumptions here. Good day sir  That's beyond fucked up. local Home Depot constantly busy people every day, minimum disruption compared every company. wish too, you’re guaranteeing kids kind respectfully people deal daily. DeSantis screams want play too. Yeah especially 80+ year old grandmas lol Yeah top UK happy fish went cruise enjoy it. understand reddit circlejerk hating cruises people. Nah, Meijer. Thing is, even smoke tobacco unaware tax, pay enough attention paychecks, took $170 refused give back Um what? NYC allowing people indoor arenas nothing people. don’t give fuck Fauci says except care effects says might state officials.

 expecting plan state governor metrics, goals, thresholds used get us gradually back full normal. Super crazy right!!!! researchers adjusted data account differences age, gender, ethnicity, found that, compared patients viral strains, carrying variant 4.8 times likely admitted ICU 11 times likely die. Courthouse married Oct. 2019, scheduled wedding Sep. 2020, postponed (in April) August 2021.

Yeah getting delayed lol. Everyone wants vaccinated August. It’s like you’re describing grandmother got covid week ago. normal oxygen saturation 90-93%( emphysema lung thrombosis). However since got covid gets bad 83% moving around, also struggles sleeping. I’m worried sick. 

The saddest part got COVID couple weeks people age group started getting vaccinated country. Flipper babies... let reiterate people smarter extraordinary cases “proof concept” HIV cured, bone marrow transplant  highly risky, intensive expensive procedure performed treat life-threatening conditions absence treatment options. realistic way cure HIV millions people around world living virus.  Moreover, attempts cure HIV bone marrow transplants individuals successful, primarily procedure performed patients HIV blood cancers, high mortality rate even bone marrow Nope. It'll honestly never happen. gonna get worse out.

Sadly probably peak human quality life. top. downhill climate change knocking door. That's great fucking question. Late stage capitalism? Nah im saying fda literally guy sitting office data made. Kids autistic wear masks. like sending ticking timebombs every day. testing 1 2 dose, authorization giving placebos Oh yeah, it’s gonna awful get phase things it’s year Time cube. Ok. learn it? I'm taking sincere question. 

My guess would FDA involvement beginning would likely delay process. 

This would mean piles communication paperwork would need shared right away every step lieu finalized report end process. 

In simplistic terms, guy collecting everything put report also know needs make sure sent everywhere needs go FDA, time, also means cleaning data presentation light conclusion drawing every single step. I'm definitely expecting sort opinion piece talking ""yes, put two St. Patrick's Days/Easters hold virus, (insert mental gymnastics here).""

Not would agree article, course. I'm sure many either. understand public health ministers.

Oh yeah, that'd tricky. point, way things going think plurality guests would vaccinated, could either limit attendance vaccinated people (honor system would probably work fine) non-vaccinated people attend risk advised take safety sanitation measures see fit. think know within month indoor gathering restrictions still concern far out, I'm guessing not.

Masks dancefloor might give rave vibe depending venue could kinda cool. 85% severe disease hospitalizations. 100% death. ICU nurse believe tell id rather die leave icu state people ""lived"" covid left. Kinda terrifying, toddler rough birth almost died. made paranoid bought oxygen monitor. He'd 91- 92 lot times, assumed inaccurate. put second child 98-100% time. People may disagree, believe co-sleeping moms chest early months saved life. post seems driven anxiety understanding virus. idea certain percentage people vaccinated, virus cannot make large inroads population encounters many immune people. virus dead end. estimated percentage around 75% people immune prior infection vaccine, estimated virus decline absolute numbers low levels. Risk household transmission around 10-40% according studies. Higher spouses, lower parent/child. Idk work aviation faa embedded us it’s super nice sometimes needing approvals. know everything that’s going on. keep hearing said every single person I’ve ever seen say won’t take vaccine said 4 months ago continues say things like “look quickly produced/tested it”, “ wanna know long term effects”, “I need data”. Issues wouldn’t resolved level messaging. People claiming aren’t actually providing evidence support widespread idea. Like haven’t seen personally known single person said “I gonna take wear mask even bother.” I’m saying people don’t exist think drop bucket compared people wrongly skeptical long term effects wouldn’t satiated messaging. you’re willing travel look Walgreens app try bunch different cities. seems handful appointments day fox valley area. wasn’t able see dates past Friday though. Well.. want come right say know, babysitters nothing health safety. Gotta keep gears turning.

If governments cared much getting kids back school well being, I'd imagine would take necessary steps make happen safe normal possible. Social distancing forever! Sounds normal never get laid Normal? What's normal precious? Anyone making less 15 hour made unemployment (assuming 40hr work week) lethal young people get tested know arguing opposite, day-to-day involvement FDA would delay trials thus causing deaths. experienced epidemiologist research scientist know first hand things work defer opinion this. Even were, what's plastic surgeon going it? “I’ll say nicely: guys morons seem pleasant enough.” “Doctors” absolutely believe this. doctors even outright deny covid. imagine “doctors” wide range heterodox beliefs covid, probably sensible. meant say “there small handful scientists/bureaucrats use alarmist language advance careers” maybe you’d better point touche used fairly popular French speaking Germans western Germany, discount air travel became thing. could drive hours long weekends pretty common.

With cheap flights, Antalya, Turkey got act together became go place families budget. almost impossible find adult hotels area.  Fuck ya  I'm sorry loss. Sending hug &lt;3  Agreed. I’ve spent enough time reading r/covidlonghaulers know absolutely want mess virus.

Approximately one ten people contracting COVID-19 symptoms months afterwards. odds high me. Cutting factor 20 mRNA vaccine would make manageable risk mind. Cutting factor 3 would not. Good, EMA approve around October. significant portion deaths (in regions around 50%) came nursing homes, NY unprepared. time wave hit Florida, nursing home protection measures place. Literally talking bone marrow transplant numbnuts. replicated total once, here's real Among patients given syngeneic transplants, actuarial disease-free survival 7 years 20%.

That took place 13 years ago since then, cured exactly one person technique. complete nonstarter liable kill HIV. mutually exclusive, either. America running adults, vaccines,

A good problem have. question makes laugh thinking past interaction cousin. town weekend, bars. met seen years. wasted time got there. music loud trying talk drunk ass spitting me. think would taken 15 minutes infect nastiness lol.

So answer is....it depends. one does. still update boss daily work.  sarcastic? Compared uniformed jobs NYC, EMT pay abysmal. Fair argument. Hopefully J&amp;J gets approved that's enough convince every governor allow teachers get vaccinated. Peak making guy Twitter mad energy proper context, last year 12. 98 now. BC population 5.071 million. 5 dudes could 98 year. complete assholes. 

I get one many like open hatred Asians occurring. ones goes weird time posters here, would assume open season Asians. roughly 920,000 Asians last year 12 instances. best example could use so-called hate state. 

Almost 1 5 residents BC Asians, too. chances happening bad statistically miniscule. Let's least try statistically, contextually objective. bad sandbagged 3 weeks. Could rolled already. cares? people get vaccinated, less transmission be. obsessed whether people ""deserve"" vaccinated? looking shoulder getting real time data analysis. month released approval basically negligent homicide sure confusion get downvoted...?

I want go them, kids, though want safe asking adults indeed risk getting covid things vs. kids. would wear two layers mask, would wear N95, might one different variables.

If kids get it, see anyway realistically house would get it. would love hear others able keep 2 toddlers away 10 days relatively close living space. Yeah feel bad people like you. could imagine go work minimum wage strong informarion virus hearing friends brag making money sitting home.

I really thought should’ve stimulus bonus essential workers worked March April  work faster boss shoulder second guessing every move, suspect similar situation.  wish would've studied long stays car. making fun people say that, 1 kid... far US 3.1 million kids tested positive covid, probably several million covid havent tested positive.

That's like shutting beaches US 1 person got bit shark, doesnt make sense.

This actually happens flu also, unless agree shutting schools every flu season, point think vaccinating fast enough beat variants. Id expect 75-100k day while, possibly more. probably see deaths drop next weeks result declining cases past 2-4 weeks, last.  mean, durations longer hour kind big deal. necessary big deal, get wrong (I'm anti-masker stretch), let's lie say fine wear mask day work eight hours straight, wear one brewery, etc. fine. spouse covid fall got tested Berlin's charité hospital, actually test ""self-test kit"" first part study efficiency tests, nurse actual test.

So I'm assuming they've done studies tests good enough. wheel. Thank you, helpful! Seriously tho, spending waaaaay year  silence deafening. CVS least NJ don’t staff many. Right it’s largely people pharmacy limits capacity. NJ example 20 day it’s simply supply constraints also manpower. Medical News Today:

""In 2007, [Timothy Ray became first person ever doctors declared cured HIV. time, referred publicly Berlin patient.

His journey toward cure straightforward. received HIV diagnosis 1990s, Mr. Brown received antiretroviral treatment — usual course action HIV infection.

However, later on, also received diagnosis acute myeloid leukemia, eventually required stem cell transplant.

As looking suitable donor match, doctor idea try experiment. looked donor specific genetic mutation made practically immune HIV.

Receiving stem cells donor, turned out, treated Mr. Brown’s leukemia also cured HIV infection.

Now, study featuring [*The shows, another person officially cured HIV, also thanks stem cell transplant.

## ‘Success stem cell transplantation’

In second case, person received stem cell transplant cells express *CCR5* gene, produces protein helps virus enter cells.

The cells without *CCR5* gene part bone marrow transplant, person undergoing treatment Hodgkin lymphoma.

**Following transplant, 30 months person ceased antiretroviral therapy, doctors confirmed HIV viral load remained undetectable blood samples.**

This finding means whatever traces virus’s genetic material might still system, so-called fossil traces, meaning cannot lead replication virus.

The specialists confirmed HIV also remained undetectable samples cerebrospinal fluid, semen, intestinal tissue, lymphoid tissue.

“We propose results represent second ever case patient cured HIV,” says study’s lead author, Prof. Ravindra Kumar Gupta, University Cambridge findings show success stem cell transplantation cure HIV, first reported 9 years ago Berlin patient, replicated.” 
– Prof. Ravindra Kumar Gupta

However, Prof. Gupta emphasizes “\[i\]t important note curative treatment high risk used last resort patients HIV also life threatening hematological \[blood\] malignancies.”

“Therefore, treatment would offered widely patients HIV successful antiretroviral treatment,” researcher goes caution.

Commenting findings, researchers involved study express hope that, future, scientists may able use state-of-the-art gene editing tools part interventions meant treat cure HIV.

Dr. Dimitra Peppa, University Oxford U.K. co-authored study, notes “\[g\]ene editing using *CCR5* received lot attention recently.”

Nevertheless, points out, still long way go therapies may become viable.

“There still many ethical technical barriers — e.g., gene editing, efficiency, robust safety data — overcome approach using *CCR5* gene editing considered scalable cure strategy HIV,” says.""  


So, uh, guess first people cured exist, you?  


At least understand vaccines work, that's something.   So, COVID people died diseases, including flu, literally every single day. change lives ""death permanent"". Covid worse flu, flu still kills 60k people year normal years. worth restrictions curb 60k deaths? can't achieve anything die said, that's true whether covid flu kills you.

This problem lot people viewpoint. deaths acceptable. understand arguments lockdowns mask mandates short term middle spiking cases, particularly arguments center around keeping hospitals overwhelmed. understand argument need keep restrictions place forever even much longer all, prevent level death. level death always acceptable part life, worth destroying economy mental health get fairy tale ""0 covid"". think China going make mistake previous conquerers youre deluded. country centre unified front western countries lot people tired American influence. tired american companies raping countries, tired endless wars, tired talked to. 

Like said, wait see. Unlike america, China able actually plan ahead proactive rather reactive comes solving problems. much concern there.

How arrive conclusion? Long-term complications seen (possibly even common) even mild asymptomatic cases.

Another user provided summary it? Sounds like benefit decision.   Good thing there's vaccine that's easily available (and even US often free) partner got vaccinated weekend many friends too. population desires vaccine immediately 10% rate... they’re practically giving away. 😬 favourite game people want discredit EU. count direct EU investment , ignore member state investment compare nations investment. Completely ignoring EU works member states important overall EU apparatus. could Boris Johnson, constantly Brussels ""journalist"". “Keg stands covid (vaccine)” love Last Tuesday new cases 4282 today 4574.     
    
Yes, US declining rapidly Israel one declining much higher rate. Israel 50% population least one shot 35% population two dose. blows comparison US. we're adding many unconfirmed % population already infected, I'm sure Israel also higher percent population officially reported. officially reported cases per capita close same. Yay! Glad got appointment! either get time slot second dose tomorrow tell you’ll get text/email closer time second shot. rebuild economy hard expensive rebuild rebuild EU members bear burden. kids - basically isolated 95% time. It’s fine. adjust back. LOL care reality much next decent, rational person, near zero flu cases still make sense me. would expect lesser amount cases sure, probably significant, numbers low, actually zero cases. anyone link explains clearly difference covid flu spread? ""Escape vaccines"" means renders ineffective. Even amongst approved vaccines far, vast majority shown reduce severe disease, severely decrease need hospitalization. know people talk ""long COVID"" case ""zero COVID"", far appears linked clinically sever cases, lead hospitalization.

It's likely virus endemic, experts predict COVID-19 eventually reduced common cold virus result. Yep, shingles come back time, mostly older, SUCKS. affects nervous system kinds shitty ways. There's vaccine though!

And yeah, like Valtrex? Really? worked awesome! 17 years I'm still living life want. 😂 Looking reassurance. got second dose today. guy administering gave squeezed arm quite hard it. one hurt way first. Also, bled quite bit looked like little bit vaccine came blood well since blood looked somewhat diluted. 

I assured ok. y’all heard anything this? Google tells arm really shouldn’t squeezed there’s risk vaccine miss muscle stay fat layer. I’ve spend year super anxious I’m still anxious now. Lol CDC reduced 10 days. Get tested 3-5 days exposure safe. makes sense! think poster may thinking widespread mask wearing unnecessary vaccine generally available, let's say summer. fulfill sell order lol  That's going harder get equal amount microchips dose. /s Jokes aside car salesmen, absolutely right. Yes are. problem instead “hey, think things going way are, July roll back mandates”. “don’t take mask off. data say it’s safe. continued masking 2022 beyond probably safe bet”

When you’re telling people basically live like even post vaccine, get push back frustration ends people flipping bird. 2019 kicked ass days. Part problem people cold think flu. sore throat congestion, aches weakness something else entirely. Uh NHS walk get flu shot. America people pay flu shot worries. virus strike again! Yeah, hospital go education put 2.7 Even though elderly likely quarantine, unlike work live. need protect quarantine expense get covid. get rent fix damn door! Nah. don’t care it’s *theoretically possible*, care it’s likely. There’s mountain evidence indicating Pfizer vaccine I’m getting significantly cuts transmission. I’m concerned 5% chance I’ll get mild symptomatic infection pass others. Studies would need show transmission still happens time order change mind. care fellow human beings. don’t care virus 99% survival rate. wear mask I’m shopping/at bank. doesn’t drop seeing family friends every chance get. much concerned loss liberties. Hope it’s avalanche! mRNA vaccine development decades. Yes you’re right much uncertainty know it’s going go. certainly wouldn’t want someone get impression bro-science guesses it’s time take masks party. pure speculation Car Salesmen, whole time extra pay extra ppe extra anything. change vaccination strategy around end May give first shots use new 2nd booster shot developing variants. long second dose Pfizer take max immunity? thought 7 days I’ve hearing different stuff. anyone link info this?   Government, WHO, world. rushed it, put bunch bullshit need there. they're pushing hard. sketch, thanks me. I'd rather another risk dying added list Good them. past year shown definitively zoom school terrible kids, terms education mental health. Furthermore, places reopened schools seen significant outbreaks result. need get kids back schools fast possible. Yes subreddit full people denying reality virus go away. Butthurt people virus comes back they'll say ""told so"" denying start. I'm tired arrogant downvoters god damn f'ing reason!!!! That's insane. Even current measures think Canada 3x current peak within months. model show signs slowing would probably reach least 5x current peak. even possible? Like Canada would infected  vaccines hadn’t even proven work yet point. would buy millions doses vaccine aren’t even sure work? Plus US already right approach diversifying investment multiple vaccines case didn’t work ended unsafe. viewed expendable called heroes. Well, Whitty already said ""restrictions"" ""might"" (i.e. will) come back next winter, there's that. new, vaccine-evading variants already cropped up, continue so. Given pace vaccination rollout far, reasonable assumption vaccination general population variant happen winter, let alone new ones, necessitating rounds societal house arrest. seems impossible... reason obsessed reopening schools. Absolutely zero planning, saying hail Marys hoping best. FFS  what, kids get flu parents get flu returns normal..
.at least stopping covid killer   paying sounds reasonable Literally nurse explain today. would game changer vaccine requires normal refrigerator 5 C 3 month stability 24hrs room temperature. Right, even fact know reduce transmission means realistically tell people “hey guess what, take mask people vaccinated” least give notion happen Lung transplants notoriously iffy, (a 5 year survival rate 60%, best.) sort infection pretty much guaranteed loss. Thanks! (See? always easier respond without first reading sources :-))

But even graphs, Sweden seem bottom pack first wave.. (March-Early May) Ooooh im shaking boots another doomsday sounding headline article full maybes.  


And besides, article straight says variant new, circulating around california since mid-2020. EU research funding quite small percentage total within UK’s top universities. I’m talking like slightly 10%. no, likely nowhere close “the Palestinians never catch break. I'm going present counter-argument--at least relation vaccine aspect. 

There many occupations require around lots people day, cannot even wear masks (think dentists, daycare workers, makeup artists). Grocery sector that's essential exposed masses means. grocery workers important people list? Society needs jobs keep functioning.

Even though grocery definitely essential than, say, makeup, industries running risk whether justified not. mean shit, think flight attendants. They're probably around people day anyone else list much closer proximity longer. 

The flip side jobs may around fewer people, workers around 8+ hours viral load higher (and therefore make sick. Plenty papers this).

Look, I'm thankful frontline workers. fact matter is, many really prioritize. prioritize everyone list that's what, 50% workforce? Yes, believe not, people tend care actual deaths potential long-term health effects. read awhile ago r value 3 6...lets say 4 example - spreading like typical flu r value 4 1 person infects 4 people 4 people infect 4 people. much often 1 person infecting 15 people 15 people 3 spread large group remaining 12 people spread spread less 4 people. Shows much worse flu covid is. Also excess death crowd taking thus account. fact covid restrictions decreased death rate viruses, workplace incidents, road accidents, etc, makes excess deaths skewed down. New Zealand death rate actually dropped substantially covid precautions.  It'll endemic.

Until everything back open without need masks physical distancing, it'll still seen problem. Bonus mask wearing makes breathe humid air, great winter. scary.

I fear never get back ""normal"" 😢. missing point valid one. Teachers help us recover economically vaccinating grocers. might sound cold limited supply makes sense either vaccinate people risk add benefit. would love vaccinate grocers (and argument sooner rather later), grocery stores close people vaccinated. Teachers schools closed many places - getting reopen helps economy. Vaccinating grocery store workers protects people. One priority societal standpoint beyond compassion protecting public limit spread.

If judgement every choice made health, would made different choices around number things different states did. 

I say essential worker waiting.  Even psychologically, many people ( children ) become germaphobes? Also look NYTimes free COVID19 maps... linearly extrapolate stay 1.6 million vaccinations/day... don’t get 90% vaccination second December. July 40% mark. that. might manpower supply constraints, don’t expect us go faster speed we’re moving in. That’s really sad. ultimately life go on. society obsessed death ever gonna stagnate decline. raid offices plants find actually going here. heard may never hit herd immunity, although COVID might simply demoted endemic; it'll *basically* over, we'll get COVID shot every year so. Personally I'm that, whenever may be.

Time tell tho; I'd love hit herd immunity. far really feel like ""sniffles"". slight sore throat along small cough. No. PCR tests differentiate people tested both. Nobody finds suspicious??? Isn’t possible, probably likely flu cases categorized COVID It’s amazing badly inches snow days freezing fucked state up, we’re bouncing back. Much higher R value apparently. masks social distancing, safety. 100% agreed. It’s taken us awhile recover Dallas. said Thursday back 100% moving new system causing slow downs much better going forward people get shots Long term restrictions helpful. 


That's restrictions make people dependent politicians dictate acceptable behavior. Compliance restrictions also decrease time eventually prevent effective. People capable staying home without government constantly telling COVID-19. Exactly this. one dying flu right now, pneumonia without flu.

Dunno dude voted tbh flu wiped almost everywhere. looking it. hope wearing masks isn’t normalized get past covid. Masks suck. hate everything limiting spread covid. 100% misinformation. They're broadly sense they're large vaccine orders, key details matter different.  
  
 extra details give U.K. leverage ensure contract delivered effectively. contracts say parties make “best reasonable effort” deliver vaccine, U.K. government clearer asserting oversight agreement. Mmmmm wait kid infected measles covid time. isn’t guaranteed, two viruses ripens conditions genetic recombination. unusual contacts type size specify capacity purchased (time location) effectively label certain doses purchased certain contract. idea idea that’s case here, case UK v EU AZ doses. dare suggest for-profit entity acting exactly for-profit entity would! Totally nonsensical! /s Well given UK net contributor EU budget left really make much sense. EU funding sense accounting trick UK giving EU money respent UK. absolutely right. definitely trying make habit loosening up, lunch vaccinated friend beers someone recently covid (in mostly empty bar) seems like unreasonable allowance every two weeks, way got it, would know where. high risk 20 something peer group area almost restrictions, pandemic fatigue real. ended week ago kids school. mask social distance. Ya know what? They’re still happy school instead remote. Kids adaptable.
Obviously one wants school like this, don’t hear kids complain masks new restrictions ever. hard them. Hell yes. young kids resilient AF. think they’ll vaccine end year would delay tens thousands deaths also mean average effort second best effort. cushy COVID bubbles, immune systems may getting distancing, lockdowns, masking, spirited sanitizing mean coming contact fewer garden-variety germs normal. year’s flu season basically may seem like welcome reprieve seasonal ailments pesky sniffles, experts fear immune systems may losing defensive edge lull. usual microscopic suspects lying wait return sense normalcy, could mean nasty bursts common colds flu-like illnesses post-COVID futures—ones may avoidable even carry COVID precautions.  literally anyone job, you’re expendable. I've seen mentioned that, variants exist, worldwide downward trend would continue.

Why that? didn’t even read first paragraph, you? It’s multi-year partnership. you’re gonna go vaccine nationalism route, least get facts right.

Hilarious think BioNTech came idea candidate own. Yeah, article explain remove limbs. seems drastic awful. 

Like flesh eating bacterial infection would understand that, understand all. 

It's fucking terrible. Poor little guy. UK, every EU member state, sovereignty independently introduce measures approve vaccines. F.ex. Hungary placed order Russia's Sputnik V China's Sinopharm vaccine. Again, UK's response far fck Brexit. changed playing field EU made suboptimal choices, member nations--pressed economic forces--have contributed infection rates closing little opening early.

Hilarious statement coming one European countries highest infection mortality rates. didn't, had, good.  Biden administration this? government force lockdown ban eviction think government pay ""damage"". urgently need update focus first doses only. probably pride British idea. society collapsing 0.3% fatal disease? get downvotes. important long covid could cause life long problems? AZ still get covid possibilities long covid... Geez. Ridiculous would necessary. Singapore high vaccine hesitancy rate? Remember flu kills children Covid. know. world living given idea? state starts vaccinating teachers today opens frontline essential workers couple weeks. Feels good moving next group. Today found parents one kids tested positive, sent kids school Monday today even though symptoms sure. 

And 500,000 dead Americans. MIGHT Covid, whole household went quarantine 5 days went get tested. Nobody ever showed single symptom, knew anyway.

And damn good thing did, tested positive, quarantined additional 12 days that.

If everyone acted way, many fewer deaths would have?

But nah, fuck that. Let's send sick kids school...  state, walmart cashiers make $11/hr servers make $2.13/hr...... (flu) deaths reported 2019-20 season September 19, influenza-associated pediatric deaths likely under-reported, children whose death related influenza virus infection may tested flu

-the tables hard read, still looks like flu deaths 18's Covid Best Explanations I've seen; role cells COVID-19 infection? immunity antibodies; essential businesses raised per hour wages. Others, like mine, gave workers one-time taxable bonus paycheck screwed tax rate enough 75% bonus disappeared taxes. Huzzah.

$250 bonus? That's cool ... wait, paycheck $75 higher?

That fun one try explain already frustrated staff.

Then, show still generous ""together this"", company exact thing 4 months later. Yes, times laugh. No-win situation. I'd rather die. enough vaccine delivered federal government vaccinate everyone wants sometime April. that, still need distribute. we’re optimistic, assume enough vaccine “delivered” US mid-April, last FIRST shots probably getting administered early May. need another 3-4 weeks finalize admission second shot, another 2 weeks second shot “fully effective”.

That gets mid-June (optimistically everything goes smoothly). probably won’t run perfectly (ie administration vaccine may become bottleneck) expecting early mid July probably slightly reasonable.  would awesome unless Utah gets gives whole shit ton vaccines next weeks, May might little early.

Maybe one day regret establishing precedent government force take drug will. state pushed group back end. get anger. Latest data UK shows AZ great effacy higher rate stopping hospitalisation pzifer seen anything suggest immunity goes away amount time.

Not EU. Reducing trade frictions one (the scope old EEC), scientific collaboration, aligning regulations reduce cost business. That's it.

Buying vaccines? Germany wants billion Pfizer doses, Bulgarian wants AZ infrastructure cryogenic storage, France wants Sanofi, need find common ground end exactly format implemented EU: everyone gets say end 6 vaccine suppliers provide fraction continent needs.

TBH, major European countries need start planning post-EU future, smaller countries need find similar countries band together (Visegrad 4, New Hanseatic League, etc).

My guess? Beginning May really nice weather. I've searched answer found reason anyone know covid vaccine cannot used treat people covid.

I understand vaccine therapeutic medicine case? Important takeaway WaPo :

“We know vaccine prevents 85 percent severe disease. … 100 percent effective preventing hospitalization deaths, that’s really what’s important,” said Nancy M.

Then course don’t give shit anything. Donald Trump you?  
Just kidding course :) haha. That's completely separate issue though.

I agree you, vaccines move on. covid still serious illness going away tomorrow. can't acknowledge things? think everyone wants rational approach.

It sucks handling virus politicized. I'd like place blame leaders, also ourselves. virus kills half million fellow Americans scorn living worry, rather give compassion understanding.

If message go back normal vaccinated, difficult reign freedumb crowd use free pass continue spreading stupid. morons claim vaccinated anyone questions aren’t wearing mask public. proudly spout nonsense “98% survivability” “people gotta die, that’s world works” telling anyone asks yes, indeed vaccinated therefore don’t wear something infringes rights isn’t necessary anyway. Never mind neighbor’s grandma died last week testing positive, COPD gonna die anyway. 

In short, suffer stupid people read something facebook. We’re year this, guess used bullshit now. Less people getting tested hospitals one element. flu shots. speculation schools traditionally big vector, also surfaces bigger spreader influenza- disinfecting probably overkill COVID actually better knocking flu. Also distancing masks. Influenza isn’t contagious COVID, fights COVID even effective seasonal flu. Turbotax.info fornyc get storm last week, fact cases deaths slowing starting rise worldwide? I'd say 90% jobs performed parties wear masks social distancing mostly enforced. However, treated ""undue hardship"" business requirement incentive operate manner. clear: keeping employees healthy safe pandemic undue hardship.

Here's thought: government forces companies operate safely follow CDC guidelines? Better yet government actively protects companies liability work conditions expose employees COVID?

""iF uNsAfE qUiT""

With healthcare tied employment, people can't quit jobs. would lose health insurance, source income, still could get COVID would bankrupt them. **And businesses know this,** able subject employees whatever like little impunity. save face public call people ""heroes"" ""thank service"".

If 90% jobs performed safely, would leave 10% need prioritized. remaining 90% would continue performed vaccine rollout complete.

I think people hubris thinking occupation much important next guy; they're exhausted forced unsafe work conditions want way out.

**The conversation needs veer back source problem:** government botched COVID response. government continually prioritizes profits businesses employees. government focused preserving capitalism well-being citizens.  **Preprint**

**Exhaled CO2 COVID-19 infection risk proxy different indoor environments ""The work essential, workers not""

\-Society nutshell. even Western thing. worldwide. Ask yourself: last time tipped Wal-Mart cashier needs way restaurant worker? cold strains flu strains could basically die COVID restrictions?

Or always come back somewhere  article made sound like penalty EU could decide pay AZ.  Fuck cruises. Viva la Pontiac bandit! That’s amazing tracked. I’m appalled.  [The America vaccinated 3x number people per capita That’s said. Fair point terminology, I'm familiar terms edit, using shorthand. However, absolutely anyone think maybe numbers fudged little..? Seriously, every single regularly recurring death statistic massive drop off..heart attacks, flu, cancer, literally everything. possible still happening labeled COVID related deaths bolstering numbers? hospitals get 4-5× money COVID death legislation granted. since general practice elective surgeries canceled make sense keep revenue coming hospitals would label almost DOAs deaths hospital COVID? Maybe? would let stick anywhere. Plus mention personally seen middle aged older adults take seriously throughout pandemic walk around massless tf young adults suffer this? teachers know well called heroes told basically human shields school shootings...instead legislation passed help. Lol right Yes think people traumatized this. don’t agree you’ve vaccinated still terrified weren’t, doesn’t make logical sense me. someone like seek mental health professional Yeah that’s fucking dumb reasoning Hopefully Biden Trudeau talking getting Canada vaccines.

100% correct - much time listening idiot politicians science teacher school went ""I'm acceptable loss"". sit well people. read comment all? - people listened Fauci one way other.

1) Increases supply

2) Easy transport stable store long period time fridge

3) One dose

That said, get choice I'd go either mRNA options it. likely complicated that.

The flu shot typically made attenuated (weakened) inactivated (""killed"") forms virus. Two main covid-19 vaccines mRNA based, requires different substances keep vaccine stable. seems unlikely one simply mix two. Ok waiting multiple days meeting analysis done recommendation made increase safety? Keep mind coronavirus quite unsafe thousands people dying every day. one 60s way better...   saw menasha morning checking. might’ve gotten filled though. thought read need work ID drivers license. refer covid as, ""Just flu."" Except speed decided stop pandemic old fashioned way. Unfortunately, Federal government's power health matters pretty limited. Constitutionally, states authority here.

This said, control overall vaccine distribution, make recommendations, provide leadership. Which, fair, doing. actual ""giving vaccines directly people"" part state control. Nice mate! Hope it’s soon! 
Enjoy long satisfying jab ;) trust Johnson &amp; Johnson bathroom needs, fuck would trust this? Horrible company. I've used 7 disposable face masks since virus times began.

Sitting chair Random internet guys hopefully right. Nobody right thing. wait digital passports etc. never live again. agree, expected take American stores point future.

As stores use facial rec track patrons shop, masks kinda interfered marketing data insanely valuable. Even personally identifying you, figuring goes where/when general demographic analysis worthwhile.

I see giving up. mask mandates over, they'll security door making remove it. Probably depends at. uncle Florida got even though Ohio resident Ohio ID. However prove owned piece property Florida. 

But resident state trying get vaccine gotten new ID yet can't imagine would problem. rent ask utility bill something prove residence. Thank you, appreciate could probably bring proof residency item like electric bill copy lease/mortgage mean state ID moved changed it? trying get vaccine state live in? former case might ask bring bill lease proof residence. Illinois new cases 20-25 percent higher yesterday. North Carolina double. Indiana 40 percent higher. Virginia slightly. South Carolina 800.  I’ve working office like normal nonstop since pandemic started. 2 months ago, would agreed you. Now, I’m really seeing indication going happen. I’ve heard employers offering onsite vaccination places low risk don’t seem give fuck. enough supply end vaccine gatekeeping allow everyone get vaccinated?  exactly happened last autumn. There's delay people first get infected start showing symptoms risk getting ill die. rate new cases continues increase despite new restrictions, deaths follow several weeks later. seem like unpleasant person. continued lockdowns going? Indeed. employer referring coworkers family shitty manipulation tactic get emotionally invest something professional. interesting comment. reminds intuition medical topics. think best point severity Covid resulting mass deaths reason ever stopped paid attention Covid first place. Without one would’ve ever really paid attention flu season got sick, that’s kinda expected happen everyone point lives.

As vaccines effective preventing death need return normal. Instead efficacy wars vaccines 100% effective preventing even mild cases.

The end goal always going lower Covids risk normal flu levels, eradicate planet like Measles. 😅 gooooooo fats! magically backfire... need one mutation another country fuck us again.

Unless US seals borders lets nobody in/out prove machine learning analyze nasal swap accurately detect covid variants anything else potential concern.  Last read think still several years out. mandatory border crossing we'll much better shape. think missed joke....   Honest question. would want vaccine two? thought Pfizer Moderna 92% efficacy rating first dose 95% second dose? understand helps supply vaccines overall, person risk factor would better take one two? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

🤔 “deaths acceptable”,.. (to me),.. we’ve done everything possible (all sensible common sense precautions). 

We havent even that. (thats US 4% world population 25% Covid deaths.) Hmm yeah wonder there’s correlation two... mine appeared white hairs eyelashes eyebrows US able reopen May, *disaster*.  possible short amount time we've deal this. struggle even restaurants convert dining areas shanty town outdoor areas evident enough change slow businesses. People still need around coworkers types jobs. Need live others barges ship goods in, unload planes, unpack boxes... possible take humans equation completely. 5 count AZ Sputnik.  still want ""burn population"" higher death rate comfortable (500k dead far). ""Flattening curve"" keep death rate several times higher. Anyone decided letting infect everyone best approach psychopath. vaccine always plan. annoying thought Biden admin going standardize across states? older family one state that’s already gotten second shot family members age bracket different state still waiting list! bit complicated calculation that, given options (most likely) ""get J+J April"" ""get Pfizer/Moderna May/June,"" based estimated timelines. 

I wait, still think people going J+J route makes good sense (their life situation makes hard avoid higher-risk situations added two months, worried covid want go back second shot, etc.) I'm saying, get discharged hospital, go home. get ""stuck"" home government.

This situation ""you make poor decision effects yourself"". exact opposite that. 

Beating pandemic like this,. requires TEAMWORK collective effort ""as many people possible right things"". selfish ""I got mine screw everyone else"" attitude exactly exacerbates bad outcomes. Deaths also underreported.

This caught excess mortality current US data suggests accurate reporting covid deaths. 

The CDC website covering excess mortality shows we're right 1:1 death counts: Probably dumb question anti-vaxxers refuse get vaccinated, covid keep mutating among manages render vaccines ineffective?

Isn't thing? Covid likely contagious. Even asymptomatics articles I’ve read seem indicate seemingly effective reducing transmission well (with caveat still quite early say sure, hopefully going forward data confirm this).

Slightly reducing transmissibility end pandemic either. refuse! talking to? Literally I’ve said posts gun buybacks serve effective (albeit perfect) tool toolbox reducing overall prevalence guns.

You seem making lot assumptions policies support ones don’t literally zero basis here. particular one policy I’ve commented far (gun buybacks) absolutely real penalties associated it, clue “criminalizing citizens” supposed refer to. someone good links explanations Biontech/Pfizer corona vaccin works?

Well nobody prepared anything scale, nobody. hope end initiative need be, sort global rapid response infectious diseases information immediately available public infrastructure place research/design vaccines moment’s notice.

My sister brother law gotten jabs even though tried. 

Just going expectation re: Texas public health procedures waiting indefinitely. Yet first. Goes show way vaccinate people bizarre grab bag weirdness. think people upset this. handful pre-pub papers (many flaws pointed them) hardly basis declaring something true consequences wrong would thousands tens thousands lives. case needing err side caution solid confirmation thing likely true. anyone know much vaccine shipped directly pharmacies US next week? week figure \~2M, \~1M last week. healthcare professionals telling safe, safe. reason think know better tbh. wife got second shot relief. never scared covid kids. scared covid co workers. indicators strong though. Unemployment falling things open. Vaccines getting arms. Home prices soaring (at least west coast). see doom gloom all. True, also high risk populations mean everyone else *no* risk. one example, high schools, vast majority people (students 18) cannot vaccinated, yet share susceptibility virus young adults? students even conditions place high risk. 

I’m sure we’ll see, I’m sure it’ll vary place place. Good you! course terrible. u/CarlSagan79 said trend all, simply wrong. Yeah, fuck everyone 65!
Elderly first, future I'm saying historically inaccurate, I'm saying disagreed (even back then). think could ""crushed"" curve, rather ""flattening"" it. could helped us avoid last deadly wave Who's ""we?"" places become partisan issue try. either need great social buy-in dictatorship, neither Western countries could count on. Seat belts comparable analogy all. essential workers talking about? last line? Depending states roll saying March April pretty optimistic. Wisconsin isn’t opening people pre existing conditions mid April. general public follows probably late may/June they’re eligible. odd culture emergency services county live in. Firefighters cops make way EMTs paramedics. Additionally, firefighters often dispatched medical calls unless someone needs CPR pretty much useless. I’m denigrating firefighters EMTs/Paramedics technically skilled. pay disparity doesn’t make sense. It’s almost it’s baked culture. totally pro vaccine. don’t get force needle someone sake someone else. can’t compel blood donations, kidney donations, etc...this goes ethics. Seems like logic would land right stay home, rights restricted. right freedom ends another persons space, demands push well someone else's. That’s good answer. could argue seat belts basic safety measures way would stupid. contrast major UK parties support vaccination. takeup vaccinations far 90%. major parties insult every policy. vaccination. answer is: cannot within generation. Sure change always theoretically possible, amount cultural u-turns America whole would take achieve China/Australia/New Zealand levels collective action many. 

I personal experience Australia New Zealand, Chinese family China. 

With regard China, promise culture different anywhere America gets additionally, virus near zero across entire country.

 relatives northern China near Beijing, still hear extremely localized outbreaks, 1 2 apartment buildings across city. single case apartment building apartment building hard quarantined, full stop. Wuhan style, door locked, everyone's health code automatically updates signal exposed. Additionally, initially help delivery groceries community centers quarantined buildings, long since stopped. uncle repeatedly told dad tries hoard extra grains rice whenever possible, case family quarantined indefinite period time. biggest difference Chinese citizens extremely accepting this, kind like ""it is."" 

Also, vaccinating elderly China, timeline change. grandma China, 80, clue get shot, elderly friends. matter, actual idea getting vaccinated, uncle, aunt, cousins (varying ages professions early 20s early 50's) vaccines timeline them.

In sum, China, least entirely different world. America /could/ followed China, whether actually would different question. could least *tried* eradicate virus, like Australia, New Zealand, China etc. definitely tough lockdowns live life back normal (aka economy less affected). Man go on... brother covid positive boss told tell coworkers negative continue work... heard blackmailing workers money... Basically ""you going work dont get full payment"" course racism exists. problem housing Vancouver, China's Fentalyn much immigration. would anyone blame Asians covid?  worst situation is, closer herd immunity. backwards astounding. Look think stock market great looking federal reserve paper crisis. Nothing real something like 20% firms zombie companies, propped money printing fed. 

If think economy fmdoing great, must taking shallow look thing even works buying lot government propaganda like 3 trillion money printing equaling ""growth"". Perhaps part reason change certain news channel relentlessly pushes kids back school right now. saying right wrong, gets mentioned constantly. comparison smallpox bit insane. read research? 75% flu infections completely asymptomatic

Unless I’m misreading intent case apologize lol went EMT school early 20s. enjoyed school ambulance ER shifts, also realizing much money would get paid, immediately joined military lol. exact situation take personal defense seriously. cant trust cops save me.  
I bet teachers advocated armed after. That's I've personally abandoned COVID precautions bullshit back April 2020. mean, wear masks indoors fly Florida drink around bars I've never stopped hanging friends generally ignored pandemic could. great mood whole year get COVID either. Win win! Well does... sleep well knowing vaccines given immunity complications. I'm bothered long choice vaccine get. 1.43mil doses administered yesterday, 6.5mil distributed.

17.3% 18 first dose, 7.9% gotten both.  soon it’s open season high risk populations vaccinated extent willing so, need masks. 

Hospitalizations deaths trying eliminate. cases stock market single indicator economic health. also look things like median income, wealth distribution, unemployment, labor participation rates, home ownership rates, average education, many things. mention huge portion US economy publicly traded health market largely represents health relatively large companies top.  government mandates put foreign substance body. fundamental invasion privacy? 
Fine! don’t get participate public life. Talk utterly absurd gross overreach. get exist Earth shunned won’t put substance body. you’re cool I’m glad you’re making decisions anybody. 

In US I’m sure would problem two equal application laws such. It’s also political problem could impact hot button issues like abortion. 

I fully plan getting shot(s) forcing people pretending don’t exist refuse far. OK, full. requires Watch. think there’s middle ground least cut way spread people continue wear masks planes high risk activities people don’t avoid vaccines “I’m young healthy cares?” Lmao, what? That's blatant lie, stop upvoting guy. 99,9 % closed shops restaurants remain closed.

The problem people respecting rules precautions workplace, cooperating hygiene stations (i.e. reporting close contacts) breaking quarantine isolation rules. worry, post (which second upvotes thread BTW) removed. Fucking mods.... Haha! unable interact socialise peers absolutely good children's wellbeing development. Especially young age. matter fact.

Relying parents homeschooling sub-optimal method learning, absolute murder social mobility. also matter fact.

The challenge politicians keep virus control whilst also trying minimise real negative effects. one knows right now. sharing distribution plans approved use. mean, work counselor homeless shelter it’s high exposure job. qualified vaccine I’m healthcare worker, job scheduled vaccine clinic TOMORROW I’m fucked opportunity. anyone weak false positive SD Biosensor / Roche Antigen test?

No positive result within 15-30 minutes, 2 hours light pink stripe ""T"". 

But PCR came back negative...  May wrong believe J&amp;J tested participants without symptoms, whereas Pfizer tested participants symptoms. I’m guessing Pfizer may missed asymptomatic cases, could captured J&amp;J trial. sure explains efficacy differences. That's science work. Even 99% sure, still experiment controlled reproducible conditions verify. Francisco place harm reduction came HIV sexual health. Therefore, surprised scientists San Francisco (out loud, anyway) speaking need harm reduction San Francisco came COVID-19 protection.

Not surprising all... purely political. Saying anything people gay sex would seen veiled homophobia, there’s nothing wrong telling people can’t see person all. Yup... I'll passing I'm offered. mRNA novavax (when approved) please. really think teachers unions fought tooth nail avoid going back work would agree that? less zero chance public rallies behind paying it.  Herd immunity goal, be. saying herd immunity ever % moot point currently used people seem kind perverse incentive keeping locked long possible.

I would avoid possible, felt terrible second shot decide take NSAID drugs, may minor effect level immunity I'm worried personally. Lucky. (Well w/o pandemic) spent time EIfel region Germany. could literally travel neighboring countries matter couple hours less (by car)

France 6pm long time. can’t even go supermarket 6.30pm

They may call lockdown. I’d agree. I’d say worse. “Learning disability” means something different UK US, it’s confusing. US means reading math disability. would reason prioritize vaccines. UK refers intellectual impairment, eg people syndrome. would reasons priority surprising fast approved, fast developed. 

This fastest ever timeline new virus becoming known viable vaccine it. usually takes twice long happen. 10+ viable vaccines around world within year. insane. love threads get purged. Everything must highest “quality”. Y’all censor way much. sure get asking, many commas. asking wed choose magic freeze Covid button? asking people would choose vaccine given currently understood science distribution strategies? experience coughing, fatigue nausea keeping food literally impossible covid appetite shrunk much smaller before.

Using extreme case one average comparing incredibly disingenuous. expected. Numbers always higher Wednesday Tuesday.

There's really way conclude otherwise accept facts everyone reporting. problem sourcing then, ""every health official US snd UK"" promising right Ask state. least they’ve slowed Tiger Woods babbling don't, definition basically encapsulates time person communicates idea intention behind it. That's broad definition effectively useless. 7-day average daily vaccinations US markedly decreased since middle month. According [this reached peak average 1.72m shots day 16th. Yesterday average dipped 1.4m shots day. comparison, beginning month 1.36m average shots day. 

I expecting something like happen due nasty winter weather time, expect much decrease. worried this?  love man's blog. source informed wisdom throughout pandemic. Fuck yeah. Go pack go Lol 7 deaths placebo group techniques officially approved yet, still temporary emergency use authorizations? 100% correct - I’m largely talking see rules actually change (mask mandates removed, fans stands, etc.).

People (like me) relative shut-ins probably start venturing world late March early April high-risk people vaccinated cases plummet. Nothing wrong opinion - I’m actually super excited it. Yep, I'm member. strike 2004 hurt us bad. fucking Teamsters didnt back us. trucks never left yard. Instead drove store, made management back docks. Big whoop. 12-13 dollars hour, even keys.

ND's cases going down. go while, appears way back down. people calling ""bureaucracy"" medical scientific 

No. They're not. Full stop.

SOME steps include medical scientific experts. steps include subject matter experts.

This really difficult concept know can't seem wrap head around it.

Imagine this. 4 balls line. red, yellow. tell pick red balls, pick balls - including yellow ones - that's incorrect. even though balls, red.

Moving scenario. multiple signoffs. signoffs experts immunology, pandemics, related subject matter experts. OTHERS - they're signoffs political appointees (in specific case we're talking person cancer specialist - expert related pandemics whatsoever.)

Do understand now? choice long covid dying, think I'll take long covid. 

Vaccines limited supply right now, let's take get.   dumbest thing I've read day. Georgia doesn’t according worldometer doesn’t. means 2 times year. Look links. appreciate background, honestly taken personally (or even difference opinion, honest). initial comment replied responding someone vaccinated today enough go back normal today. clearly already understand agree that.

The rest details discussed (such exactly far vaccines need go) minor nature given good amount think about. especially liked statement herd immunity *not* goal, since that’s usually argument hear made. raise good point.

Anyhow, thanks discussion. I’ll check article mentioned too.  FTP No, never said that. trust it, knows effects like 5 years, I'm anti-vaxxer means I'm glad people willing try it. trust man. Good luck everyone though, I'm sure I'll get downvoted hell response like comment oh well. Stay safe guys Turning light source dark room makes room less dark.  Haha yeah. Hopefully existing vaccines able curb spread enough reduce rate mutation allow vaccinations need updates less less often. mean vaccine side effects? experience? Mine felt like mild flu 24 hours, found bearable actually sick since knew cause would temporary.  Swedish government said Wednesday would reduce opening hours restaurants, bars cafes well tighten limits number people allowed shops seeks ward third wave COVID-19 pandemic. 			  government said would propose restaurants cafes would close 8:30 p.m. March 1. adds previous ban alcohol sales 8 p.m. already place. 																		  also said number people allowed shops malls would restricted would provide details measure shortly. wow responsibility, finally. huge autonomy good reason. haven’t it. provide source (or multiple)? haven’t heard would ever know imaginary statistics testing insufficient like proposing be? bought Russia (Sputnik V) delayed couple times able secure much now.

They also got Israel vaccinate health workers. I'm actually referring news. done, start production, new variant dominant. Stay reddit bit  yeah, man. go look numbers ffs You’re misunderstanding person said. “it” willing get vaccine, COVID itself. info two approved vaccines including get one officially approved yet officially info. I'm reading though might quite effective, requires single shot stored much manageable temperatures. also virus vector vaccine instead mRNA could possibly mean particular vaccine could issue people egg allergies, can't say certain. Lol what’s girlfriend? ultimately LA times choosing language interpretation Dr. Chiu's comments. really get post deleted asking source I'm almost positive misinformation, left misinformed post up? too. trooper first 9 months. I'm going downhill fast. vaccine 5% efficacy?

That's imaginary statistic probably pulled thin air. fact remains vaccines developed shortly pandemic started. Thousands people died bureaucracy blocked access them. reddit post vaccine proven great, today bureaucracy still blocking access to. Go Pack Go 12 year old kid 12-17 trial it’s two months long. done late April. issue kids 12. hear lot messaging bad ideas even fully vaccinated.

I mean, sure, don’t yet know vaccinated people still carry/transmit disease. Like described, get-together amongst friends vaccinated essentially safe...amongst them. don’t know could cause spread amongst themselves, spread people may come contact *aren’t* vaccinated yet. That’s problem.

Again, measure 100% effective make compromises eventually/once people vaccinated, answer first guy upset current vaccination doesn’t give free pass “go back normal.” miss girlfriend I’m sure mean that. seatbelt laws. South Carolina’s health department (DHEC) saying might move next phase 2-3 weeks. hope I’m teacher we’re phase last time gave estimate said could January 15th. I’m cautiously optimistic. likely approved within 5 days Stop. Slow down. Take deep breath. go back read wrote instead arguing. 

Those people calling ""bureaucracy"" medical scientific experts. 

You want job without giving time job? 

Brilliant friend. Just... brilliant. exactly experts allow random people internet control government function. make sense without covid true. wear masks fuckerz refuse polio vaccine, we? stupid reasoning. recent evidence mRNA vaccines highly effective one dose, I'd like see US officials discuss possibility increasing 2nd dose delay \~12 weeks. US administered 1st dose 45M people. US expecting take delivery \~120M vaccine doses end March. went first doses, could vaccinate \~60% adult population early April, get 80% adult population late April, get people second shot time June. Even asymptomatic people suffering long term COVID effects, don’t want roll dice vaccine says ‘you’ll get mild COVID now’, want total protection. So... agree likely countries poor non-existent health infrastructures probably faired significantly worse 1st world countries? no-go zone? Asking friend. can't see situation approved within next two weeks People 60s dying 10-50x often 30s. know biggest comorbidity COVID is? Age. essential worker, immunocompromized, anything else. Old people die COVID. Vaccinate them, less people die.

In Connecticut, 37 people ages 30 39 died COVID. 951 people 60-69 died COVID.(1) despite fact people 30s gotten COVID 60s, means people 60s dying almost 40 times often. think get vaccine first?

Kudos Connecticut intelligent Thank you. idea may happened region? Yeah imagine able take health reason. employer right know health? Seems really fucked up. white people? Maybe one that's racist. dare question J&amp;J vaccine r/Coronavirus.  I’m conflicted 

On one hand, agree really sucks (with life threatening condition) wait behind healthy 55 year olds.

That said, like CT’s age-tier system. It’s simple, restricted specific job title arbitrary bullshit. know plenty people want vaccine “might” qualify, uncertain due state-imposed restrictions who’s jobs “essential” “qualified” particular tier. realize one biggest indicators individuals life expectancy financial stability right? Poverty kills far far people covid does. fact brush honestly disgusting I’m excited hear don’t want participate society. UK give half shot. live NC I’m glad 9pm curfew gone. get work 9:30pm usually could never anything after. Hoping summer go stay bars till 2am instead 11pm. Honestly pretty impressive France managed keep curve flat second lockdown need third lockdown save hospitals. localised lockdown better waiting get worse everywhere go back lockdown. last mostly less day.

Only President literally forced take short amount time. FDA indicated would several days. Trump said ""approve today I'll fire hire someone else approve steps involve experts justifying positions

This make sense. already have. done previous step. Besides, person who's signing expert. would even make sense?

The person signing *not* reviewing medical validity. bureaucratic signoff. normal times, would provide check fraud abuse committee. normal times, signoff provides value. still it, take hours days. close beaches drownings.

/s Point work home. Many can’t. Defining act teaching essential one thing, say it’s necessary classroom full children another. Perhaps part problem teachers aren’t taught distance teach, maybe needs part curriculum future. Yup, best part everyone crowding system May 3rd realistically like June 3rd. subscribe NYT live NYC middle school age daughter. 

Since vaccines introduced, including many teachers, primary school closures dropped 275 Dec 3 currently. 

Beyond that, goalpost moving. point NPI never eradicate Covid get herd immunity. prevent hospitalizations deaths. People get sick, always always will. vaccinating HR groups means people largely recover home, own. end. 

I highly educated I’m sorry taken difference opinion personally. said, masking appropriate high risk groups received shots benefit reflected hospitalizations deaths. believe around Memorial Day maybe July 4. schools require masks September daughter comply. suggest must wear masks hospitalization death risk mitigated insane contributes vaccine apathy. Please see excellent NYT article topic- “Vaccine Alarmism”. Yeah, I'll wear mask plane forever that's gonna be. Whatever. bars 50% capacity whatever October? lmao administration could made higher purchase offer.  clue think related topic hand. would restrictions back place October? Also, President's Day last week lowered numbers reported Monday Tuesday last week, makes normal Monday Tuesday seem like things getting worse. smooth next day two. suspect there’s significant overlap anti-vaxxers anti-maskers, reinfection Covid rare, there’s decent chance they’ll resistant Covid one way another.  I’m waiting point check coronavirus news. I’m thinking it’s close family get second doses. pandemic over...for me. r/covidiots still pretty doom gloom day. don’t like people “whining” missing important life events lol. Yep. It’s possible issues/questions needed resolved. Happens pretty regularly. flu vaccine administered primary school age 10/11 - daughter every year, although compulsory. Thank you, I’m sorry grandma. states cities keeping restrictions place population sufficiently vaccinated cases low. 

Then we’re page, since individuals fall restrictions. also effective variants. far know, effective. goal whatever going least net harm. goal herd immunity comes absolutely insane costs make unreasonable goal. Thank taking time tell father, really gives bit hope. states cities keeping restrictions place population sufficiently vaccinated cases low. However, individual level fail see damage done. We've far cases country world half million citizens dead. would send vaccines anywhere citizens opportunity vaccinated?

You'd feel exact way shoes. Maybe it’s also fact kids haven’t learned anything year distanced learning doesn’t work  Well taxes restaurant employees? going take months then. wish would've moved teachers head line public getting anxious wanting babysitters back. I'm 40s Pfizer. first shot bad, sore arm little lethargy. second shot less arm pain dizziness 102 degree fever 8 hours. fever kept night pretty exhausted next day. wife Moderna similar experience, less fever severe headache. worth it, rough. right defining irony. irony mean? Well, vast majority time irony focal point meaningless internet debates irony is, defined something example irony. parents moderna shots. dad didn’t side affects. mom body aches lasted one day. I’m typing got vaccine. One step closer normalcy! Well, wouldnt go far say everything good teaching home, certainly isn’t same. It’s obviously beneficial students educationally emotionally/socially. 

I also going say, “no thanks” giving snow day see happens! certainly don’t need understand extremely essential tradesman truck drivers are. guys wrong. Science universal. Humanity progressed, belong one nation another. question facilities resources particular country. Knowledge secretly restricted nation. Also consider flu season lasts ~5 months, like 400 deaths per day flu season. typical flu season would see average around 240 deaths per day season.

I also expect see deaths 1000/day average end March. rapid drop deaths mirroring rapid drop cases occurring. Cases fallen 70% peak, deaths lag cases. cases half rate 3 weeks ago, I'd expect deaths 3 weeks today half - getting us 1000 deaths per day week spare end March.

Our case fatality rate also drop substantially next couple months vulnerable people vaccinated. surprised see deaths 250/day end April. i'd rather direct tweets Dr. Chiu virology team UCSF, provided info ""California' variant LA Times. Shooting &amp; silencing messenger always bad idea. counter-arguments scientific theories better hash open, news sources discuss pro's con's let reader decide real risk. statistician aware drawbacks using generalized averages population specifically mentioned averages non immune compromised adult even lower.

In state less 10 confirmed deaths 20 30 age group. matter cut cake that’s tiny risk Sure, UK US gave investment money help change factories able make vaccine. EU didn’t AZ using former Novasep (now Thermofisher) facility Belgium. Vaccines provide 100% prevention hospitalisations trials. Congrats! Californians ignored Newsom’s stay home orders went shopping ate like normally would do.

Are even California speaking state absolutely case. live heart downtown Los Angeles I've seen first hand difference stay home order place every single night. Downtown ghost town dining ban stay home order, nothing here. moment lifted people came again. Oh fuck off, government cautious, want economy open safe Yes, Philly completely different beast. appt early March pharmacy 1st dose- made late January. was/am registered every possible pharmacy health system. Crickets. Pretty cool. examples mRNA vaccines Covid-19? majority people laws? No. us first place. one wants social distancing masking. us going getting rid asap probably even using much mandates say to. 

You're comparing incomparable things. like jaywalking, we're supposed certain point cares? Police enforce mask mandates people best tolerant right plan keep them. Reminder data shows teachers risk covid, children extremely low risk, lower flu.

With great power comes great responsibility. rest us fact collectively moving life vaccination.

The comment replied literally guy bemoaning can’t yet “move life” vaccinated - clearly isn’t true.

Vaccination absolutely end game, yes, that’s vaccination *everyone* (or accurately, large majority), vaccination *you* individual. Biweekly change cases Europe: situation also ICU full, 748/800 ventilators use, doctors turn elder patients. [It may new confirmed yet.

Recreation retail activity far lowest region CZ, SK, think reason something different: rollout continue patchwork riddled inequities. I’m 40 qualifying pre-existing condition, FEMA state opened mass vaccination center street apartment (initially serving local residents first), able get appointment wife within minutes. qualify, still 80 year olds state haven’t able get appointment. That’s it’s going go.

When you’re eligible, maybe you’ll get lucky too. think vaccine hesitancy set much quicker people anticipate, young healthy people chomping bit vaccine easy time getting appointments “wait see” crowd refuses actively seek appointments Twitter alerts stuff.

They’re really enough help less tech-savvy people get appointment, least work advantage. get eligible, who've choose?

Right now, vaccine get depends vaccination site get appointment at. Vaccination sites use vaccine get first second dose location without potential mix-up. expect continue case going forward J&amp;J vaccine gets rolled out.

At least New York, site signups advertise vaccine type use, don't. expect vaccination sites acknowledge advance whether need followup appointment, easy indication whether getting J&amp;J vs Pfizer/Moderna.

Incidentally, right now, there's pretty easy rule thumb figuring sites use vaccine. Fixed location mass vaccination sites run state large cities well large hospitals mostly using Pfizer able handle special shipping logistics freezer storage requirements efficiently. Pharmacies, urgent cares, community health centers, smaller vaccination sites mostly using Moderna stored ordinary freezers need set special freezers Pfizer small number people getting vaccinated site. know exactly J&amp;J vaccine change things, even simpler storage requirements Moderna (doesn't even need frozen), lack followup appointments means use hard-to-reach populations trouble tightly timed followup appointments. Among things, imagine eventually super useful vaccinating homeless people walk-in vaccinations doctor's offices, pharmacies, pop-up sites, etc. lot difference current situation ""normal"" behavioral choices people make, government restrictions are. There's ton people live places COULD go eat restaurant, choose to. There's ton people staying home socializing family friends choice. see situation change, alter behavior. That's gonna happen lot people well people vaccinated. live far Berks - got shot Philly - guess different system? 2 oldest get shot #2 today downingtown area. aren’t millions doses shipped long ago waiting refrigerators everywhere? shipping really need wait approval? Pfizer $PFE superior efficiency  barber/stylist cuts outdoors... good promo business too! wears N95 requires clients surgical high-filter masks too. know gf's stylist actually takes weekly PCR tests prove clients she' clear, operates indoors longer periods time woman's cuts &amp; coloring, higher degree exposure. Huh?

That’s weird perception.

It isn’t certain news channel. It’s entire medical scientific field. Could bias influencing perception tune scientific evidence recommendation you’d change worldview? believe many epidemiologists fail weigh economic, social psychological factors decisions

That's job fault telling way see things. job politicians weigh many voices come coherent policy. Wish true area PA (Berks/Montco). Today’s way optimistic piece forgets remind people restrictions back place come October. issue isn’t enough science denying teachers still keeping schools closed select areas. 

When mention get vaccinated first, response vaccines don’t stop transmission. Everyone ever come contact also vaccinated go back work. 

I think thing needs happen unions allow teachers want go back districts still closed go back. rest... well, sit forever replaced. EU stop individual country buying either – everybody free approve buy whatever want.

In fact, Hungary already approved Sputnik Sinopharm started rollout latter, EU member states might follow.

The thing can't try bypass collective vaccine purchase deal secure doses first. 

What more, order EU buy those, manufacturers would first apply EU approval – far know, neither Russians Chinese decide so. 

And say Pfizer et consortes – sure, time countries buying signing contracts products yet made, made sense.

Right ball court vaccine manufacturers – trial data proving efficacy safety, submit EU they'll approval within weeks, money flowing soon after. Shaken faith almost understatement almost understatement although really surprising?

Imagine someone taking Tesla intel home Apple R&amp;D information home. always trials Think may go summer? part summer? NYC goes June anyway. Ok stock market isnt damn economy. austria found recently one biggest testing places vienna simply used random unemployed people slapped one uniforms them...any gave tests also almost training work US. Given acceptance issues people already masks all, see anyone accepting restricted freedoms government able offer vaccine. noticed lot covid skeptics sub reddit lately  Demanding *sovereign assets* collateral absolutely overkill undefendable. correctional facility shelter choice vaccine make available inmates, one(s) cheapest easiest store. Full stop. I'll tell know mrna vaccines places using J&amp;J AZ full swing. Cost cutting things like correctional facilities (similar programs tangentially related places services like homeless shelters). Virginia PA.  Sorry hear. know got ""learning disability"" mean something different UK US? I'm US would generally think dyslexia ADD learning disability, seems aimed folks might living group home. What? Schools closed almost last year. economy soared, DOW grew ever broke 30k last year. see connection schools economic health. anything, keeping kids school \_helped\_ economy seems... I've riding positive news wave last couple weeks, many us been. noticed days ago ND became state R0 1, every state 1.

Then noticed today SD reported 400 new cases reporting around 100 every day last weeks. 

Is something happening dakotas worried about? reading much it? figured two states confirmed cases per capita one highest numbers vaccines distributed per capita would closest herd immunity. seems like things beginning spread again, also soon tell trend hold weird blip. Maybe result people feeling like cases many vaccinated anything goes causing infections. insights? understand populations statistically risk. shouldn’t controversial anyone required work government goes front line. case teachers, doesn’t seem unreasonable schools reopen staff opportunity receive vaccine. Reopening schools vaccinating school staff members go hand hand terms importance. Would mind sending link? Makes sense. enough vaccinated return normal, enough vaccinated attend event significantly less risk exposure. doubt vaccination checks continue normal, atleast US, enough population gets shot. takes one decent mutation start new vaccine out. That’s experts big concern right now. 0 plans deal pray. Yes, criminal proceedings over, legal strategy works. Yeah, folks overseeing absolutely experts. might weeds reviewing data, absolutely reviewing - ability litigate - summaries/conclusions reviewers looked everything. There's 1 universal answer that. going vary person person (or day day circumstance circumstance). works (or sensible) someone lives small town Alaska,.. could entirely different thing someone lives high-rise apartment building downtown San Francisco. 


But wish people would slow little bit,.. spend bit time thinking problems through,. thinking choices behaviors effect others around them. 

For personally.. way approach problem-solving consider:

* Solutions fix things,. me. 

* Solutions fix things me,. everyone around me. 

* Solutions fix things me,. people around me.. also people come along time me. 

That 3rd option option striving for. (We always able achieve it.. worth striving for). 

If walk,. see trash ground,. pick up. notice unsafe situation (say:.. broken glass Apartment Building EXIT door).. Call report it. (or let neighbors know). 

Keep eyes awareness open things going around you.. react respond things ways higher selfish. 66% sure week. understand companies trying shield liability jesus christ asking *sovereign assets* put collateral overdoing it. Still bit shocked companies sheer gall even propose thing. feeling even dare attempt similar demand developed western/east asian states. No. meme that’s taken hold somehow, think people get bad flu like literally gatekeep say “if didn’t feel like dying wasn’t flu”, research shows [a ton flu infections mild they’re CDC site vaccine tracking going break F5 key today...  Thank injecting sanity shitshow thread. happy ultimatum across nation \_teachers\_ ages, risks, etc. full total access vaccine required return person. ifs, ands, buts it--no throwing smattering vaccine older people only, playing games hygiene theater like putting puny air purifiers classrooms windows, etc.

If getting kids back classrooms critical health nation, classify teachers \_essential workers\_ exactly nurses doctors ER. get vaccines get back normal. sooner.

Over read headlines company X 100M doses ready go, company found 200M doses, etc. etc. Well many millions doses vaccinating \_3.5 million teachers country\_ done \_a weekend\_! problem getting million people shots arms. Cheb district heading towards 0.5% population fatality rate. That's crazy. Totally ""in line"" steep incline anything. Check again. site linked actual numbers 2020 October.


The site linked UN estimate 2020 made pandemic. says right page linked near top page giant red box: ""NOTE: 2020 later data UN projections include impacts COVID-19 virus."" Imagine reading article use justify hatred lol

""DeSantis’ office respond questions Friday governor blamed Pfizer federal government’s apparent mistake"" comment front page: “The SA variant cannot cause reinfection.” firm known integrity.

Reddit slate company sucking dicks.
Hypocrites. always choice live network information. me, shot make feel scared Hey, Zune HD fire! demographics getting this? People 50? leave two 50s (those would worse symptoms infected). Didn’t drop lawsuit???
Gotta love 15 minutes fame. statistic, exactly? number dead since vaccines developed? risk COVID death among certain demographics?

Anybody declare *""It's called statistics""* handwave argument. validate anything. R0 Rt t=0. covid meant 100% susceptible population specific measures place. specific situation, something R0 ""is"". second modest bounty. point assume said think. Basically sounds like summer get finally birthday party outdoors without scolded Fall straight back restrictions. Weird   Reporter: ""Does vaccine protect new variant?"" 
Scientist: ""We studied yet, can't say definitively either way.""

News Headline: ""Scientists say vaccine may effective new variant!"" Spaghooter people skeptical mRNA shots bc that’s newer technology. fact think moderna Pfizer’s first vaccines type ever. don’t think scientific reason worry them, always inherent risk new tech - general lack experience, long term data, etc. Baby boom? Haha I'm convinced they're mostly paid trolls. plenty friends EU see quite clearly politicians screwed up, big time. thought 66% effective preventing ""moderate severe cases"" COVID-19 unlabeled, anyone even verify MSDS corresponds contents what's put bottle, short FTIR spectrometry? safety data sheet unidentified solution prove anything point. could hand MSDS say bottle, lol. 

Worried? Here's MSDS 409 Spray. armed police officer inside school - how'd work them? It’s never single person reviewing data approving drugs though, be. You’re going different reviewers looking different things - chemistry, microbiology, clinical, non-clinical, manufacturing. reviewers still write summaries/conclusions data, summaries reviewed collective someone them. 

There might day two saved reviewers on-site, that’s it. No, 15% people unprotected severe COVID J+J, that’s gnarly study, definition severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: signs consistent severe systemic illness, admission intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure death, among factors. [The CDC's slides suggest sure getting downvoted, general consensus seems covid stay human race, it'll probably end like flu. Eradicating pipe dream. likely we'll yearly vaccines/boosters keep immunity up. Glad approved hope timeline eligibility get Modena Pfizer. Yes they’re two shots they’re effective I'm fine able go school, ride public transit, enter grocery stores, etc, etc.

There way would happen UK. Better turn another baby powder scandal 20 years.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  r/wallstreetbets portfolio finally worth something. think need stop using 65% efficacy figure includes results South Africa Brazil (they tested variants intentionally). It’s misleading know none vaccines high efficacy variants. 

J&amp;J efficacy much higher non-variant Covid. It’s actually pretty good variants comparatively. counter argument process rushed way,

This would dumb argument, part rushed bureaucratic sign-off. experts allowed TONS time review data make decision. people allowed time people oversee experts. frankly, take five minutes. reviewing data they're qualified relitigate issue. Either believe experts went *right process*, don't. need signoff something blatant happening (i.e. believe bribes members committee, something like that.) THAT'S check multiple agencies checking multiple datasets

This happens, though. was, 3-week wait one group 2-3 day wait another. They're reviewing datasets. One reviewing datasets, one rubber-stamping. one person rubber-stamps rubber-stampers; level President rightfully put foot gave guy day. Government messed fall. failed call action epidemic board May September. infection started rise August massive deathwave arrived October nothing done. localized outbreaks one highest death toll Covid known world, instead dealing regional level; government applied lukewarm nationwide lockdown media accused rural areas overplaying infection. rest country dropped guards, media giving free reign populists, unified healthcare prevention front evaporated. 10% population got infected, preventative measures failed. became uncontrolled communal spread government way stop it. Society became tired Covid. pressure street minimize it, pressure medical community stop it, big deal presidency Zeman, usually poisoning system rhetoric, totally silent Covid. Sorry ask, genuine question. vaccine J&amp;J 66% effective preventing moderate severe Covid, mean average 1/3 people take vaccine get infected still moderate severe bout Covid? managed get access choose vaccine got take, would want vaccine Pfizer Moderna? Ask SDS, Safety Data Sheet. Covid obviously didn’t play enough Plague, Inc Yeah Europe kind fucked, mention Africa rest developed world live America that's country matters overall things going well half teachers, 40 received least first dose. (Not Healthcare)  Yeaa could be, might wrong cases started surging. still dinner table make sense me. First paragraph: Absolutely want. droves doctors epidemiologists quoted saying “we get life fine like this” variation. So, yes, damn right believe want. Life covid avoidance. 

Second paragraph: course not. able schedule wife day NY. Expo center State Fair showing 3 open appointments day select time slot. Called vaccine help line guy took call said inventory released top hour refresh page then. thought making get phone checked top next hour sure enough time slots later day. Snagged one got vaccine hours later. beginning month I'm sure process changed since might worth trying. cOnCeRnInG ""I've long concerned public health messages tailored people work home, people work tech people intact families need see people.""

So true. That's huge part Reddit (especially sub) loves lockdown much. Introverts go much pandemic get WFH working class ""people"" deliver groceries ""stay f home"". think Fauci said vaccines regular people would start distributed May idea think that. Maybe trying cope lowering expectations idk seems kinda weird Meanwhile work fucking professor chair chemistry fear-mongering vaccine.. way humans adequately quantify full complexity ""opening up"" mean level openness beyond case numbers begin rise continue fall. That's math. ""lockdown"" might effective one would imagine (probably people flout rules,) reducing exposure opportunities absolutely affects rate spread--that's means disease contagious; catch virus unless exposed it. reduce exposure opportunities adequately, final surge. rapidly spreading affects amount time take competitive variants dominate. reason ""goal posts"" ""mobile"" course pandemic affected collective actions. That's point. hold back variants' spread limiting exposure enough people vaccinated, fourth surge. 

You think best err side less economic/psychological impact risking extra 100,000 deaths fail keep R 1.0 better certainly saving lives risking greater economic impacts. agree logical position. opinion based reality insist collective actions, whether influenced policy personal responsibility, impact number people get sick die, pretend precautions cause collateral damage benefit. defies infectious disease works.

(BTW, California's more-contagious variant CAL2.0C already accounts 50% cases state. Southern California fared much worse holidays Florida, Northern California, people compliant restrictions, much smaller surge. California's peak higher Florida's, California's numbers falling much steeply Florida's.) answer 2 questions last word. new information first dose Pfizer Moderna start give immunity? remember initial Pfizer trial said effect around Day 12... Yess, that's really bad beginning Czech Republic exemplary Europe world well. political crisis beside covid guess. One health Minister goes another comes since pandemic. best wishes Czech Republic, lovely country lovely people. Hope everything start getting better Everything cost. State budgets absolutely destroyed dealing covid whatever slow spread.

Other programs suffer....toxic waste sites won’t get cleaned up, roads won’t improved, drug rehab programs won’t get funded...reductions programs cost lives well it’ll dispersed harder pin single number on. there's anything take away nobody cares we're doomed Yesterday, CDC reported number vaccinations pretty early day, many. Today, longer. mean doses? Fauci actually said “relatively back normal— masks.” also said things could better worse.

Since made statement, positive news effectiveness stopping asymptomatic infection greater protection strains come out. J&amp;J much better numbers initially thought.

Just look Australia media. month ago, talking locked another year. news talking beginning open international travel summer vaccinated. lot vaccine excite coming legitimately good news trials vaccinated countries. researcher use common sense.

I'm support *not* rushing technical / expert overview. support eliminating non-technical rubber-stamping.

Seems pretty simple me. And, guess what, worked great! Looks like I'm right wrong. Pandemic ends hospitalization death non-overwhelming levels. goalpost moving utter bullshit Cases hit 30k first time since mid-November...things definitely trending towards ""better"" here. takes time humans prepare read digest things. information can't magically absorbed. best thing post idea advanced Israel actually is. Los Angeles announced moving Tier 1B educators, food service &amp; agriculture workers &amp; first responders. LOT jobs listed eligible lot people. Wonder long take vaccinate them.

There soooo many industries jobs covered new tier. Seems like it'll easy people slip in. point really care, guess. I'm waiting turn whatnot, guess really care someone says they're restaurant worker.

I wish standby system people show appointments, people list called end day. randomly checked online vaccine supersite day 35 appointments listed available still mid-afternoon. friend another county saying seeing openings well towards end day. know doses got used eventually, would nice know are. Would dumb jabbing many arms possible every day restrictive non-sense annoying. unfortunate though I'm already hearing people moving onto Flu saying ""gee...no flu year...we *THIS* future!"" 

It's mystifying suddenly care Flu spending full year talking Flu bad anti-science piece shit dare say word ""Flu"" sentence Covid (and fully recognize Covid much, much worse Flu, record...) timeline approving single-dose version Pfizer shot (or precise, stop requiring second dose)? Israel seems suggest regimen effective (if more) -- would seem crush pandemic faster switching single-dose (or least well delaying second dose) Well hurry fuck jesus christ changing. US increased vaccine output significantly every week... one cares anymore piss rope CNN. Nothings gonna happen. Archived link: I’m teacher (at school open kids campus) whole year, immediately thrown clothes washer soon get home work. I’m feeling really good decision now. think reason high cases? That’s exciting! Congrats! notorious “single girl” dates lot never find anything lasting. I’m excited friends finally see someone. Yep, pretty much exactly like that. well, retract claim. Let said disregard evidence.

As stressing out: I've gotten screaming walls maybe... 10-15 times day, marked improvement. source gloom emerged briefing last week. Academic researchers warned vaccination alone might induce sufficient herd immunity stamp virus. unhappy combination imperfect vaccine efficacy, suboptimal take-up super-infectious variants could derail attempts reach herd immunity threshold, R falls one virus begins dissipate. Modelling University East Anglia corroborates unpalatable possibility.   major worry countries poorly controlled transmission might acting production lines dangerous new variants. current vaccines work high-profile variants including B.1.1.7, dominant UK, good fortune might last. Yeah paywalled. maybe? also much better getting Covid getting shot. yes, know works. Polio smallpox eradicated vaccines enough people vaccinated. Unlike you, science pulling whataboutisms imagination.

Even Spanish flu lost ability transmit enough people antibodies. accepted Israeli vaccine past token amount least.
It’s circular meantime people aren’t getting vaccinated.  Thank telling - idea. asking morning. best part vaccines created weeks. entire rest time testing. feeling annual covid boosters may thing on. trial considered this, decided it. I’ll go J&amp;J single shot expect sometime fall variant booster could mRNA vaccine. 

I see difficult problem repeated adenovirus vector shots mix matching mRNA vaccines. immune system eventually start attacking adenovirus vector used multiple shots. third best? I've used 4 (likely knockoff) N95's since April. Nice pipe dream. never go back normal. cars essential too.. No, reason 1) medical ethics 2) understanding scientific process. Sometimes two better one ;) go ahead shipping need mean time? so, really doesn’t matter it’s approve tomorrow Monday, long ship arms next week. recall hearing exact thing, time year, last year.

Happy too!!! publications third biggest country world, that's stupid point make  Florida hiding dead bodies? evidence? referring crack pot fired opened data site exact numbers public health site. might dumb question, even big reason vaccinate children, considering virus largely affect all?

If answer ""well prevent spreading someone risk"", risk person one needs vaccine more?

(And I'm anti vaxx all, I'm genuinely curious) 100% valid argument, vaccines followed book turned perfectly safe.

The counter argument process rushed way, without multiple agencies checking multiple datasets, one vaccines could harmful would eroded trust vaccines made much harder vaccinate public, perhaps setting back months even beyond year. I’m quite young, early 20s. haven’t really experienced much sore arm lethargy. people med class chills, headaches fevers, nothing major! 
I’ll keep posted anything changes next day! 
I believe Moderna quite hectic side effects though? J&amp;J minor apparently. Vaccines children arent planned ready september. youre parent teacher wont   Okay, thanks insight. I'm sure scientific researcher scientist health policy expert? Fauci colleagues wrote currently, interim data Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine suggested vaccine 72% effective COVID-19 U.S., 66% effective Brazil 57% effective South Africa. 

I'm starting tip ethics J&amp;J vaccine. suppose there's nothing stopping someone getting mRNA vaccine period time, round specific group second time next year booster shot (which presumably needs DIFFERENT adenovirus vector immune to) variants selected individuals seems unwise.

We close vaccinating vulnerable US well, ramp mRNA vaccines full swing. Waiting little longer might mean waiting couple weeks. fully accept vigorously disagree, want say understand reasoning reach conclusion. Way downplay what’s still going on. Talk people work morgues LA. ""Across 51 locations, median COVID-19 infection fatality rate 0.27% (corrected CDC last updated pandemic planning scenarios scenarios 1 2 consistent WHO's IFR computation, though IFR's divided serological studies like following recent months almost always come back 0.3% less range. OC example IFR computed South Africa open 143k excess deaths pandemic period, like everyone else's excess deaths track COVID population would least bad United States, despite South Africa quite bit younger country. Wait people seeing friends all?? cannot fathom that.  look forward day praise people going way get vaccinated instead vilifying them.   It’s black white issue.

You stop treating like one. Uh huh, less deaths attributed cancer get listed where? Thank unwittingly making argument trying dismiss conspiracy. diagnosed cognitive dissonance? exhibiting clear signs it. right swing fist ends face.

If want get vaccinated, body certainly want state force you...but I'm fine able go school, ride public transit, enter grocery stores, etc, etc. include dyslexic people?? might make lifetime terrified read loud minimal zero trust towards officials incapable too. example almost 200k vaccines central storage several weeks gov incapable select logistic company. Completely ignoring multiple private companies/startups offering help it.

Comments like ""current covid crisis nobody fault"" downplaying covid victims car accidents Ministry Health help either.

At start work together, leadership. empty PR lies. disaster here.  scientific experts signed first two phases (first, trial group drug company; second, FDA.)

Anything useless bureaucracy safety value-add. also intentionally lied herd immunity threshold Pharmacists going save country ppl still cuss us blame us everything month Can't wait Nolan film situation.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Why?

When panel scientific experts declare safe, value add 3 separate sets bureaucrats rubberstamp?

It's making maybe 0.0000000000001% safer delay weeks thousands people per day die. make sense.  not? clearly saves lot lives. Yes set goal/threshold/metric reach lifting restrictions rather particular date.

But don’t goals/thresholds/metrics lifting restrictions full normal US (with exception Utah maybe). can’t that??? “Do til say so” isn’t good enough 

And yes think people aware gradual. think people want actual plan though still burn heavy shipping oil isn’t great, still.

The fact vacation outside home city awful planet. honest, idk information, best tell best thing planet close dead possible sequester carbon permanently. Maybe watch YouTube play video games wait worms 

But seems bit extreme. guess it’s hard square fact didn’t ask misery born seems inhumane allow inefficiencies sake making time earth bearable worked cashier grocery store right pandemic started quit immediately someone thanked service like solider. knew going, soldiers get shit either. Lol work least keep offering hazard pay while. summer though. 150 extra every two weeks. able get vaccine yet pregnant woman cant? Seriously curious. share potentially infected bodily fluids strangers, would share potentially infected air?

Okay masks 100% effective. never been. either proposing stop breathing start wearing hazmat suits we're *always* sharing potentially infected air.  mean death count IFR similar 20th pandemic flu events, Spanish flu 1957 pandemic flu example.

So word “flu” vague. know right! happened Brazilian one? Haven’t heard anything lately completely understand desire keep children safe. it'd foolish acknowledge effect virtual school educational social development. goes long, lost generation kids mentally fucked this. truly hope able get fine. Reducing community spread important well. everyone get vaccinated. also considerations mutation could change equation, case want front-line essential workers better defense help protect economy. Another spike and/or lockdown would really bad already damaged economy, even vulnerable populations protected. it’s fact. It’s truth. It’s “a strong possibility” according one guy. 

I could say “it’s strong possibility everyone California catch Covid week”, doesn’t make true.  both? point tired lockdown/pandemic go work/home/vid games/watch tv/go walks/vid calls family friends. lacking human compassion/contact say essential care vaccinated care anymore take seriously even though variants could come play causing others harm essential care anymore guess vaccinated. Pretty much somes up. 

I'm essential essential enough get vaccinated sure luckier complain alot lucky already vaccinated others still waiting.  Perhaps handwashing habit we've *diligently cultivated* pandemic help us?  big reason I'm coming think might best vaccinations fully age ignoring everything else. 

Actually, state Connecticut exactly believe not, happened last days previously vaccine priority groups like state. surprised see states follow next weeks next group eligibility opens up.  Yeah go vaccine passport route, please. Flash card you’re in. Much better going this. I’m perfectly fine using vaccine passport get places next 12-18 months. big deal all. attitude, silly ;) Schools gotta safety systems place first bruh. Vaccines help that, enforced systems social distance mask wearing plans hybrid models etc. still acknowledge horrible disease killing lot people.

Well there's strawman! acting people addressing think horrible disease that's killing people. you? Mother Teresa? Right that’s was. Thanks dude. bet see states start strategies lifting restrictions.
I'm opposed snowball effect. saw initial lockdowns. pass sniff test anybody? people really believe wiped flu map?  No, pretty sure that’s shipping containers. ship burning bunker oil would awful since it’s dinosaur equivalent fryer scum Oh, I'm getting vaccine soon can. girlfriend nurse (fully vaccinated point), I'm counting days get it. take seriously wear masks try avoid larger groups people. realistic assume people keep past year vaccines fail due variants counteracting measures taken. sure make thing think ""science get me"". think ignoring fact people begin move even variants happen great detriment, naive. Science viruses draw line, people do. already see past year people give shit. honestly believe, another year, two, three level compliance society? Deflecting what? half million deaths? defend death Americans free? kind suspicious studying virus Wuhan gets realized there.

Then China silences doctor tried warn people. later died catching covid helping patients early days.

Finally, China let investigate? not? cam US, Canada, England would allowed full investigation.

I've China 3 times, markets like never seen bats, heard it.

Not saying that's truth. suspicious tho imo. acknowledge covid problem think number people actually deny existence covid pretty small. 

However, think number people, especially public health officials US, still clutch pearls say something along lines “we global pandemic!! time double restrictions!! you’re good might reach slight semblance something could conceptualized normality within year two” non-response someone asking restrictions lifted pretty high 

Basically, people previously thought reasonable say covid problem/isn’t real, fair amount people extreme, sick two things mutually exclusive

I agree, people making plans people live lives US, seem mutually exclusive  Yeah, trusting lot latam governmenta right now, specially Argentina this. Vaccines ass Yeah, don’t switch “bunker fuel” they’re international waters? Isn’t like bunch extra pollution? people arms. think depends live too. crowded subway train NYC, I'm sure masks make huge difference. Otherwise, one person coughs dozens others immediately exposed. 

If live area close contact people social setting, see point. even then, hard wear mask see happens empirically? Everyone stockpile now; see harm continuing wear mine covid over. Thanks catching screw up...after sat 11 hours. LOL That’s shipping vessels, don’t think people would want boat burning bunker oil. Amazon package fault there, boomers love boring ass planned excursions “researchers noted dramatic burst upper respiratory infections shortly children returned schools daycares October 2020” thing happened home. Kid got sick school took doctor runny nose covid test. expect dramatic uptick illness actually dramatic uptick needless visits doctor fear rona explain ""massive drop flu hospitalisations?""
Last year flu ignored possibility SARS-CoV-2. photo link previous post new york last year shows flu disappeared medicare paying $39k covid $5k flu. looked testing. Ask doctor look tell covid flu without test. Please dont believe me.

What fanatic experiment watched. flu stopped stopped people flying Asia year. year drop stopped flights Asia could never test would happen.

""American Airlines, Delta, United announced suspensions service United States China.""

""Most influenza viruses infect humans seem originate parts Asia"" 

""Russell said colleagues found year since 2002 new strains influenza (H3N2), infectious variety seasonal flu, originated ""the east Southeast Asian circulation network,"" spans Malaysia western Indonesia Korea Japan. virus showed Europe North America six nine months later—and continued South Grow people worse past year. Mentally upset going work, back home everyday playing vid games/watching movies/vegging out/video calls family friends man BUMMER.

 People lost lives people can't wear mask follow basic guidelines. guidelines followed causing unemployment allowing virus continue spread/mutate. Maybe encouraged everyone take serious since Jan 2020 no. people take seriously probably ones complaining now. reason timeframe literally timeframe. Nobody wants say, ""we go back normal May 4th,"" May 4th comes something horrible happened can't go back normal.

It's going on/off switch. going gradual, starting literally speak.  Oh makes sense - thanks clarifying. nah.  Lol Damn. millions doses made vaccines already. think Johnson unlike others exporting initial production? yet contract prevents it? fucking remember capes. gold given customer service managers. Meanwhile, week, self-checkout cashiers wear bag stickers it. Easily turning point time working Walfart. lol, science viruses don’t draw line cause you’re bored one get scientific community. hopefully vaccines work completely boosters aren’t even needed might - that’s reality, get feel making proclamations give power largely uncontrollable situation... whatever gets guess 🤷🏻‍♂️ last large virus besides influenza probably 102 years ago reminds use growler bottles craft beer industry like learning data via science. Science isn’t what’s desired learnt. Science process understand things Well read comments thread talking US cases, worldwide cases. following worldwide cases, I've tracking US cases can't accurately speak pretend to.

That said, I've tracking US data months developed feel data gets weird - times. past week we've seen bunch data/reporting anomalies think smoothed next week. teachers?? loser. Good luck 😂 said ""hero pay"" sidestep saying ""hazard pay"" cause they'd implicitly admit fuckin dangerous is. True, totally OK. Idk you’re downvoted speaking strong possibility, guess subreddit ready move know else going spare B.C. coast sewage? new sewage plant Victoria B.C. opened. Yep, they've dumping raw sewage since 1894. plant serve thing like 300,000 people (can't find exact numbers). always were.  Curious know would happen much lethal virus caused pandemic, something Ebola magnitude, able convince people use mask enforce it? could set dangerous precedent. I'm assuming there's way repeal shit ever really hits fan? people ever believe warnings future scenario plays viruses politicized? I’m paramedic wearing 7700 mask p100 filters majority calls. Working thing, carrying people up/down stairs, trying communicate radio ever patients fucking exhausting.

I received second dose yesterday. There’s still calls I’ll wearing 7700, it’s going lot less frequent. I’m goddamn excited. aching jaw sore throat shouting, struggling communicate.   Same. Sore arm mild headache/fatigue bad all. know COVID, I've tested weekly since June. Open state get recalled Newsom. would get there, would get anywhere. want damn vaccine, want OP moot point Israel likely inject every kid country soon enough, allowing everyone else approve without wasting time trial. referring essential workers retail/hospitality/etc. yet vaccine-eligible inconvenience able go bar? think start prioritizing people certain jobs, e.g. teachers grocery workers etc  though? lately even mention sort negative thought possibility gets downvoted hell Great news except fact teacher household going back classroom April.

Ready! Shoot! Aim! Essentially sacrificial...... Rise shine, Sammy! There’s nothing wrong people getting help. don’t think it’s something need doesn’t mean others feel way. Like said people real ptsd trauma ocd seek treatment. People decide want do. US problem US effective relevant country

This comment. directing at. Also ban exports kinda better everyone. 

But point comment. USA effective country. changed mine Darude - Sandstorm couple weeks ago. also turned Disturb mode, I’m prone fall asleep suddenly due sleep issues. Long story short, I’ve scared fucking hell multiple times Darude - Sandstorm. It’s hilarious. don’t care yet work essential worker gotten vaccinated. You’ll never get point. wonder many cases flu misdiagnosed Covid though. could sell refills. containers exchanged company reuse. read article? offered vaccine declined it. Exactly this. expendable forced work sub-par working conditions. pfizer, moderna jnj actually produce said, think could see 3M/daily 2 weeks. regularly clipped 1M doses first shots early Feb, 2nd shots coming due come new distributions. Im confused many vaccines coming March July everyone vaccinated Kids 12 won’t eligible summer 2022. That’s 20% population right there. 
People better start waking it’s mask mandates summer 2022. Next reason “remember, kids can’t vaccinated yet...”   Time holding up, time us. I'm beginning think unless EU blocks vaccine exports needs met, never going get vaccination program unstuck. point facilities manufacturing vaccine, economy going shutdown additional 6 months?

The EU made enough missteps handling pandemic. time stop tough talk, start tough walk. whole fiasco vaccinations border closures underlining fragile EU is, really good thing them. Fair. anecdotal answer question  won’t summer 2022 part ""front line"" reads way ""cannon fodder""? Bad bot mean, yeah right. thread seems filled extremists sides. people vaccinated yet. Man...that’d suck live country. could totally abuse system push ""right"" narrative, whatever may be, definitely imply problematic.

The upvote downvote system intended narratives used disagree/agree button. entire intention used push things add conversation bottom, pushing worthwhile constructive comments top.

But, guess I'm running wall that, think used way better part decade. Former UFCW member here. Yes, we've always expendable that's including opinions union itself. I'm still pro-union record UFCW sucks. store used work following mask mandates want confrontation customers. Employees going along set management easy firing part working there.  

Still, reason I'm paying rent money able save working want seem like would better union. Fine, zoom enough equal worst peak summer. particularly great trending right great, say literally every stock market commercial, ""Past performance guarantee future results"". We've ""trended sharply downward"" several times now. read garbage holidays, science deniers loudly declared pandemic over.

It's like every end world prediction- people never show later admit really know anything like talk shit.

EVERYONE wants with, except maybe Jeff Bezos Walton asswipes. people urging caution want irresponsible people screw everyone else yet again.

Maybe listen people urging caution since, know, they're listening science? lol ok, long great oath2order says so. China, back back world champs releasing SARS related time, virus “jumped” seafood market animal carcasses found contain virus. market, next BSL-4 lab also plenty BSL-2 BSL-3 work actively researching corona viruses. hum diddly dinger could happened wonder! market primarily sold seafood, building literally dedicated studying viruses country already leaked virus two separate occasions.  Thanks stopping  I'm skeptical, hopeful. Moderna supposed fill vials 15 doses instead 10. Pfizer calling 5 doses 6 doses. assume Pfizer also increased efficiency production hopefully make keep spamming message? yep, nobody knows, saying you’re going whatever like matter happens good bad you’ve “had enough” makes people sound dim. what’s point always closed flu season?... shits gotta stop. Within country perhaps across countries.

The US much affected COVID countries...why would US receive vaccine first? gonna keep copy pasting like moron? Here's pin corporate. companys logo word ""essential"" it. wear uniform. Get fuck back work.  Yep, us too. canceled said, ""we knew last forever"". boy scouts made us big sign heroes. embarrassed it. I've lucky far, I'm diligent mask wearing. dont take I'm car. got really lucky get first vaccine tomorrow. supposed beginning Feb, changed 65 older. They're putting 50 aside grocery workers got appointment. realize lucky am. Thank god finally someone willing say it. every mainstream media headline looked like last 2 months integrity all.  dunno man, whole lot hospitals got full places went hell even without mass gatherings, everyone gave 0 fucks continued non stop parties think damage health system would big comprehend. think people's opinion life much examples gave, let's forget that. Logan's Run

Never seen add queue. question really, decided workers value additional 1.50$.  seen requirements going Nets game? It’s hardly lifting restrictions. 

I want Cuomo commit allow fans Yankee Stadium adults given opportunity vaccinated. Yeah, thats weak unions look like. need remember people fought died 10 hour workday. unions nowadays neutered smell unionizing.  both! vaccine available kids yet. Literally top post sub full people calling continued restriction curb flu every year going forward value ""hero"" use lieu paying people deserve.  Everyone already lol  think exactly case. don’t want people vaccinated going lives normally every one angry haven’t gotten vaccinated yet LMFAO sore argument loser probably prevented cases, tons harm itself. Social distancing kept cases 1% population getting Covid might brainer positive. Social distancing let 40% Americans get Covid also wiped tens millions jobs, cost kids year school, spiked murder suicides etc - maybe benefit isn’t clear. seriously can’t wrap head around many people acting like things government officials possibly say “we go back normal May 1st come hell high water” “idk, might go back semblance normality summer, maybe spring, oh wait meant fall, idk, everything still awful, let’s talk super scary variant instead.”

I want see plan! Goals! Metrics! aspirational statement things hopefully go back normal September x, y, conditions met! statement vaccines work people take them, quicker we’ll get back normal! I’m asking promise, I’m asking clear goals. Anything constant stream fear-mongering guesswork. People actually believe ? Wild. agree you, understand I'm downvoted, especially comments car salesmen significantly upvoted. 

I assure public transit, airplanes, daycare centers, many things list safer grocery store. interact regular basis. bus system ""limiting capacity"" aka advertising policy shit it. They're packed. Planes packed. kind retail packed. Plumbers repairmen/women inside people's homes hours, bet air saturated occupant sick. know grocery different.  perspective UK lockdown effective, think roadmap exiting lockdown bad idea.  


The issue proposing fixed dates several months advance certain restrictions lifted. Infections deaths likely decline, possible predict numbers look like month advance. Infection spikes theoretically possible well.

 
There possibility infections decline rapidly expected, means fixed dates cautious. hand, might new data suggest infections could go up, fixed dates theoretically pushed future. However, undermines public trust. UK also many people ignore restrictions annoyance dates changed. 


 


TL; DR: think possible predict COVID-19 infections future beyond likely trends. Better get ready happen June 2022  Neither right, telling got screwed way time?

It's Midwestern regional chain. can’t believe people take bait... yeah article BS flu doesn’t go away. infectious disease works. covid, everyone laughed trump said would go away laughing people say flu did??? Technically, *is* correct say vaccines. That's literally latest information. great news, vaccine 100% effective still 100% sure long immunity lasts. Getting people vaccinated critical, agreed, immediately mean we've beaten it.

It cure gives body ability fight it. jury whether prevent spreading it. people who've once. one thing say certainty thing people know anything certain it.

All said, there's lot great signs would stupid change messaging without eliminating possibilities. Everything I've said cautiously optimistic, based available information. Still bunker oil, also never said aren’t awful. sure you’re trying prove.

Literally every vacation activity excess definition wasteful consumption. flying South America (or Europe you’re bouji). driving city every weekend go hiking.

The sad fact math basically every activity doesn’t involve sitting front computer comically wasteful. Every thing buy, consumable eat mile travel taking put in. Hell, could things like put produce outside like lot grocery stores There’s plan though. None. goal. effort. It’s moving target.

We drink bars, get manicures, go Trader Joe’s kids can’t see kids get educated properly. Time make children priority Implicit Logan's Run reference right here! yeah i’m starting see brainwashed everyone is.. many people taking situation seriously. can't even imagine grocery store workers go through! Bats used extensively ingredient traditional Chinese medicine. Pangolins well. i'm talking vaccination... saying social distancing useless now. think lot people since beginning hitting wall, think there’s people pushing narrative. things, truth probably somewhere middle. 

Even admit if. Absolutley nothing set stone new variants, even super concrete awnsers new variants already there.The media started reporting antibody evading mutants months already. we're following precepts 2020, seen massive huge spike cases weeks ago, especially witth fact superbowl 16 days ago know know *plenty* people following rules day. would pessimistic versus optimistic way won’t let down.  Full mostly vaccinated people (and 40% immune infection)? what. bird flu often thought one potential next pandemic, least future one, wrong mutations allow human human spread really set things fire CFR north 50%.  still partial lockdown many parts country. kid set foot school since last March, California, regardless virus given moment. experience people would rather use days they’re sick. I’m nurse everyone uses PTO vacations want day whatever. they’re actually sick. Especially something minor like cold Good lord topic public interest  Yeesh! thread toxic. Makes want drink, it’s even 8:30 yet. 

(Guess I’ll go watch cake-decorating videos palate-cleanser instead...) There's operative word signals intent idea fun I'll leave people guess. One dose still disco shit. GG said seen general news, naturally meant happened hit eyes, trawl possible news sources, none mentioned I’m trying get across B117 variant vastly contagious, becoming predominant strain numerous places,

Not according [your shows prevalence new variant UK actually going end observation period, percentage new variant cases cases 50% short time. including Ireland (need source too, google it?). 

Yes, would nice get source that. actually tried google information proportion new variant UK (the data earlier paper finished December). find anything useful. data, please share. (This something understand seem think information valuable commodity share sources others, means lose something it). trend means 2 vs 3 comparison uphold flu misleading. 

Possibly future, currently (which top discussion applied to). hand, talk future, herd immunity due vaccinations start take effect coming months means whole number may completely irrelevant (a bit thing measles R0 vast majority population vaccinated). Furthermore, nature exponential growth, “similar” ratio R0 equate similar rate spread. 1.5 vs 2 makes difference. 

I'm sure mean ""difference"" here. key value R0=1 NPI methods aimed push that. next question NPI methods lower different ""natural"" R0 values similarly difference. So, instance, method lowers R0 30-40% (as according closing schools universities does) would bigger effect high R0 disease low R0.   somebody source publication explaining efficacy differences like table something? see 66% 95% everywhere. Thats literally vs grade. 

If given choice two doses pfizer one J&amp;J I'd pick pfizer every time, I'd prefer 5% chance losing sense smell taste 34% chance.

Also, everyone got pfizer moderna, would likely less argument post vaccination masking/social distancing. Post vaccination masking/social distancing biggest demotivator getting folks vaccinated now.

Please correct I'm reading wrong. Union mean strike whenever unhappy. Contracts that, contracts. agree contract length contract. strike contract expires. Otherwise file grievance, that's all.

Under union contracts, strike contract active, terminated differently miss work. Perfect Peggy,""No fun allowed!! must sit front screen!! MARCH BUTTS INSIDE RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!""

Everyone else,""We sat long enough, keep sitting party till we're purple!!!!!"" *throws Zoom bird* live *banned* seeing family till may, btw? place vaccine distributed, surely. want mix households without vaccined? making stuff again? vaccine administration drop recently? storms Texas something else going on? stop it. better. 65% reduction catching disease all, far 100% reduction ""Too pathetic even wear mask without whining""

Its worse get close people SCO. managment gives hell stand ik ng close anti maskers, like choice. others physically push I'm ""too close"" Ah ok thanks, working data strong point.  Summary Johnson Johnson full data:

* Efficacy hospitalization: **100%** (0 people hospitalized vaccine group. However, 5-7 cases placebo group, CI pretty wide 31% 100%)
* Efficacy deaths: **100%** (0 people died vaccine group. 6 people died COVID study, control group. Again, confident interval wide, good expect.) 
* Efficacy ""severe COVID"" 28 days shot: **85.4%**, maybe little worse elderly 70% (again, super wide CIs, could actually comparable get real-world data)

""We sucked party!!!!!!!!!!!"" Possums awesome pedantic. clear distinction. Virus introduced body, full stop. suffer permanent heart damage big deal. /s great news light fact 7-day average cases increasing last 2 days.

Hopefully ease one shot vaccine help bring trend back next couple months. “But Z.456.892 variant Botswana?” /s Twitter sports banter. muted literally every single word/phrase regards covid politics. timeline much better place cautious Covid stuff entire time. think reasonable believe must everyone vaccinated start getting back normal. need critical mass vulnerable groups overwhelmingly covered spread difficult. data knowledge say number would certainly fully vaccinated population. 

Also people seem getting caught ""normal"" means arguments based little discrepancies people using word. Quote it. I'm interested seeing strawman.  honestly fault people this. state different rules states poor visibility. someone immunocompromised vaccinated Texas now, can't get vaccinated state couple months, understand would fly Texas shot.  experience much racism. Especially black.  don’t know. best friend’s brother died COVID. knew count? 

I think you’ll find deaths impact wide circle people. people work, school, community activities, etc addition family friends make wide number.

It doesn’t 500,000 people. bet small towns deaths effects whole population. Hero American equivalent martyr. They're one fact do, even atrocious act, done someone's best interest heart. best interest may also villainous intent. Someone runs fire dies saving child much hero/martyr someone dies murdering people foreign countries name democracy. 


Some say semantics, think that. elitism. Thinking way life somehow inherently makes better someone else. Correlation causation. There's dozen reasons cases declined. Vaccines probably helped they're whole story. Supply. make fast. one called antimasker lying coward

Literally first reply calling cry baby anti masker.... stomached whole year weeks break you?

Where get weeks from, household mixing banned I'm till May thats months away Yeah think even best intentions still get stuff like Trending thrown replies insightful nuanced stuff twitter make lose it. worth imo people learning disabilities much likely die COVID? I've seen they're 3-4x likely seen explanation Given choice one I'm getting

I think get choice. Right? Everyone always says get first one that's available you. I've planting seed going max 2 times week go back. always essential. also easily replaceable due much population driven desperation.

Keeping minimum wages living wages, taking away healthcare, etc.. great ways maintain steady supply labor compromise wellbeing put food table table all.

You can't throw someone harm's way call hero. never heroes. That's happens locked parents' basement year start believe everything read online Good edit. Agreed. absolutely ""an abundance"" covid19 shots. Many states behind vaccine schedules due lack supply. US export ban primarily use Pfizer Moderna produced country. 

The fact Canada gets AZ doses US shows it’s hard fast ban, wouldn’t worry much EU. Heroes expendable, society starts calling hero understand saying appreciate sacrificing life, expect anything pat back. like conveniently ignoring australia argument. People Philippines regulated can't nation poor ever try. Pfizer vaccine government funded.

False, Pfizer self funded. could price profit, make lot focus U. S. government ordered via Defense production act.

Again, false. DPA accelerating production point. production bottle necks non-DPA related. vaccines paid U.S. government. 

Yeah sure I'm willing bet demand would roof government involved Capitalism healthcare system zero this. Government investment does.

Government investing accelerates basic science research, saw UPenn, NIAID NIH. need capitalism juice it. 

There's reason almost biotech innovation occurs US. change dogmatic worldview inadvertently destroying institutions help beat serious diseases. new J&amp;J vaccine, considering approving using one shot current two shot vaccine. Either way happy camper. It’s almost four weeks since Osterholm predicted “Category 5 Hurricane next 6 14 weeks” Meet Press. According NYT, new cases 37% past two weeks deaths 23% past two weeks.

Will Chuck Todd bring Osterholm back 14 weeks wrong explain wrong? Don’t count it. That’s nice UFCW garbage. held mom’s disability money two years, gave lump sum untaxed, said taxes taken already. ended owing $20,000 top usual taxes owed. realize real way eradicate flu cold would close schools colleges mandate distancing capacity restrictions every flu season?

Maybe first trimester. rough guess vaccinated numbers end March. think 53% least one shot 25% done. based johnson johnson approved. Anyone think I'm far off? love got banned opinion throughout past 10 months suddenly allowed.

Good waking up. Yeah does. said everyone knows 65 least gotten shot (yeah ancillary evidence).

It kind crazy though, seeing bunch 65+ people going packed places. rural areas/beach town went to, nobody cared outside super corporate spot.  Cool. Hook up! Remember old game? Well throw old shit away, playing new game. took year. Slow clap Sweden. want everything back normal except working office. Would much prefer flexibility work home.

Currently work Fred Meyer, wish could tell making strides better, would lie... think coming months parent company going make things much worse... morale already toilet, people leaving left right. 

I admit coming home crying almost daily mental stress beginning much. 

I want over... eat food every day like dogs well :o Thanks reply, though I'm wondering measurements made people hospital, ongoing monitor trial participants? define severe/critical case meeting following criteria—

• Clinical signs rest indicative severe systemic illness (respiratory rate ≥30 breaths/minute, heart rate ≥125 beats/minute, oxygen saturation (SpO2) ≤93% room air sea level, partial pressure oxygen/fraction inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &lt;300 mmHg)

• Respiratory failure (defined needing high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [ECMO])

• Evidence shock (defined systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &lt;60 mmHg, requiring vasopressors)

• Significant acute renal, hepatic, neurologic dysfunction

• Admission ICU

• Death

Obviously overlaps highly hospitalizations even deaths. look like specific categorization severe cases requiring hospitalization since hospitalizations that's ended measuring. 60 percent effective better nothing.  Fauchi put sorta, Americans much independent spirit we’re told.  Get ready articles describing socioeconomic and/or racial disparity terms gets vaccine. News outlets try make two seem equal want reality aren’t luxury time transportation venture farther mRNA vaccine.

Now pfizer less strict temperature requirements allowing reach rural areas moderna ramping lets send J&amp;J start beating thing globally. indigenous peoples gone ... 🎶 🤷‍♂️ realize real way eradicate flu would close schools colleges mandate distancing capacity restrictions every flu season? Masks alone won’t shit get children vaccinated, Covid literally nothing compared flu children.

3,104,010 children tested positive far, deffinitely way positive, didnt get tested. Based current death counts, 250 children died covid.

Even somehow caught every single covid case children, IFR far would about
0.008%, let's say caught half children covid cases, would mean IFR 0.004%, compare 2019-2020 flu year estimates, IFR 0.0034%, that's 55% children vaccinated... not. think there’s rise cases week, since there’s less snow many parts country people asymptomatic testing? yes are. btw he's misinterpreting freedom all. freedom. whatever fuck one wants. know throughput supermarket? would disaster sizable city thought media ""experts"" said vaccine work variants need lockdown forever due them. Either variants evil say need lockdown vaccines still work need worry. Pick one Ah gotchya. Ya I've seen lot usa. Hell one usa governers signed proclamation day prayer fasting like October. Still mask mandate. Wtf. People taking serious over. give people vaccines desperate ( even selfish) Also twitter, reddit, instagram, tiktok, etc.

And traditional media claiming vaccine prevent spreading virus, can't anything differently vaccinated (which makes sounds like vaccines useless). People oxygen saturation less 93% hositialized? Hezbollah, Iran Neonazi Party Israeli occupation. also never situation entire world attempting solve single problem. 

I try optimistic, feeling could indeed get workable vaccine they’d get done quick course - that's true every year flu season. 

At peak flu season average year, around 33% influenza-like-illness samples test positive influenza. year, 0.1% U.S. ILI samples test positive influenza. extreme difference. role play exactly? It’s scientists, industrial workers, brave trial participants worked tirelessly past year make happen.  aren't.  


Name one mandatory vaccine. I'm US. country teachers earn really low wages. nationwide strike years ago. Cashiers earn 1/3 here... Zero COVID impossible fool little later expected guess matter since production lagging little ship initially anyway... think know better scientists went school living? factor vaccinations, could well transmisible lower case numbers.  nearby hospital announced 0 covid hospitalizations first time since March 2020! Things getting much better here. March likely gonna catch-up month many states since February, there’s snow 2-3 times week, every week. It’s probably main reason Fauci scaled back timeline availability general population April May. Sorry kinda put example first reply there. bad lol. yeah instances law equally enforced. Great attitude YOU, terrible attitude everyone else deal careless self doesn’t want get sick. type ignorant selfishness got us state we’re whatever - you, you’re coolest. Literally came say see u beat it! Funny thing is, people say follow data science, always agreed with. Well data science say vaccines work, cases going down, also potentially seasonal virus. Vaccines = open up. Sinister experimental vaccine forced upon population. It’s bullshit point view. Working market one oldest professions society would collapsed pandemic without guys. doesn’t take skill every job requires degree. often not, takes whole lot money, privilege, time many people don’t have. still plenty us ton gratitude teachers, health care workers, grocery store market workers. would’ve screwed without y’all. Thank you. 💜  Spain’s regions autonomous central government states US, more. constitutions, official languages, healthcare, education system, treasury taxation, specific judiciary, legislative executive bodies. “national” police force.

So yeah, Galician parliament approves those, become law. power enact, collect enforce laws... take lines context cut short. said would make plan see possible find way. reveals think things take others consideration making plans absolutely correct. Sorry inconsiderate see people's health safety way. keep trying say mental issues issues going worse someone loses loved one conscience yours.

 know half country inconsiderate (non-political) point give shit others long need do, selfish prolonging pandemic taking seriously start inconsiderate comments see comments. refuse treatment moving forward hospitals since none take serious care people losing lives mental health right. Give break probably people think depression anxiety excuses people say can't things thats crowd feel I'm talking here. cant tell people unless talking us directly bc mutliple employees punched location. Im high risk. Im around bunch maskless people never said legally mandated. mandatory Japan either. respect others. 3,104,010 children tested positive far, deffinitely way positive, didnt get tested. Based current death counts, 250 children died covid.

Even somehow caught every single covid case children, IFR far would about
0.008%, let's say caught half children covid cases, would mean IFR 0.004%, compare 2019-2020 flu year estimates, IFR 0.0034%, that's 55% children vaccinated... buyback program good idea? see post war countries everywhere. people giving guns unknown antiques, idiots favourite: people getting rid evidence. mean police destroying evidence questions asked?. people keep them. Hell, family kept theirs.

You're already putting life line institution US. sound alike like person refuses wear seat belt yet insists driving Ferrari highway speeds suburbs. 100% fatalities *and* hospitalizations realize real way eradicate flu would close schools colleges mandate distancing capacity restrictions every flu season? Masks alone won’t shit legally mandated thing longer absolutely necessary, people penalised wanting use mask sickness want to. Since shot gives 65% protection virus risk mild Covid rest, question this, “mild” Covid result long-hauler symptoms even mild? seems like I’ve also heard sometimes “mild” cases still cause internal organ damage?  Well expendable sense replaceable workers. expandable human beings however. Kind clickbaity title discrimination? follow laws going get harassed police. suspect SARS-COV2 likely ""burn way population"" .. whether actually end-point.. whether circular due mutations new strains?.. wait see.

The question may moot: people humoral immunity reduces common cold, one diagnosing tracking mutations anyway. There's zero evidence far variant escapes vaccines. None. article's title journalistic malpractice - quote expert not. article worth bandwidth consumes. 


Anyway, I'm well aware. Here's another article: 


 [New California Variant Contagious, Two Studies Confirm - New York Times  


Some choice quotes: 


 “I’m increasingly convinced one transmitting others locally,” said William Hanage, epidemiologist Harvard T.H. Chan School Public Health involved research. “But there’s evidence suggest it’s ballpark B.1.1.7.”  - there's evidence even bad UK variant. 


""Reviewing medical records 308 cases Covid-19 San Francisco, Dr. Chiu colleagues found larger percentage people died new variant others. result could statistical fluke: 12 deaths group, difference deaths one subgroup another may hold larger sample."" 


""Still, variant’s effect immunity seems much smaller caused variant South Africa called B.1.351. Dr. Chiu said it’s clear vaccines use less effective B.1.427/B.1.429.

“If get enough people vaccinated, able deal variants simply won’t ongoing transmission,” said."" 


Oh, likely less concern SA variant.  


 
At point, I'm even sur operating good faith - either way, try stress much. Spring almost hope get enjoy nice weather arrives. Hopefully we're immunized next months put behind us! Astra-Zenica allow manufacturers produce long sell cost, can't developing countries that? I'm trying figure people getting info from. feels like regurgitating takes CNN that's weird. people young 20s really watching cable news like now? that's sad. go outside enjoy young. Finally got second dose yesterday three reschedules! say, barely adverse reactions far. 4 hours post dose, minor twinges joints slight feeling. mostly faded 10 hours post dose.The thing remaining point sore arm.

At point, flu vaccine year worse either dose. cool all. know finite amount time left earth, matter what. I'm getting older, independent COVID I've come terms mortality.

I know die, live? Severe cases defined ""a positive Covid-19 case, plus elevated heart rate 125 beats per minute, elevated breath rate 30 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation know of.

They're pricey reuse them. Use code ""KINJA30"" 30% off. always taken covid seriously, don’t think lockdowns answer. Lockdowns help keep hospitals crushed, (in US, least) rates hospitalization icu use going down. That’s don’t think locking serve specific purpose, unless hospitals trouble, imho. 

What’s take lockdowns? What’s goal?   guess but: goto ER need given oxygen. get it, feel better leave. admitted hospital.


There's chance going kind self reporting too.  

They certainly track people study.  

Maybe tracked person reports infected Covid-19, ask bad they're feeling scale 1 10 something.  say 5 higher number counted ""severe"".

I’m alum Duke University contact tracing kept university open safe fall semester. 78000 tests 241 positives long term effects? would still susceptible yes? mRNA ones effective?

There's lots articles variants going cause chaos Spring ruin progress. pessimism might merit depending things shake lot doom gloom makes headlines.  guy there's reason extensive trials anything goes public. Can't shoot bunch people hope best... Yeah, it’s kind strange scene here. city, Tampa, hosted Super Bowl, since don’t restrictions save local mask mandate (that bars restaurants largely ignore), told would big bump infections. tell Tampa loves football, plenty people celebrated around area. hotel occupancy around 90%. bump. 

Maybe lot town people took covid around country, plenty people celebrated too. 

I think employment numbers improving too. Im saying praised. Im pointing ridiculousness crediting president vaccine research development. best bet adopting zero covid strategy vaccines one tools toolkit. expect we'll data fairly soon especially related boosters - say Novavax booster SA/Cali variants come September starts trial - may see recruiting Moderna/Pfizer candidates specific group test this. 

It would logical thing Moderna recipient I'd likely volunteer. Certain government officials happy let minorities die covid sweep rug. need study history country better, especially civil rights movement. feds reserving percentage vaccines themselves. They're opening FEMA vaccination centers underserved communities, sending vaccines directly pharmacies. purposefully blind see vaccination differences whites blacks. Everyone society responsible creating equitable society. Sorry vaccine sounds less effective. expecting push people lest ability push better vaccines?

I'm extremely bitter watching rollout. rate doubt family, including elderly parents, manage get vaccinated sun goes supernova. right recent studies first dose - US still moving forward two-shot plan. think make assumptions based data currently utilized approved government.

With respect delivery times (i.e. time shot delivered US Gov't shot going arm) currently correct - SUPPLY bottleneck right now. point, bottleneck shift administration time stretch bit (we supply administer quickly). 

The timeline laid accounts items, admittedly assumes vaccine hesitancy wane (and ever demand bottleneck). happens timeline could stretch bit (at least respect things like masks). personally think we'll dip 1,000 deaths per day April

I disagree. think we'll 1000 per day early March. 

RemindMe! 2 weeks groups stretch benefits ""Sorry can't give raise, pandemic."" 

The rest us end whenever feel like. Yup. lurk news feeds twitter rarely engage anything overrun bots idiots. think people saying observing corporate America corrupt cares profit. 

Restaurant workers grocery workers really top vaccine tier along medical, opinion. Medical workers get paid well risks exposed to, not. Senior citizens live home ability self quarantine, not. Yeah, many people seem prefer catch flu least week pain suffering (plus potential long term effects) wearing mask weeks public.  understand that, usual lie still circulating. unfortunate thing pessimists voices magnified social media. tends affect policy fear ""addicted miserable"" slow important actions like full school reopenings fall (which would unfortunate succeed getting critical mass people vaccinated). definitely depends state. MA, older coworkers unable get appointment. One got appointment booked finally yesterday, driving 2 hours still wait 2 weeks. area vaccine desert. nearest city 2 sites, they're smaller pharmacies, appointments. entire city. Even smaller city, that's right, especially limited transportation many residents. Near Boston, that's issue, though. letting 1 person get elderly also slowed vaccines elderly themselves, hence coworkers can't get appointments.

My parents CT issues appointments booked within 2 days eligible. mom wait bit, able book fairly easily. Right? - UK completes vacine drive top story EU getting vacines. Well currently seem like there's mechanism get single shot Pfizer/Moderna [according looks like people situation fine getting one dose. 

Seeing (unfair) skepticism J&amp;J network I'd happy ignorance false-choice rhetoric best. ignores done, e.g. mandatory testing, contact tracing, quarantining actually drive rate infection much possible. Following half-assed measures claiming ""There balance risk snd benefits"" argument even less manage pandemic manifest incompetence.

South Korea gave good example manage pandemic. question still stands... Congrats reddit epidemiologist/virologist, that’s works That's exactly hesitation one. good prevents death hospitalizations, I'd also want know prevents long term chronic effects one contract mild Covid. 

I wonder possible lower risk people get J&amp;J later get Pfizer/Moderna they're readily available. Reddit. vaccine diplomacy discussed article recognition Israel countries need vaccine. point random effect diminished significantly. Currently, without immunity (from vaccines, prior exposure, etc.) random effect severe. entire population exposed, severe cases become rarer rarer may eventually diminish point where, even severe Covid exist, risk worth planning around. first wave exposure, unlucky mean everyone similar experience numbers going forward. 

Sure, someone prior exposure years come, could deadly - they've refused vaccine, medical reason so, that's risk they've assumed. Unfortunately, everyone live life full potential - certain number deaths sadly unavoidable. I've gotten BPM rate I've flu bad cold before. Garmin watch telling burning 5,000 calories bed lol, probably assuming spending entire day jogging. Diagnostic guidelines laid essentially said flu symptoms means presumptive covid case. Restrictions magically eradicate influenza failing even slow sars-cov-2 suggest. Let's honest here: saying death person know name ""affects"" us either exageration pure demagoguery. know wish best hundreds hundreds people, perhaps handful people died would impact lives serious extent. 

I know one person died. brother close friend father. even country last time saw least 15 years ago. remember nice person though. sad died? course. affect me? honest say did.

I would say order say one third Americans suffering someone died must considered personal connections slightly less distant one mentioned. Fair point, casino enforced mask rules, large open spaces, good ventilation probably safer small bar packed full maskless customers. Granted that's judgment call, things open there's nothing stopping OP going out. flu doesn’t overrun hospitals like we’ve seen last year. 

What think you’re suggesting need vaccine 100% effective mild severe disease transmission...or what, collectively say “fuck it, vaccine?”

Get real. Ah go, COVID threat move flu. fucking predictable Good question, range 96-97 time. wish were. Pfizer, Moderna, Janssen vaccines developed last spring. lot deaths winter happened. panic sacrifice liberty consoom more. Good talk. [17% eligible Americans already least one we've distributed somewhere around 82 million far. Moderna Pfizer track distribute [40 million *weekly* mid-March, 2-3 weeks administered seems lag week 2 behind doses distributed, we'll vaccinating 8-9% population weekly basis come April longer demand it.

Unless fuck something up, every single American wants vaccine have, least, first dose arm Memorial Day.

Where math wrong? normal circumstances, yes, but, since lot happened winter surge US, depending state hospital system time , people may sent home oxygen monitoring, told come got worse. happened NYC spring surge, imagine happening places hospitals overwhelmed/on-the-brink. Herd immunity isn’t goal, risk mitigation also important. ten percent population gets J&amp;J vaccine, statistically result around ten percent reduction additional deaths 8-9 percent reduction additional hospitalizations. J&amp;J vaccine approved prevent thousands needless deaths across America next 2-3 months. Right giving people free money sit ass home, retailer workers got nothing. 

Also you’ve ever worked grocery retail management you’d realize everyone job. Sure, anyone stack apples, everyone actually run department store. Ssshhh, we're trying naively optimistic here! /s

You're right though, long way go partying summer guaranteed means. heard Daily children make 24% population there's vaccination site yet. reach herd immunity need 80% population vaccinated (According Dr. Fauci). math add ""raves everyday summer"". That’s really intelligent response. Informed consent doesn’t mean much I’m guessing Teachers need go work like rest unvaccinated population. California way behind rest country educationally teachers refuse go work jobs properly. Zoom classes education. Trader Joe’s workers show up. Servers show up. Medical workers show up. can’t children essential enough teachers show up? rest country it. California unique children missed year school. year! I'm glad someone else remembered it. I'm always reminded terrible game someone says ""Awesome possum"" due title screen.

Sega Channel good way experience many platforming games wanted cash Sonic Mario hype. Anti-Israel folks always seem omit one key fact. Hahahaha what? born here, man. didn’t ask this. Seat belts way different talking about. Guns sold illegally time, get shipped outside boarders. government buying back guns different? Like it’s voluntary. I’m disputing people all. I’m saying wanted guns street you’ll make profitable black market. one thousand customers per day park, broke attendance records park almost every day. busier we've ever waterparks area owned Universal Disney open last season (because able meet social distancing standards Magic Kingdom Universal Studios following). zero social distancing, either outside inside (we indoor seating). temperature checks customers, screening asked symptoms. mask requirements customers waiting line enter, standing queue lines buy food ride rides,or gift shops bathrooms.

employees required wear masks, multiple ""mask free zones"" employees required wear masks all, including break room one door windows.

we multiple employees test positive covid, tested positive once. management never mentioned staff. zero contact tracing. Biannual means every 2 years. Semiannual means every half year accept, thanks... COVID’s run nice weather effective vaccination campaign. Even current death rate continue dropping caseload, COVID would need *another* 100 days hit mark. everyone else told “shelter home” #stayhome retail workers told following: 

“Get there, work harder, shut up.” Yes, does. One trial arms took place SA variant spreading. included efficacy numbers too.

Still 100% death hospitalizations.  it? ""If apply logic something completely different, make sense!!11!""

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There’s studies UK Israel suggesting cuts transmission lot still unknown 

I’m much speaking vaccinated people masks, masks still important I’m speaking things like Fauci saying still can’t go restaurant others saying still can’t gather family.., 

Everyone account risks , risk NEVER zero . you’re 70 years old good health you’re fully vaccinated Pfizer risk getting sick relatively low, risk getting really really sick much lower . decide want do, government 

As far end masks goes,.. prediction vaccines become common infections plummet masks come slowly . feeling people eventually make move, government 

* tremendous respect Dr Fauci doctors really , think it’s clear speak conservative zero risk approach mask keep class sizes small possible. friends given mRNA vaccines, date applies increasingly large group is: week. get less advanced vaccines, date [2022 could [even things get back normal. long time.

It bit year far. people left homes time except buy groceries. We're talking 2 years maybe even 4 years mutations threaten effectiveness second run classic vaccines. Boosters delay end date time needed.

tl;dr easy say gonna last forever. harder say another 2 - 4 years this. estimated timeline rollout decision final? took year. Mask usage among elderly quite high I'd say. awful, things getting better medical abandon hope kid. may still able restore mobility / independence. journalists make headlines like this? I’m sure lockdown measures mask wearing reduced flu cases zero cases super unrealistic . Headlines like encourages conspiracy theorists 🤦 Honest advice: stop reading news daily. 

Check every week two, informed changes may impact personal decisions (local vaccine availability etc). constantly wired 24 hour news cycle make anxious paradoxically less informed.  releasing info sent? feel pain. eventually quit four months later getting much mental stress top physically stressful. started late December 2019, first stories corona virus starting circulate. thought big deal, another MERS SARS. Man wrong. know signing working ""essential"" job global pandemic people need pay taxes go work? don’t, keeps world turning, it’s kind argument. We’re team human here. 🇺🇸🎖 🦠 

SVAC Hearing today - “Vaccines Vets: Best Shot Ending COVID-19 Pandemic”

Date: Wednesday, February 24, 2021

We encourage public utilize Committee’s livestream hearing, available website:

www.veterans.senate.gov What's spin half doses? evidence points towards first dose reducing hospitalization serious illness 94%, that's recent surely that's spin referring to? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hear ya. I’m equity needs grounded pragmatism. can’t free also can’t spend much administrative effort vaccinate “right” people fall behind curve.

I understand meant referred J&amp;J “inferior” vaccine I’m sure understand eliminating deaths important part. said, wish narrative around J&amp;J around impactful distant rural communities disadvantaged communities can’t take time work.

Hell, older relatives said waiting J&amp;J vaccine said don’t want take time go back second dose three weeks later they’re busy! (Spoiler alert: they’re retired shit else do.) anecdote, demonstrate least people see conventional (non-mRNA) single dose shot superior. ""Inspiring confidence"" hard compare 2,600 people (mostly 80s) died COVID past 7 days alone, FDA sitting data.

If 80 years old living nursing home, I'd choose fast tracked vaccine massive COVID risk. you? logic work competition. sure, stuff like epipen jacked owned patents it. even though companies probably patents formula, game town. pfizer decided jack $100 shot, Moderna happy sell $25 shot wedding require proof vaccination entrance. go time life. science literally come back last couple weeks appears vaccinations preventing transmission. data becomes clear recommendations adjust Early on, people assholes first started taking things seriously saw guy go store teenage daughter. Door greeter asked wanted masks daughter reached one. dad slapped hand away said ""I'm shopping America, China."" bulldozed through. 

The look daughter's face much anguish embarrassment felt bones even hundred feet away. boldness idiots never ceases amaze. Trump got way everyone job constantly, telling people inject bleach, setting example never wear mask, promoting drug help stop Covid-19 might actually killed people held large gatherings people got sick died (Herman Cain), also tried get one worlds top immunologist fired silenced no, praised. jail. Israel vaccinate Palestinians workers west bank black white.  Thank you. 

Nor I. COVID test doctor order lab work? seen doctor routine check-ups past?

Regardless, probably best give call ask. don’t see situation it’s granted EUA, hasn’t today, wait couple days lol  Wouldn’t delay people getting tested cause decrease reports new cases though? I've saying weeks now. keep saying fall, deliveries meet promised we'll vaccines shelf waiting arms mid-spring. never before, unless got chunks hair (gets crazy sometimes). article Canada. going two years social isolation government way. move discussing realistic consequence covid pandemic. Nobody locking flu, yeah, might see masks. Probably mandate, bad strain, small local areas might outbreak.

Maybe stop dismissing everything ""fear mongering"" like it. agree, everything seems trending right direction. question whether governments going recognize start putting actual effort expodite reopening process.

Specifically case I'm referring home state CA, restrictions state. current plan almost impossible metric achieve get ""yellow tier"", literally zero plans full reopen point. Literally, ""green tier"".

Unless Newsom adjusts reopening guidelines, literally never get back normal CA. Getting pretty mad jealous Florida right now. Yep also winter storm slowed distribution vaccines last week....there major catch week. Thing also is, flu shot nearly effective covid vaccines have. However, masks , cleaning hands distance seems worked wonders flu 2020/2021, south north hemisphere.

This goes flu, I'll cc one top comments:

""A year I'm still stunned comparatively transmissible covid is. We're still struggling contain that, yet we've made flu fuck entirely.""

In case, they're able mix two one shot, I'd great. Yup. See Manaus, Brazil. development marks reversal Sweden’s previous doubts regarding face coverings, coincides increase transmission rates.

I found good way articulate yet: major problem see changes restrictions (capacity limits, indoor dining bans, masks) changes reactionary. see numbers going tighten restrictions, see numbers going people start yelling lifting restrictions. numbers weeks behind virus actually real world. incubation period math exponential growth really can't rely new infection rates published today dictate policy tomorrow. Zimbabwe started vaccinating Ukraine.

Embarassing. also interested works rest world. imagine USA's main allies next line, huge numbers vaccines delivered near future.

The politics bit fascinating, could define new Biden administration's interests global alliances.

I sure hope we, USA, contribute (as much needed possible) less wealthy nations well. many countries desperately need catch soon possible, hope USA political willpower fund, help fund, global effort.

We need stand together fix pandemic. then, follow booster shots wipe emerging variants.

Likely effort takes many years, simply become annual thing like flu.

I suspect, hope, world leaders already planning possible outcomes. right, american politics immense influence canadian society 

more canadians watch american election Congrats... awesome. support skeptical overly optimistic projections, realize theres people taken comfort quarantine. Many people scared outside world prior covid, covid validated belief. folks, skepticism recovery form optimism, whether consciously admit not. Arctic blast main cause. It’s also likely reason Fauci pushed back predicted timeline month. willingness individuals get vaccine translate faster normality? always thought people didn’t want dose could get sent someone wants there’s shortage people need it. increase enough I’m thinking we’re starting plateau. That's different though. specifically referring wearing part pandemic effort, general sick pandemic over.

I know later clarified depending threat reduced minimal still overly pessimistic choice words begin with. sub opposed re-opening schools?

It seems like public sentiment scientific evidence strongly favor re-opening schools, since even staunchly pro-lockdown politicians public health officials support point. 

Is people kids? spread misinformation. Never change Reddit. Yes. 250 million adults US. Even assuming optimistically 80% seek vaccine June (likely like 70%), that's 200 million people. Moderna, Pfizer, JnJ, figure mid-June. Moderna Pfizer alone nearly sufficient (400M end July indications plan hit figure early) JnJ gravy top. 

Pfizer Moderna committed 400 million end July indicated plan hit early.

Flexibility nice, done 100% remote two weeks in. nice get work around people. Hope got vaccine! Thanks volunteering I'm sure random troll knowledgeable literal experts matter. end society due vast knowledge. Well yes sure. That's want drag forever. lives before. Fans team went maskless party beating duke reschedule next game? Unlikely :) meant brown folk? Aren’t black people brown well? that's strange. parents Cali in-laws NC got 2nd shots already last week. much difficulty make one phone states schedule shots. hold long time, stayed hang up. NC, started lunch, ate finished time someone picked up.

My parents Cali got first shot Dodger's Stadium 2nd shot pharmacy.

My in-laws Charlotte went speedway shots.

It's weird hear horror stories. US already administered 65 million doses. 13% country already got first dose. impossible, many getting shots? protect scarring lungs mild cases want know article long ago many residents New Mexico coming Amarillo get shot, require appointments whoever appear independently residency. don’t see problem, shots wasted seem impact locals leading lack vaccines. going Mexico US March. December perfectly fine. sure! Thanks clarification. “I won’t take vaccine that’s less 90% effective” crowd concerning hurdle herd immunity. Pretty much entire country frozen/getting storms. catch back up, I'm sure. sorry. Sending mom hug. need lockdown. Period. Tell Tar Heel fan I'll forgive you. I'm suggesting wear masks actively water.

I'm talking standing line buy tickets food.  “devil” headline California variant irresponsible thing I’ve seen long time (Almost) 15 here. struggled anxious thoughts prior covid (Loud noises huge trigger), believed two-week lockdown would help calm nerves.

348 days later, I’d rather get shot foot go longer. Every adult household vaccinated, they’re still refusing allow also vaccinated grandmother visit accounts “What she’s 5%?”

It’s infuriating. parents belief easy me. friend postpone August 2020 wedding September 2021 we’re excited! feel like summer going party wedding explosion lol someone forcing hit reply? Oh yea, complained lost, gained ten pounds. lol Keep hanging on! get this. ❤️ Unlikely innocent bystanders killed friendly fire shootout closed quarters?

Like said, username checks out. gun rights begin with. ""Ha.. I'm worrying that,. I'm high risk group chances dying less 1%"".. go behave .. could dead couple weeks.

I'm much worried dying almost anything else Covid, given age group relative health, vaccine. mean, *could* drop dead aneurism typing message... worrying also ridiculous. case think proper testing necessary. It’s worked American universities anyone know vaccinations dropped massively last week so? Especially last 2 days, we've back million. know blackouts Texas account it, contributing factors? clear, get first one available. mean would want extra information. Knowledge power. idea based early ideas covid apocalypse scenario anyone walking infected person going get it. thought would easily infect 70% population hope damage control. know media kept saying early on, pretty clear really idea time, ""all keep hospitals overflowing"" never assumed measure success. 

Also, US hardly flatten curve, pandemic rising uncontrollably. reason ended burning year covid turned lot less easily spread expected March.  Oh no! I’m sorry. hope smooth delivery enjoying little one. Hang there...we get this. ❤️ makes sense. think people want latch idea possible magically isolate old people, loosen restrictions see things magically turn out, but, well, people actually see numbers. Yeah point brain blocks things protect itself. people said 5 easy either lied forgot went through. So, ive gotten positive result Covid-19 today doctor called me, tell inject blood thinners 10 days on. common?! since couldnt find anything topic. 

I young, otherwise health adult, hospitalized close symptoms, sore throat... provider also supposed providing essential employees. people got put waitlists. state gives vaccine, take eligible groups, regardless membership. Washington State longer giving vaccines. vaccines public good, private property. yay! afraid ask friends thoughts. strangers made feel much better Good. think lot longer year many people... schools rooms halve class size. lot schools needs halve. There's suggestion building temporary rooms playgrounds. Yeah, effect mitigated good amount fact second dose needed immediately. vaccines give March going require second dose April, enough supply second doses whole lot more. I've exact opposite experience. Everyone family across multiple states least received first shot week. 

It took many hours calls refreshing web pages. find new subreddit doomscroll really like ya’ll. everybody shot that’s 65%+ effective basically going eliminate transmission. think backdrop actual herd immunity, individual plunged vat Covid. dentist. necessarily covid think it’s good hygiene practice general Yeah mean that’s work. He’s everything right. Lol expected don’t actually know that. lack data show common uncommon. Unfortunately due testing limitations, lack sequencing, variables, cannot determine time. wife changes hospital supplies scrubs work strips garage puts clothes garage washing machine instead house washing machine immediately takes shower attached pool house.

Not something know, it’s keep ICU germs coming home (yes, work car work grocery runs also treat “dirty”).

With us vaccinated it’s likely way kiddos could get sick, we’ve cut out. understanding point ""flattening curve"" simply ""not overwhelm medical resources"". think much plan beyond (no time-limit etc). ""Isn’t pretty much exactly happened US last minute assist vaccine?""

At least US.. we're currently standing 6% (have doses) 13% least 1 dose.

I know down-trends we're seeing conclusively attributed vaccination progress. I'd think bit premature assume anything there. 

It's nice see trends going down. think people start celebrating loosening anything yet. 

Remember 1918 flu pandemic 2 3 years long multiple waves (2nd 3rd waves worse 1st wave). 

We're 1 year one. Pfizer second dose kicked like mule. Havent felt sick long time. 

Only lasted day, though. ""Essential"" buzzword keep work shutter business. hope gyms close 🙏  supposed reason phases trials see there's long term effects etc. 

The fact able get year honestly amazing itself. can't come soon enough! snowstorms last week. People delayed getting tested, reporting test results delayed. indicative actual increase covid cases. Lots kids. think I'm 5 now.

Uh, unclear many kids have?

Or misread this? LOL, either way. Lol. 5% increase 3 days small? 
Are trolling quality mind sub attracting now? Got 100k doses Vietnam today, going greatly help working quarantine hotels along border. Sure, workers going Israel. Ever since late October ""pandemic fatigue"" gotten me. sleep little, I'm depressed, I've gained 15 lbs, I'm lonely, hardly ever focus. I'm starting feel optimistic though, vaccine news keeps improving daily. Lets turn Joe Raging Ron fucking rage Summer. shown several times, Israeli health insurance presented robust data this: every peak, in-hospital death rate increased lot. I’d wait least June see things progressing making travel plans year tbh. That’s though. 

By then, know whether Biden’s Christmas timeline doable Covid bleed 2022. legit saying go rogue? 

Most interactions I've seen put responsibility vaccinating org make sure get second shot  stop pretending care welfare children.

I 4 children serve school board.

The people care welfare children advocate mandatory testing, contact tracing, quarantining outset prevent situation getting control first place. denied pandemic. half-assed personal responsibility. idly watched government manipulate public health messages specifically give false information open schools early possible. things then, need daycare work shameless narcissists, claimed must ""balance"" children's needs.

Your rhetoric joke. this? surge ants? question have: enough people ready willing take vaccine get (say May summer), enough herd immunity finally open get back normal?

Or would get point we'd coerce ""vaccine hesitant"" part population get well? Sort ""we can't return normal EVERYONE vaccinated"" approach.

I'd like think there's enough people willing get it, judging long lines cars waiting vaccine distro centers, first option enough. would really hate live segregated society people vaccine passes get live normal life, everyone else limited rights. Didn’t give exact date said would couple weeks. I’m guessing know next Tuesday next press conference.  article looks like severity learning disability previous criteria, they're recognizing severity may poorly described within medical records. someone may difficulty understanding COVID safety precautions, situations place greater risk death. new standard includes people likely low risk instead old system likely excluded people high risk. trying pedantic emergency approval much easier standard approval surprising 3 vaccines approved pandemic still get plague US!

The plague animal reservoirs. never rid unless vaccinate field mice world (aka, never; impossible task).

Covid believe also likely animal reservoirs, seems Minks others may able carry it. Depending upon suitable animal host finds, may ever able get rid it.

&amp;#x200B;

For us able eradicate vaccine, really suitable animal hosts (aka, evolved alongside humans long enough become human-only like smallpox others). think Covid likely fits bill. biggest risk factor death age, even close. strategy stop people dying first. Thank kind help! Fortunately, I’m lucky enough I’ve pretty good mask access. store doesn’t sell high quality ones anymore whatever reason, extras think last summer, since try rewear long last. That's fine - go ahead 3d print guns tie cans together strings, whatever floats boat. long gun laws get passed stop innocent bystanders - often children schools churchgoers - taking bullet tiny penis fetish, works me.

If laws prove ineffective, well, time try something else. time something now, legislation option. advisory committee meeting Friday, February 26th -- nothing come following trends happened Pfizer / Moderna, EUA would follow within weekend vote. Yep, bought pulse oximeter early pandemic freaked first reading 95%. frantically googled, realized going fine 7500 ft elevation. Yeah, **this issue** concern public. chances living good, going dependent machiavellian healthcare system quality life? big pharma *any* intention protecting us conditions would make billions future? look treat diabetics. vaccine also MRNA no?

NEVER say ""well done usa'. never done good job never will. Covid still over. US talking about. always everything wrong bet vaccination process different.  wish someone would pay kinda work. virus spread small space someone virus?

Hmmmm must grant kind research. That's fine. One thing: close schools every year that's factual 😎😎😎

Imagine brainwashed genuinely believe flu influenza eradicated conflated said (in open report claim wont count flu cases season, look up)

Or keep following m*ss m*dia choice 😎 Oh yes doubt, intending praise criticise. 

What mean is, example, able make COVID-19 mRNA vaccine years ago, proven can. one advantages mRNA develop prototype vaccine extremely quickly, order days (before trials production).  can't right. Utah already opened vaccinations 65+ age group. vaccines arms ASAP better. Same.

All older family members friends gotten shots now, they're spread across multiple states. bunch happened get first shot day 4 weeks ago totally different providers different places.

My dad got first shot literally 3 different providers call next day (again, 4 weeks ago) try schedule him. nothing political statement. Extremist behavior extremist behavior. Sheltering truth doesn’t make less true terrible take racism prejudice. see unjust opportunism. One group discriminating others get opportunity.

This China become dominant power, even declining American influence. even present veneer partnership cooperation rather pursuit exploitative hegemony. (Yes, America thus American influence already decline starting ascendancy 80 years ago) case see future China revenge past wrongs. countries trade China resist political social sphere influence. possible business China remain liberal democracy. I'm surprised even pro china hawk like see difference ideology economy China does. China culturally incompatible, even Asian neighbors, lot work create even regional sphere influence. 451 per 100,000 people registered learning disability died COVID-19 21 March 5 June, death rate 4.1 times higher general population adjusting factors age sex. [...]         
           People learning disabilities likely difficulty recognising symptoms COVID-19, following government advice getting tested, self-isolation, social distancing infection prevention control, report says. may also difficult people caring recognise onset symptoms cannot communicated.      
            
[Source - UK government press release November Hacking government network order convince healthcare workers quit jobs *in middle pandemic* deserves nothing severe consequences. wish state DeSantis. source that? don’t doubt misinformation sides regarding vaccination Palestinians. good info!!! way see officials created monster here. People afraid COVID due official messaging media won’t accept anything best vaccines. 

I don’t blame average person. They’re getting somewhere. Well mean anytime criticize you’ll likely going get pushback matter you’re talking about. question help understand could happen. Generally speaking, prefer bureaucracy things injected millions humans. I'm totally fine us selfish fuck considering hard hit.

Take care America first help rest world. US abundance dual-shot vaccines anyway.
 
Lol don't. wish did. I'd actually positive I'd vaccinated June entire article absurd misinformation: Israel pass amount vaccines Palestinians, top 100k Palestinian workers vaccinate, vaccines already gave Palestinian medical crews. know won’t nightmare getting signed even eligible? plenty people eligible right still can’t get it. hopeful start summer, that’s looking unlikely imo. Scientific evidence really say schools safe; usually see statistics show large proportions cases traced schools. However based contact tracing data, virus control one tell people get infected anyway, statistics close saying anything definitive. 

The optimistic outlook I've seen likely high risk heavy measures like socially distanced classes installing new ventilation systems taken. believe moment though schools things; know usual way businesses institutions fudge things say they're complying standards they're really anything. photos packed hallways Georgia high school probably what's actually going much time. Interesting.

Thanks. Going ""actually"" guy say virus sequenced year ago, able develop MRNA vaccines quickly. Something true science studied. early information suggesting single dose provides 90 percent immunity 3 weeks. double blind studies change course action likely. mean stay inside much can? continue so. pistol permit ccp NY state. Look epic amount shit go order get permit.  
I'm nra life outside youth gun safety programs.  
 least 5 million brand new gun owners last year US. literally make beltfed machine gun bang energy cans plumbing parts. Keep dreaming ban shit.  
I never understocked. Ammo worth anything make right house.  
I'm still waiting solution active shooters schools.   Curiosity 100% im going get whatever vaccine available available me, trying understand could possibly happen given situation. vaccine go someone want then? think excess amount yet mrna vaccine kind? (Just curious) heart rate increased bit reading comment. Based data, heart rate continue increase exponentially forever. I'll try polite this, Americans really got pull heads out, look around, realize rest us exist.

So long Elon, hope goes well move Mars take smartest people there. bet it'll feel like heaven. trumpeter uncle waiting this. asked said cause J&amp;J American.....

They also probably don’t look details, like thinking needing one shot=better two shots. 

I guess people feel safer getting known household brand even though Pfizer Moderna American,just well known typical households. (I’ll admit didn’t know Moderna came covid vaccine) say.. need cigarette reading this. It’s everything I’ve trying say articulated concisely. Fully agree. half population considerate, follow guidelines, etc. vocal minority anti-science people always exists, bet internal motivators ""me me."" Wow that's crazy. Fun fact week. Hydrogen Peroxide? use disinfect reusable masks full body overalls etc. optimistic predictions. boots ground observations state. 

My wife volunteers Facebook group helps seniors get appointments state. week last, got snowed appointments canceled. Last week, shipments delayed appointments first second doses impossible get almost (including 2nd dose appointment) canceled. 

In past three four days wife I, helped get first dose vaccine appointments 50-60 people least. Every hours, hundreds new appointments coming online like since Sunday. NEVER seen much availability. 

More importantlyWe finally starting see sites booking week advance again. Due supply constraints, many sites booking 72 hours advance (at most) day next day. works think majority population going willing put lives hold many additional months order protect bunch anti-vaxxers, may may ever persuaded get vaccine, sorely mistaken. study conducted glancing immunology textbook isn’t possible put type math metric “opening up” 

That’s subjective thing gets. means something different every community.. state problems we’re wide open. Florida couldn’t care less numbers similar California who’s obsessed lockdowns. Wasn’t UK variant supposed dominant “by March” .? heard Fauci say yesterday “by end March” ... perpetual mobile goal posts tried that, responded, “Yeah there’s still chance, no?” assume `/s` Anytime criticize question J&amp;J vaccine r/Coronavirus get automatically downvoted hell. God forbid. Okay, that's fair...and basically meant said need robust supply. Agreed current distribution system headache, things easier getting covid shot like getting flu shot. Especially us willing show anywhere, anytime get with. FDA endorses JnJ. approved Friday's meeting. probably Monday maybe! really. America enough good stuff, you’re fool accept inferior product. life, don’t get cheap it. 


Yea 4 months ago would been, facts changed got 2 premium vaccines. can’t live past. That’s silly logic. Let's pretend second FDA threw away morals standings approved vaccines Spring, would country, hell world, gotten supply? like millions ready immediately like April 2020 something making advance back then. They're starting ramp production better state now. article doesn’t support title plausible likely. 
us could also reach herd immunity tomorrow. Hello friend, high quality mask (like KF94 KN95)? not, would happy send recommendations would protect coming months. Generally rights end infringe upon others' rights. right walk around infect others. guess I'll petition add nuts list infectious diseases then. likely FDA clear kids 12+ get vaccinated summer. Moderna Pfizer already running safety trials. Yeah probably. school too, bought spray bottles every room pour cleaner us. think first major global pandemic lifetime, we're pretty damn good. Could better? course, compared bubonic plague spanish flu walk park.  Remember risk even coming ""extremely low""?  Real days. happened day Pfizer (after moved 2 days after).

Given meeting Friday possible slips Monday, I'd shocked longer that. I'll admit, really care get number vaccinations herd level.

Establish leper colonies antivaxxers? Fine. Load J&amp;J vaccine blowdarts issue modest bounty? I'm good. Throw bottomless pit? get behind too.

'cause I'll fucked I'm stuck wearing mask second longer or, God forbid, hiding vaccine-resistant variant circulates. Right theoretics aside, documented case that? Well mean that’s well dandy, thank shaming worried body! understand reading much virus/vaccines, question could find answer to. I’d like understand I’m putting body get shot would like understand much risk I’m putting way of. comment incredibly pointless. still people believing it’s real calling people, sheeple wearing masks. Wild. point simply managing case count similar managing forest fire. complete control.

You might add temporary restrictions needed cases ever spike protect healthcare infrastructure. unclear cases could spike dangerous levels 50% vaccination rates plus level natural immunity.

I epidemiologist. always made sense would, question would much. 95% effective vaccine would unlikely eliminate symptoms without least reducing amount time contagious for.

I see we've started US far ahead us vaccinations. Time US start giving Africa. make sure uncontrollable spread know. FDA approve anything studied. Unless mRNA manufacturer study show two doses 43 days apart provide X% protection, FDA say ""you 43 days"". know two doses two weeks (or whatever existing studies proved) work. people saying offer benefit, simply focusing death ease use exactly fair either. Living long term (maybe permanent) issues ""mild"" case covid also tragedy right.

Having already covid good vaccinated.

Hope approved soon! Much love South Africa. Thanks posting article. hope right, I've heard *""just two weeks""* often. optimistic predictions come pass, please tell us wait two weeks. time. Erring side caution, case uncertainty, “silly.” PCR give positive results dead viral fragments. quarentine procedure says stop quarentining x amount days post symptom resolution even still test positive.

This number dwindles time goes on. China huge study showing still positive PCR cases months later like 100 10 million tests. people racist, that's case? I'm afraid masks worn sick, response seeing ""thanks responsible"". Instead ""the hell public? go home"". Hopefully New York revisits quarantine data then. Cause 90 days isn’t whole lot time worry quarantine. Amen. civic duty. Let walk around passport vaccination go back normal. Oh yeah ? Where’s studies ?

I wonder measuring that? I’m Moderna trial didn’t receive measure blood oxygen levels. Seems folks wouldn’t necessarily know blood oxygen levels, unless required kind medical intervention. ?? You’d rather people needlessly suffer can’t get vaccine? That’s ridiculous.  Probably fact lost year lives that’s lucky won’t work. last time set foot school? bet half schools US wouldn’t able follow CDC’s guidelines. FDA confirmed safety efficacy. looks good, highly highly likely Give undeserved, me. hear vastly underestimating supply chain sheer amount people required make something like work. Seriously, look language used article
--50% coronavirus samples subjected genetic analysis state.--
Notice say 50% cases subject genetic analysis - likely caused due variety reasons beyond contagious worse.

--Samples collected range counties, using variety collection methods, suggest variant 19% 24% transmissible. circumstances, advantage much greater: one nursing home outbreak, B.1.427/B.1.429 spread rate six times higher predecessors.--

Notice change comparisons. 1st part paragraph allegedly contagious California variant second part UK variant. 

--In UCSF lab, scientists found L452R mutation alone made California strain damaging well. coronavirus engineered mutation able infect human lung tissue least 40% readily circulating variants lacked mutation. Compared so-called wild-type strains, engineered virus three times infectious.--

Notice use language engineered virus lab applying lung tissue. host issues this. newspaper applying real world scenario lab. Lab studies important used applicable real world.

--That’s reminder that, given continued opportunity spread, SARS-CoV-2 keep looking ways thwart effort suppress it, said.--

And last least, anthropomorphize virus give twirling mustache, villain. character. watch it? concern? probably not. We've interesting example locally, long-term care centre near gave first Pfizer dose residents staff back end December. mostly received second dose yet due still controversial policy provincial government prioritizing first shot promising second within 90 days so. 

The important thing new outbreak months nothing, 25 infected -- received first shot six weeks ago. Virtually infected asymptomatic, outbreak discovered due routine screening -- even know long going on, now.

While great track-and-trace perspective, would still pose threat anyone medically able vaccinated safely, facility saw 20 die last outbreak apparently virus circulating within least week two nobody felt bad enough even notice. that's one shot! view cautiously good news, guess we'll see days come bring. Yup. want ways. want people terrified *while also* expecting 100% compliance towards policies seemingly contradict fear mongering headlines. need responsible reporting order end Covid crisis quickly. Telling people they're fucked forever there's ""incoming category 5 Covid hurricane"" cases dropping table...it reinforces anti-mask, anti-vax types Look, could get, one shot, one opportunity, freeze Covid like wanted, one moment, would get vaccinated, let slip? don’t wait approval kids? Give rich COVID dynamics always convoluted reporting dynamics trends.

For example: Case numbers last week almost certainly lower actually due reporting delays caused weather. possible case counts go bit fall back whatever baseline trend get past catch period reporting. feel way? Even 30% people get vaccine, we've likely already 33% country infected, vaccinating around 70% would get us well herd immunity. dad couple days. mom something funky somehow got beginning March instead. So, user error caution. refresh page process booking appointments. check VAMS frequently openings. They'll come disappear alerts get sent  FDA already approved protocol? know study concluded, needs FDA approval translate action. symptoms went through, getting Antibody Titers me. getting another vaccine unless drop acceptable standard. Well, goal keep stress hospitals. look like effective hindsight.

I think need still take care while, still need take precautions, think lockdowns way go. Monitor case death trends, ease restrictions accordingly.  Ohio announce 60+ get vaccinated? That’s fostercare /s.

Smh fkn people man... Yes, give choice young people ship course. 15 minutes guideline. could get one quick interaction. much harder. Depends environment well. Air flow, indoor/outdoor etc. It’s great gave volley shots. could figure mandate make much convenient, flu shot. Get done one. worksites. Besides saving old pneumonia hate getting flu. It’s awful. get vaccine it’s better everyone . Wouldn’t save businesses money anyway, callouts? Neo Capitalist logic can’t even good 😔 

When deniers say covid “just bad flu” I’m like...have even regular flu? People eager ""normal"" care long term issues. People care living years long term issues... deaths matter. getting line see studies show J&amp;J's ""mild"" covid cases long term issues. 

We studies long covid mRNA options prevent \~94% symptomatic covid, feel likely prevent long term issues. right I'll wait get mRNA option (or maybe novavax ever approved). Yes. Fuck science great-grandchildren concerned. School caused depression anxiety, also gave *release* depression anxiety. trapped home lets build up. think tricky question precise moment, mass vaccination imminent. difference between, example, operating inherently dangerous piece equipment necessary alternative exists, operating one safety fix exists, take little time actually implement. seems far less ethical put employees risk second scenario. think 3 comparable, though J&amp;J might less likely due one-dose?

Still, remember side effects signs vaccines vernacular vaccinology, vaccines trigger range transient side effects lot recipients known reactogenic.  vaccines — fact, Covid-19 vaccines reported data far — fall reactogenic category.   common side effects injection site pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, joint pain. people clinical trials reported fever. **Side effects common second dose**; younger adults, robust immune systems, reported side effects older adults.

Oh, brit. explains vaccine nationalism.

You always pinpoint extreme accuracy british sub. group using vaccines form nationalism. expert, real concrete basis opinion, guessing Id wager we’ll booster sometime next year, maybe another following year so, they’ll become less frequent. squash vast majority virus circulation, round vaccines might even come close to, hit variants booster round there’s much chance continue spreading changing, able reduce prevalence much takes much, much longer change boosters might end much less frequent, even needed. bailed manufacturing culture created. vaccine safe prescribed dose. Given quadruple dose approved safety unknown. 

The phase 1 trial vaccines showed severe effects larger doses think went large. TELL people that. Lots people going around saying definitively prevent transmission, spreading misinformation. That's true. good news would bump stock prices. definite possibility, especially since covid tests proven completely unreliable I'm saying seems late reparations make immediate impact health black people regards Covid-19.

That's article about.

Yeah say zero cases it, doesn’t matter less contagious still cases. possible.

Several possibilities: people must choose higher-risk situations generally already exposed virus segment reached something herd immunity.

The spikes saw really due people saying ""fuck it"" gathering family holidays, spreading disease within normal bubbles. fewer people moving cross-bubble, we're seeing rates return normal rate people generally careful. 

With light end tunnel Re: Vaccines, seeing high hospitalization rates recently, may creating another ""wave"" people willing take extra precaution, pre-vaccine approval concern could years, people willing keep safer patterns long. bit moral/ethical question guys somewhat split friends. think lying healthcare worker, teacher, etc. order get vaccine unethical?

In opinion, is. healthy 20 something-year-old rush get vaccine. Lying healthcare worker profession currently qualifies vaccine, time doses still limited, morally wrong. making appointment, literally taking dose AWAY one essential workers enough doses everybody. 

I'm wondering people think, I'm totally wrong here. friends seemed kinda annoyed told felt like plan kind right thing do. wrong? take whatever means necessary get vaccinated even risk all?  repeated people want. lie. another instance doctors deciding people “ready” hear feeding governors think need parrot everything health officials say lest accused following experts.  constant throughout process manipulation flat lying.

When data AZ (will take time obvious reasons), compare two real world. Pfizer/Biontech data far matches well trial. Hopefully AZ well (most likely will), hopefully it’s closer 82% 65%. 
There certain reasons Pfizer one end better (doesn’t mean AZ won’t good enough really) think (as lots others).
Note, I’m German American 😅
I vaccinated Pfizer/Biontech vaccine (healthcare/COVID diagnostics), really don’t anything AZ vaccine. simply find Pfizer’s data better far, vaccines together get us outta sh*tshow. funny I've heard people sarcastically say flu ""going disappear COVID 19"".

Johnson said Johnson make far vaccine locally manufacturers here, using majority locally next couple months, lot contract fulfillment Europe come partially made here.

They're private company massive production capabilities, want risk vaccine getting approved made bunch. It’s actually closer around 1/3 population large proportion vulnerable population first shot. However taking cautious approach ending restrictions doubt end sooner June 21st. What’s official guidance? Ah yes, silver lining deadly virus! US, 48% adults 63% children got flu vaccine 2019-2020.

""The prerequisite production runs consistency approved vaccine. preclinical tests animal models necessary, small study humans, prove modified active ingredient effective vaccine original, "" explains. However, effectiveness measured laboriously clinical phase 3 studies, researchers wait months random illnesses Covid-19. Rather, sufficient detect sufficiently high titers neutralizing antibodies blood samples. entire procedure, currently discussed European Medicines Agency (EMA), take months.

CUSTOMIZATION STILL SENSIBLE

The PEI President cannot yet say change take place practice decision made. ""It happens quickly certain point time. continue vaccinate existing vaccines."" Even South African mutation leads frequent infections vaccinated persons, following still applies: ""Vaccination vaccines approved definitely better vaccination.""

Uğur Şahin, head Biontech, considers desired procedure appropriate. However, cannot yet say adjusted. ""First clarify laboratory modified vaccine works. currently still different types viruses circulation, help us vaccine works mutation, previous wild type longer sufficiently neutralized.""

VACCINATION MUTANTS UPDATE

One method immunizing mutation likely another booster vaccination. means people already vaccinated would receive another injection modified vaccine. would several advantages. ""In laboratory see blood samples higher titer neutralizing antibodies vaccination, lower decrease effectiveness compared mutants,"" says Şahin. Another boost, booster vaccination, would definitely increase protective effect.

For mRNA vaccines, immunity already built problem either. antibodies directed corona spike protein, vaccine lipid envelope. Therefore, booster vaccinations find way right body cells.

COMBINATION DIFFERENT VACCINES RESEARCH AGENDA

Anyone vaccinated vaccines - Astrazeneca vector virus - probability still refreshed adapted mRNA vaccinations. general, research heading ""Mix Match"" soon clarify different vaccines could combined one another. Studies already initiated United Kingdom, could soon follow Europe, says Cichutek.

Basically, initially evidence mix different vaccines could problem, says Marylyn Addo, infectiologist study director University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf. course effect would clarified studies.

Oh Im bothered downvotes. I've numb Reddit 5 years.  Good question. know OP's grandma come contact health system, question whether points actual difference affects outcome. average 80-year-old gets diagnosed COVID probably sicker average 80-year-old (and might get diagnosed).

So, question is, average OP's grandma closer to? doctors would know me, I'm guessing first. Hero pay like 1.5$, makes question value 'hero'. Never seen anyone CNN say that. Cool story bro yes. ignored recommendations waited shit hit fan shut down. population density matters

mask wearing alone gonna eliminate flu. things like people working home winter months, mask wearing, people getting flu shots... stuff help Unfortunately no. Child trials beginning. another year little ones honest, didn’t realize people even went doctor flu mid-twenties; years ago. grew single-parent household tough deal sicknesses alone room. day isolate nurse back health I’m ill. That’s say- correct. Zoe McLaren someone constantly shooting saying still need actual number. agree, statements come “we still cannot tell people vaccines likely prevent infection/transmission.” Angela Rasmussen good tweet saying let public know smart enough realize masks don’t need cone now, vaccinated. minimum say “hey people vaccinated, take masks off?” really think that’s huge deal. Ummm show one?

I would probably bet money made hoping true. hindsight Florida done pretty good job.  Bruh mean, think want. I'll follow science.  Let's talk people becoming outraged tabloid news. Let's talk economy, politics facts. 

The EU disclosed many doses exported. said million. 

Why this? doses would wasted otherwise. vaccines ready go used infrastructure place Europe actually start vaccination use doses. Sounds crazy right? unfortunately quite true. vaccines exported majority Pfizer crazy temperature requirements really met, question getting people accept vaccinated, long process first many European countries. 

The EU failed itself. Exporting million doses irrelevant need shy 800 million population. 

It's also important know EU trying cement place geopolitical landscape, preventing free trade help cause. work biotech company hundreds licensed people administer vaccines, scarcity limitations bottlenecks. Nj allows smokers fat people people certain health conditions. Everyone lying Oh, well, guess person's life matter /s

I bet fun parties. LOL Scottish data suggests Astrazeneca slightly better Pfizer reducing hospitalisations - plus much cheaper, easier store, sold cost. EU want I'm sure plenty countries would happy more. single dose highly effective (about 80%). people avoid serious symptoms death getting level protection sooner later.

Also based current information seems reasonable assume vaccines significant sterilizing effect. case getting population vaccinated reduces overall rate transmission, even unvaccinated people benefit greater extent. ""by supplier seeks prevent dealer selling products""

UK negotiated terms part contract AZ, perfectly consensual business agreement. US mandated executive order, forcing manufacturer's hand. 

I sure EU's rationale pursuing clauses UK's manufacturers, whether chance (or whether companies pan out) would disappointing pulled US fact. Species thing go extinct. term used groups well. people would stop shoving Mtn Dew McDonald’s fat faces we’d save 1.7 million lives every year. hear this? Canadian here. know sure going reduce effectiveness?   speak Cleveland - football team fans last winter, baseball team fans opening day April. expect football stadiums *packed* fall college football. Thanks, appreciate it. hope wife safe healthy. got first vaccine week ago already feel safer. think lot people said no, clearly person replied implying. measles virus airborne survive air hours. walk room get infected someone left room long time ago isn’t even anymore.  It’s weeks. I’ve bronchitis done thing me. deserves look, wouldn’t say sort long covid yet export ban vaccines - ordered first 100 million doses Astrazeneca vaccine manufactured UK. sucks. I'm sorry go too. lot vaccinators make show work ID likely turned away lying. Well, restrictions without vaccines perhaps. vaccines building strong wall, getting higher every day. unethical lie deceive, including lie omission, yes lying get vaccine wrong  would mistake? anyone consider ""best effort""?

What mean? direct relationship level effort amount vaccine produced, otherwise every country would overflowing vaccines dozens manufacturers now. young adults expected continue quarantining get vaccine. Either COVID major threat individuals higher priority required work, COVID major threat individuals lockdowns pointless? option prefer? Literally everyone even cursory medical background, even laymen read papers, expected this.

Didn’t stop called “anti science” “tea reader” Operation get behind darky. North Dakota: ""Fuck Science!"" cannot, sorry   read it. missed part. would know Risssia zero didn’t read? Whole Foods? remember paying smoking tax... say link comment. hope masks least remain winter thing. seriously save lot lives prevent lot shitty time sick wearing mask grocery store airplanes. small town PA know 14 people FL souvenir Covid cases (from 4 different groups people). timeline it’s clear got brought back here. 2 hospitalizations, one resulting death. Thanks bump numbers FL.  union couple years ago contract negotiations. Well half store going cross picket line keep working cause company needed it. both? need see people less valuable elderly? 

As second half, long willing live alone sake people? kill outright since presence harm people? people fallen j&amp;j marketing hype ignoring fact significant chunk people get covid- especially mild cases- experiencing long term health problems. Since vaccine doesn’t protect mild covid, leaves people open long term issues. 

Even ridiculous argument it’s great vaccine vaccines (for viruses) worse efficacy. That’s like going store steak- 2 really high quality cuts 1 much lower quality cut, instead comparing 3 steaks other, reason lower quality steak best option it’s way better clearance pork chop prob tossed. Makes sense. 

Stick opinion. Hopefully able call around get appointment Pfizer Moderna. think lot type risk already dealt with. spend days breathing asbestos see COVID seem like big deal. parents children polio thing. grandmother probably saw Spanish flu. gotten flu couple times chicken pox barely remember. also cavity. freaked not.I think context counts lot. literally somebody reply saying ""it's flu people,"" definitely exist. think US going another lockdown, matter what. People sick tired it. would take something like 5k dying per day public opinion budge point. consistently says

Nothing says consistent. even vaccination target (70-85% big range), changed admitted lying based singular opinion public could “handle” Oh 100%. lot middle class boomers never got this. wouldn’t thinking public health agencies media actually non-misleading messaging. I’m sorry exactly 14 days second Pfizer shot, don’t give one single fuck. I’m done. agree psychological damage u cant expect majority follow practical Same...it lame... vaccine worthless significant majority population lockdowns rules end now. take seriously since Jan/Feb 2020. mask take precautions. part reason kids virtual school. concerns received many taken seriously enough see comments like take seriously start take comment shove reason virtual schooling many more? It’s pretty obvious you’ve projected viewpoint “people” since start conversation. One coworkers got second dose butt felt first dose caused much upper body muscle tension injected arm month two end April though. That’s late “everyone” get end April. think looking like June July. engineer biomedical field, hahaahahahahahahahahahahah!!! Try again. really suggesting racism purely north american phenomenon exists parts world influence? that’s one dumbest ignorant fucking things i’ve ever heard That’s heartbreaking. I’m sorry. 💔 Buybacks fucking great destroying evidence tho.

Also, last sentence lie. mean that, otherwise support things criminalising people arbitrarily. Israel smaller city vaccinated exposed mutually exclusive groups. can't add together way. People exposed/had covid also part group people getting vaccinated. wife's mood improved dramatically parents least first shots week ago. second dose yet knowing March 11 huge relief. They're early 70s. worry parents year huge dark cloud. Still, acting like completely unstoppable possibility damage control. Even Italy think spreading kind speed, media played disaster scenes way made seem like civilization collapsing country real idea situation.

If messaging try keep R 1 instead ""you're great long hospitals overflowing"" (which turned almost meaningless even get overloaded people said there's surge capacity move people ones) could handled much better. think hospitals kept enough capacity actually contagiousness completely collapse health care system extra capacity measures, effective ""flattening curve"". ""most"".

I said get long haul symptoms mild, get covid get long haul.

1/3 people covid get long haul. mild case Covid. 

The ability read important.  low? It’s job physically, mentally, time wise must exhausting great. Bingo! Iran here
Metoo!! think doctors like this? honestly believe society want? doctor wants another concert happen, ever? 

Do think they're fun time, watching people die? even unknown, vaccine research covid done wonders vaccine research development plenty known diseases Vaccines significant enough main thing driving drop. suspect we’re gonna plateau continue drop time vaccines increase. surprising. People saying cases/deaths/hospitilizarions would largely April May deluding extrapolating data always effect. don’t believe look Israel’s data much along vaccination US. think ebola contagious covid people would take precausions vast majority would wait governor tell saw something like themselves. Without data, assume remains threat. high case counts, even vaccinated give full protection, especially newer variants adenovirus based vaccines.

I'm also curious subtle effects children get covid - even asymptomatic kids damage body scans.

Add together, I'm good getting vaccine basics, indoor parties see case counts sub 10K/day +150M vaccinated. Learn something new every day Unfortunately, make sense give vaccine groups less likely come back second shot. see homeless people county type jails prime candidates. 1/3rd ""most"". significantly lower primary school children. secondary school age based   enough vaccine delivered federal government vaccinate everyone wants sometime April. that, still need distribute.

Don't deliveries arrive many continuous shipments? March 31 they'll dump 200 million doses front stoop White House say ""go it"" we're left wondering get rid sudden supply. They'll deliver several times per week, distributed constantly. least that's I'd expect. they're Pfizer moderna suspect open borders one big things popular EU point believe weeks ago survey EU got 74% agreement statement ""Without freedom movement EU would worth having""

I suspect sentiments like people pushing worried without open borders significant period time EU may lose lot popular support 

Friends tried warn me
But held head high
All time warned me
But passed by
They tried tell me
But guess care
I turned back and
Left standing there

All burning bridges fallen me
All lonely feelings burning memories
Everyone left behind time closed door
Burning bridges lost forevermore

Joey tried help find job
A ago
When finally got want go
The party Mary gave me
When walked away
Now there's nothing left say

All burning bridges fallen me
All lonely feelings burning memories
Everyone left behind time closed door
Burning bridges lost forevermore

Years passed keep thinking
What fool I've been
I look back past and
Think way back then
I know lost everything thought could win
I guess listened friends

All burning bridges fallen me
All lonely feelings burning memories
Everyone left behind time closed door
Burning bridges lost forevermore

Burning bridges lost I'm glad two got in! volunteered..and got 10 zillion spam calls  really joke. average hourly wage EMT NY $15.63, second highest paying EMT wage nation. Absolute joke. someone get past firewall please kindly post salient points argument vaccinating teachers feels like stupid argument even have. many teachers US? Google tells 3.7million. Let’s say 4million. could vaccinated two days. argument even worth having? Wealth advancement (in fields) go hand hand. bad, totally glanced that. Still, 40% better 0%. Update, it’s removed. Well, world ending, it? world (and NYC) still here.


It dramatic fast due number different factors, think population density obvious one. also lot public transportation use NYC.

And also consider, NYC quite simply cultural focus point. eyes US, world NYC. NYC lot people think think America, lot media centers based there. cultural lens might bias focus NYC.

Florida pretty dramatic spike, weathered well -- despite restrictions relaxed average state. think important area study looking back.  Haha worries What's worst Covid hotspot right US even importing vaccines US plant US moment. It’s really disheartening fragmented is. 

It’s mistake allow every state whatever want, distribute however want. 

We end issues states 19 year old smokers getting vaccine 64-yo cancer patient can’t.  biggest damn game beach volleyball world ever seen, that's what! media 'done' religions banned everyone world makes amount money everyone else. say Easter. Well feels like face palm me. I'm assuming planned budgets, states can't run deficit makes much harder allocate money throughout year vs beginning. seven day average deaths looks even worse. There's significant uptick last days. I'm hoping anomaly weather. # :O I'm happy Covax beginning work. thinking despair health care worker directly working Covid country begun vaccination watching 20 year olds countries get shot risk level even close.

 
Covax good initiative hope beginning stronger international response mechanism allows equitable distribution vaccines aid related health. way knowing.. that's point. (The various people interact randomly across every day ... constantly churning changing incredibly dynamic. person interacted yesterday could healthy.. assume they'll continue healthy.. could catch virus somehow overnight tomorrow, making assumption they're still ""clean healthy"".. wrong. know (and possibly neither would they). already late. 

If ""Star Trek"" style body-scanner people could walk .. could 100% unquestionably conclusively say:.. ""All 100 people confirmed proven healthy virus-free"".. yeah.. would awesome. 

But exist. How’s that? Right waiting people read report could involved whole time  adenovirus-based 1. NYC densely populated city America 

2. didn’t adequate supplies hospitals 

3. didn’t knowledge treatments five years it'll something else, stress much. There's even lab! We're intentionally infecting people covid. would needed double blind. vaccine clinical trials used approve double blind. give vaccine see much lower infection rates vs. non-vaccinated people. exact way 3 weeks one dose study done.

There's need correct experimenter bias case, placebo vaccine, double blind, single blind even. measurement. 1. information effect long term COVID issues?
2. I'm replying someone said ""It seems like garbage idk everyone's excited about."" we're focusing minimizing deaths rather spread, straight age-based approach may best.

I'm epidimologist though, maybe I'm wrong. I'm throwing idea. There's also possibility decisions made gets vaccinated politically motivated. don’t know knew this, covid *very* contagious. means even relatively low death rate, causes LOT deaths. wonder aware this, know many people died covid past year flu? Another poster said Palestinians bought vaccine. suggestion? Wait longer deploy vaccine? Tbf, might’ve extremely weak flu variant season. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* First thing thought - “that sounds great wait one” - lazily wake get ready morning meetings, bed, laptop, get paid dozens dollars hour work home. It’s literally problem wait mRNA solution.

Not everyone afford luxury waiting continuing quarantine - people’s jobs require leave hole interact public, financial situation doesn’t allow easily switch jobs.

I saw post someone day poor couldn’t afford switch direct deposit one predatory bank another manageable credit union - that’d cause ten day gap paychecks didn’t kind financial buffer that. 😞 bet person lucky get J&amp;J dose. basically hid flu cases calling covid? quite understand trying say. going them, yes, adults likely get infected children, least somewhat. 

If going would get infected first order transmit you, transmission never 100%, logically must lower risk? ""People reported fatigue, shortness breath, sleep disorders symptoms lasted months, said."" I'm saying people made sacrifices generations, ones forced into. beneficiaries countless sacrifices. think mostly people 16 largest group can't get right now. That's sizeable chunk population. Awesome vaccine yet? seeing anecdotal reports long haulers feeling better getting vaccine. Still waiting scientific study confirmation though. enough vaccinate everybody who’s willing end April. rest population may never get vaccinated. wonder happen summer vaccines flooding market, demand seize exist? Read article, tells less effective caused serious disease people diabetes truly fucking astonishing fast done. Yes, however there’s 1-month delay first dose second dose. means today, need dedicate 1m vaccines/day ensuring people receive second dose time. Currently, we’re vaccinating 1.4-1.6 million per day (I’m assuming current weather issues cause drop vaccination rate). they’re able supply 4m/day mid/end March, we’re going vaccinating rate ~2.5m first doses/day ~1.5m second doses/day, won’t exactly 110 million fully vaccinated (2-doses) people, instead maybe ~1/3 fully vaccinated (2-doses) ~2/3 partially vaccinated (1-dose only, still incredibly effective) definitely 110million people stage vaccine process. also back hand numbers, quote them, expect see successful ramping production combined month wait doses. Also vaccines full proof. Somebody refusing get vaccinated puts even vaccinated people risk exposure. doesnt cut bureaucracy thank god florida. Seriously wouldnt survived past year without state. actually cure HIV.

Um... even close. ""cure"" people blowing bone marrow give bone marrow someone CCR5 delta 32 mutation makes able avoid HIV, that's trading one immune compromised situation another, linked strongly dying let get way completely incorrect bit asshole think Covid longer killing people?

By mid July, I'm expecting COVID deaths side note America. Vaccines work, yo. don’t know either. seems getting worse areas tourists don’t know Dunkirk counts tourist area. solid guidance. husband told take anything first shot. went confirm second shot told first time nurse shrugged said thinks medicine fine. think even know. big one I've heard avoid Ibuprofen. Right mean vaccinated it’s risk assessment point. Fauci he’s point feels comfortable flying. That’s fine, point that’s he’s choice. say someone similar age vaccinated status shouldn’t fly either he’s loosing people Based previous technologies they'd pretty accurate estimation... someone worked next Moderna years back, developed vaccines, much optimistic. think, scientist myself, small shot ok mid-end summer people actually get vaccinated... also, realistic, many strains likely covered round vaccines already (I believe passed threshold already last summer). I'll called pessimistic, maybe, I'm evaluating honestly. detected 4,000 strains link CNN article quoting Moderna's CEO topic, nobody really knows yet. extremely unlikely many strains, known jumps species like mink, cross immunity every strain... perhaps spike protein major conformational changes strains exist yet. That's continuing right thing incubating virus super important... alas, regions entirely acting like pandemic exact thing, around world. Proven? one disgruntled state employee claimed fudged numbers? seem like anybody proved anything.  know long term side effects ccp virus shot People still getting hazard pay? EMTs severely underpaid valuable I'm pregnant breastfeeding. underlying condition qualified states current tier. definitely depends live.  Te 

The. Coming of.  Never ending nightmare, Yeah, AZ really fucked EU ass UK. sure talking about. Israel's cases seem dropping pretty rapidly. 

Cases US also declining pretty rapidly. major reason 13-14% population least one shot (which already pretty good protection) plus 30% population already infected. It’s season, it’s amount light exposure.

Proof? Much lower bar prove Thanks People especially loved beginning rollout slow limited healthcare Fun fact Merck &amp; Co US subsidiary original german Merck former US government expropriated WWI. Pandemic almost over. Step line like rest September hits we’re still sending grade schoolers class masks UK forward looking

Lol evidence piling up. January could see vaccinated population Israel showing decreased viral load PCR assays. point value low virologist would say patient transmitting right now. It‘ll take time prove epidemiological studies aswell data looks promising, meaning direct protection risk groups indirect effects preventing spread pandemic could come end soon (in developed countries least) Ignoring ""CDC says safe"" ""teachers deserve priority"" arguments. disagree economic reasons. way get teachers back school vaccinating them, it. allow people try re-enter work force. pay huge benefits starting part economic recovery can't start till kids back classrooms. 

Now maybe could say schools still shut positive test screwed kids get approved vaccine... God help us anyone needs/wants work monitor kid learning home. That's funny. Science seem agree opinion. tens thousands lives.

There single confirmed case COVID spread via surface transmission anywhere controlled laboratory environment.

*Not one.* Say sorry blaming problems Americans we’ll think it. know, know they're talking about. work clinical lab covid testing actually cartridge tests 4 viruses. test covid, flu B RSV time. covid result may one reported still tracking flu results zero positive flus area Minnesota. flu covid simultaneously 😬 Yes completely unethical IMO. Yeah, right. I’ve seen many bullshit “good news” stories COVID people don’t know better eat it’s want hear. 

Remember CDC raised estimate mortality rate 0.2% 0.6%? course don’t, headlines “CDC says 10X many cases reported! Death rate lower looks”. 

What time Pfizer decided could send us fewer vials vaccine count vial 6 doses instead 5? “Good news everyone! Pfizer set deliver doses promised earlier thought would!”

I swear god, it’s like something straight 1984. people tested symptoms covid negative..... assumed much would.be flu? say said secret knowledge? say J&amp;J never made mistakes?

Does J&amp;J sell baby powder today? figure still enough people wear masks wear properly, along touching mask face everything else.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* could get vaccine birthday early April would amazing read least one theory may complicated reason transmission/virulence trade-off. Like adding spike proteins also required becoming less virulent time, end seeing trade-off occur regardless circumstances (totally made-up example though...probably). think anymore theory though.

They're thinking latest strains increased virulence though, virus already following rules. could honestly see evolving either direction since neither seems anymore advantageous other. like said, get impression strong understanding stuff. Let’s smart know SURE coming soon. Keep wearing masks, distancing, get vaccine help loved ones get really get this. incredible. know seems like forever pandemics harsh terrible things. science done us herd immunity safety measures short period time incredible. RIP Americans worldwide lost fight continue to. Let’s strong ❤️ Take care yourselves, light end tunnel! Felt like sniffles. Turned head cold/“feel really bad now” 24 hours that. tested negative first two days. third day feeling bad subsided tested positive; chills cough started night necessarily. Rate means (number one thing) per (number thing). also talk ""success rate"" certain treatments, example. Snowstorms Methodology Change
Due significant change CDC’s reporting methodology, longer able include data obtained directly states analysis. CDC’s update results sudden change reported vaccinations states. Data reported CDC may update quickly states, cause temporary dip overall U.S. daily rate. basic disinfecting wipes contain ipa quat dont think were, 9th grade biology class. good news. significance 82% end June? Yeah she’s got lot issues. Sees world completely black white nuance. ""The vaccine doesnt eliminate spread entirely hunker summer 2022"" Sweet! Outdoor transmission negligble , people water parks typically ones considered high risk (75+, serious existing conditions, etc.) 

I'm gonna get season pass water park kinda close me, know open another couple months. cold right now. Honestly witnessing one sciences greatest achievements work right eyes. absolutely incredible came concerned yahoo mail mentioned mutant strain California that's massively transmissible, deadly, &amp; resistant vaccine. 

(now say loud, sounds like sensationalistic story, think front page yahoo would that.)

I guess opening restaurants mutant strain right? Well, *can't* tell people vaccines prevent transmission. *reduce* transmission. distinction important: vaccinated, reasonably lot things could vaccinated, still wary activities high transmission risk. 

That's permanent thing, course: case rates close zero (and countries, like US, might long all), vaccinated folks able go back pretty much normal. US 86,958 per million Israel 82,584 per million far off. Israel peak higher per capita new cases US peak. Even Israel vaccinating 35% people compared 5% US, US one steeper downward trend make sense. good question. finally say ""okay close contacts quarantine more""? think lying healthcare worker, teacher, etc. order get vaccine unethical?

ABSOLUTELY. They're much risk I. need vaccine much sooner us work safely. stay home work remotely months. We'll get chance. need their's soon possible. many young people got Covid, let alone got really sick died? point infection spikes, although predictions necessarily close accurate. 


Also, think post-reopening spikes blamed politicians taught people think COVID. opinion, big issue people entered state learned helplessness, take precautions unless politicians make mandatory. UK up-to date incidence fatality rate (IFR) estimates January 14: (click IFR tab)

IFR age group:

0-4: 0.00037%

5-14: 0.0013%

15-24: 0.0035%

25-44: 0.025%

45-64: 0.36%

65-74: 2.3%

75+: 19% would helpful last August. hell get one? live top 10 city damn near impossible find 7-day average new cases US holding steady verge creeping upwards too: think people getting lost charts show much historical data failing see things continuing drop forever. Canadian model bad thought joke first.  Case counts generally increase Monday Friday every week. Best compare count 7 days 14 days previous. 

New cases 6,000 last Tuesday close 40,000 14 days ago. vaccine count Bloomberg tracker terrible today? [Half many doses last makes sense isn’t even close enough supply get vaccinated herd immunity.

Not quite yet, couple months. Also keep mind previous infections (of US 100 million) also contribute herd immunity. word ""hero"" overused long time. impact seriously diluted. wear masks ""all time."" people keep saying ever actually Asia 2020? Maybe crowd one two people wearing mask. People sick, good practice. Stop acting like everyone going around masks Asia pre-2020. often test flu? I'm referring school openings UK. I'm referring notion vaccine-escaping variants, never ending pandemics such, based panic; science, entirely ignoring effectiveness approved vaccines have.

And answer question. Angie Rasmussen, Ashish K. Jha, Scott Gottlieb, Howard Forman, Trevor Bedford, Francois Balloux Muge Cevik science medical experts follow closely. That’s right. exit strategy want get back I’m going go it. comment literally first time I’ve heard term far know, shipments US affect shipments EU. vaccines used US made US, none vaccines made US go countries. I'm CoVid denier, make sense combined effort U.S. putting in, including minimal non-existent effort people putting forth areas, experiencing flu cutback less .02%? know believe we've done enough cut back 99.98% flu. share screenshots instagram last night people packed bar California wearing masks, birthday party live music all. I've wondering this. quarantine positive effect communicable diseases?  Contra Costa probably mid late March, adjusted case rate 12.5 per 100k. growing body evidence suggests Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna vaccines do, fact, cut viral transmission. Two recent studies show pretty favorable results — one UK found two doses Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cut 86 percent someone’s chances developing infection could pass along, study Israel found 89.4 percent reduction (though noted Israeli study yet fully released). findings consistent know vaccines transmission general.

This encouraging. Based studies seems like Pfizer Moderna least 86% effective infection transmission. important remember mean vaccines effective reducing transmission, all. remember reading somewhere AstraZeneca 27% effective asymptomatic Covid. know J&amp;J since 67% effective preventing **moderate disease**, guess effectiveness infection transmission similar AstraZeneca's. still needs researched. case. Pfizer shortage borne parties supplied plant. EU stop exports AZ shortages plant, would making parties bear cost shortage nothing contracts. Also, per Bloomberg

Methodology Change
Due significant change CDC’s reporting methodology, longer able include data obtained directly states analysis. CDC’s update results sudden change reported vaccinations states. Data reported CDC may update quickly states, cause temporary dip overall U.S. daily rate. That’s sad. Germany problem people thinking certain vaccines good enough take. politicians said really silly things. scientifically correct total PR disaster. talk mum back accepting ever get. think worth remembering that, deaths avoided prevented. die. best we're avoiding untimely death (e.g. car wreck). 

With something like flu gets little less clear generally speaking probably pretty close death already flu kills you. Another one NJ found sites lets know things opening register would though? clinical trials already done that. symptomatic infection absolutely capable spreading virus too. Plus AstraZeneca also shown fair chunk patients able asymptomatically infected (a similar proportion number unvaccinated people asymptomatically infected). One shot pretty much enough protect you. Two shots better, second one delayed (for several months). experiences similar vaccines even say better spread larger period. That's vaccines (like hepatitis) repeated 6 several months apart *minimum* wait dose better protection.

It's like washing hair twice get really clean. first wash gets stuff out, second one extra clean. cleaner wash hair every day week, instead washing 7 times Monday.

So, worry. got shot, protected *enough*.  really cigarette smoke, measles community great degree. new strain SARS-CoV-2 achieves immune escape still going called SARS-CoV-2. I'm actually talking disease condition deliberately (which -- since reddit blissfully unaware sarcasm irony -- clarify understand also still called COVID-19) live BigMacRepublic specifically says condition improved time. vaccine rollout Trump era initiative referring worldometers list like 7th considering Gibraltar San Marino occupy first two spots really tiny countries populations less 40,000. Variants appear concern vaccines ""wearing off,"" though degree immune escape variants highly unlikely big deal already immune. idea population Israel is?

USA Population 330 Million

7 Day moving average cases 69,579

21 Cases per 100,000

Israel Population 9 Million

7 day moving average cases 3,529

39 Cases per 100,000

Yeah daily number looks low Israel significantly smaller United States. daily per capita infection rate almost 2x US is. ""So another 2.5 years vaccinate everybody""

I feel like people skeptical vaccine adopted mantra. Wonder next. hard time believing aren’t deceived little bit benefit haves vs nots. feeling science data says vaccination good go, people don’t want say trying get little blow back still rolling out. don’t want people don’t get pissed waiting. yet see anything doesn’t make believe this. BTW, haven’t seen take similar someone said it, full disclosure opinion.  Chinese government hire sway public opinion something? You’re deflecting like life depends it. Essential means bottom food chain 100% less though? mean come on, impossible. might surprised rich people get away US Well countries actually serious lockdown essential meant something important close - really supposed much food drug stores. mostly US thing screw around let practically anything weasel way calling ""essential"", kind thing made meaningless. Totally agree, biggest boy needs lollipop soiling bed. sure I’m downvoted. mariners stuck ship year point, equal number work unable engage ship. know it’s like stuck ship covid outbreak thousands miles away nearest hospital? limited amount oxygen, using oxygen bottles engineers run medical grade? forgot /s Ugh, unfortunately ""Airfinity"" again. Went website, regular person cannot see data sources. Would love see data sources. chance data sources news sources use different data Airfinity? cannot analytics company knows much money countries invested. Would also want verify data (for example: use data member states including EU, direct EU investments).  One worst stories I've ever read. definitely not. anyone know much vaccine US shipping pharmacies next week? know 1M last week 2M week. CDC allocation states next week 15M, hopefully there's another big chunk going pharmacies well. demand 5G tracking chips....the 5G coverage house sucks, hoping get couple bars phone...

Come Bill Gates, come through! France peaked beginning November plateaued stayed (probably lockdowns). vaccination + natural induced immunity like parts United States starting see. No, reinfected died. really severe case early on, spent 30 days hospital (this still new country), endured five exploratory surgeries multiple organ failures finally recovering enough released.

Like said, extreme case covid people ever experience \*lucky\* dude. basically ravaged body turned healthy 40 y/o 80 y/o matter weeks. Unfortunately, no. 

""Fauci said Pfizer start studying vaccine 5- 12-year-olds beginning April. said study take year, anticipates data 12- 15-year-olds sometime fall.

Moderna, bit behind, process enrolling 12- 17-year-olds trial. March, begin enrolling kids age 6 12, 2 6, 6 months 2 years.

Fauci said timeline similar Moderna: sometime fall high school students least early 2022 elementary school hoping vaccines first graders Fall. think something lower covid numbers making study take longer (fewer infections). Good news, wait till hear bad stuff! I’m property manager. manage 1200 units total. I’d say half people haven’t paid rent 11 months people going work every day months. aren’t paying bc don’t to, hope handout end. lot half didn’t pay timely before.

Most people paid least it, truly need able get rent assistance numerous agencies got federal funds assist this. Oh remember elementary school used coal 1964. could look window see goal pieces dancing conveyor belt school. must changed oil used oil delivery firm parents used. Neither particularly ecological. Lying ""avoid mass panic"" another nation literally epidemic got bad first place. come believe virtually never good idea this. Fauci's well-meaning lies early days left many people subsequently disbelieving masks work, example. feel great. person recognizes health workers everywhere vaccinated first serving humanity well avoiding disgusting narcissism people revel in. think you’re confusing different things. “Orthodox” term you’re looking for. may thinking “Haredi,” comment lot media speculation there’s evidence it, it’s certainly “orthodox” thing get 200m adults vaccinated, would lucky. I'd happy 175m. 

That number go kids vaccinated, course. Oh goodness. injecting red herrings. simply asking remember people lost lives COVID regardless numeric figure years lost, understand would've likely precious time planet. That's red herring. That's asking, again, remember humanity behind numbers. Like said, I'm outraged. I'm disappointed even considering I'm repeat again. I've actually done conversation ever since said ""fine"" continued perpetuate feel like somehow defend aspersions. Kindly step honestly, going see point I've keenly aware several back forths. I'm tired feeling well. really need think it'd healthier well. Sometimes communication understanding happen. mean circle like pack nipping dogs. 

Thanks advance hopefully understanding least. reply again, respond zero point. single one?! Ok that’s suspicious af agree, feel like people go maskless right away understand takes time getting vaccine actually affect within body. Covid continue mutate, evolution action. Nothing ... provably need boosters. Mask up, social distance, get vaccinated time comes. New “Insert country/state/region here” could infectious, cause reinfections, worser people, says “insert science person” Seeing certain states lift restrictions give confidence **that** happen  Yup, county: One case per month low. Schools generally pretty safe. spread virus schools minimal. guess it’s masks flu season forever We're global pandemic...so vaccine ANYTHING EMERGENCY? Average efficacy 66% doesn’t compare Pfizer Moderna vaccines. won’t feel confident vaccination numbers. would nice year ago. want too. dont mind waiting. Studies show there’s fairly robust lasting immunity moderate infection like one got essential worker. J&amp;J producing preparation approval? makes absolutely sense.  I'd imagine EUA Saturday doses shipped Monday. can’t play game. use facts. want go rabbit hole, studies covid trash logic. think socialist rifle Association John Brown gun club members support nra?? 
 
Do even know pro gun organizations exist? 
 
I think lot shootings happen ""gun free"" zones. Schools soft targets. emotionally appealing psychopaths. churches.  
 
Youve given platform pontificate reasonable solutions actual counterpoint plenty insults.  
Thanks. Wisconsin agree Memorial Day. also think first really nice spring day. Probably middle end March. people 65 vaccinated already it’s going fall apart.  seems roughly around 15 covid begins deadly flu.

Yeah, I've never ounce concern kids getting it. want get pass others boiling life covid avoidance going forward. fun that.  concern governments take numbers discriminate people got 65% (on paper) vaccine Johnson &amp; Johnson. happy finally leave country go Europe realize Pfizer Moderna's vaccine get past customs, want J&amp;J / Sputnik / Chinese vacciners.  true. staff treat COVID aren’t breast reductions surgeries. Even hospitals downsized staff. need staff treating COVID lot areas hospitals making choice staffed work doctors meet demands rather take burden costs. feed conspiracy theorists well ah two shot trial Good you! want go back life sucks. I'm sorry. High hopes pull through. best. No, union formed much later others kind clout uniformed services NYC did.  Maybe people going car avoid air travel? Click baity virus existing doesn’t mean transmissible. can’t one ways. virus spread takeout/mail/groceries not? CDC says so, means can’t spread clothes well. There’s reason taking something like zzzquil contains Diphenhydramine day vax shot bad, right?

I got shot Monday took Diphenhydramine sleeping pills last night. missing people undiagnosed cases covid would mild asymptomatic round two Monday. began telling participants process week, since looked like approval imminent. Said expect calls upcoming week. 

I given chance different vaccine work within next weeks pushed second dose date short time. would 58-60 days first week March. 

I’ve got first antibody blood draw shot 2 second week March now. Glad works well I’ll Pfizer one even wait next year it. ignoring severe-critical due super small sample size, moderate-severe differences much smaller anticipated. good news overall. Compared rest states, NYC much higher cost living. isn’t doomscrolling subreddit anymore. It’s bloomscrolling subreddit anybody info J&amp;J trial regarding two dose regimen? still trial idea it’d completed?

I think it’d cool vaccine tested effective ways, single dose necessary even better protection second dose flush air car like five seconds That's something pretty well understood beginning. I'm little embarrassed actually lost track fact. stop there's war. wrong predicting millions vaccines ready? 66% moderate severe symptoms efficacy % US looks good based 40k people. regions, much.  Teachers can’t work home either. Kids failing last sentence lie. don’t mean that, otherwise you’d support things criminalizing people arbitrarily.

Explain please. I’m seeing connection you’re trying claim statement last sentence (copied solve using variety approaches different angles together issue resolved. Read last paragraph article. might rate vaccines take variants account. It’s still super effective. 

A wild coronavirus appeared! used VACCINE. 

It’s super effective!

Enemy CORONAVIRUS fainted!  Everyone benefits smart decisions, agree? mRNA technology could huge impact treat prevent known diseases. Wouldn’t say there’s difference terms restrictions long grind keeping virus years come ?

Based scientific reports vaccines well protecting serious illness, according medical community number 1 metric 

Keeping society shutdown meet magical goal post 10 years isn’t sustainable .

There diseases world cause harm live it. Even partial protection vaccines get us  I'm going kiss mouth.  Children suffering levels California. rest country open fine hybrid models! Teachers aren’t dying that’s lie. Shame you.

Gavin Newsome’s kids school full time person. Education becoming right wealthy seems. anyone outside California.

Teachers absolutely ashamed fighting kids. Seriously. Especially comes things like customer support lines. beginning, sure. it’s year...

Poland, Czechia, got hit badly November, managed turn things around (for time). Czechia seems going bad worse. wish congress would stop trying put non-covid related things (Like 15 dollar minimum wage, money foreign countries, etc) stimulus bills. slows process passing stimulus also reduce amount money package.

Just related strange rant. dislike using ""spring"" indicator time. bet surveyed reddit, vast majority would consider June solidly Summer. Kids school, days long, warm everything long since bloomed.

Accept good news  21yr old cop attitude ""Ha.. I'm worrying that,. I'm high risk group chances dying less 1%"".. go behave .. could dead couple weeks

First numbers painting accurate picture. state based confirmed deaths confirmed cases 20-29 age group, CFR 0.01%, CDC estimates like 4x many cases confirmed cases, IFR likely far lower. 0.01% number include everyone auto immune issues, etc.

If healthy 21 year old chances dying Covid obscenely low. Seriously barely register. You’re way likely die something else.

Your comment lot “could be”... “might be”... yeah “could” exposed “mutation” die 21. That’s news anyone. happen time. Imma come back say point might merit seeing AZ wasn’t available till 4th Jan. prior vaccines would’ve given old people, minimum turn around time vaccine effect 6 weeks. 3 weeks get immunity another 3 weeks catch coronavirus die... we’re looking prevented deaths early Jan right now, doses Pfizer data public. Make coronation death tracker choice. watch numbers recent weeks. usually undercounted go higher later.

Everyone cheating degree someone worse others. variety approaches solely consists singular knee jerk reactions criminalizing citizens.

It's oxymoron Good god that’s miserable Unlikely. Northern Hemisphere season usually follows Australian one, Aussie flu cases higher normal Jan-early March 2020. shaping bad season here.

Might’ve good vaccine/strain match year. it’s hard tell since flu shots came late March, time everyone went first round lockdowns.  Yeah, agree. going mad people simultaneously pushing “the vaccine doesn’t provide immunity” “asymptomatic cases massive organ damage”

Which would basically meant would pass virus back forth eachother died organ failure, guess. state still bans sporting events, indoor dining, recently stay home order, experiencing fastest recovery. \*Surprised pikachu.\*

As much shit Newsom received missteps, fear California could looked like someone incompetent DeSantis. least Newsom admits corrects mistakes.

The experts science disagrees you. accurate characterization single longitudinal study pretty small sample size showed somewhere 15% 20% people COVID symptoms *bad enough require hospitalization* (the definition ""mild"" study - majority ""mild"" cases would likely classified moderate severe cases J&amp;J trial based reported symptoms fever, cough, and/or fatigue) reported fatigue loss smell 3 9 months initial illness resolved, percent might symptoms. fully believe lingering effects moderate even mild cases COVID, want downplay draining stressful must minority people get not-terribly-severe COVID months lingering fatigue affects badly. even ignoring whether study actually says anything types cases J&amp;J would consider mild, none really makes think huge numbers people mild COVID symptoms really likely experiencing *debilitating illness* ten years out, whereas people refused vaccine two months got severe COVID could end hospitalized dead survive much likely REALLY serious medium/long term complications seen, including life-threatening complications like predisposition organ failure. considering I'm fully expecting end getting booster shots variants and/or renewing immunity within year probably possible get RNA shot later even now, COVID probably peak pre-vaccine availability harder catch months now, fully unprotected couple months seems waaaaaay worse somewhat reduced protection year. Like said though, that's personal risk assessment. Exactly. People better get ready exactly life style leading epidemiologists prefer advocate. note majority incidents go unreported. Casual curious questions like “do really eat bat home?” extremely offensive victim often swallow silently. don’t need physically assault people hurt them.  Can't wait see u/MrMrsMonk start posting pandemic nears end. Vmat2 god gene, figured '05 gene humans possess makes likely spiritual. US military planning using Middle East make population logical, hence less spiritual, idea logical they'd less radical. Luciferin sort bioluminescence. Bill gates talks ab this. tattoos well make glow. compounds contain benefits biology virus treating wise. here?  elderly sick people get vaccinated let's reopen society keep rolling vaccine Ah kick rocks ... what? approvals FDA CDC. experts. specifically view bureaucrat? Yeah population autonomous robots could've reopened Easter, population imperfect humans, realistic expectations would take mRNA vaccine?  mRNA tech also way faster older methods IIRC, untested pretty much theoretical. cut beurocracy least predictable, even smart assume would intense. development time vaccine also huge leap forward. It’s fucking glorious. Yeaa protest going mask pubs violeting measures. Seems like double edged problem what's happening Czech Republic and, like SA variant, able reinfect everyone covid already?

This false. Glad see restrictions finally beginning ease places. makes feel relieved getting pandemic.  General term “doctors” overboard. bad. 
The small handful drives public policy governors let happen since can’t seen contradicting experts. rules apply ""biweekly"" well? Lol. EU first foremost trade (no customs, unified standards, bureaucracy, money transfers etc). Travel side story.  even know going economy right now? even know stock market sliver whole economy? companies, vast majority, even list stock exchanges.  Work home parents easy street lemme tell ya... Vaccines *everyone* (or least vast majority can/will take it) end-game. vaccines personally.

A huge problem also (that many ignoring) children, authorized current vaccines, account 25% US population.

Things undoubtedly going improve (as arguably already), masks going around longer many people think. That's good well high-quality vaccines coming millions. us live places fortunate. said something like recently TikTok video kinda got chastised thinking people ""can't"" get vaccine due medical conditions allergic reactions, etc. I'm sure large /signficant group is? Anyway, thought it'll kind ironic we're vaccinated still wearing masks protect anti-vax... assume real interesting test would long antibodies high enough quantity reduce risk future infection. think that's interesting. first thought. needs go muscle. trained IM injections hip arm.

Yes could get butt. way could mass vaccinate line people get pants?

Why would add hurdle?? I’m teacher. I’d that, don’t think they’re organized enough make work. district can’t even figure when/if we’re opening now, much less happen summer. 

They would find funding pay teachers, get parents enroll, figure logistics like curriculum. takes time. lol know, things like samples sizes... 

The number potential exposure events kind important. want start jabbing people vaccine 5% efficacy? Omg one getting recalled even members party??? People severe learning difficulties already included. like malicious plot exclude them, trying misleadingly imply. blanket inclusion *everyone* learning disability, people fell cracks imperfect system (which people physical health issues, nature generalise many people). 
 
Celebrities pressuring issue meant less hassle issue blanket prioritisation *everyone* learning difficulties, even mild ones, means shutting up, means lot people prioritised really reason be, expense others.  
 
As usual, really, bit case celebrities pressing ""selfless"" looking causes selfish reasons, things really understand, people represented token celebrity lose result, there's plenty people vulnerable reasons prioritised, who've also fallen cracks similar ways, wait even longer. absolutely horrendous. sorry. chance. I’m south usually get Memorial Day. delayed school year go mid-June parents pissed. Well, they’re pissed school virtual, it’s reopening in-person, sky blue ¯\_(ツ)_/¯   consider lucky. *only* lost job eventually got new one. strange form Hell basically trapped townhome girlfriend year interacting virtually anyone else sacrificial lambs. first time obvious.

Yes ""essential"" initially meant grocery workers, Hosptial staff etc. notice everyone marched back work overnight. Even need physically office. 

My office work almost entirely remotely. soon lockdown lifted forced back office. office do, remote off-site server. 

It's thing firm looses money post smaller profit people top would like. turn cut salaries dead weight top contribute little overall success business. 

No, cut ""essential"" staff bottom, without business would collapse. force remaining staff take responsibility. know failed - idea vaccine even possible, long would take. 

If looked like vaccine ever coming coming decade, probably would indeed strategy much higher burn rate. funny can't tell intent comment describe registration system dystopian bureaucratic nightmare, blame open source asynchronous queueing implementation. Like honestly “wearing mask winter/fall” apocalyptic scenario you? don’t think it’s insane shut restaurants, schools, sporting events, theaters, bars, concert halls, etc flu? really don’t think that’s absurdly overkill? might well never leave home you’re scared That's natural consequences deaths taking fully report chain. data ""complete"" current week, look several weeks back. mean anyone hiding anything. not? Seriously? surely don’t think everyone else getting crazy? wonder ever flu mRNA shot? thing happen?  work major retailer quite literally giving hand sanitizer away free purchase bought certain SKUs hundreds thousands units known even weren’t, vaccines end game. That’s good going get. 

That said got Covid April waiting almost year everyone “catch up” think masks Memorial Day fine would taken people give single solitary fuck others, ironically requires humanity, actually. year celebrate INDEPENDENCE!!! Serious question: 7 day average appear though beginning tick up? seen good answer yet. muh variants due testing reporting anomalies due bad weather last week? world talking about? stock market entire economic engine country. Every single publicly traded business depends health market. need better ways identify serious bias embedded AI across social media news matching sites. Perhaps third party organization could conduct systematic evaluation content, response reports users. No, ones days data, North Dakota’s r0 1 since February 15th. yes South Dakota one day data, wouldn’t find significant weren’t ND’s increases well. seems strange weeks ago many commenting dakotas might hit form immunity cases per capita state good margin vaccines luck draw state? could see people wanting take Pfizer Moderna instead J&amp;J. Yes. So, it’s really unfortunate success rates vaccines reported. success rate effective preventing getting COVID severity level. people see 85%, Astra Zeneca around 65%, think isn’t good. reality vaccines still good. Nobody got hospitalized. Nobody died. people mild/moderate symptoms home, overall fine. vaccinate population quickly vaccine prevents 85% cases, fatalities hospitalizations, people get cold, well that’s BIG win. point Spring France simply lift restrictions sheer exasperation. would thought six pm curfew work? Cause...life? one guaranteed safety every time leave house. Life comes risk. one idea they're talking about. Forcing non-expert FDA commissioner sign get fired. Worked great. Saved lives. never said need even help suppress flu. basic level hard require masks distancing things like public transport, certain large gatherings hold winter months depending severity flu season? Please stop strawmanning me, I'm scared flu, want save many lives possible. approved yet btw. Still fda advisory meeting cdc meeting. last mostly less day... steps involve experts justifying positions never friends first place, easier shame people seeing friends Even jobs medicine mandating vaccine. Nobody said it’s ending next week, we’re happy see it’s clearly improving Same! understand. several approvals chain. *not* done experts; ones need expedited. restrictions I'm following come October wearing mask public transport grocery store. Beyond following single restriction.  panels bureaucracy. They're medical experts CDC VRBPAC whose job declare whether ""safe"" not.

Stop. Slow down. Take deep breath. read wrote instead arguing.

You're comprehending simple arguments written plain english. teacher North Dakota? not, opinion uninformed meaningless.

They've tried following guidelines. Still good enough want get paid nothing. Go back read everything I've said. Sure places indoor dining, visiting friends, basically living low key life within restrictions.... hear lot messaging bad ideas even fully vaccinated. No, they're not. They're political appointees. head FDA - forced sign lose job - oncologist. *not* position review relitigate conclusions actual experts immunology. That's medicine / science works. start thing flu virus. 

What call flu really wide range fairly unrelated rapidly mutating viruses. really. I'm living Switzerland. AZ vaccines:

- produce enough data make sure older people protected can't use people needs most

- coming late winter, spring month. infection figures decreasing steadily since 2 months, one feels need rush vaccine proven excellent now. Maybe Scot data change point.

- next autumn, we'll enough doses mNRA vaccines cover population. Absolutely whole way life gone Yeah California's peaked something like 70% excess Florida's 30%. people die per capita daily Florida older population. download data set total excess deaths Florida middle worldometer total Covid deaths.  Unless government expendable! see got first vaccines dont you. wasnt nursing home folks elderly representatives! Hell ya!! wouldn’t, unless someone forced take conserve costs supply. Macron shitting place  got union letter getting job Fry’s (Kroger). Never got one before. Stray bullets horrible comparison think point made much better use driving. Driving frequent activity highly dangerous (relatively) yet people choose accept risks risks outweighed benefits. can't say certain whether point COVID (and honestly depends individual) point people accept risk COVID exist form like diseases returning normal life. watched documentary shown severe economic situation Philippines covid; people litterally starving. I’m wondering still possible people refure vaccination. Moderate disease actually pretty gnarly, J+J’s COVID-19 disease defined laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: evidence pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, shortness breath abnormal blood oxygen saturation 93%, abnormal respiratory rate (≥20); two systemic symptoms suggestive COVID-19.

And severe disease - remember, J+J vaccine 85% effective preventing severe disease - even study, definition severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: signs consistent severe systemic illness, admission intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure death, among factors. Israel research data suggest opposite, big surge infections right vaccinations, researchers sure thought maybe people dropped precautions soon got first dose (despite told to)

This super interesting exactly type thing *won't* show controlled trial people sure whether they're vaccinated! feel like unfortunately goes lot essential workers. lot Teachers back classroom year, never seen treated worse, live, already treated pretty poorly. noted China, Australia, New Zealand managed virus near-zero happily living life restrictions. concerts hundreds thousands people. Friends go restaurants laugh drink without fear dying killing loved ones. 

The question need ask ""how long live restrictions"", ""how get like China/Australia/New Zealand?"". need eliminate virus, period. bring covid home dad hospitalized month wont think fault then? Yay! cancelled anymore! J&amp;J vaccine approved, think I’m finally going unfollow sub! Thank talk covid worst. somewhere go everyone getting sick talking able keep family safe right precautions. I’m going go hard road reclaiming mental health getting life back track. Godspeed you! &lt;3 Geez man. I’m sorry. hope see soon! understand mixing could lead issues immunity might positive effect. IE: get J&amp;J mRNA dose later might improve protection all. studying it. also part reason I'll shopping around mRNA vaccine turn. Yes are, throwing shit river ditching bush someone else find. could go hours destroy evidence. It’s prefect might help lower amount fire arms would normally black market. “no questions asked” means people less scared give guns black market not. well making profitable someone going selling black market. think I’m gonna pay 40 bucks month read shit opinion? Ha! lost grandma COVID last month. absolutely hoping grandma comes without issue. Bless family. know worrisome helpless feel. New York state mass vaccination sites used issues started using two protection measures think online systems start using vaccines available:

1. Reservation system pick date guaranteed end long finish registering within reasonable time limit.
2. Ticket/queueing system lets certain number people pick dates time, might wait 15 minutes select appointment, less likely appointment dates swept mass people selecting appointments time.  Thank way people talk makes think there’s lot undiagnosed agoraphobia Reddit. (I diagnosed 15.) It’s one thing homebody, Redditors seem legitimate anxiety thought leave house WFH Zoom School ends. Good luck selling public.

Selfishly I'm willing let Americans die ship vaccines we've paid 3rd world countries hope virus mutate something vaccines can't defeat. sounds like lot ifs maybes - I've home year wife fucked catch Covid. 

Where specifically would send it? Could distribute efficiently country? Americans willing stay inside another several months piecemeal together strategy developing world? 

I'll roll dice taking months get fellow countrymen vaccinated go back work pay shitshow.

If need close borders, it.

America first. OH yeah anti maskers yeah... literally heard brother police visited local restaurant tell People inside keep music quiet... Pretty telling specifically excess death comparison Florida California makes California ""better"" fail see conclusion based data provided.

Florida looks peaked 5000 deaths/week average California 10,000 deaths/week average Winter 2020 spike. California's population roughly double Florida. remember, r20s ended Great Depression. That's still separate issue. completely understand frustrated. that's question even really related to.

I'm asking seems impossible acknowledge need plans place better communication also acknowledge covid still problem. two things mutually exclusive. best type surge sick Perfect Peggy. i’m US husband sick recently (high fever, congested) negative covid strep (??? don’t know tested that) I’m pretty sure probably flu didn’t get flu shot winter son did. didn’t even test it, places even testing flu? going go find sources realized idiot downvoters seem think guaranteed = 93% (even entertain shit notion.)

So yeah, good job posting semi-source refuting claim. Second, fact even believe wrote proves without shadow doubt you’re selfish asshole won’t drive 20mph save lives.  Thank you. number cited accurate, exactly thought was. 

My info came [this CDC reporting total 75 laboratory-confirmed influenza-associated hospitalizations Oct. 1, 2020 Dec. 12, 2020, reported FluSurv-NET sites.

FluSurv-NET sites represent total nationwide hospitalizations like thought. Still, info good news.

Hospitalization rates stratified age presented case counts increase level produces stable rates age.

Following meant nothing pandemic  feel guys, too. get past eventually though. to. soon vulnerable groups chance get vaccinated left non-vulnerable people low risk serious illness probably still restrictions

That won’t happen literally tomorrow, yes, pretty pretty soon zero plan lifting restrictions happens patience running thin

If actually plan lifting restrictions least somewhat reasonable manner, I’d placated, zero plan US we’re still acting like it’s airborne Ebola almost acknowledgement nuance officials conversation thread somebody said ""flu less deadly covid,"" got summarily downvoted invisibility.

Nobody saying directly, silencing notion covid still dangerous. narrative pushed, narrative ""end restrictions now, covid big deal anymore, pandemic want be."" comment made genuinely chuckle. 1 year living virus lot people still irrationally scared conditions user finds in. outdoors, chill out.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Meh... fear mongering trash. read ""Cruz Ban"" comment, hoped Texas come senses. No. implying island nations managed get around Covid pretty much unharmed, would able well. 

Every first world country 2000-750 deaths per million. United States fits right in. outliers 2nd/3rd world countries island nations like New Zealand South Korea. 

Maybe could say 250,000 preventable that's comparable rate deaths per capita (Netherlands) imply could came unscathed absurd. can't wait lawsuits workers file jobs got covid work job provide adequate ppe Yea um, that’s flu, otherwise would covid either. literally say that. want lockdowns continue.

I'm saying writing immucompromised people shitty. Surely see shitty asking stay home them, right? really struggle stuff, one hand support people right choose medical procedures drugs agree to. hand, people can't protect put risk choose to? Shocking, recover faster states state higher % people catching COVID state.... booster whatever. Things fluid change every month. Smart honestly, people don’t ability quarantine. access care others do.  Conspiracy’s definition implies something harmful, like joke anyway. wear seatbelts, people still die car accidents absurd expect people avoid driving completely take far restrictive measures tiny risk (""stay home, stay safe"" works avoid car accidents, too, one expects anyone that).

Or even less (and sadly realistic) that: put speed limit 15, although would certainly save lives, would cripple economy annoy people. Sound familiar? Single payer treat doctors better. Canada UK treat doctors much worse US, that's many leave US way around risk death covid nowhere near great. think term ""sacrifice"" really right one circumstance since matter equality entitlement. I'll explain. 

Let's start basic propositions, imagine agree on: everyone inalienable right ""life, liberty pursuit happiness"" society strive ensure rights enjoyed equally. is, much right live do, much right live grandmother does. society strive ensure enjoy rights equally.

COVID impacts rights unequally across populations many ways, purposes conversation, acutely area mortality. grandmother several times likely die severely hurt COVID am, COVID represents greater infringement right life. incumbent society general ensure equal enjoyment right life, allowing people whose rights threatened COVID vaccinated first vindicates duty.

In practice rights enjoyed equally across population ton complicated reasons. particular instance, easy government balance equities allocating limited pool vaccines people whose rights threatened. nothing English though. people using wrong term.  worry all. problems vaccines enough warrant lock travel, bigger problems. undercounting covid deaths works make look better. Russia (they recently admitted 3x official number). claiming ""people listening guidelines"" requires zero data evidence easily flipped needs suit narrative. Looks like earned it. Bold assume Redditors friends. rescheduled last august June aren’t postponing again- things trending right direction! anything, way early make call now. everything , there’s mixed messages mid-November \~ 1% Denmark's population confirmed COVID, period. 3.5%. clear short-term antibodies work disease, first figure ones might see reinfection all.

Even UK strain could reinfect prior response, shows real evidence doing, would extremely hard detect country prevalence. side effects? friends thirties got shot gnarly side effects first two take work. one easier, I'll go that. take work, close classroom, avoid that, saves fifteen parents find 730am child's classroom closed! Governments likely incentivized minimize pandemic. Follow money. might ""compareable"" (in quotes still bad do) national level. greatly locale how/when results processed/reported varies. example, report results based lagged database, set file run Tuesday morning still weekend data.

Look specifically last couple Tuesday/Wednesday comparisons states cherrypicked, thing. R0 baseline. 100% susceptible population specific measures place. account environmental factors normal population behaviours. sense rely intrinsic traits pathogen.

Rt (t time) effective transmission rate takes account susceptibility, mitigation etc. may wrong, think fair call delusional. strain responsible child elderly parent tough. think try infer anything scientific literacy parents based upon caution toward grandmother.

You start making decisions parents small ways add years. bigger decisions. suddenly there's one two realize hold life hands. changes person, extent. Look back year ago people calculating death rates comparing number deaths number confirmed recoveries coming absurd numbers like ""this kills 15% people catch it, we're doomed."" serious trend while. data shows us even injection sites working holidays / weekends (at least nearly much.) told stop panicking abiut epidemic year ago... turned well. :( This. thought DeSantis crazy reopened Florida back October hindsight, fine, comparable California, another warm state except Florida way old people expect way worse. end Florida fine Wednesday Thursday. well organized kleptocracy. staff recommendation full brief members board. imagine they'd like time review brief, make sure questions, etc. people know likely approved, imagine start moving available vaccine distribution points ready go EUA issued. could see point talking weeks. Imagine many lives saved everyone looked data made determinations *in parallel.*

Not would vaccine come nearly month sooner - big part problem holidays slowing ramp-up. effectively lost 1.5-2 months insisted signoff signoff signoff one another, rather working problem time.

There's argument made cost hundreds thousands lives added virtually value safety / efficacy process. knew it. Everyone owns bonsai trees also unpleasant. can't coincidence anymore. can’t see happening fast. can’t even get vaccines 70 year old parents here.

* Humans imperfect.  
* Masks lockdowns work perfect idealized scenarios.  
* mandates shift contact points multiples spread out, one single channel grocery stores, making lockdown truly pointless. 

These simple reasons obvious contradiction, even begin *discussion* obviousness this, seemingly impossible. really want look things accurately, per capita death rate Florida course pandemic 22% higher Minnesota, 3750%. Fair enough. estimate based thought eligible vaccinated, thought would serious risk. CDC already said vaccinated people don’t quarantine, vaccinated people get together without precautions. maintain covid safety measures public unvaccinated people rate transmission vaccinated people still unknown.

What want? Saying vaccine means take mask public? I’m seeing point you’re trying make without specific. 


Summarized Yale study:

The FDA approves drugs faster counterpart agency Europe does. majority pivotal trials drug approvals involved patients lasted 6 months less.

71/222 drugs approved 2000-2010 withdrawn, required ""black box"" warning side effects warranted safety announcement new risks. 


Can process streamlined certain elements review verification done tandem ongoing trials? course. FDA dragging feet problem. We're well realm vaccines, sure. know we're well overall.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* CNBC:  company said vaccine prevented 100% hospitalizations deaths. 

Guardian: though vaccine 85% effective overall stopping severe cases disease, federal regulator said. 

These figures widely circulated sources.

Can someone explain gap 100% hospitalizations prevented yet 85% severe cases? What's considered severe case?

Sorry answered before. That’s problem, society’s whole. really? We're much maybe Mondays always lower back mid 3k end week. We've hovering near past weeks. Let’s turn bee Chatty Cathy get word Wow. Total game changer. might thing finally covid in. There’s big difference “endorsed” “approved”.  short-term trend, long-term trend. worry much know validity, someone said addition J&amp;J, promising huge number 3/31, US surplus vaccines summer. Let's hope. That's start getting every country around world. waiting strong scientific consensus major development global pandemic killed millions?

Do even listen yourself? Indeed. theres also significant research coming suggesting second dose adds little value (atleast short term).

But according Biden Christmas ""may"" normal.

what joke lol. pandemic developed world months away media, politicians, doctors want extract every last bit it. saw like 65%, really overwhelming ?  realize real way eradicate flu would close schools colleges mandate distancing capacity restrictions every flu season? Masks alone won’t shit seems may real-world data time too. Cases (in US) fallen 77% last six weeks dead winter. think everyone decided mask go work last six weeks. Perhaps, vaccines larger effect previously thought....if cutting infections surely must matter bit. seems like drop coincided infection numbers. 65 million least one dose. still normal summer? buyback bandaid sewing surgery needed.

Okay, even get surgery still often put bandages afterwards yeah?

There’s single poster trying claim buybacks *all* need they’re going magically fix entire problem themselves. still tool toolbox helps some, importantly they’re exceptionally easy implement tool start using quickly working implement in-depth measures.

You don’t solve systemic problems silver bullet policies magically cure issue own. solve using variety approaches different angles together issue resolved. optimistic prediction anti-vax population crater employers make COVID vaccine prerequisite job. mean it’s white people  Oxford one showed sign Anaphylaxis believe. good options people allergies. think they’re avoiding “vaccination means normal” message doesn’t create situation vaccinated live differently haven’t many people haven’t vaccinated yet. puts one group time one group isn’t allowed vaccinated yet. 

However, becomes available everyone, think switch message encourage people get shot. get it. Looks promising, I'm bit tired living nagging sense dread... Fingers crossed! thought knew already... Like almost year ago. Oh HELL YEAH Yup beginning pandemic friends lost jobs sat around home smoking weed got 400 extra dollars week. Meanwhile made minimum wage store worked precautions place like 3 months pandemic. got hazard pay (1 extra dollar per hour) like 3 months started ""taking seriously"" took away again. training actual hours extra work new sanitizing procedures. allowed turn away customers following safety guidelines. Wow, looks like Chicago area good place teacher, though tell teachers teaching 20 years. 

Here info school district grew **Clarifications Rantings**

The virus serious business. kills people. makes people sick long time. people lose sense smell/taste. people get sick all, *no idea* why. Yes, I'm ignoring age distribution stuff here, know people every age *can* get really sick. really want loss smell taste happen me. That's keeps motivated mask distance. think ignore danger virus, *at all*. 

Just decided distance follow rules, mean get make decision people too. Respect choices, even they're *terrible* choices. *so ignorant, purpose,* spite there's nothing it. people chosen stop distancing they're vaccinated, that's fine, long respect people's choices. extends wearing mask. usually wear mask outdoors around people (in part) want respect choice extra careful.

[The virus made idea conspiracy theory garbage, know it. Even made lab, what? cares? you? humanity, ability fight virus, people who've lost loved one? Nothing spread hate. Give up. 

If think ""defending"" China, beyond help.

About - I'm ""anti-lockdown"" ""pro-lockdown"". US, think we've ""lockdown"", we've restrictions, minimal ones that. lockdown like NZ China, think we'd better place (fewer deaths). hand I'm *totally* convinced effective people think. encourage people ""follow rules"" guidelines whatever. Masking easy, yeah, suck, anymore. I'm ""pro-mask"" point. seem work, myriad reasons. Double masking dumb, idea comes good intentions. Experts trying hardest, heck, [trying every crazy idea protect people deadly virus. really difficult you, I'm sorry. Politics making decisions based science. one aspect science.

Sure, early-years education open probably bump 'R' number bit. epidemiologist would probably say it.

But clear-cut that, also balanced developmental mental health needs five-year-old child. 

And yes, also economic impact schools closed. dirty word. People keep food table. even allowed make one? company consistently murdering people products.  don’t chose. experience, Sites either Moderna Pfizer sites. don’t sitting back. 

Personally I’ve noticed pharmacies Moderna hospitals Pfizer that’s experience. Maybe one day chose, anytime June probably. past two days 7 day average Covid cases US increasing. Thoughts something concerned about? bet catch far fewer half cases children. Let's say adult brings home, gets sick, tests positive, everyone else family gets sickness (same symptoms). going bother packing entire sick family car get little kids swabbed already know anyways? 

Couple kids mostly getting mild symptoms, I'd suspect we're catching tiny fraction kids actually it. absurd expect people avoid driving completely take far restrictive measures tiny risk 

That's fine (and understandable).. nobody expecting anyone Covid either. (There's recommendation ""hide closet blanket head, cowering shaky fear!""). That's thing anyone advising. Anywhere. 

It's certainly possible go side ""live life"" (unless people think ""live life"" means ""do irresponsible thing like!"".. No. .you that). ""Some people ride motorcycles, drive Top Fuel dragsters, take risks others, that's them.""

Except part,. choices ""pandemic-effect"" kill people (not way infectious respiratory disease does). decide wrap Ferrari around telephone pole going 200mph... great,. that's you. unknowingly Corona-infection go movie theater start coughing.. could infect dozens people. That's entirely different situation. ""Society whole moves forward, like we're moving towards now.""

Haphazardly poorly stumbling. (don't get wrong.. love humanity think pretty awesome things.. way people handling Covid19 one shameful failures think I've ever seen). widespread lack empathy concern wellbeing people (especially low-bar simple things like ""wearing mask"".. reprehensible). angers people talk reopening schools. make children think it’s fault can’t go school well-being education worthless adults. Complete lack empathy. Like bother you?

DeSantis put gun face scientist exposed state Florida downplaying COVID numbers, still crap. important get veterinarians vaccinated pets get normal medical care  acknowledged outset *there public policy equal access health care US.* There's civil right to, ideological consensus about, ""equal enjoyment"" medical necessities. even prenatal care, much less flu shot, paid sick days contagious workers.

The idea COVID shots suddenly exception deep-rooted ""inequality enjoyments"" standing rule arena quite something see here. astonishing thing disregarded circumvented cases, black markets inevitable feature supply constraint. COVID egalitarianism ended social consensus, inequalities reported outrageous, so-called ""violations"" few.

In instance, seems thousand person-weeks vaccination misdirect--out hundreds millions. minuscule level abuse; fraction ongoing incidence insurance Medicare fraud.

Yes understand outrage, need convinced principle; anything, I'm far left opinions health care access. Nevertheless, think context, COVID care established completely new concept health care equality US: one sees equal access health care net social benefit common wealth. there, short step establishing civil right US, developed world. actual report, CIDRAP:

* game changer. Can’t wait America run back normal I'm reading right, single shot J&amp;J 66% effective ,while shot #1 Pfizer I've read 85% (on way 95% shot #2) effective.

Why would anyone want this? mean, think Americans trend towards Asian style mask wearing, could go indefinitely. Wearing mask sick smart thing do, think pandemic normalize two things, work home, mask wearing needed. Fuck mirriam Webster shit. gonna believe that? me, random internet guy?

:) page 15, describes symptoms categorization. Teachers Union  stop telling everyone DEVIL ALARMS RAISED

It beats people point apathy whole fucking thing including vaccines. generates ""why bother"" attitude. well hit 150 minimum everyone scared come... don’t know sure. told yesterday would tell soon eligible otherwise vaccinated state parents completed second dose honestly relief overwhelming. knowing won’t die gasping alone icu tears. I’m frustrated hard get appointments eligible relatives across multiple states.  It’s nightmare despite best efforts.  3 scheduled 1dosed 30 trying. That’s happens live society. United States sitting 65,000,000 vaccines. January 24th, one month ago, 21,848,655 given. why? Wrong again, mainly trade union.

The US collection states united. 

The EU collection sovereign countries decided want work together. EU executive power territory.

Do also call NATO state? people say flu exist anymore every sickness covid government sham shit. realistically, hospital, covid test also test influenza hear low overall province like less 10 cases showing efficient mesures actually were. position essential worker expendable. could employ monkeys, slaves, robots, would heartbeat. employee limited needs unquestionable obedience perfect employers. people ask fair rules established enforced. 

Florida made vaccination resident servicing world turned unpopular across political parties. 

I glad restrictions since supply determined population, many interlopers service. 

I feel sorry people live states politicians unwilling put people communities first. Yes measures aren’t onerous though ventilation old builders might
be costly. 3 vaccines approved year brand new virus found. Science awesome. Stonks 📈📈📈 Pre-pandemic, waiters mid high end restaurants vastly outearned minimum wage workers. point ridiculous chose tip. Nope. Initially, first introduction Jan 20, 2020 according US CDC study December 2020 showing 1.1% samples blood donation bank stemmed early December 13, 2019 (they look earlier).

*The scientists indicated it’s unlikely antibodies developed curb coronaviruses, 84 samples found neutralizing activity specific SARS-CoV-2.* again, ask countries investigate introductions year later, China held different standard... why? Widely attributed Churchill never said it. satire? got second dose yesterday well, arm pretty sore woke feeling sick. Nothing miserable, though. glad left retail.

Hour long mandatory non-paid break.

Low wage yet massive work expected.

No real paths promotion training.

Workers fighting scraps.

Horrir shift hours.

Hours cut yet expected work 5 days still.

And ect. question people vaccinated also suffer long covid develop mild symptoms. Rifle club thing school. bit difficult account essentially full grown around 12, stabilizing sling didn’t fit all, remember it.  AstraZeneca business wants make money. act accordingly. people pre-existing conditions cause lowered oxygen saturation’s, COPD emphysema. people live chronic state hypoxia, usually around 86-93% O2. O2 saturation alone reason hospitalize patient. factors come play well. Given current production forecasts less 10% country get J&amp;J vaccine. hardly going move needle. Might speed herd immunity week two. worth it. No, say that. said possibility. large chunk refuses vaccinations virus escape mutation. South African variant dangerous step closer able avoid vaccines, cluster known cases variant Southeast US already.

If said masks needed Christmas something happened, he'd crucified public opinion. Saying longer able push deadline ideal.

Also, next concern next flu season, may see mask wearing next winter, maybe due covid. Lack circulation flu could cause worse season next year, that's nearly hard combat covid, though flu vaccine uptake good could US. nah EU fucked EU mean entire Reddit account seems anti regulations rules. Hilariously enough founding fathers used use quarantine measures people forget history. Alright. stop pretending care welfare children. worried source transmission adults, seems interest balacing children's developmental, educational, social needs protecting adults them. Children seen ""source disease"" nothing else. disgusting enough.  read headlines never actual comparative data you’d think US 10x death rate every country that’s true year social isolation getting think opposite, data actually better looks. According [official vaccine's efficacy gradually increased time. severe cases reported 49 days vaccination. me, hopefully suggests protection severe covid eventually becomes 100%. hope data gets released eventually know sure. possibility “you could dead couple weeks” always exists minute risks accept every day life.

Sure, vast majority mundane things we've come deal are:

* stuff decades (or 100's years) experience information (take ""wearing seatbelts"" example. that's established thing. ""new mutations"") 

* stuff people take sensible precautions around. (again.. things like ""wearing seatbelt"" pretty common understood thing. reason people simple understand benefits easy see. pandemic viruses complex difficult understand constantly mutating. ""We deal them, don’t hide bed them, either. ""

Nobody asking expecting anyone ""hide bed"". ""Covid is, be, different.""

Covid killed half million people already. think we're well past ""it's different"" threshold. (not mention fact know mutations, etc pan big picture. 

92 worlds poorest countries vaccinated 1 2% populations. also likely places mutations frequent prevalent. doesnt take much mutations hop plane 1st world. 

This yet. celebrate Half Time there's still lot game play out. There’s much incentive allow clients skip line. One Medical chose give shots, health care provider would One Medical would lose clientele.

It’s short term PR hit months nobody’s gonna care. I'm dead last line healthy young person already covid, choice think I'd prefer J&amp;J vaccine won't, think Brits sociopaths?

What wrong sub man. cesspool. used play hell terrible game summarise:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Authoritarian governments bad
2. submit authority 
3. Authoritarian governments bad That's inspire confidence vaccine people already freaking using fact ""fast tracked"" excuse trust it.  Let's quick math estimate many people vaccinated unofficial start summer US (Memorial Day), official start summer. Let's use people vaccinated least 1 dose shot, 2 weeks date metric, since takes couple weeks immunity start building.


Bad weather across country disrupted vaccination bounce back - probably even accelerate supply increases, let's say get back averaging 1.7M doses per day. let's assume 60% shots going forward first shots (taking account J&amp;J shots first shots since 1-dose shot). Right 44.5M people (13.5% population) 1 shot.


By Memorial Day, increase 129M people protected, 39% country.


By official start summer, increase 50M people protected, 45% country.


Now consider everybody 60 people serious health conditions vaccinated. consider probably 35% country level immunity covid already, majority people level immunity, putting serious brakes much spread. covid clearly spreads less readily summer winter. rate vaccination probably increases, conservative estimates.


Covid going GONE summer. going massively reduced big threat is. Summer 100% ""normal"" going hell lot normal things winter. well 50% effective flu vaccine stopping transmission? well seeing millions infected tens thousands die every year.

Plus keep mind new strains appearing make vaccines less effective. want start highest efficacy possible even reduced new strains still good enough. I've gotta admit I'm profoundly confused Sweden. seems used people around argue point, extent given time they're model needing lockdown, failed non-lockdowns, ability isolate seniors life continues, people's ability take precautions need without government telling them, sacrificing grandma economy... That's one example. Similar problems people trying drum fears another surge cases actually going - well-meaning (trying prevent thing they're predicting, sense), harming public trust exaggerating. also telling people ""even vaccine transmit virus."" Maybe well-meaning, let's extra cautious etc. going lead people jaded possibly even doubting whether vaccine worth it. Telling people scared actually leads shutting realize need scared. non-pandemic situation time world produce distribute mRNA vaccines would make sense. right shortage “existing standard care” additional vaccines approved long meet minimum efficacy requirements. It’s saving lives, perfection"
