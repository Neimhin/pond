0,2021-07-31,"  Imagine thinking idiots like Marjorie Greene special qualifications. literally vote yes bills. That's suppress voting (taps forehead) gerrymander (nods) time, belief unvaccinated problem. Hmm, sure 

-	there's fewer breakthrough cases = fewer incubators, quite lot
-	afaik mutations random thing, infected, dangerous mutation equally probable vaccinated vs unvaccinated people, assuming equal viral loads (probably untrue assumption, vaccinated people lower load scholar saying)
-	once dangerous mutation occurs still needs spread community large effect 
-	I think right mutations vaccinated person would become dominant, since easily beat vanilla virus, mutation occurs think vaccinated person *more likely* spread unvaccinated person competes vanilla virus. know whether increased transmissibility outweighs lower probability mutation occurring first place 

Just laying thoughts, really trying convince you. Surely it'd become dominant vaccinated people easily, makes perfect sense me, unclear balances odds mutation scale. Curious think!  Anti-choice stance power women.   im fucking sorry immune system rock medication need kinda live. ill get soon stop depending it. im fucking sorry Amen! vaccines work, problem vaccinated. mean, isn't, large margin. Time blame people take vaccine.  vaccine that. wonder many actual deaths vaccinated people.  üëç hear that. I've snapped least two people walking elevators recent weeks exposed noses asking honestly long take learn? Nose, mouth chin. FFS, daily practice long now. would appreciate link article. source specific kids? believe majority kids underlying conditions. microchipped several dogs cats. confirm needle much much different way bigger used vaccine. Brain fog too. Yeah see want talk geography, neat bud. Midwest, north. Whatever man don‚Äôt argue semantics. Chicago Midwest. Cool!

I‚Äôm tired redditors can‚Äôt make point deciding hone single point rather spirit argument. Open non vaccinated ‚Äúhospitals‚Äù i.e. tents parking lot. 

Let vaxxed people access hospital usual. Let others suffer die parking lot. start IVs cars. Complete distortion.
100,000 cases.

You thought new cases per day, right? That‚Äôs MSM wants think don‚Äôt say entire week.

Why wouldn‚Äôt say that? lie deniability. course, antivax face new winter season. even bother? saying risk every citizen ensure current party stays Power? live mountains Colorado, even dead winter found ways socialize friends kids friends. friends sledding, picnic, hot cocoa deck. several 5-6 hour hangouts like this. wore snowsuits enjoyed warmth sun infested 2 outdoor heaters gas fire table make even better easier winter. 

I think underestimate creativity parents lengths going keep normality kids. kids aren‚Äôt suffering. like virtual school better brick mortar schools attended, likely continue pandemic. virtual school offers field trips social opportunities meet classmates area. 

You‚Äôre concern trolling. Move along, please. simple logic. bad. vaccines development decade. use 18 gauge needle got vaccine???  microchips flowed right large bore needle got 2 injections. ( think 2nd dose microchips per ml stuff thick.)

LOL -- kidding one thinking I'm serious. get microchipped.  AIDS less problem, medication suppresses HIV, live old.

Soaking HIV, Moderna apparently testing mRNA vaccine it.  Well data show vaccinated people fewer infections unvaccinated, expected.

The vaccine never 100% effective prevention method, delta otherwise. delta, still hospitalizations immunocompromised people. vaccine works well body's immune response.

In words, infections vaccinated nothing new. We're seeing now. mean, Tokyo posts data daily? Sounds like kids risk you‚Äôre psycho loony nut job somebody call child protective services seem assuming second infection would mild milder first infection. That‚Äôs entirely possible, maybe likely, it‚Äôs given, especially considering advent harmful variants. saying. think effectiveness current vaccines reducing severity symptoms doubt, least moment. great fantastic thing, excellent reason everyone get vaccinated without delay. Reducing number sick dead obviously important goal.

The thing that's changed last weeks, think, think effect vaccines case rates. scary thing Florida doesn‚Äôt low vaccination rate, middle pack US 49% population. Hot take...avoid dewormers unless worms think anyone claiming does. 

I find misleading.  can't reason someone something reasoned first place.‚Äù - Mark Twain maybe Jonathan Swift

You seem speaking authors submissions top comments. angry year certain people can‚Äôt grasp basics: wash hands, wear mask, distance, get vaccinated‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs hard. basic things children know. 

Yet people go way stupid ignorant prolong nightmare Think analytical statistical point view parent. 35 kids entire state Florida hospitalized. 35 kids 4 million kids living state. isn‚Äôt erring side caution, it‚Äôs badly misjudging actual amount risk COVID presents healthy young child. understand herd immunity means. didn‚Äôt understand every virus different terms achieving herd immunity. Especially rely information ‚Äúcredible‚Äù sources. ‚Äúcredible‚Äù sources change definition herd immunity specific virus. Unvaccinated people opening possibility more, deadlier variants eventually possible vaccine-resistant strain pop up. Organisms adapt. viruses bacteria succeed. send kid psychologist. (and been, guess what? He‚Äôs better.) can‚Äôt bring back dead. Anybody left South Dakota besides nutcase Gov?  people don‚Äôt understand statistics many others choose ignore sorry everything family going (and selfish note ears hate too!! heck?!?).

Honestly I've finding enjoyment cooking different things meals/snacks (though I'm Kraft's blue box special) working Dungeons Dragons thing friends Discord. Nerdy socially distant!

If can, start something small small bursts. hope helps little, please take care best can.  I'm little confused intrigued. ELI5 delta numbers go soon? expecting stay bad winter. fully vaccinated, adhere covid restrictions (if cops around) stupid antivaxxers attitude   California‚Äôs state worker mandate doesn‚Äôt mention that. It‚Äôs get tested get vaccine. DeSantis wants see kids faces. mask mandates schools.


I know he's creeping around kids schools though live US. fiancee son live Philippines. vaccinated. Philippines struggling vaccine supply US one countries list they'll let foreigners enter from, US handle covid. 

We seen person almost 2 years. Thankful technology like video calling everything, I'd really like go family finally get married begin life together.

People refusing vaccine part what's making take longer, ""angry"" adequate word describe feel. going make edit?

I think wording misleading. vaccine inject people contain horseshoe crab blood. restaurants bars employ lot people. Particularly chefs young people however point fucking love going restaurants, bars live music shows want society forgo things permanently. I‚Äôm also vaccinated going Europe soon. Mostly, I‚Äôll museums, cafes, outdoor sight seeing. Im planning masking everywhere go, think expected anyway. basic courtesy precautions, plan think much possible enjoy trip! I‚Äôm confident avoid severe illness vaccine ready go. hard teach old dog new tricks. Condition young trained life. Whoosh goes point. apparently able fuck anything ;) Okay, didn‚Äôt know meant back still don‚Äôt. That‚Äôs fine, don‚Äôt act like it‚Äôs somebody else‚Äôs fault. 2 flatmates get vaccinated. One says gotten around it, that's laziness. one, teacher, thinks vaccine insert virus DNA eggs render infertile, that's fucking idiot. Tell health care workers that. could use break. pay peanuts, get monkeys. least monkey virus vector. right! Yeah, has. That's called heterogeneous prime-boost. Recently shown BNT+AZ better two BNT (Pfizer) Good point! downvoted well Hannah Reid, 30. F.D.A. approves vaccines, said husband feel somewhat less apprehensive continue _do research pray_

Aaaaaaaagh! Exactly ""research"" plan do? gym close put measures back I'm going activity look antivaxxers slap face. Delta variance work India. CNN report one correspondents overwhelmed hospital May. emotional. cry time watch it. awaits us.

cnn.com/videos/world/2021/05/03/overwhelmed-hospital-india-coronavirus-ward-lead-dnt-vpx.cnn Looks like $23.15 per dose Pfizer $25.50 per dose Moderna. prices paid via supply contracts, price end users.

For decent point reference, CDC pays vaccinations. typical change DNA crap. also tried vaccine causes autism bull. binary ""immune"" ""not immune."" vaccine simply gives body tools fight disease without actually fight disease. disease arrives body, vaccinated immune system already knows deal it, begin fighting immediately. large viral load, still result symptomatic infection spread others, virus still replicating. difference extent symptoms; unvaccinated person receives similar viral load, immune system fight disease, also spend time figuring fight building resources so. mean time,the virus take much greater hold body result far greater symptoms much higher viral load spread others.

It's like army storm castle nowhere vs army storming castle received intel going attack. case received prior warning, stockpiled right ammunition practice run. castle still gets stormed, might still sustain damage, lesser extent case stormed nowhere. still live with, HIV pandemic stayed since 1980. flu season apparently 1918 pandemic.  change tone ventilator breathing them. never understood people mad needed job...like yeah, happy. POC Republicans really letting us down.  really option me. called life. ""Now, says even fully vaccinated people sometimes catch virus catch Delta variant, likely infect someone else unvaccinated person would be.""

Is true? CDC really say that? downvotes? right.  clubs festivals. chin masker chronic sinusitis literally can't breathe well lightest masks. Also, vaccined. Can't care less stares nowadays

I chin masker chronic sinusitis literally can't breathe well lightest masks. Also, vaccined. Can't care less stares nowadays ingredient, all. also true 100% people got vaccinated could beat covid

I idea bringing up, I'm arguing it. think everyone get vaccinated, course, information apparently coming scene suggesting might effect expect would, Delta variant least partially escaped current vaccines. course needs followed urgently probably be. 

Numbers heard Delta variant suggest 90 95% population needs vaccinated get R_0 less one. far know, country jurisdiction anywhere close this, speculation and/or article faith might happen ever do. Right now, 12% world population vaccinated, 1% Africa vaccinated. obviously going several many years achieve extremely high levels vaccination across world, new variants continue pop up. (Vaccinating isolated countries going helpful course saw last year virus initially confined inland China infected entire world months.) course, coronavirus vaccines fade time.

What's point? I'm sure, seem idea would immediately completely vaccinate entire world strategy getting rid covid going play hoped, ongoing emergence new variants likely make situation difficult. need allow religious medical exemptions, many times, abused, based number times ‚Äúhow get giving kid X vaccine (TDaP, MMR, etc)‚Äù comes homeschool groups.

I two friends cannot get vaccinated legit health reasons constantly express frustration they‚Äôre basically locked there‚Äôs vax that‚Äôs safe them.  Many countries using 12 week interval. longer interval give better end result (and limited trials they've done confirmed this). Drawing conclusions Bear Week P-town like trying draw conclusions Spring Break Daytona Beach.

People clubbing, drinking, partying like crazy whole week.

Insanely higher risk profile average random sample.   #1 none links provided prove long haul common break infections

#2 people lie internet regularly thought guy President one want anywhere near close having. Man, comments. Thanks kicking us we're down, fuckers. they're offering 3rd doses

Only 60, mind you, everyone. I‚Äôm dumb someone confirm something me‚Ä¶ whole like 99.5% deaths unvaccinated‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt include deaths pre-vaccinated times right?

When report like 358 new deaths 7 day average mean 99.5% 358 deaths unvaccinated right? someone confirm dumb brain? It‚Äôs certainly interesting. Can‚Äôt really make sense it‚Äôs fun watch. mean ya you‚Äôre open average deaths. I‚Äôm Canada can‚Äôt speak guys. Maybe overly locked down. Feels way guess that‚Äôs we‚Äôve 26k deaths. governors care political points ppls lives üò≠ actual evidence this? It‚Äôs both. vaccines show drop antibodies time. doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre less effective. Immunology nuanced Would nice know vaccination rate staff... exactly I'd afraid too. That's feel like better private organizations (like workplaces, restaurants, movie theaters etc) require proof vaccination. Let stupid people lose jobs ability go public places want remain unvaccinated. rest us want move on, time leave behind. Wow that's different Alaska's fat bear week data, work large health system uses Epic EHR reports patients COVID status including vaccination status. COVID positive, COVID recovered, COVID PUI (person investigation) well one shot two shots dates. 

Most patients (we seeing 250 day) showing either vaccinated ever took one shot WAY overdue second dose. 

Just throwing there. wonder many got one dose decided wouldn‚Äôt go second one may play here? I'm sure we'll make fall. case rate icu rate growing way faster we've experienced pandemic. Toxic masculinity rears ugly head. guy hate citizens deal exactly? they're lying say studies show decrease effectiveness vaccine 6 months? 

At point need take side. Either Pfizer honest data there's massive conspiracy sell vaccines. Federal Election Australia next year. suspicious part thinks Federal Government delaying vaccinations, new quarantine facilities, etc happen election something point since voters care happened recently. hospitals completely collapse people start dying streets Desantis nothing, Biden declare martial law Florida? know that's extremely worst case scenario, I'm genuinely curious. information likely ‚Äòlong COVID‚Äô lasting effects mild breakthrough infections? Perhaps they're difficulty finding someone ounce credibility string two words together. plenty people life. live south. degree world convince people. don‚Äôt trust science think masks vaccines governments attempts control us. reasoning them. recent surge literally making two surges look flattened curve. Lmao, okay bro. anecdotal experience observing neighborhood trumps polls showing Florida among lowest wanting covid restrictions, trumps fact Florida average vaccinations nationwide despite one oldest populations older people much higher vaccination rates, population adjusted vaccination rates Florida EVEN WORSE. doubt personal experience. I'm talking Florida general, compared rest country. absolutely doubt anyone functioning brain Floridians taking pandemic way less seriously places country. Curious question, can‚Äôt government step something governor‚Äôs mask law? school starting soon, doesn‚Äôt look good. saying ""Don't Fauci FL"" start saying ""Don't DeSantis USA"" Confirmed COVID cases US \~10% population. Confirmed cases Australia close tenth 1% population. significantly less normal annual flu.

The Delta variant got through, Australia's track record, likely fizzle almost immediately. quarantines work. Even infection occurs, easy isolate contain them. whole world following similar strategy beginning, would significantly less likely isolated breakouts happen first place, would fewer global cases begin with.

Full containment border virtually impossible, also unnecessary. Almost full containment stage enough enable full containment later stages. Anything win 2024 good thing delta surge it‚Äôs boosting immunity ahead could rough flu season hospitals won‚Äôt much capacity. That‚Äôs loads unvaccinated people getting immunity hard way wouldn‚Äôt seeing vaccine mandates otherwise. Companies afraid sued mandating vaccine isn‚Äôt fully approved, consequences right front faces. He's going run president sometime soon. prepared.  heck kind math that? There's like 7.674 billion humans.  Probably please hillbilly antivaxxers Lol perfect shield Delta strain.

Also important recognize people vaccinated certain way, mean certain variants die vaccine-resistant ones remain. world essentially failed controlling growth virus, uncountable evolutionary pressures around world continue mutate enough find new niches. 


Our hope lies in:

* seasonal global lull + increased immunity deprives virus opportunity replicate new strong variant
* fundamental limitation constitutes effective COVID-style illness vaccines develop cover possibilities
* new variant deadly scary everything shuts again, real time Conspiracy, no. think Pfizer interest sell much vaccine possible though We're going Left Behind. great! Pray God gets boot. ‚ÄúDue increased transmissibility Delta variant, officials preaching Americans -- regardless vaccination status -- mindful surroundings.

Aerosols containing Covid-19 travel easily smoke cigarette, Michael Osterholm, director Center Infectious Disease Research Policy University Minnesota, said Friday.

""If want understand aerosol is, think somebody smoking,"" Osterholm told CNN. ""If smell cigarette location at, breathing someone else's air may virus it."" Guilty charged. south Florida 3 weeks ago. Nobody wore masks, bars restaurants busy. surprised went Aventura mall saw lot people wearing masks. place saw people wearing besides airport. 21,000 Florida lol Huh could've sworn advertised PCR test. looked right, must mistaken understand that, also understand week extraordinary compared average July 4 experience. Fortunately vaccines work. Thank kind words‚Äî aunt said fully vaccinated ‚Äúa months ago‚Äù Moderna. know vague fuck, didn‚Äôt want pry much right now, aunt 80s also lost husband two months prior this. find certainly update! Some? 

#SOME vaccinated Americans? 

Probably bit understatement Agreed, don‚Äôt understand all. It‚Äôs rampant mindset parenting forums pro-vaccine families. don‚Äôt get act high mighty ‚ÄúI TrUSt SCiEnCE‚Äù comes masks, isolating, vaccinating also turn around feed fear-mongering kids dying droves incapacitated ‚Äúlong Covid.‚Äù Big Pendleton concert attracted obvious clientele (unvaccinated, young, partyers zero inhibition due alcohol). recipe major spread. Sad people die name country music festivals. eat raw elk meat work suppliments, perfectly fine\*

&amp;#x200B;

/s Yes Obviously type person gets fake certificate going smart enough cover tracks. massive conspiracy Pfizer Israel sell vaccine?

Sure, okay. Dude fucking thank you. got first time said it‚Äôs biggie it‚Äôs C word that‚Äôs censored apparently. early 2020. got cat got it. basically called crazy saying cat got it, myriad anecdotes saying same.

I‚Äôve treating COVID like pandemic. I‚Äôm staying away crowds. Enjoying nature. keeping mask. I‚Äôm vaccinated trust little questionable completely ethical company like Pfizer moderna ows Moncef board member of.

I don‚Äôt care good say is, I‚Äôm choosing common sense would screaming pandemic movie applying real life. universities bound too. 2 weeks, college students moving dorma campus teach cant ask mask, vaccinate, social distance. Students already saying dont want vaccine want wear mask. hate state.  chances dying stupidly low vaccinated. I'd say that's pretty big deal comes long term health.

It's also obvious current data like 93-99% hospital unvaccinated. That's pretty strong argument protecting long term health.

No, perfect, neither seatbelt. I, personally, always wear one those. That's great vaccinated! Especially cuz every two weeks seems way long time period transmissability Delta showing. Where's freedom muricans? Ironic Actually, 25% stronger ;-)

But 4% 20% weaker 5%. July 4th brings full bars every vacation hot spot across country. difference Ptown partners higher average vaccine rate, useful studying. Maybe press conference, anyone drive landscape company today? way, normal life reward get vaccine. reward isn‚Äôt handed us like hoped  Specifically. People live healthy lifestyles preventative care get check health insurance company. People don't.. don't. Unbelievable. person infected respiratory virus working around patients regardless precautions make. likelihood end infecting even people. assumed frequently tested since we‚Äôve know year asymptomatic spread thing America‚Ä¶.

And doctors hospitals wonder people avoiding hospitals routine exams?? executive order say schools can't take Scared Straight approach? Show really gruesome ICU videos kids dying tell little Timmy Susie there's box masks back room would like wear one. Fully vaxxed never stopped wearing mask. still going essentials hanging put groups masked not. Fuck. 

I go pharmacy see unmasked. Fuck. Sick people go pharmacy well people. wish car could go drive through. Fuck.

 putting going post office missed appointment DMV see far many unmasked every fucking time step outside. regular mail man NEVER worn mask. Fuck.

 many businesses went under. new restaurant opened near went pick take workers wearing masks guy putting order together even wearing fucking gloves. Fuck. walked called health department. Fuck. 

I comprimised immune system. mother 89 moving assisted living would like see dies. Fuck. Every business mandate this. wear mask get tested every two weeks expense indefinitely wish remain unvaccinated. Great... idiot.    Forbidding someone something: FREEDOM!!!!!! USA! USA!        Triage 101. saw Arizona back 2020. hospitals plans paper‚Ä¶of there‚Äôs massive emergency. It‚Äôs nightmare scenario. 

‚ÄúArizona‚Äôs state health director Monday declared hospitals could activate ""crisis care standards"" guide allocation scarce resources patients based factors likelihood survival.

The announcement Dr. Cara Christ, Arizona Department Health Services director, immediately met criticism advocates people disabilities say state's current Crisis Standards Care could result discriminatory denial life-saving health care COVID-19     Exactly, didn‚Äôt include qualifiers means made blanket statement. helpful? mandate vaccines test. vaccine free, opt helping crush world wide pandemic, get pay it.  Hospitalization numbers key. We'll find Labor Day back lockdown not.

Current data indicates fine, time tell point. cousin pulled kids out. fully vaccinated, doesn‚Äôt want risk delta variant. It‚Äôs bummer, also remote last year. Ahh yes, it‚Äôs ‚Äúthey‚Äù‚Äôs fault‚Ä¶ unvaccinated selfish public hope there‚Äôs press conference leaking rudy involved backyard... unless me. I'm US mine  Getting booster shot shown help people didn‚Äôt create immune response first set vaccines(immunocompromised, elderly folks). doesn‚Äôt show real benefit created sufficient immune response first set vaccinations. 

We‚Äôve seen third shot helping cancer patients who‚Äôve received organ transplants. they‚Äôre immune systems weaker require little extra umph create response. healthy immune systems third shot nothing increase sterilizing immunity short period time. understand desire lower odds getting infection getting booster right seems silly. Delta burn USA booster time kick offer much protection. makes much sense ride wave accepting risk mild disease wait updated boosters winter/spring. 

We‚Äôre gonna chasing covid next little falls seasonal/predictable pattern. though we‚Äôll able time boosters accordingly maximize efficacy lower overall infection. meantime I‚Äôd grateful protected severe disease live life. breakthrough cases overwhelming mild turning shorter duration. Politics COVID inextricably linked one side decided use tool polarize electorate fear misinformation, actually focused science preserving life. 

To ignore misguided harmful mainstream media giving equal consideration conspiracy theories science fear ‚Äúbalanced.‚Äù promoted vaccination instead downplaying win dumbass culture war.

We could 80%+ vaccination rates now. think long covid us really concerned dehabilitating, I-have-to-quit-my-job sort thing. know handful long covid cases personally Israeli study defines it, even one take months work (they seemed fully recover getting vaccine). subset long covid apparently minority, study UK came suggests risk sort thing probably less 1 100 infections, half vaccinated (correct reading wrong): Israeli study cite also quite small, long covid defined much generally (i.e. someone still can't smell five weeks would classify ""annoying"" rather ""life wrecking,"" unless perhaps chef something).

Finally, kind ruin-your-life long covid, would last year, effectively vegetable never work again, also probably even rarer &lt;1 100. ""Objectively bad"" vis vis 51% vaxx rate example. honey, Louisiana's objectively bad.

A 51% **single** dose rate awful. 43.9% fully vaccinated. Who's one engaging rhetorical fuckery?

Texas one earliest places *world* get access vaccines. What's next say Texas better. Clearly can.

Yeah, Texas does, &lt;50% fully vaccinated rate objectively done better average job based metric matters, amount dead compared national average.

Do actually think US done well? Like think slightly average construes Texas well?

Also, fact Texas facing new wave vaccines readily available objectively bad. certainly good job time shift, pretend certain states better excuse dead (which bullshit, state governments saw Italy China yolo'd), can't change numbers.

Hint: America country world.

Then again, even consider US only, Texas still bottom half? supposed good? Seriously, metric Texas objectively done well in? God, ever wish, even little, let people suffer awhile stew consequences? Oh ... uhm... sorry, im still taking it. Terribly sad true, I'm sure 99.99% correct though. read Israeli data questionable. media propaganda cause division among people. unvaccinated blamed everything next they'll putting concentration camps.  Confirmation bias, sub full ends spectrum.  problem unvaccinated *third world countries* go visit *tourists*?  Hey everyone, sorry dumb question. 

Do people get breakthrough infections build additional antibodies fight virus? 

Found data Israel suggesting protected Covid back 2020 vaccinated 2021 quite interesting. still build new/additional ""natural immunity"" antibodies infected first time post-vaccine though? Thanks working hospitals. family members friends quit severely cut back working hours hospital due uptick again.  Yeah, do. much reliable way verify showing vax card.  assholes always think healthy going stay healthy, forever. Smallest violin reality hits down. actions create world live in, something remember become vulnerable later life suddenly expect people act different acting past 40 years. dad got covid vaccines diagnosed today covid. symptoms mild antibodies. hope stay way. still scared shitless... Piss rope good one tho like that. That‚Äôs little much That's super unfortunate, never gave much thought childhood vaccines realized tons parents vaccinate, remember measles break pregnant obgyn told worry fully vaxxed...I emotional, called mom crying, thanking vaccinating lol submission linking huffpost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Many states (27 iirc) locations like big cities tracking them. I‚Äôm sure CDC access data.   Same. chance. deaths matter children immunocompromised rare may sue vaxxed. absolutely sympathy anti vaxxers pleading vaccine get intubated die wasting hospital resources.   That's true currently, also true last year Sturgis. lot people died there. 

Here's chart deaths per 100k state.  forehead symbolizes person believes (where faith is) right hand serve. like beasts horns symbolized nations rulers.  Everybody's badass they're told sit fuck down. exactly strange? people found lockdowns wild never seen constriction personal freedoms. certainly feel way shots.  seen bottom-lippers. Mask covering half bottom lip, chin. bother trying pretend? wear like wristlet like idiots‚Ä¶ Really though, aren‚Äôt using microchips? would harder forge, admin rollout National Vaccine Registry. could prevent unvaccinated people boarding aircraft countries, check everyone coming back international flight. could also add vaccines mandate, flu, West Nile, anything else that‚Äôs there. Seriously need embrace technology ever want move forward. wasn't, asked question. 

But true half antivaxx, doomed suffer Covid related bullshit forever. US is; fortunately nordics antivaxxers small minority. OK sure Moderna. Sooner doubt, Trump's team's distribution plan simply there. Biden turned around dime. highly understating level misinformation we've reached regards vaccines specifically, level delusion we're dealing actually unprecedented comparable elements modern society.

You can't really ""centrist"" situation, care color creed background have, ability get vaccine gotten (in United States), are, put plain simply, idiot, even register radar ""who care about"".

It's like asking step front speeding car person walked front purpose thinking survive it. tragic? Sure. feeling guilty getting smashed pieces car? No...my conscience perfectly clear. doesn‚Äôt even need government‚Äôs call - there‚Äôs reason insurance companies can‚Äôt jack premiums unvaccinated people. It‚Äôs even perfectly fair interpretation ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù. Based UK India waves, lot statisticians predicting 3-6 weeks spike peak, 2 weeks ago. downvotes 

Oh no, downvotes? Better delete comment cry people disagree me!! I‚Äôve seen cashiers pull customers on, put unmasked customers. think it‚Äôs polite thing do. Mother Nature: Send Coronavirus cleanse earth anti-vaxx unvaccinated lower life forms. mistaken: yes.

Do understand right take chances ends life? Also yes.

Nobody gave permission endanger anyone else one ever tell worthwhile human don‚Äôt right endanger others.

That‚Äôs mistake, that‚Äôs forfeiture right still get make choices regards everyone else.  depends masked distanced, etc. look data Providence RI festival had. cases helped change CDC masking policy.  not. replicate faster give people 1000x dose get Delta.

So get X amount antibodies vaccine, need 100x amount get sick. way numbers last waves, surprise they're nearing natural herd immunity. pandemic isn‚Äôt ‚Äúending‚Äù. Covid stay. Disingenuous. 


There's science good reason keep wearing mask. shit According CDC, Covid-19 99.5% survival rate. Yet pushed vaccine. Yes, got vaccinated also. NIH saying vaccinated need mask-up even home due variant. sound like vaccine effective variant. know answer rather safe sorry. look forward new variants virus killing people. Less Trump votes. It‚Äôs absolutely bizarre hence conservatives arms it. I'm U.S used live U.S, currently Asia mass outbreak everywhere include city. got vaccinated Saturday 1st dose Moderna, mass roll public vaccine area. gather peoples live area one spot vaccine, everyone mandatory wear mask, found one positive infect quick PCR test, away old gentleman 2 meters, worried get chance infect walk passed since everyone wear mask, I'm bit worried get 1st dose Moderna since need 2 weeks develop anti bodies. think lot people jumping getting vaccine actually scared needles embarrassed say so....  happened big government? Rudy Ghouliani disassembles pile writhing worms, slithers soil 200 year slumber value limiting hosts virus use mutate. getting unvaxxed sick means less likely vaxed fight virus evolved forms.

As pissed am, mass extermination idiots really appeal me. Therefore protecting idiots wearing mask best option.   Enjoy downvotes , try get outside bit means keep going, smart guy. I'm vaxxed, childless, guaranteed job go back lockdown. go piss rope care. Mutations always vaccinating doesn‚Äôt mean stop spread virus. :hope vaccine enough

It is. Plain simple. religious man either, prayed first time years to... Something, anything... August 2020 beginning school year get with... pandemic, political stride, climate emergency praying first time years. overwhelming. controlling COVID.  Wtf say take them. many waiting see stuff played while. one got first dose last week. Based what? polling showing winning general even better Trump did? Same!

I worked every day last year, ‚Äúcritical infrastructure‚Äù industry, exception whatever vacation days took off. 

We get consideration get vaccine early. 

We vague best information instructions COVID-19, protect office. sort made things went. 

We got zero hazard pay. 

Now, don‚Äôt get wrong, I‚Äôm blessed talent abilities good career profession. you‚Äôre going make come public facing office everyday, make fuck sure protected don‚Äôt give admin staff hid home months fucking shot.  Agreed first part there. country almost completely open point many months. always assume people get much surprised events happening. Stadiums FULL sports concerts since May (and before). fly Mexico walk US. Simple solution  Still low risk overall. kids going fine, despite stupidity others state. first I've heard anything speculation long covid vaccines.

This great news! fuck anti parasitic dog medicine going virus? Surely youve noticed We‚Äôre 70% Ontario. They‚Äôre asking 80-90% Many employers two-tier system smokers pay premium. Yeah, it‚Äôs still doctor‚Äôs note valid HR department. 

We go customer sites we‚Äôre already getting ‚Äúdon‚Äôt send him, send vaccinated guy‚Äù requests. It‚Äôs handling city, it‚Äôs basically sure misleading.

The 75 reported cases include asymptomatic cases, every country world counts cases reported cases. correct? 

Also wondering (if happen know) reporting asymptomatic cases later become symptomatic, exactly symptoms reclassification. wanting pretty good reason. body, choice. Whatever say: WINTER COMING !  let's take government equation.

The doctors tired AF deal pandemic , take shot them?

The delta variant proven transmissible, wait till thing becomes even worse? take shot prevent ?

I, vaccinated *individual* can't fix myself, need other's fight virus, need need finally end pandemic.

You're right, *individual* desision getting vaccine affect life, cumulative mindset ""I'm muy getting vaxed"" gang indeed affect ones taken vaccine.

Your desision get vaxed neither fix government end pandemic.

By taking shot actually help get pandemic come end.  think bizarre worldview believe government force us jobs ban us seeing families months, can't mandate us get shot might give us sore arm, headache, fever day.

Because one involves forcing something somebody's body will, others not. 

Do really want top image Wikipedia article pandemic two armed police officers holding black man doctor injects him?  That‚Äôs assuming level exposure. misleading.

*At point delta, vaccine not, aren‚Äôt wearing mask, become infected.* Especially places like Florida. That‚Äôs CDC‚Äôs entire point.

So vaccinated people spread virus. matter quickly get infected. get infected.

Your best bet avoid antimaskers assume everyone unvaccinated.

Only masked vaccinated people might get it. Everyone else will. That‚Äôs reality situation point. certainly hoped 4 people infected give welcome back party, though arguably vaccinated, blame themselves. she‚Äôs furious eligible get vaccinated refuse, citing misinformation desire make political statement. Graves, lives New York City, said she‚Äôs understanding worry vaccines rushed market people color whose communities historically mistreated medical professionals. Graves said worries getting long-term symptoms contracts rare breakthrough infection covid-19.

Some progress *Washington Post* acknowledging (somewhat parenthetically) Bubba vaccine hesitant, also ""people color""; blacks Hispanics actually lowest vaccine uptake race.

I think conventional wisdom breakthrough infections ""rare"" needs updated, though. Studies cited week CDC suggests breakthrough infections quite common fact may happening similar rates among vaccinated unvaccinated. hit still kill regardless protections, didn‚Äôt drive drunk still protections, we‚Äôre likely walk away safely? 

Comparisons situations illogical. It‚Äôs false equivalence logical fallacy.  seen covid postive subreddit? It‚Äôs full double vaxxed testing positive now, seems like it‚Äôs happening last two weeks especially day. delta getting everyone. Thanks I'll let there's posibility I'll cancel reevaluate maybe like October. hear you, go die? plague houses again? People carts every night calling ""Bring dead""? saw entire medical history bloodwork hospital saw? family members still anti-mask/anti-vaccinations.

They claim God decide fate protect them. ""Religious exemption"" funny can't fucking cite Bible actually says stay away vaccines medicines.

I've lost patience called stupid. said insensitive. say insensitive say everyone that's fucking died virus result co-morbidities going die anyway.

Yeah, point I'm ok even family consequences actions. sheer selfishness bothers claim moral superiority.  US awful science medical reporting send golf reporter report science.  unlike seatbelt , difference two words situation seems lack data self destruction normal. They're trying drag everyone they're spiraling down. Raise memorable toast them, Zoom . . . high rate breakthrough cases among vaccinated spread virus much non-vaxxed people. hard people comprehend mask isn‚Äôt others well. course not, becoming increasingly larger possibility. long risk afford keep taking? Triggered... lol. Quite opposite. thinking I‚Äôm triggered gets day, it.

But lets honest, can‚Äôt argue position resort comments like one above. It‚Äôs cool. get it. Explain - someone unvaccinated become use case virus mutate?

Wouldn‚Äôt virus choose mutate faced sort resistance like vaccine?

The s-protein covid already mega absorbed body except vaccinated individuals, doesn‚Äôt conclude vaccinated ones driving variants? end chance. silver lining everyone get Trump treatment. Funny stem cell research need it. Cowards Well didn‚Äôt say god. Maybe they‚Äôre praying Zeus. Except places don‚Äôt require proof vaccination. you‚Äôre scared unvaxxed, you‚Äôre free make choice stay home well. Canada fairly high uptake 60+. 93% people 60+ gotten vaccinated. Ok, yes I'll admit point transmission whether fully vaccinated less likely become infected. think timeline. alpha dominant, vaccines much effective preventing infection delta. heard much ""the vaccinated shed much virus, even infected"" alpha dominant. though... big outbreaks among vaccinated, even though less likely get incredibly sick etc etc. continously evolving situation information murky sure. different blatantly spreading false misleading information. Information proven false, reasons sky news banned. 

Sky news came YouTube feed constantly unknown (to me) reasons. never watched videos remember reading headlines knowing immediately pushing false narrative.  expect? It‚Äôs Florida go back normal everyone vaccinated. insanely disturbing people willfully declining life vest burdening rest us help keep sinking.

There's really simple solution whole debacle. Get vaccine. know phrase ‚Äúlong term effects‚Äù means? Almost medical professionals agree covid comes high risk damage expose one‚Äôs life time. right now, long term. That's test, tell action. u want reality see Israel. spread virus masked. car analogies don‚Äôt make sense you‚Äôre reaching. ‚ÄòRona, says ‚Äúhold muh beer.‚Äù Thanks social media internet, though, impossible overindulge. I'm starting learn crotchety, irritable older people always like that, years seeing world operates probably them.

Eventually, learn let anger you. Sad trombone sound. they're safely clear again. 

After they've recovered? Suddenly little flu, people overreacting. It‚Äôs government‚Äôs job force protect others. Quit trying use 3% mortality rate justify authoritarianism. time. given shit anyone else, outside friends family, year now. Maybe govt change strategy tell unvaccinated huge Covid party herd immunity . whoever know dies‚Ä¶ well, dies‚Ä¶. say right way... Learn understand virus mutation even basic level get back me, darling never even got attend graduation ceremony. 4 years life thousands dollars get degree mail... Imagine triggered piece cloth. mask, guy. ain't serious. 

But seeing comment, surprise care others could affect. Especially vaccinated still catching covid :) thought experiment. couldn‚Äôt vaccine escape, continue track lineages plan changes upcoming vaccines?

The goal *avoid* vaccine escape staying ahead it, like nature article mentions flu surveillance. nothing, possible SARS-CoV-2, fully evade current vaccine. Probably tomorrow review chart lancet article you‚Äôll see probability vaccine escape variant function cases.

I can‚Äôt imagine would nothing, saying it‚Äôs impossible incorrect. huge concert Jax hospitals overrun covid. insane. talk Radio hosts area telling people refuse mask every single day . I'd agree you, [Gordon thing quite lethal enough stop freight train.  Thanks Greg  Yes, stupid analogy ridiculous. probability severe damage vastly different. There‚Äôs really don‚Äôt lie One childhood friends (known 35 yrs) RN that's exactly did. got really angry tried tactfully make point did. NP I've known 20 yrs works dr I've gone 20 yrs absolutely convinced government injecting microchips us vaccine. Dr's office requiring employees vaccinated shes quitting job. Already put notice. idea people I've known long fucking crazy. mind blowing. It‚Äôs protecting others. completely self-regarding issue wouldn‚Äôt give shit. safer vaccinated well, would advise keep distance precautions check things similar now. much worse (and honestly sound like might much worse Florida now), would less advised, I'm sure. 

That said, Thanksgiving four months away. would expect many things become tentative then. definitely follow CDC advice minimum, knowing Florida's government demonstrate goal health safety people may different advice. definitely ton travel advice holiday, opt follow cautious advice see. Keyword believe. Lotta kids believe Santa Claus idea you‚Äôre trying say here. start saying saying said, move rambling non-sequitor littering, misquote me, finally end saying thing started saying weren‚Äôt saying.

Yet, somehow completely miss point that. everyone vaccinated vaccinated, none would happen. It‚Äôs 100% fault willfully unvaccinated. deaths unvaccinated breakthrough cases vaccinated aren‚Äôt fault going concerts restaurants getting shot(s). It‚Äôs people aren‚Äôt vaccinated things.

In short, empirically wrong, you‚Äôre asshole, moron, need shut go make appointment get 5G upgrade. I‚Äôm vaccinated still fear it. office 3 breakthrough cases. going get downvoted hell‚Ä¶.

Either unvaccinated hold-outs change minds go get vaccinated (unlikely), (the vaccinated) best help unvaccinated catch COVID ASAP. Assuming don‚Äôt die, immunity (the hard way)‚Ä¶

The exception cannot take vaccine due medical grounds. well. I'm tired idiots. 

Lmao think ending everyone vaccinated. agree you. set tent Jacksonville, assumed covid people. Guess what? It‚Äôs non-covid people. Fantastic. vaccinated punished substandard care. I‚Äôm teacher, wore KN95 mask eight hours day teaching students. (KN95 South Korea-manufactured version N95). took couple days get used it, made warmer wanted be, got small desk fan blow face, helped lot. wore wanted keep students families safe, keep wife safe, medical issues. say entry booth 'No entry fair unless proof vaccination' mask. - arrow pointing vaccination booth. give prepaid ticket free entry next week. fair advertising saying entry without vaccine. get it. Next table, sell hats t-shirts aprons say 'I'm vaxxed' 

Something I've noticed go restaurant now, tell hostess/waitress i'm fully vaxxed - worry lines disappear face smiles, relaxed now, seats us restaurant. smile worth little stiff arm :) ‚ÄúYour car airbags, seatbelts, crumple cage.

Why care drive drunk? It‚Äôs personal choice.‚Äù  said veteran NEEDS medical care, VA screws over. don‚Äôt want wear mask shut next person. people don‚Äôt want it, sane ones recognize burden outweighed potential loss life, see happening every day

**By argument here, mandating vaccines, though.** less burdensome effective mitigation measures describe. government mandate can't go work see people love, certainly able mandate people get shot want anything public.

Additionally, think person responding overstating things (we certainly need mitigation hospitals verge overrun), following point remains. always exponential growth mitigation measures removed many people sick vaccinated. takes one case start chain transmission. I‚Äôm also living Missouri it‚Äôs pretty easy track many vaccines given out. like optimism, county number people dropping isn‚Äôt running people vaccinate. last four weeks 20 people, 20 people, 15 people, 10 people vaccinate. wouldn‚Äôt get vaccine fair either, many places get vaccines available here. people haven‚Äôt gotten yet aren‚Äôt likely unless someone else preventing it. Considering vaxxed individuals still catching covid still hospitalized , missing point sweetheart. stupidity unreal. Going back 100 years . Segregation all!! Please stay home stay safe. want .00002% chance dying! end never sight, vaccinated people still risk getting spreading, told day 1 recall article implemented yet, good idea not? kidding. least I'd charge, always group work dumbshits.  That‚Äôs thing. You‚Äôre comparing apples wristwatches It‚Äôs time start canceling unvaccinated Damn straight I'm mad. They've year get heads right. I'm tired punished right thing. Open total 6 hours Tues/Fri too. Also, wants get vaccinated fair wait around 15 minutes case allergic reaction? Fun stuff. File under: duh Kids 12 exceedingly unlikely die covid Tell ran let squirm. rewarding people willfully stupid point. Vaccines give immunity. LOL LMFAO Angry politicians* He‚Äôs stupid, he‚Äôs gambling stupid voters votes. Yes? getting downvoted, edit spot on. costless intervention wish people would acknowledge that. Low cost? Maybe. costless, prolonged use greater costs time contribute social isolation. Masks social distancing go together, latter damaging mental health, also essential reducing spread. Masks also substitute social distancing, like many people mistakenly seem believe. definitely effective largely vaxxed population.

A prolonged masked society one hopes enjoying. one gives hopes future. already left southern hick town greener pastures. Best decision ever made Fucker trying ‚ÄúTrump‚Äù, Trump.  still die car crash Seatbelts airbags risk mitigated people drive anyway. goal mitigate risk live I'm 0 risk world. Masking without social distancing mitigate risk still. 

Again point wearing mask come contact others? Ill say again. Would install airbags seatbelts intention driving car? No. would stupid. Masking intention around others logic. point mask safer around others. Some? would say us them. mentality hasn‚Äôt allowed us act global warming. It‚Äôs defeatist attitude. shit, let‚Äôs MINIMIZE much possible. people taking vaccines access maximizing possibilities much possible. I've also always irregular cycle part. 20s, mostly regular skips there. got vaccinated first time period came early spotting normally happen. also gave painful cramps abnormal. happened second vaccination well. fully vaccinated two months ago last period couple weeks ago normal. 

Last year around April, stress pandemic gave irregular periods year. would skip every three months eventually righted around Jan Feb, regular again. guess afraid something wrong reproductive system, worrying whole time afraid get checked out. use one period tracker apps could estimate timing also contributed little anxiety last year. finally regular again, happy bc meant healthy. getting vaccinated, guess irregularity put back anxious mindset last year.

I'll probably end getting booster anyway recommended, pleasant comes this. I've really never anything wrong whole life would scare something abnormal. one time life want Insurance companies pull kind shit. think daily discussion thread functions pretty well place ask COVID-related questions, although see specific sub might attract larger number answers per question got popular enough. anti-vaxxers clinging every breakthrough case coerce claim point getting vaccine.

Plenty people well. Some? point nicest people know sound savage cynical ass. Talking hope Darwinism takes effect wipes last remnants fools move on. miss myspace Yeah idea front lol, thought article might helpful general I‚Äôll leave specific question someone might know answer works OK delta. Maybe better OK, maybe quite good OK. data place that.

It works well Delta, certainly better OK. Hes right 

Modern day Republicans greatest threat humanity I‚Äôm still confused though, say it‚Äôs still pretty difficult catch twice. fuck still many people US haven‚Äôt already come contact covid point; especially considering antivaxxers haven‚Äôt careful catch last 18 months. I‚Äôm expected believe antivax, antimask, anti social distancing folks who‚Äôve going bars concerts whole time catching covid? ass caught year ago taking every precaution possible short quitting job? feel like Dr.Manhatten right idea yolo Mars. course, surely scientists made predictions estimates. really sucks.(Cannot say something make look smart local) government like ""LOL, pandemic losers! $300 unemployement you! Go die treated terribly economey""  Well, people reject Pfizer Moderna vaccine, eventually get slightly less effective virus vaccine. country media loved hate reaping best worlds: current cases deaths, stronger economic growth lockdown countries, people never experienced yoke tyranny.

We need digest happened see Sweden's approach much better anywhere else world. lie make self-contradictory statements beginning pandemic like many health experts Dr Fauci said masks necessary protecting general public health care workers needed dwindling supply backfired fueled lot distrust legitimate information advice later on. recently, relaxed mask social gathering guidelines rollout vaccine. virus human many humans. submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

In Western world, it‚Äôs eradicated. 

It‚Äôs making comeback though antivaxxers. Oh,America first.huh. statewide positivity rate hit 15 percent Wednesday,

OMG. University Texas, said requiring mask wearing would help state curb rapid spread Delta variant.

OMGx2 (in 50's pre-existing condition)am luckily vaccinated,though many 50's 40's including family members yet vaccinated despite seriously want vaccinated. 100%. responsibility now, much getting vaccinated was. Yes, likely happen like likely come GoF. stay inside couple months keep spread low possible still are.

This nonsense. Every country done seen huge uptick cases restrictions ease. Lockdowns temporary solution. [Israel starting apply third dose desperation serious cases begin rise even among fully spent last year furious disappointed people gullible idiotic difficult right thing. Instead come theories myths vaccine help, even end world.

I also without job pandemic hit, looking focus mental health declined, covid happened. home time meant slowly going broke, rely stimulus checks barely even got due charge time.

Eventually got vaxxed, job. I'm numb people's problems try throw anti vax shit me, going make money go tf back home. Even vaccine always wear mask gloves, even though customers come maskless. ignore em thing. You‚Äôre making sense. unvaccinated far susceptible delta?

More 91% new cases Germany already Delta. Bunch kids get sick recover like nothing happened. Media course hype number cases thousand 18 deaths last 18 months one os really going care.

Cuomo democrats already burned nursing homes last year majority folks 65 either antibodies vaccinated Yes, know. point is, haven‚Äôt forgotten wash hands. time could better spent. ceo, entrepreneur? born 1964? jeffrey bezos? Faux News tell it‚Äôs gullible viewers? quite true, **everyone** (vaccinated not) pay unless prescribed. Long covid. Mutations. [found mean protein subunit? Yeah, probably work. developers claimed due vaccine's nature regular tests show antibodies, use tests check, lol. I've heard similar Chinese protein subunit vaccine used China Uzbekistan, produce antibodies. Vector (developers EpiVacCorona, vaccine question) full shit. Look UK, Healthcare system could handle larger caseload last year due vaccines. Using metrics last year ""following science"" yet proven third dose helps and, so, needs one when. 

The third jab obviously desperate measure cases keep increasing even despite high vaccination rate. Tell family 4.2 mil people died tosser still fucking platform? Burn stake Patients kept hospitals contagious, sent dedicated recovery facilities, isolation wards established nursing homes.

Here Korea, government paid bunch hotels temporary isolation facilities, believe spent time building dedicated facilities. building paid government modify airflow negative pressure Wards cases overflow. think point everyone choice vaccinated.

You understanding article. Trained... Yeah that. German government enough resources get testing centres cover population.

You love this, fix allowed anyone open test center (like small tent somewhere city). requirement online training, video show admit test.

Once done good best part paid close 30$ per test submit number daily. need prove really number. Data protection names anyways need prove bought test kits well.

You'll submit positive cases sure.

So ended centres never positive tests. Press checked bigger candidates multiple test centres, counted people passing out. Number like 100 people went 700 announced day.

Free money hey population pay bill.

And real consequences people cheating. Sadly true. search ""unpopular opinion"" subs top. Killing disabled people pretty common ""unpopular"" opinion. think point everyone choice vaccinated. mask protect can‚Äôt vaccinated. point everyone choice, may choose effectively declared position infected. B 1.351 resistance antibodies completely vaccine resistant. anyway, proof said; emerge spread real world got outcompeted variants. current environment need variant completely vaccine resistant highly infectious. agree rest said. Mine too.

I mind wearing mask public got vaccinated soon could. 

I work stock room though, AC hits 90+ summer. I'm back alone hours time expect wear mask whole time. 

Meanwhile seem consequences unvaccinated people lied stopped wearing one may. Like war! unable manufacture enough second component. Russia underdelivered many countries purchased Sputnik, that's Sputnik Light (it's first component vaccine) 'created' on-going tests mixing shot AZ/CanSino.

The vaccine probably good working can't manufacture it, null. countries lack 2nd shot Sputnik try get CanSino Convidencia jabs - Ad5 component. think Canada released data effective Moderna Delta, according data seems least effective Pfizer/BioNTech. spreads amongst vaccinated almost easily amongst unvaccinated.

No doesn't, spread misinformation. vaccinated infected, spread easily someone unvaccinated infected. vaccinated, substantially less likely become infected, however. spread far slowly population vaccinated people otherwise. 64% least partially 52% fully vaccinated total Italian population. better US. Number first doses significantly decreased, number second doses decreasing well. demand decreased point less supply vaccines. 

Here Netherlands that's case weeks now, want vaccine, come next day. places even started vaccinations without appointments (but preferred less efficient).  day take breaks think much easier live western world pandemic, all. important perspectives. trials, ""bureaucracy"". Even small changes substance could trigger vastly difference response humans, tweak needs tested released market. know anything choose take word it. I'm American reading sub year impression I've got vaccines, much like everything else US, politicised. 

Half population treat vaccines enemy, half treat God negative news (like article) seen personal attack 'their side' rather cold facts based research. fuck wrong lol People vaccinated getting now. Thats about. Correct I‚Äôm wrong can‚Äôt show scene blurring faces? can‚Äôt identify patients video would matter? issue alot places base guidelines &amp; restrictions number cases, hospital cases. pretending like million cases million vaccinated people bad million cases million unvaccinated people. great re-submit comment contained word f*** got deleted automod incorrectly accusing personal attack. 
and yet, comments like nothing personal attack, zero intellectual defence arguments, purely fuelled hatred, picked one. 

none wrote attacked person's character. criticism bad policy religion-like supportiveness bad decisions. thing achieved prove point Yeah feel like flavour exageration revealed time. Anti-vaxxers would screaming ‚ÄútOld sO‚Äù; sowing distrust vaccines.

Not mention lot people got Pfizer could try sue, although don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd able to. Or, even worse, would start distrusting government, CDC, science, vaccines, overall medical medicinal treatments advancements. We‚Äôd regress society even probably. Thanks. Understand delta infectious, interested translates safe social distancing specifically? Using logic article, delta 1000x infectious, 2m social distancing 2km? i'm you. understand race get people working. Unless want kill old sick save medicaid social security. Well u saw israel stuff right? vaccines seeming like wearing while? fully read comment, wouldn‚Äôt make assumption understanding, lack thereof, vaccine works. explicitly mention comment lifting mask mandate vaccinated people big mistake, well aware fully vaccinated people still transmit virus others.And that‚Äôs exactly point, CDC lift mask mandate knowing full well vaccines prevent contagiousness?Also, paid intention statements made Dr Fauci past months, made statements going unmasked indoors quite safe you‚Äôre vaccinated risk getting infected extraordinarily low effective preventing serious illness death.

It‚Äôs clumsy carelessly made statements like made people lower guard led surge delta variant among double vaccinated non-vaccinated people alike. CDC Dr Fauci made statements severely undermining mask wearing social distancing precautions work alongside vaccine.

This it‚Äôs upsetting see Dr Fauci talk spread false information reason virus still persists responsible making many scattered contradicting statements fully supporting CDC‚Äôs announcement fully vaccinated people longer need wear masks saying people ‚Äúneed get feel we‚Äôre approaching form normality‚Äù reversing previous recommendations made regards masking wearing fully vaccinated.

All all, CDC Dr Fauci responsible facilitating spread false information inconsistent information recommendations throughout pandemic.  Maybe it‚Äôs better. 1)Polio wasn‚Äôt pandemic.

2) 1% human population still millions wonder many need die take pandemic seriously. Goes show selfishness value life eyes.

3) alternatives talk proven work, cheaper not. U.K. 165 days full lockdown March 2020 April 2021 (when rigid lockdown ended restrictions remained) place world. don‚Äôt think American U.K. approach lumped together sub ask covid questions? Like raskcovid? wish was. Italy Israel statistics that, taken grain salt. statistics basically say vaccinated first higher chance breakthrough, problem vaccinated first elderly.

So lower efficacy could basically either waning immunity and/or simply older. Google dlco covid... could learn lot history, stopped erasing it. Sounds like it. wonder less individualistic countries better.... (even forced collectivist ones). I‚Äôm really wondering else do. article said lockdowns table nationwide vaccine requirement considered. 

They say tools left don‚Äôt see many options available.  trying pretend like covid anything like polio ridiculous massive disservice using refrigerated trucks temporary morgues. Digging mass graves manage bodies anything else.

How people forget shit quickly? still get polio getting polio vaccine? Exactly  taken random Leftovers though? rapture would theoretically take believers. it‚Äôs phrase, now. I‚Äôm pretty much pandemically exhausted. Like here, saw news early 2020, shocked finally hit home us March 2020, abided lockdowns masks many months, finally took shot. Things finally looked progressed it‚Äôs deja vu. feels like we‚Äôll never escape portion pandemic slowly get hole keep digging us. It‚Äôs sad takes keep going on.

Mask mandates may answer waiting society man take shot (unless they‚Äôre kids can‚Äôt yet) clearly working. doesn‚Äôt work, don‚Äôt know could go really piss people proudly refuse take shot, January 6th indication scenario, it‚Äôs hopeless. *a good chance vaccine make feel better.*
 
What? I‚Äôm way. It‚Äôs awful say point, I‚Äôm sick minority stupid, selfish people screw rest us way, long. go back masks lockdowns, they‚Äôll continue party give two shits. Zero pity them. pretty high. Good luck. hope works you. makes sense though, confirmed positive cases always going lag time know wear masks running rampant community. need risk analysis instead: vaccination rate, population density, hospital beds per 10,000 population. kids rarely died what's big deal?

You kidding? Polio could mortality rate 10%

Children died huge numbers major medical breakthroughs 20th century. start 20th century America 10% infants would see first birthday, nearly 25% children would reach 5 years old - massive improvement 1800 number 50%. US number 6/1000. live Japan - combined child infant mortality rate 2.5/1000.

Just requiring pasteurization milk alone reduced infant mortality rate half. differences infant child deaths pre-1900, 1900-1915, 1915 1940 onwards massive - clearly see specific changes caused huge differences.

Measles, pertussis/whooping cough, influenza, tuberculosis, smallpox, cholera, diphtheria, pellagra, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, yellow fever, rheumatic fever - never hear we've completely knocked vaccination, improved sanitation, antibiotics improved understanding nutrition (eg. rickets pellagra), cases good job simply exist more. That's bizarre witness. Brazilian middle chaotic landscape half million dead, LEAST say adhesion vaccination seems high here. base belong us  I‚Äôm boat. went CC last year transferring university year. stayed CC guess. Didn‚Äôt think 100 million people would refuse vaccine‚Ä¶ also know 5 vaxxed people tested positive recently. 3 covid pre vaxx era. None symptoms all. never would known subject mandatory testing jobs. 

I covid I'm vaxxed. I'm going test unless really good reason to. Well... shit. aggressive nearly violent protest several countries anti Vaxxers .

They literally protesting point ‚ÄúLiving‚Äù

We live sad times work went back masks today. one whole month mask free life. first, said unvaccinated employees mask up, distributed list supervisors people were. Holy shit, uproar singled out, persecuted, discriminated against. end day policy updated employees. Fuck you. Yes know many 42,000 exposed Really tired feeling like antivaxers antimaskers winning again, got vaccinated, I‚Äôve stayed home well family, going necessary even vaccinated still take precautions feels like many people don‚Äôt want wear mask get vaccinated businesses forced make masks mandatory, vaccinated people (myself included) back scared media constantly acting like you‚Äôre still lot danger even you‚Äôre vaccinated, meanwhile antivaxers antimaskers enjoying lives usual.
I‚Äôm back scared vaccinated 60+ old parents catching back feeling like I‚Äôll put life hold cause danger again. 

Does anyone else feel way? sucks feels like it‚Äôs job protect people refuse vaccine. really disagree, 82 percent number valid 4000 employees exposed? holy hell hope satire tests use? Thanks, edited post reflect that. I'm math background follow logic, I'm used terminology like that, thanks letting know :) different time. People took pride giving back
To community contributing. it‚Äôs got mine!‚Äù First emergence new COVID variant similar death rate MERS, kills one three infected people, ""realistic possibility"", government's scientific advisers warned.However experts also say virus could result ""much less severe disease"" older people clinically vulnerable long term.In paper published Friday, scientists outline chances new variant evade current vaccines, saying one causes ""almost certain"" happen.The document written Scientific Advisory Group Emergencies (SAGE) looked ""long term evolution SARS-CoV-2"", virus causes COVID-19.It said eradication virus ""will unlikely"" scientists ""high confidence stating always variants"".   considered scenario variant causes severe disease greater proportion population previously occurred, similar death rates coronaviruses SARS (10%) MERS (35%). 
The experts said could caused ""recombination"" two variants concern variants investigation, beta alpha delta variants. Insurance companies need start blasting unvaxed people. Government mandate vaccine, it‚Äôs matter national security. one guy currently symptoms. mother, father, brother, girlfriend symptoms time (now). vaccine prevented symptoms well claim must really really lucky. fully vaccined 65. hate say Trump administration got anything right least early pandemic later subsequent second wave. made lot stupid decisions least front cameras telling them. Idiots. point also think absolute risk. efficacy twice infectious variant means actual risk infection doubled, even vaccine efficacy stays exactly same.

But think anyone handle numbers. Like good bad % employees caught covid given moment? probably focus much efficacy, long know vaccination status everyone involved, least make rough estimates. Really tired feeling like antivaxers antimaskers winning again, got vaccinated, I‚Äôve stayed home well family, going necessary even vaccinated still take precautions feels like many people don‚Äôt want wear mask get vaccinated businesses forced make masks mandatory, vaccinated people (myself included) back scared media constantly acting like you‚Äôre still lot danger even you‚Äôre vaccinated, meanwhile antivaxers antimaskers enjoying lives usual.

Does anyone else feel way? sucks feels like it‚Äôs job protect people refuse vaccine. grandfather polio child sometime around 1930. left legs paralyzed. spent next 60 years crutches completely limp, worthless legs. strong, barrel-chested upper body, little skinny stick legs bowed backward decades way got around crutches. would swing legs forward sort wedge ground move, throw upper body forward, swing crutches around, catch could fall face-first ground. lived decently long life, very, hard life.

It's moronic. I'm going get away posting written here.

In opinion unless get escape variant (unlikely) clear year end US. Delta burns hot. made far. hold much more. unpleasantness may occur. And? real viruses kill millions.

Why matter one kills less other? getting Covid-19 November 2020, despite following safety precautions leaving work grocery store. entire pandemic done number me. Covid-19 ruined wedding husband planned. top that, dealing depression anxiety since Covid-19. lost trust humanity refuse go anywhere without mask despite fully vaccinated. think given life ever returning normal due number people refusing get vaccinated refusing wear mask. stopped giving shit well counter party whole COVID debacle. I‚Äôm numb news report dying COVID wishing gotten vaccine. don‚Äôt care anymore. Please. Britain. holy. Keep masks long shit takes. Please. Same! Someone knew sitting fence recently got first dose. delta variant much contagious, way bigger initial viral load bodies overcome generations access plethora bad information via smartphone television. mean Biden Arkansas something would say thing? think saying much lose state voted party last like 10 elections. 1 percent 350 million still enormous, even talking lasting effects. 

Also, exactly start caring virus? kills 1.1 percent? news we've hoped haha I‚Äôm still confused this. numbers much higher waves? get percent younger people higher, actual numbers kids younger adults. Maybe chief one hospitals, week ago, said efficacy infections 80%s July (which means Delta). population 93% vaccinated. unless something crazy happened last week, actually good news efficacy Another CDC fuckup -- time, [false number would believable 1 4600. mean, I've really lost faith mask mandates even effective point. think that's one hardest things seeing come back.

How effective really expect be? unvaccinated (who still significantly likely spread thing) way less likely comply? people comply take masks second sit restaurant? many, many folks wear cloth masks, can't believe provide much protection variant contagious Delta? we're talking mutations, much help much world remains unvaccinated, red areas COVID truly raging extremely limited odds instituting mask mandates? 

I feel like we've seen movie million times before. Blue areas limited spread/high vaccination vaccinated folks wear masks knows long (case point, university -- vaccine mandates -- issued mask mandate). Red areas/the unvaccinated ignore. COVID continue spread.

I'm exhausted this. likely Pfizer since came first health care workers one earlier groups vaccinated. free, life saving vaccine rape. all. even hypothetical scenario vaccine mandated. even remotely comparable. mind boggling comparison chose. France, Italy Eastern European countries too. Long covid always far terrifying prospect death

Agreed. may sound macabre, family still young enough move lives find replacement me. disabling long covid, would stuck caring decades. would rather set free burdened manner.

That said, wearing masks, fully vaccinated, taking nearly precautions vaccinated. everything avoid Delta variant, others, enough research know real levels risks longer term ramifications.

We fortunate 3/4 us work home, live bubble, since even pandemic, tightly controlled bubble.

Doing best. Remember, ‚Äúefficacy‚Äù trials (controlled studies specific times/population). ‚ÄúEffectiveness‚Äù real world. variants effect vaccine effectiveness.  guys need understand limiting factor research time per se, resources. 

I also understand matters whether virus affects young people older people. life life. what‚Äôs logic avoiding unvaccinated people. stage unvaccinated means you‚Äôre willfully probably engaging behaviors put risk? 

I ask spread happens unvaccinated vaccinated people, matter one person group unvaccinated? Unless there‚Äôs new info prevention spread missing? we're gonna ""reduce mutations"" like 7/8 planet still access vaccines wearing masks grocery store lol really feel like much changed due what's happened last days. went boardwalk although people saw wore masks, weren't.

I‚Äôll check out. Thank I'm fully vaccinated see mask. pointless now, variant going spread without them. remedy get vaxed. large college right? Maybe populace educated? People want hear it. want pretend vaccines provide sterilizing immunity. (permanent sterilizing immunity) never going happen, pandemic probably end sometime 2022 point it'll endemic kill thousands old people year.   even said publicly mask mandates protect unvaccinated people. Put blame blame belongs.

Eventually he‚Äôll realize literally fault people chosen forego vaccine. literally cause effect whether want blame government. point maybe put anti-vaxxers together one room see applies group monkeys typewriter. understand point. ü§£ ‚ÄúSome‚Äù? üòÇ Thank much, latest test came back negative happier Except least one hospitals vax rate **93%**. get really high vax rates, start see vast majority cases among vaxxed too. vast majority cases among vaxxed vast vast majority population vaxxed, still see good efficiency.

See here: agree still important stat though, solution stop reporting it, report necessary context.  didn‚Äôt drink much, could probably smoke weed without puking lol twitter thread informative informatik[A reverse zoonosis thread can't. That's slippery slope dangerous idea. Also goes codes medicine. Bad link?  Going forward, let‚Äôs also fight federally-mandated paid sick leave US. talking willfully unvaccinated agree you. agree mitigations imposed though. assessment age death alone.  Every time unvaccinated person catches covid, move towards herd immunity. on, good thing unvaccinated person catches it. variant could come anywhere. variant developed Kent, England. variant didn‚Äôt develop New York height outbreak. Mutations completely random, should‚Äôve learnt middle school. outbreak ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù lead certain outcome. 

Your original comment, heavily downvoted it‚Äôs obviously wrong, say variant likely occur UK Florida. showed wrong. Florida isn‚Äôt even seeing uncontrolled spread US right now. UK certainly major country concern right now. original comment completely false. 

Stop calling people little boy, it‚Äôs pretty weird man. MAIN reason many schools went back hybrid person last year... ""essential"" workers still needed work needed childcare. see coming from, get it. numbers departments health allowing public see. public see whole picture. SFDPH release vaccination status tested, total tested. week gave breakthrough case data(the time data released) 4655 tests/day. best-case scenario, 4557 tests taken fully vaccinated, giving us test positivity 2.2%. worst case, vaccinated test positivity would 100%. also know details vaccinated cases; close contacts, visits packed indoor bars, age, duration exposure, immunocompromised status, etc. 

The KFF study includes date ranges include winter surge tons cases hardly anyone vaccinated large periods time everyone socially distancing wearing masks. SF 10% fully vaccinated 3/14, cases already fallen 32/day point high 373/day 1/8/2021. I'd like see study using current data 6/1/2021 today.
The title ""COVID-19 Vaccine Breakthrough Cases Extremely Rare, According KFF State Data Analysis"" obviously case. ""Extremely rare"", opinion, lifetime chance commercial airliner crash. ""Extremely rare"" not, 2.2% daily covid tests return positive result vaccinated individuals(when overall daily positivity 4.4%).

**So get vaccinated**, may keep getting mild/moderate case covid, keep hospital ventilator. believe Washington state already online K-12 program everything shut tried public schools online learning/ classroom. mess sometimes.

Does Texas online K-12 program separate current public schools? Somewhat true. Kn95 requires initial test almost non existent oversight. N95 FFP2 requires process testing every batch according sampling plan. requires people test samples wasted test. Like NIOSH N95 single test doesn‚Äôt pass, entire batch scrapped. higher labor quality demand results increase price. Whereas kn95, long samples sent passes test. following batches longer required tested get certification interesting idea. Famous Zen popularizer [Alan used concept show can't improve yourself. thing wants improve must also thing improving.  don‚Äôt know enough make generalizations:  money always easy choice. rate 0.011 % that's going take hell long time Thanks!!! *The family scared get vaccine, McCall said, health conditions know bodies would react shots.* 

I guess means research found allergic ingredients vaccine? /s Pick fucking soda up. control behavior, don‚Äôt shitty saw shittier guy earlier. self respect. Biden done shit bring Desantis line. vaccine 100% effective, going less effective people pre-existing conditions, elderly etc. cases. vaccines make *far less likely* die hospitalized situations vs. vaccine, vax awesome. fuck even talking about? vaccines bizarre theories world? live back normal low vaccination area. business requires mask/vaccine job require mask/vaccine. live back normal people unvaxxed, government restricting going back normal. say let people want roll dice roll risk averse stay feel safe. Equity üíÅ Honestly point round anyone doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated put camps. get leave get shot.  Texas mom here. kids good wearing masks surely minority wearing them. pay price another year crap due unvaccinated idiots? I‚Äôm furious. cannot move I‚Äôm beginning think it‚Äôs time leave Texas next years. love morons running state destroying it. ICU number skyrocketing again, people sitting cars oxygen masks there's room hospitals. deaths coming. fewer overall vaccinated people, number still high. new variant starting affect children (who can't yet safely vaccinated) seriously, trend find concerning.

Add that, unvaccinated breeding center new variants. let go long enough vaccinated people variants test against, *will* ones start evade current vaccines.

I want people around me. consider dangerous willfully so. need get program locked homes thing longer endemic. One aunts died coronavirus 2 weeks age bracket allowed get vaccine Ohio. 

She 57 year old 40-65y/o people 65+ group. wanted vaccine couple months get ""too young"" nearly 60. gotten one dose got infected, she'd probably still alive. died suddenly middle night due one known complications...blood clots causing heart attack. preexisting conditions make COVID-19 worse. like many people, hit especially hard. like playing Russian roulette virus.

And hear dumb fucks able get vaccine *easy access* vaccine...but get vaccine. assholes refuse wear mask stay home feel sick likely infected aunt. left behind two kids two young grand kids.

So, compassion people still unwilling vaccinate pretty much null point. hear stories news time people hospital, deaths door, want get vaccine. fail give crap took getting hospitalized take seriously. like fucking mystery COVID-19 deadly causes terrible health effects...we've seen images crazy full ICUs heard horror stories crying doctors past year. people feel sorry young get vaccine, already immunocompromised still living like hermits want die coronavirus, medical staff deal unvaccinated idiots filling emergency rooms. usual, I‚Äôm glad American. Wrong: small risk profile, current risks could change anytime, know risks children face, simply know enough virus make sweeping generalizations Texas won‚Äôt lock down. another wave, unfettered. hope medical folks ok. wave big vaccination rate low 50 under. Luckily many older folks got vaxxed, many big past. shall see. 

My family‚Äôs going best hunker let wave go us. mask, vaxxed, won‚Äôt go restaurants, parties, movies etc. it‚Äôs shame fun that. Anyway, hardest part school starting up. 3 kids K-12. vaxxed better position families kids 12. actual N95 Envo Mask, they're super comfy able pass actual fit test one. exhale valve, double mask procedure mask top, great situations want full N95 protection. got third shot last week, said first one.

I got official doses boots setup Missouri government, May. (Pfizer)

I went Walmart website, made appointment. time decided get Moderna. reasoning mixing give better protection.

I decided get Moderna doses ü§î No, unvaccinated. found pandemic lasted 59 years (yikes!) there's longer one maybe someone could correct me. ever good argument ""socialist healthcare"" this.

once US gov stops paying covid treatment people, guarantee private insurance people drop idiots like bad habit Yeah spike protein changed couldnt mrna vaccines updated rather quickly? major organ failure caused spike protein suppose stay arm, per Japanese study, spread throughout body? 

We need mask part. We‚Äôre controlled minority every way important. one? Even this, don‚Äôt think founding fathers spinning graves. County one surge counties news 0.011 per cent population passed covid know information that's is.

40% injected, 60% not. Ah yes, ""whistleblower."" colleagues fired dashboard designer Rebekah Jones public health experts tell CBS12 News claims directed delete COVID cases deaths state‚Äôs data unsupported social media firebrand, long alleged leadership Florida Department Health asked change raw COVID data cases delete deaths. claims continue spark national attention mistrust Florida‚Äôs widely available COVID despite repeatedly making startling accusations, Jones offered proof.

It's going lot harder finally post proof suspended Twitter.   Idk still want research jump What's epidemiological explanation flu apparently disappeared last winter? Personal attacks nice buddy. Well isn‚Äôt America‚Äôs deaths heart disease? eat like trash haha. anyway, healthy bodies &amp; minds could fight sickness find doctor disagree that. 

Cheers mate ü§£ Vaccine protected ‚Äúnormal‚Äù covid variants around 95%+. delta variant already drops around 88%. won‚Äôt long another drop like maybe another. drops low(idk exact percent) would become susceptible again. point seems like natural progression towards even vaccine resistant strain. Lol, what.

Horseshoe crabs, real first responders. No, put fence gate lock it.

Since proven reduce risk.

Harm minimization harm elimination DeSantis never cared protecting residents. hospitalizations deaths remained extremely low, thanks vaccines. French media awful, give much face time fringe nutters like Raoult little hateful troll Zemmour. don‚Äôt, they‚Äôve caught cooking books Covid numbers before. They‚Äôre probably stillness it. TB, AIDS, polio, various poxes. Flu, rhinovirus, coronavirus feel badly. company dead set bring everyone back offices event felt need town hall show us ‚Äúresearch‚Äù people actually productive working office home, could sta ‚Äúwe know think you‚Äôre productive home, you‚Äôre wrong.‚Äù Hippocratic oath. don‚Äôt, they‚Äôve caught cooking books Covid numbers before. They‚Äôre probably stl it. saying disagree you, think okay vaccinated people lose masks? Influenza mutates rapidly non-human hosts (typically birds swine). 

There common cold, it‚Äôs dozens viruses several different types virus manifest similar symptoms. he‚Äôs weak human? called Darwinism. It‚Äôs science. weak die current info rights state. might less need permission told. Unvaccinated people ready also. So, let‚Äôs it. like forever. options solve vaccine mandates permanent lockdowns. There's reason vaccinated person continue putting life hold. Covid stay unless mandate vaccination spread like worse happen every year 1775 - General Washington uses 100 Soldiers quarantine city Boston restrict travel.

1776 - forced inoculation entire Northern Army

1777- mandatory inoculation Continental Soldiers militiamen

1777 - Thomas Jefferson drafts mandatory inoculation law citizens Virginia

1770s- early 1780s - mandatory isolation hospitalizations anybody symptomatic.

1793 - Benjamin Rush James Monroe assist enacting quarantining refugees Philadelphia. breaking quarantine jailed assistance citizen patrols, particularly New York, Baltimore, Norfolk. Havre de Grace sinks anybody crossing river Maryland.

1780s end life - Benjamin Franklin advocates stringent public health measures face epidemics. Dr. Rush pushes government mandates sanitation.

1813 - True words Constitution ‚Äòpromote General Welfare‚Äô, James Madison signs -and Congress Authorizes- government funding vaccines citizens ‚ÄòAn Act Encourage Vaccination‚Äô formation National Vaccine Institute Lol that‚Äôs point‚Ä¶ world Yes differentiated. common test analyzing presence three proteins unique virus. also antibody test line speaking really show virus, (or vaccinated). NYC taught anything advantage whole nations fked.

Stock GOOD masks, spend Lil IDC. Also stock like shelf stable groceries 2-3 weeks worth, maybe buy gun ya one already. sorry dad immune compromised? rare someone vaccinated die even variance.  Some??? must shorter average patience fed fuckin idiots year ago  Next up: Cold wet socks deemed unpleasant most! 2022 2024 already gone. It'll De Santis 2024, observing he's growing much composed version Trump is. Trump cause split Republican vote base, De Santis winning. 

Lockdowns would also ensure US economy would collapse beyond recognition. money printing time. guess that's also concern Biden administration, political motives. People injected still spreading virus what's point pretending free move around they're still spreading it? ever needed ruthless tyrant like Stalin.... choice back Stalin's USSR would simple.

You either get vaccine, take two bullets.

Since can't that, let's put island somewhere option vaccinate.

I truly feel sorry rest world people want vaccines can't get :( much worse would get held accountable?

By mean 48.5% population Florida vote Democratic opponent, vs. 48.2% still vote him... Could misprint, I'd like suggest another possibility: Florida extremely high proportion senior citizens. Seniors US whole likely vaccinated (haven't checked Florida stats), also seems like may less likely mount strong immune response vaccine. maybe they're also likely get breakthrough case likely get sick young vaccinated person. 

I idea what's happening here, worth mentioning another interpretation. would getting risks mutating possibly something vaccines provide 0 protection from. reiterate, mask even vaxxed Let's get mRNA vaccine RSV , hmm? Let's realistic, natural selection event. Either handle covid infection don't. I'm fully vaccinated took PCR test vaccinated coworker office working tested positive. 

My take vaccinated people weather delta covid infection better. many breakthrough cases keep hearing make believe otherwise. media‚Äôs coverage mind-bendingly irresponsible Yes would asshole vaccines 100% effective. It‚Äôs defined symptom lasting longer 12 weeks. includes fatigue persistent cough, ‚Äúshit quality life‚Äù indefinitely.

Persistent symptoms exist infectious diseases well. Wait‚Ä¶ mean things everyone past year? 

Not everyone, yes. Maybe Americans, humans generally good health could fight sicknesses &amp; use good antidotes.

Like currently happening? 

It's pointless trying conversate people like you, brain flowing ass. live Tampa too. I'm vaccinated started wearing mask indoors fine that. Glad hear it! MS enough burden without covid too! hope stay healthy possible Yes take even small based risks seriously, ALWAYS determination much worth sacrificing order mitigate risk.

These determinations already made diseases similar risk profiles covid (for children vaccinated) determination worth forcing everyone wear worth gathering based restrictions. Yes, are! California tourism, course. Florida that's pretty much we've got, technology, healthcare, financial services etc. brother-in-law got sick virus. 

He used drive FedEx. can't anymore got sick virus fucked cognitive abilities hard unable drive all. sister called mom yesterday told pay mother's phone anymore mom would pay SSI check ‚Äî sister needs pick slack brother-in-law working. five people living house (two ""adults"", elderly couple, 11 year old boy) none plans get vaccinated still. Fucking idiots. clear, lots answers, questions assume folks far far smarter given thought trying come solutions. 

I also think one size fits all, motivations probably diverse people are.

For myself, hate sick anything prevent getting sick together minimum lesson severity duration win book motivation getting vaccine.   concern right cpacity limits forced us again.

If cancel plans reactionary idiot common council, im gonna pissed me. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating makes feel demoralized powerless. like gun control gridlock American.


Imagine indulged drunk drivers thought entitled freedom, thought ‚Äòthey drive fine drunk, statisticians making numbers up.‚Äô You‚Äôd like ‚Äòok, well guess I‚Äôll avoid roads altogether. crosswalks. sidewalks.‚Äô


That‚Äôs now. probably using janky unwashed rag found walking trailer park mask. us using actual masks, yes, work. Especially taking account moisture breath transfer medium.

Sorry bad science and/or finances. Let us know help buy real mask. I'm afraid can't help stupid, however.  Eat good books lately? 

Sure N95/KN95/surgical mask works best mask offer high protection. 

Regarding variant, variant breakthrough cases even chance death practically zero. say vaccination nothing variance plain false. cannot expect fix broken system come within system. could determine accessing state vaccination records  area local health department come cannot get out. know Lyft Uber offering free rides anyone going get Covid vaccine too. Also, local traveling nurses traveling house house communities see anyone still needed vaccinated. true. sister caught covid. W/i 4 days exposure, vomiting blood, drowning blood. went seizures.

He's 17 drop regular school keep anymore. whole life straight A+, math/science ""genius"" watched NOVA talked parallel universes worm holes beginning age 3. alive -- thank God -- know ever get future back. Apologies, thought obvious asking rate infection polio vaccination vaccination first implemented, introduced, first started - prior herd immunity even possible. 

I would like comparison infection rates vax two diseases vaccination first began each. public health bar much much higher masks point. School closures particular- expect every business targeted schools year. data slides 11-12 regarding LTCF residents shows 85% effectiveness severe illness. without population bias (meaning population relatively homogeneous terms risk). good, nearly amazing 97%-99% biased numbers administration/media quoting.

Otherwise we'll keep getting spikes whenever mitigations put place get lifted. delay outcome, downside crushing economic social lives process. explained why, today, 21st century, long herd immunity reached virus stopped spreading, rate contamination amongst vaccinated polio low.

I know desperately want interpret proof polio vaccination, unlike COVID-19 vaccination, prevents vaccinated catching disease doesn‚Äôt.

What rates infection covid among vaccinated?

Can provide links polio infection vax? cannot find anything. Goddamn immunofreeloaders City level data two weeks Delta hit showing 30% cases vaccinated. city 70% vaccinated. 3. need polio booster shots every 6 months They're going need full approval (not emergency approval) FDA lot consider getting unfortunately. here. cdc announced new outbreak fungal infection people area commenting news outlet reported fear mongering.

Yet, somehow overwhelming concern covid-19 calm storm. don‚Äôt see getting better. see getting lot worse. last shred empathy gone. anti vax cretins wallow die Quite opposite. I'm losing unemployment benefits Sept 5th along everyone else state collecting pandemic emergency insurance. 

I guess they've decided safe enough go back work. safe enough without mask... vaccines.. distancing.. vaccine resistant variant ever pops (let alone strain). far seen variant made vaccines useless. Gamma / Beta variants E484K mutations reduced neutralisation titers 6-7 fold made vaccines still sufficiently effective (Delta refuces 2-4 fold, breakthrough cases happen coz high viral load / fast replication).

If vaccine resistant variant pop up, regardless vaccinations, could still dominant due factors. vaccine resistant. 

But get saying, still try reduce infections much can. boofing newest variant days. Everyone's true. Heartbreakingly, wish people could watch everyday. worked covid floors seen dozens die it. seen people die it‚Äôs part job, covid different. tried help people get exhausted every resource modern medicine offer avail.

Ya‚Äôll realize people, right?

It‚Äôs fucking fact going create national trauma won‚Äôt ever recover from, ‚Äúwell deserved it‚Äù isn‚Äôt ever going make better. Hate break way things going looks like covid stay.

We're discussing firing healthcare workers based vaccination status. discussing health pass imposed travelers. think lockdowns due Delta - thing bring lockdowns back vaccine-resistant strain. thought hospitalizations deaths going goal well vaccinated states still case care case counts? IBut kids parents don‚Äôt care two shits COVID. feel you. keep screaming much you‚Äôre right I‚Äôll keep screaming reality situation. Yeah thats said. Third shots priority, getting everyone vaccinated is.  Yikes people differing levels knowledge. Grouping together sociopaths much insight understanding way. Go political sub, FAR worse. Florida 1/5 cases. even persistent opening schools without masks COVID affect/kill kids. Dumbest dumbest. Masks still real easy wear, they‚Äôre still good idea, thing changed you.

Let‚Äôs clear nuance, mask always easy wear *physically*, always technically help lower Covid spread (question draw line Covid never go away), mask absolutely fundamentally irreconcilable normalcy. never state normalcy mandated socially expected mask (I argue others wearing mask optionally stand way normalcy). sure weren‚Äôt good person spite bad man office? 

I think almost point here, problem argument though attitude change occurred drastically last couple weeks, 45 stepped office 46 entered. 46 several months office people old care optimism.

Guess I‚Äôm saint then. seem missed masks mandates social distancing immediately discarded, even less 90% total population fully vaccinated yet. 

That suggets vaccination important, word ""immediately"" implies restrictions removed point. even included hypothetical figure. news reports hospitals time. Blur faces. done, no? lockdown till 2022 would devastating say least. A) would nothing open to. B) mental health crisis seen ever before. C) Education loss. D) People going hospital issues (NYC saw issue happen last year) internet terrible idea retrospect. r/Coronavirus members Anyone amount common sense knows talking can't get vaccinated won't. made choose username? want really feel negative emotion, ask much work put fixing problem. UK high uptake vaccine 60+. US, Germany, France, canada‚Ä¶ others don‚Äôt. Germany we‚Äôre still 15% unvaccinated 60+ age group alone. Enough 50k-100k deaths (assuming delta isn‚Äôt deadlier top) alone.

Spain Portugal done even better job close 100% vaccinated age groups Yes sidewalks front yards!!!! absurd statement, right?! Hahaha. really don‚Äôt even know say people say dumb stuff like that, like‚Ä¶maybe disinformation campaign successful rest us like, ‚Äúwait, say?‚Äù advocating anything except vaccination. Everybody's choice, it? benefits withholding funds school districts? sure kids. much variants boosting antibody counts. First two shots still seem highly effective preventing serious complications. Booster prevent symptomatic contagiousness disease. Boosters certainly optional unless get true vaccine ending mutation. instead conscripting them, offer healthcare benefits couldn‚Äôt otherwise afford /s Oh way, CDC report also stated vaccinated breakthrough cases transmit virus easily unvaccinated. CDC still maintains breakthrough cases rare. 

The media picked headline threw failed apply context. Unfortunately, feel people choosing misinformed blatantly disregarding factual information. Yes, there‚Äôs huge issue country due incredible spread lies false information; but, people got willing ignore readily available correct info first place. must kind mental illness disregard information 99.999% medical field (or group experts depending upon topic) follow .001% disagree. outdoors still safer indoors delta variant? example crowded setting like fair, festival, outdoor stadium, concert? vaccinated don‚Äôt direct threat would like vaccinated can‚Äôt be. sociopaths deserve scorn, ridicule anger. incompatible science...

Sorry guys, one vent without starting argument ‚Äúwell he‚Äôs family‚Äù nonsense. Going see therapist first time Tuesday help deal this. Apologies offensive language. vaccine resistant variant emerge environment vaccine begin with? give virus competitive advantage itself. 


Because avoiding immune responses generally helps variants replicate high loads vaccinated umvsccinated, becoming vaccine resistant canbe side effect hevetally becoming better infecting humans. Also keep mind immunity due infection vaccination similar, variant evolves infect infected before, also able infect vaccinated readily. Lastly random/neutral changes occur spike protein cause vaccine-mediated immunity become less effective, spike looks different immune system. evolve chance time without exposure vaccinated people.


But course high case rates populatuon high vaccinatiin rates, creates best environment evolution vaccine says nothing likelihood event. 

We predict likelihood event studies aimed literally true every virus earth

Yes true, reason happened rapidly diseases like measels, mupmd, diphtheria etc nber cases worldwide much much lower covid. cases = faster supposed vaccinate stay lockdown every virus ever omg 20 years time vaccine resistant variant could pop up? 

No course not, supposed take evidence based approach prevent pandemic spiralling control rather pretending ending full hospitals, fast evolution variants, lockdowns again. High vaccinations rates + public health measure like mask wearing cases begin getting high, could keep cases low enough that, measles, evolution extremely limited. sub become mindlessly doomerist?

You'd prefer bury head sand pretend over? Well isn't...so I‚Äôm essential don‚Äôt give shit anymore. I‚Äôm burned out. wore mask year, got vaccinated,

Does suck children immuno-comprised? Yeah does, is. lack awareness shitty person advocating death others also bad, worth, figured I'd explain irony you. Since youre dick though: hey advocating death suffering, bad!

Fair enough people can't get vaccine, turned could it, actually agree second point. importantly, wearing mask protects breakthrough infection (which delta little good at) Ikr? elected leaders best actually leading order confirm bias. obvious fell bullshit saturate sleep night. makes difference logic used though.

No.. stuff makes vaccine like spike protein whatever else gone 2 months it‚Äôs meant train body recognize spike protein COVID virus Got it. Okay, thanks clarifying, let see clarify point bit. 

I seen unvaccinated people state choosing take vaccine time afraid short- long-term effects, gone deep end seem believe vaccinated people die within 3-5 years. sure number coming from, it‚Äôs thing. So, go unvaccinated universe discourse, predicting death vaccinated. However, mostly see expressing concern worry people believe harmed vaccines. 

In terms purpose statement, wasn‚Äôt going sides thing, trying portray vaccinated folks vindictive something. 

It‚Äôs like this. 

Why wish death, even passively, diverse group people may largely actually worried you, however deluded brainwashed worry may be?

That‚Äôs aside, though - guess I‚Äôm expressing points once. 

The main thing I‚Äôd like get across this:
A years ago, could imagined okay whole subsection society sort left die?

I mean, think it, that‚Äôs kind extreme perspective hold. tend become skeptical face extreme perspectives they‚Äôre often based reaction, rather response. get we‚Äôre venting frustrating unvaccinated sometimes, think two things important remember: 1. I‚Äôm seeing increasing number people express sentiment, go beyond venting isn‚Äôt thought critically examined; 2. aren‚Äôt immune inflamed, mobilized, manipulated either. people start wishing death one another, sets alarm bells manipulation going on. 

I feel like might gotten bit tangential here. hope expands discussion, please don‚Äôt hesitate let know you‚Äôd like clarify anything, feel I‚Äôve gotten bit topic I‚Äôve people comment good-naturedly ‚Äòjerking off‚Äô otherwise referencing ‚Äòmy‚Äô dick places I‚Äôm always like ‚Äòyes. dick definitely own.

Also, among incredibly rare healthy young people end dying it? ER doctors reporting young people care begging vaccine, tell late. see upside giving 'a lot leeway.' Yeah headline completely fine. ""two jabs reduces risk long covid half individuals catch covid"" completely redundant.  Actually, work hospital, 20% covid cases right fully vaxxed, though critical condition. Scary stuff.

Yes. point. Covid preventable, need people vaccinated end it. Florida Texas low vaccination rates, relatively high population density, hot summer season (ie people packed inside) make vulnerable time. 

The point I'm trying make vaccinated pay mistakes unvaccinated. I'd rather see vaccine passports requirement enter crowded public places (restaurants, etc) see restrictions vaccinated. Covid started little year half ago. started dating someone ive close online (in different country) long time around year ago. made sure going see eachother over. got money flights good 7-8 months ago?

Did also know water wet? Shocker, know. I'd okay halves knew comorbidities help mitigate risk. example half includes healthy 20-30 year olds, okay better nothing. pretty much asthma, diabetics, obese immunocompromised, knew adequate risk assessment we're good. already good idea comorbidities take extra precautions change much applies long covid. Hey, I'm sorry frustrated drained, stop framing posts versus world assuming everyone you, make progress.

There are, doubt, studies show effectiveness lockdowns. think also virus simulations prove point visual manner others like read. Including posts would win subset people like data over.

And again, think need consider lack control people governments. criticizing saying, ""Look New Zealand,"" without giving people actionable steps get (written language encouraging calm).

The truth is: 100 percent point, way make counterproductive.

Just probably danger hospitalization since vaxxed mean can't catch asymptomatically potentially spread others.

Even Trump got vaccinated. one mind boggling situations could ever make up.  fear mongering. Texas Florida serious trouble hit ICU capacity.

At minimum, require masks again.

Though tbh, really think need mandate vaccine end this.

Either that, comes it, throw covid patients get Vax (not children couldn't) street someone gets car wreck needs bed. point is, society forced suffer selfish people. one impressed  Would rounding shooting work better you? Think that. think that. That's good answer, variant could detectable earlier. think sure make choice endanger underlying health issues choose get vaccine, comment honestly odd read considering studies recently come showing vaccinated unvaccinated people roughly viral load noses, meaning spread same. mention concern vaccinations lowers symptomatic disease (which great thing, let‚Äôs get twisted) people infected might still going work socializing thus spreading it, won‚Äôt know infected.

The confirmation bias incredibly prevalent sub sides argument, it‚Äôs insane. taking step back objectively looking facts?  still get Covid vaccine. unvaccinated even anything? live life stop worrying others.

Just remember, going hear people internet TV say ""I'm fully vaccinated exposed I've tested positive symptoms"" vs people saying ""I'm fully vaccinated exposed get COVID"".

Not meaning downplay breakthrough infections, saying negative experiences going speak louder positive ones. Florida around 10,000 people hospitalized us around 26,000 total hospitalized Florida around 38% people hospitalized that‚Äôs insane 3000 cases yesterday doesn‚Äôt translate immediate hospitalization deaths. went art fair yesterday saw zero mask noped right back car.

No, obviously get writing.I understand bubbles convenient people want spend intellectual effort. Still responsibility base decisions information bubble alone. I‚Äôm glad got without catching yourself, husband mend!

I think lot us Covid past deathly afraid getting again, despite vaccinated PTSD. Yes, end like cold flu, hopefully case us vaccinated, also know bad be. never want go again. worrying family, newborn sick, middle child get MIS-C, husband sick couldn‚Äôt sit minutes time 6 weeks. 10 months afterward long Covid symptoms 5 us. life-altering experience. Add week one year anniversary BILs death Covid. 

We definitely don‚Äôt want live holed forever, sure going lay low bit things improve wear KN95s whenever leave house. two kids young vaccinate immunocompromised mom, it‚Äôs do. It‚Äôs situation would chosen life, could much worse. Yeah mean, people responding official announcements. Also, would someone go door door that? want rob shit one home, they're house. Makes little sense. robberies happen unoccupied houses. Midterms Appreciated. feels like total bizarro world. What‚Äôs play. Realize trump won‚Äôt win nom 2024 he(desantis)sucks nuts long enough Donnie boy try prop up? sure UK yeah Canada administer covishield shots. Around 270k something  go call ask card? They‚Äôll lie. mean anti vaxxers ICU. They‚Äôre begging vaccination get intubated. 

But agree, ideally could strict triage system. Non vax goes parking lot tent clinics wished good luck. Lol nice, tell problem laziness, TFG thought hospital environments prohibit valved N95 (since weaver could exhale spread infection via valve)?

So perhaps workers still careful patients (masks securely fit, transmission either way) workers contracting virus outside patient rooms....

Or workers unfortunately caught patients (transmission either way possible )  around others days since symptoms first appeared hours fever without use fever-reducing medications symptoms COVID-19 taste smell may persist weeks months recovery need delay end recommendations apply people severe COVID-19 weakened immune systems (immunocompromised).

Deaths lagging indicator thusly comparing apples oranges. three weeks new cases 100k deaths stay 300 conclusion validated. Same. Plenty young Republicans too. actually kind wish knew hesitant people degree biochemistry friends family trust opinion kind stuff. implying sort blame gay people?

Straight people go P-town well, especially watch fireworks July 4th weekend.  breakthrough rate pretty wide range based dataset looked at. state Virginia dashboard breakthrough rate 1-2% last month.

The dataset looks worst breakthrough infection Provincetown Bear Week cluster, it‚Äôs nearly bad math illiterate media portrayed it. cluster breakthrough rate closer 20-30% symptomatic breakthrough rate around ~10-15%.

The difference like attributed delta variant well behavioral differences. seems evidence suggesting vaccination greatly increases amount virus person inoculated with. point, initial
Exposure extremely high vaccine becomes less effective stopping infection cases vaccinated people become contagious. Whether contagious contagious duration unvaccinated individual isn‚Äôt known yet. appreciate downvote, don‚Äôt trust numbers coming autocratic regime. I‚Äôm singling China, either. I‚Äôd say thing North Korea, Saudi Arabia, many Republican-controlled U.S. states. exposed anti vaxx sentiment first believe true. Thats it. hard convince person like would hard convince taking vax bad idea (which would never do) sympathy never really existed honestly, except people truly medical complications vaccines general. Sad thing is, large group actually knows safe/effective, shear defiance reason, stimulating them... Holy shit even doubtful mask wearing erring side caution comes children's safety? political issue??? Let guess, Vaccinated get Delta, sick contagious shorter time would vaccinated? Mandatory vaccines win indeed. pushed LOOOONG time ago. seen required absolutely ridiculous. need pay people get vaccinated. think people getting sick shit games people media playing. Like US really well past months think many people expected another wave, least winter anyways.

Luckily everyone experienced least briefly normality feels like again. hopefully help motivate non-psychopaths society part, get vaccinated, help get things back normal againm feel weird writing serious answer sub FYI grandma‚Ä¶

The virus particle size vs. mask filtering purposeful ignoring fact virus travels itself. 

Covid always surrounded things, like water (spit, moisture), that‚Äôs can‚Äôt get mask, that‚Äôs gets stuck outside N95 filter. 

So covid can‚Äôt get N95 it‚Äôs surrounded package water. U.K. done 9957 tests / 100k people last seven days, roughly 10% population gets tested least week.
The US overall executed 2291 tests per 100k people roughly 2.3% population week. I‚Äôm sure split state - Florida likely exceed national average one better testing states? could town sooner think. Put big adult pants get damn vaccine. 

‚ÄúThis dangerous number,"" said. ""Our children dying. two weeks old two years old four years old. cannot make up. children dying."" Well Israel numbers encouraging effectiveness basically falls half symptomatic infection versus months earlier delta, still great protection death/hospitalizations they're offering 3rd doses.

UK data really comparable US due main vaccines use (AZ) mixed (AZ+mRNA) intervals doses (longer 21 day Israel US used Pfizer) . 

So important US data collection domestically verify Israel's experience replicated months since months ahead vaccinations see drop effectiveness happen US Israel anomaly, what's drop effectiveness (if any) here?


And everything send hospital/dead considered mild. important actually track infection especially breakthrough able say kind long ""mild"" symptoms last

Fatigue weeks, loss taste smell, brain fog etc considered mild..so prevalent symptoms? average long last? compare unvaccinated. 

For vaccinated saying wear mask vaccinated viral load unvaccinated, measure often happens instead guessing/estimating

I doubt vaccine works reduce these, data bother collect it. collecting it? afraid it'll confirm Israel's experience they'll admit vaccines less effective?

 conversely, say actual data delta reduce effectiveness type mild symptoms people get prevalent vaccinated? 

This least let people know need mask measurable data say needed Delta also seems changed calculus bit terms vaccinated people potential spread it, making masking bit protecting others again. see attitude lot want ask questions. vaxxed matters? wear mask indoor settings people don‚Äôt know/speak least semi daily?  Republican Political leaders finally starting ""approve"" vaccine that's probably why... ones impacted Republican base really great carrot would someone suffers adverse reaction, drug companies would held liable paying medical costs resolve adverse event! people want watch world burn. Fucking Ted Cruz sent email yelling masks shutdowns eeeevil. know I'm stupid mailing list, keep moving spam, filth keeps coming. I'd agree it. husband immunocompromised, there's much keep getting hospitalized. 

We thought he'd safe friends got vaccinated, fear Delta variant and.....I'm tired this. Yeah, true. reason people taking exactly medicine science  quotation marks article title? Let's allow expert's quote taken fact one rather appeal ignorance clicks.   Come pathetic attempt install fasc dictator, stay widespread viral death.    Funny people don‚Äôt wanna take shot act like know people studied medicine decade. talk negative side effects vaccine, despite fact medicine side effects well. Vaccines medicine perfect, it‚Äôs better effective treatment none all.   Meanwhile Austin full blown tourist mode. Packed streets events.    decisions people make lives business. health care providers responsibility take care need services, doesn‚Äôt matter see repeatedly thing. someone overdoses don‚Äôt treat ‚Äúwell shouldn‚Äôt done heroin‚Äù, fucking treat them. patient patient, regardless vaccination status.  Deaths lagged several weeks behind cases cases recorded right still unvaccinated people. number likely go next weeks. US fucking solipsistic country.  asshole's term end?  Especially vaccines get full FDA approval....   Yes! roll eyes hear people say they've done research. Like scientists didn't.  think case could made either way goal overall reduction deaths, hospitalizations, transmission.

Sadly, places would benefit new restrictions places vaccine rate lowest, places least likely impose restrictions.        OP, know happens Provincetown outbreak specifically?    There‚Äôs data shows Delta + variants sharp decrease time?          100% agree approach. I've past 2 weeks foreseeable future. stay safe well! like wearing condom balls rather dick. kids aren‚Äôt school, parents create wealth corporations?   attitude exactly situation getting worse. matter person mild symptoms, they're allowed spread people B, C D, spread people E, F, G, H, I, J, K L, spread to... mean like following CDC guidelines?  Underlying conditions negate deaths covid.  majority Americans underlying conditions. family there, gotten tested expensive get tests know it. definitely underreported. instituted vaccine passports beginning. Flights, work, stores, amusement parks, everything! agree wish didn't. Maybe morons office actually took proper action dumbass anti-vaxxers stopped acting like children talking another lockdown first place. 

The country can't handle another one unfortunately really deal now. People gonna get sick people gonna die. take precautions try get many vaccinated possible. 

When said done, really wonder gonna look history books. I'm also curious gonna change things moving forward, hope start cascade horrible shit done line. pandemic deepen divide people. Vaccinated people roughly zero risk contagious long time. There's relatively value tested earlier. water wet. stance everything one way now, opposite later. need concrete evidence time vaccination make sure it‚Äôs good line.  I‚Äôm ball anxiety. early June, booked ticket visit grandfather Florida, who‚Äôs essentially deathbed stage 4, coming week. much better idea booked ticket, implication call days ago knows little time left.

Oh my. Wow. human body makes antibodies work virus, variants well (hopefully - can't make unlimited variants antibodies, make *a lot*). That's cool. Thank information. Right gullible Cubans got 1 3 Latinos still 1 10 African Americans bragging holds much weight reality. lost huge states like AZ GOP attempts take voting rights Latinos Native Americans backfired big way. chin masker chronic sinusitis literally can't breathe well lightest masks. Also, vaccined. Can't care less stares nowadays  didn‚Äôt say vaccines were, vaccinated people could also carry viral load. everything supposed do. lot stopped masking going places have.

But that's changing soon. brought back masks mandatory personnel word streets vax mandatory coming pipe.

Good

I'm tired assholes can't get herd immunity?, settle herd stupidity! Okay, well good - comment replying says 'northeast' reason.

This moronic thing I've seen day.

You've vaccinated? Great. nothing worry covid.

What risk someone shot? vaccinated, risk next zero. vaccinated (by choice) odds bit worse... health responsibility.

And headline trying imply health (or circumstances) vaccinated somehow supposed someone else's responsibility (the unvaccinated) pure fucking stupidity.

Go ahead shit pointing obvious. less right less wrong. 

You guys heading huge fuckup attitude I'll laughing ass that's way things go.

Don't complain happens... told (Aug 1st angry unvaccinated getting way

Oh yeah, anger... that's got great historical track record seeing/solving problems.

I'm looking world return ok life time. That's say joys life, interactions world outside immediate loves, going well. trust Anyone, We've past that. things expect see life time: failure USA democracy. Continued Covid spikes rest life, expect bad climate destabilization. Extreme heat waves bigger fires flooding/ extreme storms. also expect ecosystem collapse bug-armageddon. life time. kid always thought ""the end near"" people dumb... was. now, I'm really losing hope. 

""Don't lives fear, need get back it."" disgusts me. ""Back what? Killing planter school children mads murders every week. fucking crazy? No.""

""No, think understand, I'm playing game all. joy, hopes, dreams, language, wants, even needs same. drive ""consumerist more"" makes stranger me. want free labor makes other. delusion dominion earth makes deadly plague.""

You're wrong perspective article would get back normal sooner antivaxx antimask morons. aligned article arguing pedantic stupid reasons. Israeli Prime Minister stated *‚ÄúWe know exactly degree vaccine helps[vs Delta], significantly less‚Äù* due rise new serious cases among vaccinated people. *""The highest number coronavirus cases nearly four months""*. also affects children mostly unvaccinated need get vaccinated, perhaps updated booster shot late. half population fully vaccinated among everyone *""around 60% patients serious conditions vaccinated. Moreover, according Hebrew University researchers advise government, around 90% newly infected people age 50 fully vaccinated.""* vaccine HELPING, statistics PROVE THAT, also prove Delta Variant taken lightly new vaccine MUST developed combat deadly mutation.  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Nope. good last long.  Fuck religion seen reputable public health official say people certain medical conditions get vaccinated.

You're killing people preventing us returning normalcy, selfish prick. 

Go die let rest us move lives.  Legitimate questions answered long ago legitimate fear covid. hundreds millions years vaccine safety data - scrutinized last dozen vaccines doctor gave never asked questions trusted health experts. Stop listening Russian propaganda.  smoking, seatbelts, etc. People center universe can‚Äôt imagine anything happening them, they‚Äôre ‚Äòspecial‚Äô. Might time get house... opinion simple. People need live lives quit worrying people doing...
If someone wants vaccinated, great. feel safer.
    someone want vaccinated cause scared, great feel safer.
    non vaccinated person gets sick dies, great choice. vaccinated person feel safer.
I vaccinated, plan vaccinated.
If get sick, got sick accord. die.. died way. vaccinated person gets sick non vaccinated person great. vaccine work wasted time and/or money. believe body immune system worked real hard build works real hard me.

People quick let fear rule life. choose rule life positivity fear. positive get past this, positive humans get past this.

   Everyone worried others degrade others disagree with. assault them. Whether verbally physically. 

   Bottom line, you. Keep check. 
I keep self check. worried single one decisions, unless directly effects ones love. people need worry decisions directly effects ones love.
I find weird people stoop low levels hurt someone opinion make break anything long run. 

TLDR: 
    I'm mad either way vaccinated non vaccinated. proud made choice followed through.Right wrong way. Took charge life be. happened meant happen, would ever been. happens next happen meant be. Embrace random life free individual, quit worrying others think do. 

DON'T LIVE FEAR. EMBRACE RANDOM THING CALLED LIFE. live best know how. Try enjoy along way. much better.! 

Cheers, love everyone. Chicago northeast. There‚Äôs doubt. Perhaps one upside delta transmissionable quickly burn hosts aren‚Äôt left ok know doesn‚Äôt solve everything don‚Äôt need insurance get vaccine. You‚Äôre downvoted you‚Äôre wrong. think downvotes proving point. 

Certainly eye opening experience. Fewer infections lead fewer transmissions lead fewer mutations lead fewer variants lead fewer hospital stays. isn‚Äôt difficult‚Ä¶get shot. need faith know incubation period Killing unvaccinated. 99.5% new deaths unvaccinated. 95% new hospitalizations unvaccinated. Vaccinated people get delta variant seem basically get cold. However, vaccinated people generate viral load delta variant unvaccinated, transmit rate (so keep masking minimize transmission).

Covid going anywhere, ever. us established immunity, hopefully new variants colds add immunity, pro-plague crew either die change minds get vaccinated. Yea guess point. Conspiracy theories would lot worse behind closed doors. agree with.
It‚Äôs frustrating either way. Almost 2 years shit. blame politicians mostly &amp; government. Sure, people choosing get vaccinated cause issues, deep down, refusing? bet deep down, it‚Äôs lack trust government.  Maybe, charge insurance set amount administration, insurance cannot charge it. big deal you, lie say uninsured. seen that? would move goal posts well goal reached makes sense segregation vaccinated unvaccinated maybe instance? separate equal blatant discrimination oppression? sure thinks this. listen criminals though. i, however, see scenario get kicked sub fucking troll well first half 2022 Maybe true... def wonder athletes gonna catch covid long covid whatever face long term issues least reduced ability compete sport Dude offense gotta leave Reddit bubble. DeSantis wildly popular among everyone except Reddit Liberals. [Slide I‚Äôm talking breakthrough hospitalizations, breakthrough cases.

I‚Äôm aware CDC tracks breakthrough hospitalizations deaths. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying, that‚Äôs thought talking about. whole conversation whether anecdotes breakthrough hospitalizations mean we‚Äôre going seeing lot bad news future. argument already up-to-date data breakthrough hospitalizations deaths show many them, see surge breakthrough hospitalizations deaths reflected data. doesn‚Äôt get much forthcoming public page data apparently updated regularly. agree tracking breakthrough cases, though. don‚Äôt know they‚Äôre not. Blame government Can't wait guy appear aged like milk couple weeks   honestly like way COVID looking me. Took spiked protein kneecaps    ask doctors follow advice? Since mentioned, probably not.  Less initially thought, yeah. certainly seems pockets. Like, vet office know everyone unvaccinated. Nurses band together vaccinated hospital. 

I'm saying shame via peers work half country vaccinated.

No, never claimed that. throw words mouth. Guaranteed FDA approves going draw recent controversy approval aducanumab (the Alzheimer‚Äôs drug) use excuse say don‚Äôt trust FDA.  already got Covid, laughable 2 days mild coughing. dont need vaccine natural antibodies. live healthy lifestyle, eat well train daily basis. punished treated second grade citizen ? 
 
If feel like vulnerable disease unhealthy lifestyle natural weakness, means save life get vaccine dont shove throat. post purely political removed.  would helpful know percentage breakthrough cases among people screwed immune systems. addition transplant, cancer, HIV etc. patients, seems like drugs advertise tv warn start infection flu, make prone. Please let die start over. Sweet sweet garbled fluid filled apologies sound like music. It‚Äôs tempting.

Homeschooling inherently bad provided parents competent making sure children following good curriculum. homeschooled pre-college education loved it. probably got much better education would I‚Äôd went public school, behavior issues insanity went local schools.

Plus got high school opportunity earn high school credits local community college, WAY better normal high school classes offered.

it makes dumbass unable properly identify threats (or even reality). get chose pay taxes? thousands examples modern society don‚Äôt choice. Stop carving thing could actually save lives.  Right. people definitely haven‚Äôt covid twice already Covid definitely around decades Interesting thing blame nation. There‚Äôs lot don‚Äôt know maybe remember feeling right. make matters worse cdc says vaccinated people also spreading Delta variant. extra fml finished math stuff early next level math 2 months spare. kind fucked History till last month. supplement ""Science"" approved could go counties Exploratorium week, went public bus. 

One thing really enjoyed though, able pick books requirement list instead assigned handful throughout year teacher picked based preference. love sci-fi excited see novels like Enders Game list. 

All said, families house worst dial world gaming consoles. things different probably would wasted ton time struggled pass. stopped Walmart Missouri yesterday, amount obviously sick people walking around coughing shit one cared. I‚Äôve never fast life, I‚Äôll take third shot.   idea somebody could get vaccinated chose infuriating. 

Everybody eligible every opportunity point. Everybody. almost beat left door open behind us. Well helps can't get HIV unless direct fluid thing, either blood transfusion sex.


COVID's little uh.. contagious.


AIDS still scary hell though, death sentence without meds it, say otherwise pure fucking idiocy. Yes Maine looks great. Filthy    Hope you‚Äôre doubling masks you‚Äôre about. county vaccinating 10 people week, they've got what? single postage stamp town?

Like, get numbers might decreasing county, overall uptick state, situation better county. tiny ass population like county, surrounding counties impact what's going town substantially.

There's lots reasons optimism vaccination rates up. sucks took dangerous variant it, turn 3 weeks increasing rates 4 5 6 7, that's really cooking gas. There's lot misinformation this. KN95 asian version N95 standard. 95% particulates 0.3 microns, ""suspends air"" particulate size associated airborne pathogens. use layers spun polypropylene nonwoven polypropylene create filter provides electrostatic filtration. get away 0.3 micron particulate size respirator becomes *more* effective, less. difference standards trivial amount breathability - KN95 needs hint air pressure rate flow. Almost nobody could even tell lose effectiveness wet. replace get moist. sanitized reused another linked CDC approved methods shortage crisis. leave dry days virus particles break down. good supply $0.20 people going bother more. 

N95 masks approved US healthcare regulatory agencies quite lot particular normal people. reason going pay hefty premium N95 possibly might unnecessarily taking supply needed healthcare workers whose heroic work puts greater danger. that.

Anyway, fit far higher concern difference N95 KN95. need masks fit face specifically might try brands models get that. sporting majestic face mane needs come going filtering anything anyway. understand US military shit ton fighting wars, right? Practically every homeschooled person met visibly lacking social skills bunch eccentricities. 

Homeschooling children among stupid things do. Blows mind. spend evenings extra enrichment letting see kids day? mention next step narrative people like saying along: need start living life covid stay. is. mean totally anecdotal -
My sister ICU nurse. several fully vaxxed patients. organ transplant recipients immunosuppressants. Apparently according new data vaccine ineffective population. although they‚Äôre technically vaccinated, work way works general population. I‚Äôm sure lot deaths circumstances like that.  Can't trust communist drugs [archive link anyone trouble accessing article  ""I grave concerns vaccine.""

HERE'S BENJAMIN FRANKLIN 

""Poke me."" think correct earlier prediction going endemic problem. Getting lives won‚Äôt cut dry.

If becomes endemic think things dire long term. endemic means average person's first exposure likely young. we've seen, young people generally severe health consequences. infected level natural immunity. 

There many diseases like this. Chickenpox good example, children annoyance adults quite negative health effects. 

(And even totally ignores vaccines, provide level immunity even without getting initial world doesn‚Äôt sound like getting lives. sounds like recovering disaster.

COVID *is* probably biggest worldwide disaster I've seen lifetime. I'm convinced way thwart maybe earliest stages China. still move forward we've done contain damage. Right, true. Gotta love ignorant. guess ""actual"" mask better different ones others wearing. probably one masses believing virus intelligent attack entering/exiting restaurant masked-up, without mask seated eating drinking. Science ever evolving, long term testing vaccinated still spread let choice live too. link this? saying anyone side effects insane? I'll go ""cesspool"". blame both? Nope, infections community spread. People coming back vacation mainland spreading like wildfire unvaccinated communities. Everyone getting immune one way another. need light switch replaced, call handyman. need electrical panel replaced, call electrician. I‚Äôm sure some, full approval really they‚Äôre waiting for, feel justified waiting happens. position virtue immediately identifiable dismissible insanity like DNA-editing, microchips, whatever else crazy kids cooking daily basis, even though data actual billions vaccinated teeny tiny amounts reactions, even serious, much less harmful fatal, largely undermined ‚Äúfull auth‚Äù position. It‚Äôs still arguably invalid point, arguably one that‚Äôs supported enough anymore continue hang onto. It‚Äôs sticking point raging, mutating, resurgent pandemic. 
 
I think reality though people still claiming waiting full approval now, August 2021, chosen excuse least likely bring grief others require defend position. Last heard, full approval still solid couple months away. (taking figure) 34% unvaccinated get upon full approval, I‚Äôll eat hat. It‚Äôs far likely opinion never intended get vaccinated, they‚Äôll switch next-least-controversial excuse available then.
 
I read story Reddit 38-year-old father five died covid, leading wife immediately setting gofundme due poor husband/father ‚Äútaken them‚Äù, claimed couple decided they‚Äôd give vaccine year (presumably initial use, dates involved) watch issues reevaluating it. me, reads like complete horseshit excuse two people weren‚Äôt even committing get arbitrary year observation (falls far short ‚Äúwill get fully approved‚Äù), smacks of: I‚Äôm energized enough get daily people it‚Äôs poison, conspiracy hoax, etc etc etc, even though real positions, I‚Äôll say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm giving year ‚Äòwait see‚Äô decide then‚Äù keep people backs. worse, best surviving wife sole parent five kids could pull ass short notice wouldn‚Äôt undermine gofundme. ‚ÄúAngry‚Äù understatement, referring people ‚Äúunvaccinated‚Äù nice. prefer call straight morons. forced chose. Forced scared decided businesses lives matter shut taking away taking away cars, food, silly things like that.

Now scared want matter last year get shot ""protect"" year. Good luck that. surcharging health insurance many gay men, thought vaccine made invincible

i've seen enough guys gay tinder wearing ""moderna pfizer johnson &amp; johnson"" shirts confirm No, time. parents blood clotting disorders make inclined towards clots I‚Äôm also woman 50. kids young vaccinated stay home, husband works home, I‚Äôm low risk getting least. There's people get tested leqst per week without symptoms, without sense me. people spread it, less likely so

We literally know large ones winding hospitals morgues.

Yes, still contribute potentially propagating mutations getting public health crisis, think we‚Äôre blaming right people.

I agree, we're focusing solely unvaxxed totally ignoring irresponsibly acting vaxxed lack government enforcement enough. unvaxxed discussed considering worst day pre post vax, there's play people simply getting shot (which people take, obviously).

Some cases asymptomatic, involved mild moderate symptoms two required hospitalization, officials said. infections determined Delta-related samples San Francisco tested variant, dominant city.

About 75 80 percent 50 staff members infected Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital fully vaccinated, Dr. Lukejohn Day, hospital‚Äôs chief medical officer, said interview Saturday. University California, San Francisco Medical Center said statement issued Friday 153 183 infected staff members fully vaccinated.

The statement U.C.S.F. Medical Center said two infected staff members required hospitalization. None infected staff members San Francisco General hospitalized mild moderate symptoms, Dr. Day said. asymptomatic cases discovered contact tracing.

Without vaccinations, Dr. Day said, hospitalization rate would much worse.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre concerned right we‚Äôre rise surge San Francisco Bay Area,‚Äù Dr. Day said. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre seeing much data vaccines showed us: still get Covid, potentially. get it, it‚Äôs severe all.‚Äù

That's stats work friend. vaccinated roommate tested positive last Sunday. hasn‚Äôt symptoms last day half aside taste smell slowly coming back today. masked sticking rooms since positive results, technically good longer wear masks common areas since symptoms gone 24 hours? discredit everyone's story ignore links provided stories, sure lolla thread filled bitter shut ins lmfao. dare least risk highly likely vaccinated enjoy lives amirite hope doesn‚Äôt take long It‚Äôs device works expect least peddle straight misinformation.

I would! Looking map, somehow think that's meant said ""the South rise again!""  That‚Äôs also approx rate film/tv productions (are?) testing US (at least union productions following rules). Chilling. Given close census was, states particular, recount Senate/House seats? Less likely 70% eligible people vaccinated. stop 80% Yeah one died, people got really sick outbreak seems mostly now. go: recent evidence one vaccination infection provides significantly protection (in terms antibodies) two vaccinations uninfected people, countries Israel, Germany Spain give one shot ineffective people. I‚Äôm ER nurse 20 years experience. resigned weeks ago. 8 1 patient ratio spike hasn‚Äôt even hit us yet. hospital DGAF hammers us BS metrics. I‚Äôm done. Fuck it. None matter issue vaccine inequity solved. matter many boosters get, virus free mutate places get enough vaccines gonna come back even worse. 

Instead boosters, rich nations instead buy current future stock allow low middle income nations get chance getting populations vaccinated.

The way stop variants appearing vaccinate enough people across world.   claim bogus then. Nobody Yep. I‚Äôve thinking too. current situation US happened smallpox polio illness we‚Äôd screwed 100 fold already currently are. Thanks antivaxxers, misinformation spreaders, generally selfish people üò° ones Hospital now. Gotlieb might reporting Virginia CDC getting information that's analyzed breakthrough cases Mass. led change mask recommendations.

Meaning, majority people Mass. function vaccinated large portion tested positive. Implying vaxxed transmit virus others. say ‚Äúwith than‚Äù headline can‚Äôt also round up. Doesn‚Äôt work way. Plus rounding we‚Äôre talking numbers actually represent human lives like it‚Äôs generally bad idea, either go ‚Äúmore than‚Äù round like example give actual number. insane. Straight dystopian movie. back say everyone mask again.

They're saying everyone to, they're recommending areas high transmission. numbers. [Here‚Äôs one place. I‚Äôm sure cases, hospitalizations deaths overwhelmingly unvaccinated people.  equates 1 992 known residents one day. sub fucked up. think Classic Corona that's definitely true decent amount protection (though might like 10 days), though seem recall something Delta Corona generally causing much problems people one shot? Still going protection ofc may relatively minimal (as opposed Classic Corona iirc something like 80%). happened Ireland yet (and near identical fully vaxed rate UK), though cases mostly plateaued past month even though pretty much everything open near 100% delta. Coded bias‚Ä¶. Everywhere.  Insurance cover mistakes preventable, mistakes illegal negligent.

If cut tree yard forget validate may fall, insurance still bail falls home. wreck care due drunk driving, insurance refuse pay. 

I'm agreement everyone deserves health care. also believe needs social program. issues folk whol want take take take, refuse give. know people are. so-called ""welfare queens"" folks dying Delta refusing science.
 

Anyone gets COVID pay pay currently. Biden even extended disability laws cover results COVID. 

The lung cancer thing issues own. know tumor caused smoking sure? iif smoking told everyone causes cancer?  Social medicine could cover cost helping someone cut habit. I'd love see something like that. would kids would watch struggle. Every day reminded stupid decision caused this. Later, kids would hate getting vaccinated. Whatever problem thought vaccines would cause would seem pretty irrelevant then. Keep sharing story. Tons people believe vaccine 100% protect absolutely refuse masks claim ""I got vaccine, I'm done."" shame stories like heard often. I'm sorry loss. Covid incredibly dangerous unpredictable :( getting vaccinated patients hospitals now.

We point ""live virus"" stands.

I miss concerts myself, even vaccine n95 I'm risking long covid. Take jab, take jab. really care, really think segregation society solution. 

What people covid? need jab too? need jab already covid? 

In USA 80% covid patient hospitalized overweight. ban people BMI 25 go case catch virus? ban eating junk food? 

I think solution, society need learn live it. calculated risk everything life. 

I think risk put individual, scare catching virus chance survival 99% 60, right stay home. appears imply Delta can't stopped vaccines work well enough prevent infections both. curious see would take schools go online again. hope doesn‚Äôt happen, awful students. wait? please. Makes sense talking number cases large majority vaccinated serious symptoms.

Abstract

Background
Following full re-opening schools England emergence SARS-CoV-2 Alpha variant, investigated risk SARS-CoV-2 infection students staff contacts confirmed case school bubble (school groupings limited interactions), along household members.

Methods
Primary secondary school bubbles recruited sKIDsBUBBLE sent home self-isolate following confirmed case COVID-19 bubble. Bubble participants household members sent home-testing kits comprising nasal swabs RT-PCR testing whole genome sequencing, oral fluid swabs SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

Results
During November-December 2020, 14 bubbles recruited 7 schools, including 269 bubble contacts (248 students, 21 staff) 823 household contacts (524 adults, 299 children). secondary attack rate 10.0% (6/60) primary 3.9% (4/102) secondary school students, compared 6.3% (1/16) 0% (0/1) among staff, respectively. incidence rate household contacts primary school students 6.6% (12/183) 3.7% (1/27) household contacts primary school staff. secondary schools, 3.5% (11/317) 0% (0/1), respectively. Household contacts likely test positive bubble contact tested positive although new infections among household contacts uninfected bubble contacts.

Interpretation
Compared institutional settings, overall risk secondary infection school bubbles household contacts low. findings important developing evidence-based infection prevention guidelines educational settings.

Why AP rounding headlines?


If Florida says 21,693 could probably round up.  work free? journalists? That‚Äôs one reason always post archive link. honest, heard last year people going door door pretending CDC giving covid tests robbing house, I'm surprised people wary. need whip pistol around though. Wait D√ºsseldorf back Inzidenzstufe 1? eating outside? Last time checked still Stufe 2 sure shocking. long Australia going for? patient better driver people going realize two outcomes illness? laid bed sick dog pneumonia long term loss 2 5 senses isn‚Äôt death I‚Äôd much rather get shot and/or wear mask. OBGYN associations going recommend masks? annual yesterday OBGYN one nurse mask. patient mask. doctor mask told policy needs change. believe work pregnant new moms people general health care provider wear masks. Lockdowns quite harsh temporary. alternative much harsher. I'll take staying home days / weeks hospital system overwhelmed

Last year Melbourne reduced Covid zero 700 cases day. We've almost beaten delta second time. act fast lockdown get back Covid normal highly vaxxed countries showing numbers. See Portugal course numbers estimated 1/5 actuals.  teenagers getting vaccinated school, thay brief mask chance caught small. likely psychosomatic genuinely worried try get tested Unlikely. They‚Äôre ready spit face call liar you‚Äôre trying save life. can‚Äôt imagine restraint need punch face quit together.  think homeschooling denies socialization lol

Y‚Äôall idea you‚Äôre talking about. Personally I'm probably going living rest life quarantine guys go nuts! I‚Äôm much angry anymore, ambivalent. zero fucks give people choose get vaccinated get sick die. sympathy children don‚Äôt choice matter, adults waste space resources opinion. I‚Äôm Jacksonville family keeps harassing come visit. Even though I‚Äôm vaccinated, seeing shit like makes want go anywhere near place. fear may another couple years see family. It‚Äôs deep bro large defense contractor work going back masks required regardless vaccination status US sites, Monday. I'm sure go well! 1. Source.

2. background qualifies make assessments? field Ph.D. ‚Ä¶or one (at least relevant field). think it‚Äôs Reddit. read around 70% US users Reddit male Lol, yeah, sure, like I‚Äôve never thought one before. also mentioned surgery. broken thumb thing show little fuck give unvaxd. Everyone else given priority I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôm tired. comes anti vaxxers, I‚Äôm indifferent them. don‚Äôt care live die. care they‚Äôll clog healthcare resources, there‚Äôs reasonable way mitigate that.

I‚Äôm hoping delta surge relatively short, hope pushes folks towards getting vaxxed, I‚Äôm holding breath. might surprised find Israel finding significant long Covid ~20% breakthroughs. However there‚Äôs nothing really published asymptomatic risk factors they‚Äôre finding. Happy read anything else anybody Thirty-one percent infected workers reported persistent symptoms 14 days diagnosis, 19% reported ""long COVID"" symptoms loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, shortness breath, muscle pain 6 weeks. None hospitalized. 23% workers took leave absence work mandatory 10-day quarantine, four returned work within 2 weeks, one still returned 6 Covid: Builds better variant.

Science: Builds better vaccine.

Humanity: Builds better idiot. Checkmate bitches. know think US center universe global issue. It‚Äôs going around matter holdouts US. Gtfo  ok buddy That's problem. chucklefucks capable logical thinking, also one reasons seem think know medicak science.  feel bad told close friend contact anymore he‚Äôs vaccinated. 

When objected saying wanted wait better vaccines available hung blocked number. 

Dude wedding. I'm wearing mask, despite second shot, protect kids can't get vaccinated yet.

Meanwhile see tourists town grocery store without masks multiple kids. US, keep chin socially distance. put back can't. Lmao cares. open regardless. 99.8% survival rate. Let natural selection take care needs to.  This. work Agriculture didn‚Äôt miss single day work; keeping food supply moving safe. vaccine tier opened time stay home teachers couldn‚Äôt get vaccine appointment month. putting risk everyday. I. Was. Angry. even vaccination, COVID wasn‚Äôt deadly people 65. successful vaccination program risk population case continued restrictions isn‚Äôt great outside big liberal cities. 

Also, generic congressional ballot like D+4 days found 2020 elections - polls post Obama era overstate Democratic support. cruel. 

For once, governor made maybe going school would death sentence child people boat. It‚Äôs unfair. never said wash mask. leave sitting day (in clean container) decontaminate (I mean, course, Covid yard, sanding drywall construction)

Yes eventually ""go flat"" replace it. Nobody talking feel like real danger here. hospitals full sudden longer access health care need Yeah housing market crazy right now, think we're well due dip. easier short I'd seriously consider FYI number way off. [We‚Äôve spent around $123bn per year Obviously it‚Äôs insane it‚Äôs $500bn Iraq alone. I'm tired angry. Tangry. NP school people refuse vaccine, believe killing people, think Delta big deal.

Wow yeah makes sense, I'm glad least place live hope things get better pandemic son safer. thank reply. Pakistan huge population, maybe lucky 2020 large rural populstion similar Uruguay. tests even free there? Probably not. guess we'll find out, we? attorney general already investigation wasting tons taxpayer money sue states election results. doubt trusted behave sane respectable manner lawsuit.  two specifically? Yep. unfortunately, unvaccinated people confusing direction anger believe aimed government. bet Indonesia office policy you‚Äôre fully vaccinated, don‚Äôt need mask ask aren‚Äôt vaccinated, ask wear one. Around time first wave vaccines issued, one coworkers stated didn‚Äôt trust ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre gonna get cancer 5-10 years road, won‚Äôt get it‚Äù.

Guess work closely wear mask. 

Now guess severe cough, doesn‚Äôt cover mouth coughing, infected family ‚Äúthe flu‚Äù, office Friday 7/30. 

I‚Äôm good (so far), fully vaccinated, still wearing masks, stripping garage going inside, taking hot showers wiping down/cleaning every surface touched. I‚Äôm paranoid bringing wife, immunocompromised, kid. wish office would allow us choose either work office, home, hybrid two. There‚Äôs many people around honoring policy, wearing mask improperly. difference is, jeopardizing anyone's health. literally much conspiracy theorist anti vaxer big dog. Mask Mandates Lockdown. Sure half country Vac. still leaves 150+mil people Delta+ strong Pifizer's vac 39% prevention rating. Sooo... 250mil people risk.

It might even worst Since people going summer... Remember Summer! Winter going kill us. expect 400k cases maybe months even surpass old record. there‚Äôs much misinformation aimed latino black voters it‚Äôs something else. look up. know cubans liberal voters right getting spammed antivaxx propaganda. didn't. people protested Polio vaccine Spanish Flu masks lockdowns. Pandemic want it. think preserved internment camps used 1940s Japanese Americans. I'm sure use those! Dr. Fauci recently say vaccinated require masks?

I see social distancing even capacity limits returning. Don‚Äôt bother. can‚Äôt help willfully ignorant. need unfortunate job making what‚Äôs right force. agree completely. They've even said asymptomatic vaccinated individuals could still carry viral load unvaccinated individual. personally know one person received J&amp;J vaccine couple months ago currently quarantining testing positive COVID. Thankfully, symptoms mild. But, need tracking cases, severe otherwise, get better idea efficacy vaccines (especially depending long since person vaccinated). seems CDC ignoring cases, they're missing valuable research current vaccines could make difference future. Look

Basically I'm gonna

get vaccine

I know.... UGH know.....

I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It's that

I'm getting all

&amp;#x200B;

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Don‚Äôt listen hot garbage. I‚Äôm getting vaccinated, ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù 1% force back long commutes, office don‚Äôt want in, pay house never get live in. thanks, I‚Äôm vaccinated perfectly fine ‚Äúun-normalcy.‚Äù maybe stop fucking morons? It‚Äôs really hard.   went extremely rare, rare, 74% cases outbreak vaccinated within margins expected vaccine work. That's complete nonsense, vaccine supposed eradicate virus hence CDC lifted restrictions vaccinated. messaging, ""science."" 

&amp;#x200B;

And they're walking back moving goalposts. Vaccinated cases OVERREPRESENTED outbreak. inclination CDC knows, behind closed doors, vaccine really anything stop spread full damage control mode. Think drastically narrative shifted beginning week now. think we're possibly fucked either way. virus evolve evade vaccine immunity 100% vaccinated population. Slower sure, eventually evolve spread. 

The issue argument could evolve less damaging acts less like disease like disease class like flu. could keep popping variants quick yeets omega strain screws us all. making sense. Fewer cases means LESS likely mutate.  actually worry hatred antivax rhetoric escalting. family seems genetically passed hyper active immune system trait somehow, quite (not myself) people fam cannot get vaccine (all vaccines near lethal them), brother nearly lost kidneys grade school mistakenly given flu shot.. hes encountered atleast 1 person far got right pissy, refused believe didnt shot, literally tried go job it.

I think dumbfucks much anyone, please forget people CANT get vaccinated. reason rest us should. Cruises aren‚Äôt cruises without viral outbreaks, Covid-19, norovirus, something else. understanding, misinterpreting simulation think results agree sokaydough said. understanding effects vaccines mutations article: vaccines produce resistant strains - resistant strains time pop midst medium rates vaccination. time happening vaccines even available. need feel guilty first hundred thousand deaths least, except insofar refused wear mask distance. Thanks article, interesting read. Worth noting end, stated still unknowns. current data shows little risk break-through long-haul effects, ""I think trends going really going start bearing next six months,"" Al-Aly acknowledged possibility. ""It possible road may discover maybe vaccine delayed inevitable,"" said. mean, insurer paying pregnancy delivery care also, hit 8 months pregnancy, popped ‚Äúobese‚Äù category spend whole year weight checks talking someone month fruits vegetables, order lose cheaper coverage. make life hassle really want to. I‚Äôd imagine they‚Äôd want unvaccinated people. Well, tests still costfree strong pressure yet like France gwt vaccinated. success giving sausages getting vaccinated. Unfortunately we're Florida. Elective surgeries canceled hospitals diversion state.

I'm agreement, though. sympathy medically can't take vaccine, children 12 inevitably impacted thousands anti-vaxxers taking hospital meds. Covid delta now; everything else gone countries. 

A booster shot harmless would improve sterilizing immunity. Moderna seem better limited data have, though unclear whether that's bigger side interval dose bigger. 

Your health measurable risk though. point sterilizing immunity would play basketball without spreading covid, though - make safer make sure friends vaccinated.  Eat ass Oh believe want to. Especially entire family comes in, kids too, symptoms unvaccinated. Israel herd immunity delta still continues spread there. Variants formed places world minimal vaccinations. Maybe focusing sending vaccines since vast majority globe access vaccine. think point tbh. doomed start w shit due social media algorithms sensationalize everything polarize every position now. Shit wasn‚Äôt even bad 5 years ago.

 since it‚Äôs viewed ‚Äòboomer take‚Äô w ‚Äò social media bad‚Äô colossal companies get away w raping brains relationships get astronomically rich blur lines truth falsehood Exactly. can. don‚Äôt Western countries present

Seems mainly problem US, places like UK, France, Germany already making vaccine passports actual policy. Anyone angry high risk people put risk clogged hospitals incidentally causing lot cancer go undiagnosed? vaccines introduced two particular diseases, cases high outbreaks frequent. Yet resistant variant managed emerge. bother could roll new variant version FDA approval comes through? large selling point going route. understand suggestion Pfizer, seems inefficient technology specifically allows updates. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Again, ignoring reality situation. Okay. world, parents actually gave two shits COVID, sent children roam free county fair week mask. I‚Äôm wrong. LOL Thanks sharing situation. couple friends FB also symptomatic breakthrough cases, really feel like game changed summer‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs especially important info us unvaccinated kids home ‚òπÔ∏è taking long get everyone page. fight bicker masks vaccines (why?), virus mutates gets stronger. vaccine still effective Delta. effective, still effective.  live Paris, find characterization French people completely inaccurate. Every day happened, every person recovers dies gets vaccinated, gets slightly less likely.  never gonna happen would like see alliance willing states federal government sort issue out. Basically, establish bubble states subject sensible covid measures full support federal government enforcing measures. would also travel restrictions travelling states outside bubble, quarantines, testing etc. think Delta seems pretty consistent pattern far. happened UK looks really similar happened multiple regions India, lower peak (hopefully much higher level vaccination). I'll curious see Florida starts dropping like rock next week two, pattern holds, hopefully should. Mutations guaranteed dispiriting seeing many headlines vaccinated people creating them, helps feed idea vaccinations pointless. reporting this, likely next mutations countries low vaccination rates? Indonesia example? already seeing circulating anti vaxx groups, pick choose believe MSM. please stop political BS?

They pandering base votes basically. could care less people die. Ironically, thousands people dying state, going remove lot voters base. 

I put blame outlets like Fox News anti-vaxx grifters infected social media. morons ones touting ideas first place Right grabbing to. plenty anti-vaxx people left well clear. Delta preventable. remedy getting shot isn‚Äôt cure, vaccine. ‚Äòcan‚Äô lessen affects something better comes actual vaccine like get measles polo boosters born protect choose protect themselves? still much disinformation around non-English speaking world? aren‚Äôt people propagating false information caught made stop? experience change view covid vaccination? fault choosing honor system instead vaccine passports. answer problem consequences un-vaccinated, giving freedoms without proof. Getting vaccinated longer herd immunity delta. Herd immunity seems become unobtainable. Getting vaccinated protecting oneself now. zero empathy unvaccinated. didn‚Äôt give fuck pre vaccine refused follow mitigation guidance contributing problem serving breeding grounds new variants. 

I‚Äôm fucking done. get sick want to. I‚Äôll take running nose mask free. Thanks. Username check Exactly. wear mask public never issue me, it‚Äôs restrictions came along it. I‚Äôm outdoor dining December missing holidays loved ones again. Some??? bout vaccinated Americans? spouse Tysabri every 28 days, got vax April fine. hope MS meds also unaffected. great relief Hell no. that's insanity.  article reads exactly like tabloid. 

The media bias chart agrees‚Ä¶ right leaning &amp; high quality. Take look chart &amp; try selective read. generally read higher quality content, you‚Äôll soon recognize easily you‚Äôre reading tabloid trash purposefully misleads &amp; distorts.  Checked profile, talks move childhood Germany. Germany pretty safe guess. Private businesses right make decisions already happening.

But guess First Ammendment applies jackass anti vaxxers, huh? Flat no. That‚Äôs argument anti -vax anti-mask crowds making. It‚Äôs binary system. vaccines, masks. shutdowns. New cars airbags, crumple zones, automatic braking, automatic warning systems, probably safety mechanisms missing, yet still recommended wear seatbelts. *And law requires it*.

I don‚Äôt want wear mask shut next person. people don‚Äôt *want* it, sane ones recognize burden outweighed potential loss life, see happening every day. people don‚Äôt need see someone‚Äôs hand get blown know holding firecracker detonates bad idea. fact people can‚Äôt figure virus point disheartening. 

If don‚Äôt mandate vaccines, probably even point, going two soon. kids start falling schools outbreaks start occurring homes students, people going lose minds. I‚Äôm estimating six weeks that, plus minus. im advocating people want thing is, going declare war on?

Those trying impose authoritarian measures restrictions wasn‚Äôt right word choice, sorry. said instead insurance companies jack rates hundred fold.

Ah, basically thing banned. I‚Äôve following Dr. Angela Rasmussen here‚Äôs part take: 
Immune system dynamic. cells cross responsive. Therefore it‚Äôs unlikely. Yea, CDC fucked messaging that's sure. Recent data shows vaccinated individual gets infected, may shed much virus unvaccinated individual. antivaxers seem want go back good old times fact remains people moral fibre previous generations. last second genuine adversity. understand completely. get sick, want vaccine‚Ä¶ 

as long doesn‚Äôt affect them, it‚Äôs fear. don‚Äôt see danger doesn‚Äôt exist. Exactly. discovered India. can‚Äôt get vaccines everyone variants form. Last heard Africa 1% vaccinated‚Ä¶ even every American got vaccine, would still ample humans without access vaccines create new strain makes vaccines less effective preventing spread. 

And there‚Äôs animals contract covid spread back humans like case mink. really hope doesn‚Äôt spread chicken, cows, pigs otherwise could see even variants unless vaccinate literally billions farm animals seems super unlikely. think ‚Äúpicky‚Äù news sources relied mostly articles shared friends Facebook‚Ä¶ stop acting like social distancing big deal? agree masks vaccines big deal. social distancing causes isolation lead depression, suicidal thoughts, uptick substance abuse. Makes people sacrifice seeing loved ones. Social distancing devastating impact businesses jobs (such concerts, event jobs etc) hate people minimize devastating impacts social distancing act like people babies wanting it.

Vaccinated people never forced experience covid, confirm IQ depletion üëçsadly particular strain. one rise. truly difficult teach them. know worse, Zoom see faces (and see mine) we're person, person they're wearing masks can't read facial non-verbal body language see they're understanding I'm teaching. realize much depended non-verbal cues read students huge frustration tool teacher-toolkit. seeing face - I've cut back jokes/sarcasm can't see facial expression know said joke. Plus always feel like I'm shouting get voice mask back classroom. 

I'm wearing I'm part solution part problem, damn tired them. threshold increased vaccinations though, natural immunity well - it'll probably look weird end, spike - fall, combination immunizations reach closer 85%  right individuals choose want live. want wear one, it. can‚Äôt force others too. fair, actually vaccinated 85% Americans, would back normal.

The whole reason we're issues right half Americans getting vaccine.  can't even count number times I've ""slips, trips, falls"" training. Ill give addresses right now, let's saddle horses. bring jerky ammo. that‚Äôs fine can‚Äôt YouTube say specifically got banned for. Seems like simple step bad , mostly agree with. u want shortsighted go ahead tho Allergies thing still. Also, nose runs lot time temperature shifts.  people writing pandemic year half now. learned basic probability journalistic malpractice. Anti-vaxx mentality can't last forever.

Eventually horrific pandemic fatality rate around 40-80% come around end anti-vaxxers. actions don‚Äôt matter many others won‚Äôt pitch help out, bother?

Well that‚Äôs thing, actions still matter. you‚Äôre unknowingly spreading virus tomorrow, decision chill home go bar might real repercussions. You‚Äôll probably never see never know happened either way, everybody caught caught someone, you‚Äôre someone. 

The way think it, I‚Äôm vaccinated, numbers aren‚Äôt bad right now, probably run around whatever want, world *probably* problem is. love going bar miss it, means I‚Äôm one less link chain infections, I‚Äôm willing take loss. wearing mask great, cost/benefit angle assumes people aren‚Äôt exist, makes sense wear one. Honestly, glad we‚Äôre convo it‚Äôs important. 
With said, never said one group spread covid other, statement made true‚Ä¶covid spread vax/unvaxed‚Äîto degree wasn‚Äôt point making‚Ä¶it‚Äôs good added input links namaste that. actually didn‚Äôt know vaccinated individuals could spread covid (breakthrough not) EASILY unvaccinated‚Ä¶at all, fact equal (breakthrough cases, said) mind blowing worse imagined. mask mandates sure. Ideally could done testing front. Ensuring employees people work home work home neglected easy win find pandemic. Selfish fuck. making shit convenient you.  might able get jab US

You could definitely get shot day landed here, question. thing is, going declare war on?

Its matter time. Major businesses already starting require vaccine.

The insurance companies going start penalizing get vaccinated sooner later. should.

This exactly like smoking, incurs higher premiums. bad health choice made sooner later likely going create tens hundreds thousands medical expenses.

Raising premiums cover expenses part making rest premiums raised cover them.

At end day, anti vaxxers cause premiums go dramatically. question just, people created problem pay us?

Banned wasn‚Äôt right word choice, sorry. said instead insurance companies jack rates hundred fold. said idiotic. Sky News cancer Australia uses fear manipulation generate revenue divide country further

Let's hope slippery slope kills toxic channels  one missing that, Florida (where I‚Äôm from) filled mostly idiots, place Florida from, everyone supports dumbass. Masks work get overwhelming majority people wear them, protect others hardly protect yourself. kids refuse wear masks simply don‚Äôt want wear them. Maybe 2 kids class wear one 23 kids sure hell don‚Äôt care. really disingenuous take. First all, people pointing vaccines miraculous technology prevailing coverage suggested ""anti-vaxxers."" good purpose served letting gigantic misconceptions persist.

Uh, clear, you‚Äôre comparing people shooting people asking wear mask people going concerts, unvaccinated person might also chosen go? Really? ICU physician taking care asshats. patience.  59? follow news, assume say covid risky 65+, 64 year old fine much lower risk?  hear you, either send child daycare unvaccinated kids staff (no daycares area confirm staff vaccination rates, none 100%), let stay unvaccinated grandma least wearing mask went staying stores restaurants. Grandma likely got infected recent doctors appointment.

Parents facing difficult choices, thought grandma would safer daycare, though obviously safe. admit, certainly one assume vaccinated antivax.

Though exposure trolling Antivaxxers pretty high. guys horrible people. sad world live now. true. Live here.  mutation might able evade vaccine induced antibodies, evading cd8 t-cells less likely. I‚Äôm expert. So, understanding basic. Killer t-cells recognize virus broader scope. changes spike might make antibodies less effective, would escape memory t-cell response. 

You would still infected, infected cells cleared rapidly, resulting less severe disease. way viruses like influenza coronaviruses don‚Äôt kill effectively. aren‚Äôt new immune system anymore. buy diy blood transfusion kits eBay, give kid pint blood get em immune cold. Started noticing Friday night work, busy bar. left soon felt symptoms, got tested next day Covid. Negative. freaky anytime get sniffles call work fear I'm going downfall whole jobsite. Stinks gave unvaccinated/pandemic 14% 20s. give another fraction value lives lives countrymen women. It‚Äôll never happen, give idea. Presenting vaccination card eat restaurant? see baseball game? Won‚Äôt happen. doesn‚Äôt really address said ok History nit kind Deena Hinshaw Sydney, Australian city 5MM people, reported 239 new COVID cases yesterday.

Compare Florida, state 22MM, reported 21,683 new COVID cases yesterday.

You simply cannot compare community spread Australia parts US. mean, multiple countries German primary first language. insane, US, realistically ever 2 4 months away totally eradicating Covid just

1. Kept flight quarantine protocols, regional travel flareups

2. Lockdown people actually it. People keeping strict 

3. Masks, hand-washing, Distancing,

4. Proper testing, tracing, good app proactive contact tracing.

5. Essential workers, reasonable lockdown salary substitution businesses needed it, home working delivery economy.

I modelling quickly US could removed virus New Zealand, Australia early on, Singapore, countries did, almost always 3 5 weeks lockdown get controlled bit flexibility flare ups.

Its insane anger civic selfishness reason even exists. fair people fighting masks vaccines following old president told do. heard guy denier. Caught Covid. Ask doctor one Miracle drugs work denied. Got sicker went store bought oxygen meter. Man got hospitalized that. want go want put vent. idiots people mask members hospitals continued wear personal protective equipment, Dr. Day said. **the number staff infections reported July many peak winter surge. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nervous could potentially exceed it,‚Äù Dr. Day said.**

I thought pretty clear. number staff infections reduced, fact looks like increased. Rather 3rd dose, vaccinate remaining eligible population making mandatory? think Israel already version vaccine passports maybe need stricter. would surprised lot doctors fired refusing take vaccine. case, would negligible regards number doctors unable work get COVID passing patient vaccination mandatory. 
Anyway, doctors refusing take vaccine late pandemic unfit work medical field.

Further, found even measles virus mutate extraordinarily escape neutralizing antibodies blood vaccinated person, resulting strain could cause disease.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt case current endemic Coronaviruses SARS-Cov-2. spike proteins endemic Coronaviruses take ~10 years evolve complete antigenic drift escape antibody immunity earlier variants.

This statistic misleading frankly nearly useless. need look vaccinated deaths compared vaccinated exposure. Comparing half country stupid unhelpful reeks agenda driven fact-finding. 
 
This people early pandemic people died, they'd say ""well 330 million Americans that's .003%! cares that's less deaths annual flu!"" 
 
you remember that? deaths surpassed annual flu deaths, come bullshit talking point. [They definitely claimed based actual medical experts claiming they‚Äôve made decision based science, several scientific sources cited favor claim, people really expected argue them? I‚Äôm saying blindly believe everything CDC anyone says, seems unfair say people following CDC‚Äôs purportedly science-based guidance (complete citations multiple studies) result populace generally lacking ‚Äúelementary understanding high school level science‚Äù. (I‚Äôm going argue Americans generally great grasp science overall, particular case, make sense cite scientific illiteracy reason people listened CDC.) vaccinated person spread it, much, much less likely. Thanks. 

It's shame report data make useful. example, 95% attendees vaccinated 75% infected were, would big success. saying that's case, can't tell.

Also useful statistic would many hospitalized vaccinated vs unvaccinated. 

What saying comment three-quarters vaccinated? I'm sure understand point. conclusion numbers necessarily true statement. raw number 99 cases fully vaccinated population that‚Äôs nearly 3x much non-vaccinated (265k v 609k). mean antibodies decrease within months getting jab? still sufficient enough protected severe Covid long run?

Two months ago zero cases. Maybe people fed hypocrisy people trying tell do‚Ä¶. people put planet waste space. Sucks do. ""false information"" vaccines new problem, new phenomenon. What's missing countered medical scientists previously? brought vaccine sceptics side, caused change minds? course worried people working retail even understand rules applies corporate staff. 

Looking US outside companies gets hailed ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù forces mask vaccine mandates still making sure employees easily get vaccine paid time making sure cover side effects mental view. really smart pr move. don‚Äôt think could measure delta variant. many variables. People never made past highschool, hippies, Trumpist Conservatives lazy people. Yup.. I'm wondering they're getting information.    "".99 percent people since February 2020 died unvaccinated""....isn't impressive really.  I'd like see stars June July...when high levels vaccination. Serves fucking right. hope fucks real good. We've tried everything willing go far beat shit it. Negative empathy points stage.  Alright, claiming saying ""vaccines work way this"" misinformation? words claiming vaccines work, right? CDC governmental organization such, heavily influenced politics.

Them saying OK unmask obviously motivated science. Maybe thought promise unmasking would encourage people hurry get vaccinated. maybe wanted score early political points new administration. knows?

But clearly demonstrates ill equipped general American population terms elemental understanding high school level science. something Astronomer [Carl warned back mid 90s.

""We live society exquisitely dependent science technology, hardly anyone knows anything science technology.""

Los Angeles County, example, mobile clinics in-home jabs ... ... still struggle reach willing. sure weekend/evening clinics widely available there. Larger efforts, enhanced publicity and, likely, better funding, musts. global pandemic, requires federal assistance. Piecemealing everything prolongs pandemic. Disinformation basically intentional lie made facts. Misinformation information either flat false *not* intentional, otherwise accurate misleading. hospital work scheduled hand washing refresher attend. I‚Äôm responsible, vaccinated, health care provider. don‚Äôt need refresher wash hands. need, people get vaccinated! pandemic started 22. feels like early 20s wasting away think Germans would familiar enough system know obviously mean testing would simply take normal tests realizing they're free.

That's stupid governments make rules god damn complicated either million exceptions changes every weeks. 


I really get what's complicated. never take BS body. Yeah work international company that's household name gave us 4 hours pay, taxes around 130. flat number feels better tbh Alberta rolling back protections delta rises? seems dangerous  feel seen.

You're absolutely right... mental effects result pandemic? That's human mind adapting environment. I'm saying kids hide matresses interact people 20 years. I'm saying going virtual one year vaccines win spike protein arms race probably sensible sending kids fucking full classrooms mask mandate, 6th grade 0% vaccination rates. Fuck- least provide damn option rather forcing person. 

Imagine immunocompromised adult 5th grader Texas Florida. Even vaccinated... really bad spot kid. pull kid homeschool... afford it. send kid school *and pray*... good chance going get fucked kid brings home. kid die... kid lost parent probably feels guilty (even though shouldn't). kid dies? kid dead parent grieves probably feels guilty what...

I'm trying say- enough say ""but teh kids nEeD sOcIaL iNtErActiOnS!"" conversation stopper. need functioning lungs too. parents alive would really great too. Give family's chance choose challenges tackle- impose system wants ""gO bAcK NoRmAl personal responsibility muh freedoms murica!"" get fuckheads like gov TX make malicious laws prevent local governments enacting public health laws. beyond fucked. sit right small group selfish, ignorant narcisistic apes still completely ruin everyone else, perhaps americans would better rip-the-bandaid-off approach real question is:

Where stand vaccinations, Totino‚Äôs Pizza Rolls? 

The world dying know long able stop bodies attacking things another relic past know dude don‚Äôt listen pseudo-intellectual dumbass clearly think he‚Äôs expert topic.

That's frightening much, see people COPD wearing masks, person portable oxygen masks needs throw garbage wears mask even face shield. healthy adults bitching wearing facemasks. ""Young people make biggest group newly hospitalized"" because, according article itself, fewer vaccinated elderly. makes ""more"" illusion. would expect see too. Imagine stable rate hospitalizations young old, imagine old start getting jabs. Suddenly hospitalizations would fall old, young people would keep coming rate, would lead point article making: ""Young people make biggest group newly hospitalized."" It‚Äôs still interesting least.

It's stupid governments make rules god damn complicated either million exceptions changes every weeks. Probably kid, mouth breathers wanted ‚Äúdo research‚Äù, would‚Äôve meant going library. Florida here, moved one year ago. live street/loop I‚Äôm guessing 150 separate residences. Since we‚Äôve here, 5 people died covid among households. here. Like, come on.

B.1.351? South-African strain? 
 
I thought read somewhere recently math, total reduction cases (and therefore potential mutations/variants) vaccinating large chunk population reduces chance piercing variant *more* added selective pressure exposed partially vaccinated population. honest impression (based cynicism) ?

Before pandemic, could easily purchase N-95 masks Amazon.

I know briefly case major California wildfire spree.

But pandemic began - medical personnel (with option stay safely home, guaranteed encounter infected work) struggling fing surgical masks, nvm N-95s.

Many articles nurses residents washing reusing ‚Äúdisposable‚Äù masks.

The whole ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù keep overwhelming hospital systems.

And medical providers went sick, affected curve (from axis).

Now, remember happened TP hand sanitizer?

I think terrified would happen masks gloves.

Greedy yuppies either stockpiling, scalping both.

It would disastrous!

And mask wearing genpop (at least pre-vaccination pre-Delta), really better reducing infectious person‚Äôs fallout (with original version, infected person would infect average 1 2 others. delta it‚Äôs like 8-10).

A mask somewhat reduces chance getting infected, drastically reduces number infected person spreads to.

I wear mask protect (and me), wear one protect (and you). Social contract.

It important reduce transmission, earlier pandemic, many feasible asked stay home, important keep dramatically insufficient supply, available medical staff tending infected.

This shafted Essential Workers (groceries, fuel, delivery etc), cold logic.

Then, people started making homemade commercial 3-layer masks non-medical options became available, appropriate ask everyone (to reduce spread, hospital load).


I wore kind face cover beginning, happy mildly inconvenienced/slightly uncomfortable, prevents even ONE unnecessary transmission.

And studies saying masks/lockdowns don‚Äôt work - group whole took seriously, government supported efforts.

We never actually got sufficient buy-in states see potential benefit.

I know New Zealand poster child, look Canada (even adjusting population density) vs. US.

I know weren‚Äôt perfect, damn sight better did, even best.

Proof pudding. reports people handling 3rd doses compared side effects first 2? worse off? Well, I‚Äôve enlisted 2 months yet call appointment. sure hope fully vaccinated December. reporting provincetown god awful..I still can't find proper article tells 900 cases 7 hospitalizations breakthroughs. assuming vague wording articles. 7 900 great imo. usual rate hospitalization unvaccinated? conclusion later due vaccine, trigger investigation , died due heart problems post vaccine first ruled vaccine related.

Our ERs crowded, underfunded badly handled normal times, covid everything become MUCH worse. surpise people die ill treatment now. ends stop new wave hospitalizations every months. shortcut pandemic actually vaccinating combined mitigation measures like masks distancing reduce spread manageable level (zero COVID may impossible mean low COVID impossible). Otherwise take 2-5 years burn population like prior repository virus pandemics.

There lot good data long COVID; ""long"" part makes data necessarily take long time collect. Hopefully current future vaccines enough reduce problem post-virus issues. hopefully we'll take issues seriously viruses. best way deal vaccinations fewer people get infected, even exposed, first place.  Polio vaccine brought EUA?
Was Polio survivable 99.6% caught it?
And Polio vaccine contender turned cheaper, safer effective prophylactic cure?  heart issues. Wearing mask makes feel faint dizzy couple minutes body adjusts. I'm happy hate thought putting others risk (even though fully vaccinated). honestly, little bit discomfort passes quickly. I'm giving CDC shit playing politics guise science. think case removing mask mandate vaccinated people decision actually inversed based science political one. 
 
The data dominant strains time suggested among vaccinated people breakthrough rate small could go back normal behavior Rt would still 1. Delta course changed this, came later. 
 
What consider (enough) decision stores restaurants can't verify anyone unvaccinated not. course anti-maskers lied said vaccinated wear mask, set environment ripe resurgence acted normal have. still guidance socially distance didn't. That's entirely CDCs fault. 
 
If CDC considered rather obvious outcome, maybe could said ""because think responsible, effort simplicity, we're still recommending nationwide general mask mandate"". based *on science* - would fact political decision. 
The science clearly say vaccinated people really need wear mask old variants. Provincetown also site massive gay orgy time. level exposure something people worry about. Thanks link. That‚Äôs tragic. suppose technically can‚Äôt say *definitely* linked vaccine (unless I‚Äôm missing something) since gotten vaccine myocarditis linked vaccine... seems pretty likely. also seems like hospital completely dropped ball caring her, horrible. wonder could survived given proper treatment. whole family Mexican holy shit bunch antivaxers. Hearing thing lot friends' families. could known taking vaccine deadly virus would make sick Yeah, I've wondering myself. told surface transmission issue pre-Delta. really wish could make people say believe scientists live without everything science brought them.

Make give cell phones. Make give large portion food crops grown using scientific method. Make walk ride horse work.

Wait. anti-vax Tinder?

I've accepted can't wrap head around vaccine fear mongering another level headache. Or, ""was"", guess [This recent breakthrough death hospitalization numbers.

The leaked document shows chances hospitalized breakthrough case low. shows chart displaying ‚Äú25-fold reduction‚Äù hospitalization rate vaccinated people compared rate unvaccinated people. I‚Äôm sure information document specifically meant secret, portends something catastrophic. Overall, leaked document suggests breakthrough hospitalizations rare. gels data breakthrough hospitalizations deaths reported page linked. suppose breakthrough hospitalizations deaths could increase number, do, don‚Äôt see wouldn‚Äôt get data fairly timely manner.  Deaths going more.. they're going up. they've always lagging indicator like 21 days anyway. That's naive talking point people want know reality Delta keep telling themselves. barely lasting reminder anybody.

Not visible one is. Long covid still researched idea long fatigue brain fogging stay. many stories young, energetic people lives put hold. Luckily, seem recover taking vaccine, reason.  Pro-Covid19 Party Masks go away case load low enough, simple. like counties states opening closing based certain case metrics, masks kind caboose engine train. Wow typed caboose long time. Remember early June? case count low across counties even unvaccinated people could take masks off. 
 
If get enough people vaccinated, reach sort herd immunity, Delta Rt somewhere ~1 &lt;2. means vaccinated populations still least perpetuate spread, grow it. much slower spread even original strain China R^0 like 3 something. 
 
This means able handle spread Delta among vaccinated population lighter forms social distancing. I'm thinking like masking mandates limited capacities. expect full shutdowns. Maybe initial phase try come unvaccinated Rt=8 surge that's exploding. 
 
But point use least masks, even among vaccinated populations, case load across country negligible. CDC local governments remove mandates etc. metrics permit. 
 
Personally I'd say keep pressure virus snuffed feasible. literal metric follow know take masks off. looks like last month did. story : later found triggered pizer vaccine Some????ü§î  Hippies aren‚Äôt afraid drugs known partake unknown substances. polio vaccine virus completely different ballpark coronaviruses. doc told this. know took [only two Moderna develop vaccine, vaccines soon followed. Given delta variant variant virus already several vaccines for, trivial rapidly develop deploy delta-specific vaccine using existing vaccine infrastructure? Since mechanism also similar, find hard imagine safety profile different, obviating need lengthy phased trials.

What exactly stopping us rapidly deploying delta-specific vaccine? bureaucracy? number look monthly vaccinated vs unvaccinated deaths hospitals.

If 100% people vaccinated, 100% deaths vaccinated people, really good measure.

You need look % vaccinated people, compare % unvaccinated people.

For people 60, catch covid, chance hospitalised around 10 times greater without vaccine.

For people 60, chance hospitalised around 12 times greater. Gotta love conservatives It‚Äôs bad live, work bunch idiots unvaccinated. us don‚Äôt wear masks, would think would good enough incentive get damn thing. night new guy sticks nose mask sick. tonight vaxxed dude (no mask) coughing like right me. doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs THAT, keep telling myself. Even is, I‚Äôll likely fine. constant fear shit year half later fucking exhausting. Oh new term. Nice Hardly something correlate data with. I'm cord cutter dream getting news social media. Plenty news websites. Doubtful. Hospitals need people work.  Fuuuuuuuck seeing news like reminds pandemic first hit, east cost. 
 
Jesus Christ don‚Äôt want go back performing streaming shows... can‚Äôt mentally, financially, take it. got fully vaccinated Moderna got sick pretty bad shot. put time country. fuck public health become politicized... unbelievably stupid stubborn people USA.  I'll say again, civility nonsense reason *bad people* rise makes worse. I'm wondering many authoritarian regimes rise we've realized can't always democracy half people stupid, selfish completely unagreeable everything Chicken pox could transmitted ‚Äújuice‚Äù pox sure Covid. Still carrying hand sanitizer using  friend killed last May. Every couple months seriously think ""maybe made right choice"" CoVid. stupid people stupid CoVid makes everything seem hopeless. 

I live one states banned mandatory masking. we're restart school season Pulling old discussions subreddit always interesting.

This situation looked like January 22, 2021:

[The US vaccinate 85% US adults begin return normal fall, Fauci even plenty people comments saying country could go back normal 2 months.

People optimistic back vaccinations surefire way go back normal. See much perspectives change dramatically time? situation looks different now. Dad's turning 70 year never Facebook life. Hates it, calls CIA tracker. He's heavily brainwashed conspiracy nut I've ever met. Blaming Facebook like blaming Bell labs. Stupid wills out. work requiring employees wear masks. understand.  Right another wave lockdowns also number two fear. However number one fear lockdowns. 

Unless say unvaccinated get hospital public access sick going fuck responsible people killing kids people actually can't get vaccinated Olympics huge mistake pro science, pro vaccine, anti stupid contributor forum, disappointing scientists use spin promote agendas. Even support agendas. Thanks saying it!  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* thing pandemic opened eyes selfish uninformed people are, quick certain people jump onto pandemic use platform career. worry next time lucky enough get pandemic high survival rate. Original 2003 SARS survival rate 50% thereabouts 50s, MERS even worse rates. get virus that's contagious covid 19 deadly we'll still see people crying conspiracy refusing self isolate, mask get vaccinated. really faith people anymore. dunno. argue studies flawed and/or cherrypicked, that‚Äôs case, I‚Äôd place blame CDC/government realizing (or caring), American population. tend decry sort Dunning-Kruger-syndrome-esque antics think know better actual experts, leading medical experts issue new guidance pandemic, it‚Äôs pretty hard argue normal people expected delve deeply scientific nitty-gritty issues ultimately reject opinions experts. People reasonably respected authorities matter claimed CDC‚Äôs decision based science. We‚Äôre talking people like CDC director, Dr. Fauci, [multiple infectious disease mean, maybe people really screwed up, it‚Äôs hard blame people trusting (and frankly, I‚Äôm sure hell we‚Äôre supposed *can‚Äôt* trust them, people kind epidemiological knowledge required carefully evaluate every claim made experts, expected to). demonstrations largely redundant. 90% adults one dose here, 70% already doses.  too. cut dad week stop sending anti-vaxx articles even we'd discussed making even depressed.

Like anti-vaxxer crazy can't stop spewing lies disease people want Good. It‚Äôs time put shut up. generations endured more

Did really though? 100-year environmental disasters happening routinely, insanity Trump presidency, Coronavirus, constant disinformation campaign Russia troll army, constant propaganda China troll army, constant increase home prices crippling student loan debt; 

have generations really endured more? took two days develop original vaccine. would variant vaccine take longer? horrible statistic! exposure! everyone vaccine exposed weekly basis! Maybe what... 1% exposed? would bring numbers 1 5 infected vaccination! huge difference!  Fantastic idea, relayed congress asap. Good you! exactly needed combat idiocy. need ridiculed, pariah'ed, shamed, shunned, anything everything make feel bad maybe think expected member society. refuse participate, need cast out.

What needed campaign mobilise frustrated, sensible, vaccinated people systematically attacking idiots en masse social media. majority. 

Then, outside internet, ignored, literally, every possible interaction. antivaxx tries buy groceries? clerk refuses service, refuses even acknowledge existence. antivaxx needs banking services? invisible. antivaxx needs help something? sound silence deafening.

And finally, nothing else helps; antivaxx needs school, police, fire brigade medical attention? They. Get. None.

If want society, need part it. also unfortunately bottom percentage kids need school parents can't look properly. Two years good them.   love governor sabotaging state's health. supposed come back US Thanksgiving cancel many family members anti vaxxers we‚Äôre country super strict border controls aren‚Äôt sure get back leave. waiting call one siblings in-laws hospitalized ventilator point. that, parents somehow expected job teacher. numbers really useful. 

o high percentage total population die recently, 

o absolute death rate meaningful without knowing absolute prevalence.

o misinformation campaign

o turn around point percentage unvaccinated people died almost small.  Looking experts say still research. want anyone think comment telling people study viruses come conclusions. Definitely let scientists part. Arnold are. We're hearing it. would love track publish who's dying moment, vaccination status. Israel good this. 

The study Massachusetts. one vaccinated people getting sick hospitalized. leaked internal document. supposed get out. 

That's good. ""Numbers bad. Grunk think big."" [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Spreads faster, least similar death rate non vaccinated. country hospitalizations younger people vaccinated yet, people ages previous covid cases peaks affected needed hospitalization. 95% fully vaccinated, 50-65 83% fully vaccinated. Without vaccination would deads every day new daily covid cases right now, instead we're 8-15 deads/day. 
Keep mind vaccines less capability prevent infection Delta variant, high capability prevent severe infection (needing hospitalization) dead, difficult stop spread even vaccinated people. way everyone shouykeep using mask. 
EU worried Delta variant, that's Europe made big effort accelerate vaccination. Fortunately country believes cience medics, politics vaccines, high vaccination rate stop high vaccination %, EU countries there's also stupidity politics vaccines like US. Fauci help fund creation polio? generations didn‚Äôt Fox News Facebook. what? spread move on. approve vaccine 2-12 make vaccination mandatory. End story. number 1 show? goal end pandemic. CDC literally told people safe wear masks fully vaccinated _any_ setting. [They even cute infographic complete smiley message behind policy clear - get vaccine pandemic you. know clearly true, worse yet, fully vaccinated individuals appear spreaders virus along unvaccinated. home county turned comments Covid updates precisely reason  population Australia, like 250 cases day (and bad enough) Actually I'm taking Vumerity, suspect I'm part control group expect little affect MS meds vaccine, infusion invasive Ocrevus. lost patience? SOME? Also south, know one anti-vaxxer. She‚Äôs vaccinated, won‚Äôt let daughter (13) get it. daughter wants it, no...heartbreaking. Crrrazy. Catching covid recovering like one dose, better nothing something pitiful like 20% protection compared 95%+. delta variant like toilet paper shield. Covid like chicken pox. get again. I'm pretty sure Aert_is_Life means mandatory masks employees though. customers TN willing going make much difference overall. It‚Äôs actually 160 million Damn.  Stay safe. I'm sorry you.  Really. know say. damn. unfair African countries left behind vaccination field! 'ate' them? likely caused die rona fucking DONE life ruined fucking morons.

Welcome modern life. Society lost adherence social contract. past shunned people, social pressure, social consequences. anymore, tolerate ""idiot"" class. 

The way things improve society stop tolerating it. Dont hire them, dont associate them, dont accept them. Make feel uncomfortable. way. Nope. areas need them.   74% percent infected vaccinated. many vaccinated unvaccinated people exposed many infected? long they've already born! *Then* die! probably did. And...HERE ARE. Months free &amp; effective ticket hell. 

I feel bad kids robbed formative years life.

I'm Louisiana, horrible rate vaccination. work retail setting. I'm struggling anger towards unvaxxed. means large percentage customers, friends &amp; neighbors.  I‚Äôm there, there‚Äôs way whoever came line wasn‚Äôt thinking bad ass sounded. Yeah stated burning witch, masks soon enough innocent lives. 

One friends told wished could get space ship one way trip. wish could too. Probably not. Last thing want make right realize government run health care way go. Nobody reading knows state live specific.  world collaboration. Everyone wanted fast, made happen money. Normally yes, take years trials however funding creation drug sped money worldly influence. I'm South Florida BJ's Target recently, people (90%) wearing masks places. kind nasal sanitizing spray use? really need some. hill know we‚Äôre it?   *anti vax* Covid-only hospitals, let staff volunteer work those. rest us get regular hospitals staff respected, treated well, taking care people right thing. Would two different worlds. course, anti-vaxxer refused vaccine get full bill treatment. None socialized healthcare them!

The Covid hospitals staffed bunch Nurse Ratcheds Dr. My-Pillows. Sure, yet. hopefuls show know handle crisis

I hope enough stop DeSantis getting WH. I‚Äôm masks/lockdowns deaths serious hospitalizations justify it. media switched case counts? cases mild vaccinated children rarely bad outcomes, keep things open? 

This disease never eradicated. number breakthrough cases high even everyone took vaccine.  Either vaccine effective preventing bad outcomes, it‚Äôs effective one made go back quarantine since already tried that. either case - ICU/deaths metric mild case counts. statistics data

There's enough ""statistics data"" regarding Delta variant. number one indicator unvaccinated republican. drank full pitcher Kool-Aid Quit making fool yourself. bet stimulus payments tied getting vaccine would see whole different story.  crazy. know 5 people vaccinated symptomatic covid delta wave two also previously covid. 5 fairly mild cases, still. yeah probably true time, looks like state recently teamed Docket enable digital access records. said, probably still good idea keep CDC card safe take picture something.

Here info app: almost seems like want keep Covid thing going. would dying thousand deaths find reassuring, thanks 13 year old say? want vaccine? white, murderin' right.  Caeleb Dressel gold medal swimming fully vaxxed. side effects really bad. say ""never"". variant arises spreads fast Delta 50% mortality, we'll survive. Interesting! ""non-contagious"" Ct value, wonder bad scenario. means unvaccinated people catch COVID, fewer vaccinated people, certainly well-deserved. also slow spread respectably, mitigating hospital-capacity problem.

Over-masking need like 30 million people catch COVID summer rather waiting school reopenings cold weather could backfire though, last summer. guy sociopath ate many followers. think point history. experts vaccines, virology, epidemiology say side effects previous vaccines show immediately within 8 weeks. see widespread side effects occurring numbers already occurring pre-covid. know got voted presenting argument we've hearing. discussing better respond kinds objections. Pandemic fatigue real seems everyone hit wall time I'm glad hear it!  they're old age, I'd get continue wear masks. chance breakthroughs depending health conditions, may may severe effects. Again, risk tolerance thing. say ""I know others lost/suffered more"" mean *your* challenges, losses &amp; sadness things impacted less important. age group disruptive hope lives shape be. *really* important &amp; formative time life. 

With setbacks lately, remember need every single day set success behind us. loose sight future odds live with. far responsible almost everyone else.

I'm getting sense Disney Florida's hope. Florida shitshow starts really affecting tourism income, Di$ney talk $ense DeSantis. Fox news gots u swastika protocol reactions test literally take longer that. example, [here test.

SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus, takes minutes purify RNA, takes 10 minutes enzymes reverse transcribe RNA DNA. time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) detect DNA sequence, takes 45 cycles 35 seconds (30s hot, 5s cooler) drive replication real-time fluorescent readout. 45 cycles 35 seconds take 27 minutes.

So PCR test takes minimum 52 minutes, realistically longer due transport sample handling times, fact efficiency run 96 well plate 95 samples collected would increase average wait further. Respectfully well, think mental strain kids *imposed upon adults.*

Kids pretty resilient. Childhood largely human children learn social/physical environment develop strategies/tools dealing it. Yes loss incurred terms social development virtual learning, think year two catastrophic long framed terms protecting life long society accommodate sacrifice made.

The big problem see society *doesn't want accommodate* sacrifice- desperate kids back school adults working buying consuming again. system *hyperspecialized* around function state catastrophe something (e.g. COVID) challenges it. rationalizations spring ether rationalize business usual push system back former form.

An extreme example GOP, Trump, Abbot, Desantis, etc: effectively maniacs moving lunacy-territory order rationalize business usual. Another might witness happened COVID terms housing prices, food prices, used car prices, rent prices, etc etc etc... system *eats* poor afford hierarchical potency necessary keep neoimperialist system functional. 

Again get virtual learning etc cost kids social graces time, think kids resilient adults give credit for. think science win arms-race (this time least) variants get another year so- spike protein change much vaccines addressing spike protein changes especially deployed winter could really help make happen.

Our inability adapt beat COVID convinced absolutely *fucked* regards biosphere collapse climate change.  people need demand vaccine passports. Employers need mandate vaccines. Health insurers cut health insurance unvaccinated. Schools let unvaccinated kids attend class person. DMV require proof vaccination renew drivers licence. confuses much anti vaxers. proof vaccines work right front you. decades ago yet still don‚Äôt trust science. ‚Äî wonder anything history could show us happens deny science? /s thought recent poll Republican voters showed idiot boy Jr beating person would pick run big Orange Trump doesn't. huge part deniers especially US. HIPPA laws prevent unfortunately people see bad is. we're going pandemic thing couple years, UBI would appreciated.  [SG though mostly done old people, looks like contagious ~5 days symptom onset, (unlike unvaccinated) rapidly become noncontagious.  friend worked 6 days week food service months. Absolutely one applied job he's covering. He's tired beat up. They're driving change. virus is. frustrating, know.  Give us delta-spike boosters. mRNA trivial manufacturing change, must phase 1 data (though public AFAIK). trivial change existing vaccine (like annual flu boosters) likewise require full trials. ‚Äústop discriminating unvaccinated americans love freedom‚Äù certain republican congressperson work big insurance company they're opening offices early September. vaccine mandate. hold breath giving shit. Florida got lucky. older population stayed home till could get vaccinated weather mild winter. Plus, older people, good amount hospitals healthcare facilities. chance see someone work? Might good opportunity she‚Äôs hospital. Republican? 2 people hundreds congressional republicans honor sense? Give break. republicans now. This. blows mind. 

And tired frustrated. wanted go back school maskless disappointed thought would we'll probably wear fall. I've done everything do. understand people literally choosing hill die on.   idea Delta different previous variants. (and data Original Alpha) vary seasonally, seemed thrive shoulder indoor seasons. COVID contagious out-of-season stopped spreading uncontained. can't recall him. agree. Social media (and currently is) downfall civilization know it.

I highly encourage everyone check documentary ""The Social Dilemma"" Netflix. eye opening lot issues social media creates.

Yes, I'm fully aware hypocrisy posting Reddit places. heart you. sorry üò¢ die covid could've gotten vaccinated, sympathy. get deserve. one *Bedtime Bonzo*?  think we're worried saw last fall/winter Feel way. Situation context matter reality majority children vaccinated fault own. CDC think they‚Äôre tracking hospitalizations deaths (have little while). definitely larger denominator. hell y'all doin' there?
üëÄ really need masks everyone vaccinated. need regular flu season. Pretty sure it‚Äôs effect year. Show card, get doughnut pro-covid party seem help last time sure, try pro-plague next election too, let's see works you. think lot people say ‚Äú99.9% survival‚Äù they‚Äôre young healthy age-adjusted IFR young healthy .1% (or lower). But, maybe get crude mortality rate (what you‚Äôre saying). point soon need let spread. policymakers want impose light mitigations give unvaccinated weeks get shots, suppose deal (though even sure agree that).

But that. time let run course. learned Facebook masks kill people. die carbon monoxide poisoning. $200 insane, live? many masks buy? don‚Äôt correct would file claim w/ CC company say never authorized charges, didn‚Äôt. burden proof company foresee taken care of.

I don‚Äôt see expiration date mine they‚Äôre wrapped 3M packaging NIOSH markings I‚Äôm worried that. think there's big count number partially vaccinated people due people got first second shots different places whose record keeping sync. absolutely idea, I'm visiting family streets full people. need vaccinations tests eat inside. Some? Yes. much better weapons (vaccines) monsters many think weapons dangerous monsters. even case like Provincetown, vaccination rate attendees unknowable one knows identity people traveled festivities. efficacy case unknowable.

In case, vaccination rate (for UCSF least) *right there* tweets. mention, NYT reporter could probably easily get info hospitals even dig tweets. mean, it‚Äôs like Florida hitting time highs case numbers anything. Otherwise, decision would completely, undeniably idiotic. wanted normal college experience like one time life I‚Äôm gonna experience Lmao. clearly get news reddit CNN right? One simple google search find shortage articles people getting physically attacked wearing mask. I've said months now. need cynical, borderline exploitave media blowout terminal patients suffering video, body bag pileups Italy, teary, impactful interviews families victims, much much more. 

In age unlimited information connection, pandemic let everyone suffer very, silently. gotta really dumb say it‚Äôll late fucking idea happen them. never hailed hero aside morons state.  GOP actively trying kill voters? It‚Äôs bold strategy, Cotton. Let‚Äôs see pays off. likely company paying them. theoretically subsidized tests, few, needed tester waiting list would take 1-3 weeks.

That's importing anything. hello, situation right cannot find information articles extremely scared. friday, hung fully vaccinated friend outside hours. fully vaccinated well. today texted let know friend hung tuesday tested positive. person fully vaccinated too. friend got tested thursday seeing me, came back negative, worry soon getting retested. question is, scared be? considered exposure? I'm curious job?  true comes triage care make decisions gets care doesn‚Äôt. one icu bed left goto patient vaccinated better chance survival.  believe gotten vaccine. elderly patients work braces legs Polio, always first tell much hate Anti-Vaxxer morons. amazing see 1st world countries idiot politicians, third world countries alone anymore. whether not, way hell. O_o think people understands this. we're frustrated given miraculous vaccines understanding mask efficacy we're still far away totally obtainable goal.  Repost degree math, I'm somewhat source, he's absolutely right. I'm pro vaccine lot bad math floating around propaganda promote vaccines policy fact way.

The formula one way looking vaccines, particularly useful way. formula used breakthrough vaccinated deaths / number people vaccinated. One problem useful gauge risk number always increase. Another problem take prevalence COVID account.

The proper way calculating risk two fold. first part calculate efficacy trials. done comparing difference vaccinated group unvaccinated group. words, efficacy deaths = 1 - (breakthrough deaths/unvaccinated deaths). believe pretty much every study vaccines calculated somewhere 90 99%. Efficacy incredible change even circumstances change. Whether wave not, efficacy same. (Variants change efficacy, changes human behavior virus prevalence not).

The second part calculating vaccinated risk. unvaccinated, prevalence risk catching COVID IFR risk death, prevalence \* IFR mathematical formula risk unvaccinated. Putting altogether get: vaccinated risk = (1 - efficacy) \* prevalence \* IFR.

When see broken like this, see vaccinated risk increases prevalence COVID. makes sense think it, many people agenda promote vaccines want think that. boot neck feels good. going keep going antivaxers dead vaccinated. sucks is, going take lot children immunocompromised people them. affecting antivaxers, I'd sit back let kill off. But, not. happens us got vaccinated start lose immunity? fucked up. People who‚Äôve never seriously ill often display lack awareness surrounding vulnerability disease, thinking they‚Äôre practically invulnerable. 

In reality, viruses ravage bodies leave us permanently crippled. Life dangerous. husband unfortunately really strong hold her, anything without approval. really sad actually. married terrible person mean selfishness anti-intellectualism screwed us? don‚Äôt say‚Ä¶ perfectly put words exactly I've feeling past months so! well said! It‚Äôs almost like agenda. Hey now, would really like cast fire. Sorry hear‚Ä¶this pandemic really shed light people lives values. guess it‚Äôs better find character later Moderna actually immunogenic Pfizer.. slightly longer interval could mean lower fold neutralizing activity decrease Delta Pfizer.. Moderna might relatively safer longer period needing booster..
 
but then, Moderna booster trick.. yeah got fucking morons decided extend fucking idiots one day time. make it. look back one day think, ""Holy shit, know it"". I'll eating cheetos. Buddy person talking handle Covid-positive person apartment. talk society like immediate thing   Uh yeah  I've hit several times. mean -- even beyond formal vaccine efficacy -- I'd argue absolute risk/incidence extremely important statistic lose sight of. even total infections fully vaccinated individuals. shows vaccines effective preventing infection thought.

This absolutely implies. take extreme example, 100% given population vaccinated, example, every case vaccinated individual. imply vaccines failing.

[As last week, 93% UCSF employees (I find data hospital). [The breakthrough cases thus still imply efficacy infection quite vaccine previous variants, line we've seen Delta efficacy data UK still really damn good! (A hearty hat-tip u/audirt posted link helpful thread below) 

Unfortunately, data also notably absent NYT report... That‚Äôs upsetting part IMO 

It really bare minimum, literally easiest thing entire world

People would rather throw another year toilet reason cannot comprehend  kids want wear mask, still can. can‚Äôt mandatory. 

Feel like lot people missing point here. He's telling everyone wants hear, lives go back normal Covid, although real, nearly dangerous opposing team says. He's betting kids affected. thinks small number children dying disabled Covid worth risk, let alone teachers staff schools. also might betting people getting vaccinated want take risk.  I‚Äôm wearing mask around kids can‚Äôt vaccinated. frankly don‚Äôt give shit anti-vaccine mouth breathers. It‚Äôs point.  Jfc, let's hope never happens.

Holy shit.  cases polio vaccination COVID-19.

The difference we‚Äôve eradicated Polio developed world long reached herd immunity.

Once reached, herd immunity makes quasi impossible catch disease long-term.

Why? 

Not vaccine prevents catching it, virus longer spreading. 

The hold true COVID-19 herd immunity reached, becoming hard people like you. worry, 3 weeks total virtually new ICU patient, rona otherwise, airlifted different region even country, people still understand importance vaccination lockdowns.

Every weekend they're protesting they're allowed turn bars, restaurants nightclubs pox chambers Health insurance can't refuse sell insurance result ACA. employer, labor shortage. seeing many business turning away employees vaccinated. University professor here... agree saying. need ""Authentic example problems"" invoke critical thinking. that, students university hate it, complain dean I'm tough, dean gets case. There's systemic problem education general. lack weak critical thinking aspect effect  Cool, glad hear they're this! results sure great interest. Although that, stark is, even somewhat undersells effective vaccines are, vast majority unvaccinated young. And, know, disease harder older people. vaccinated group already much tougher battle, yet still overwhelmingly winning.

This super important note. comparatively small amount serious outcomes vaccinated people 60+ 

Which means even people bad comorbidities vaccines whooping Covid's ass. would settle thinking. people like this, two new variants, think we've crossed threshold pandemic going semi-permanent. going new normal. minimum made doubt Hollywood movies even pandemic movies, government rolls things get done... Exactly. Reddit high level obesity they‚Äôre going downvote anything says it‚Äôs controllable problem people. 

Some people genetic disposition toward addiction likely get hooked smoking due it. still charge smokers insurance. 

Look, don‚Äôt know charging health insurance based unhealthy weight good idea not, people acting like it‚Äôs purely genetic situation that‚Äôs control silly. Nah think first mid October 2020 realizing thanksgiving Christmas wasn‚Äôt really happening much messaging last months vaccines magic ticket ending pandemic

They are. ""Ending pandemic"" mean eradicating virus.  Nope.

Are cases getting polio vaccination? say no. wrong, Show me. rate infection polio vaccination? 

Are cases Covid infection ‚Äúvaccination‚Äù? Absolutely, it‚Äôs lot. Also, vaccinated spread disease rate unvaccinated. rate infection vaccination? say it‚Äôs enough determine it‚Äôs lousy vaccine, may even make vulnerable. 

I hope I‚Äôm wrong - you, evidence lying eyes say otherwise.

Believe actually wish luck. think jab terrible idea doesn‚Äôt seem work like literally every effective vaccine earth.

As far human pride goes, it‚Äôs easier paint others disagree anti-vax autism causing Karens, rather present actual argument proofs evidence. know popular reddit.

I‚Äôll leave that, like said wish luck.  thing media cares $$$.

We're along ride, unfortunately. leaders make tough decisions easy ones. World War 2 tough decision America, one nearly everyone considers good one. governments job protect 100% people 100% problems. world leader could take away sugary drinks stores probably improve Americans health alot, political motivation that. agree. think density far important metric simple sum people.   I'm pretty sure referencing fatality rate *paralytic* polio obviously way higher fatality rate. closest comparison would look fatality rate people hospitalized covid - equally bleak much higher survival rate. 

Like covid, majority polio cases asymptomatic. ones weren't, harder ignore. Slightly side topic, crazy many autoimmune diseases actually dig it. Diabetes narcolepsy suspected autoimmune diseases. correct solution problem would calibrate oximeter work taking account transmission blocked pigments skin (I.e. photometric reading skin tone addition oximeter reading calibrate according known curve), manufacturers take account device likely never rigorously tested different skin tones thus need different baseline readings never considered. definitely bias work. case anyone wondering, compiled vaccination rates generation United States America(USA). know generation spans exact social science, used general range birth years generation. percentages fully vaccinated, 07/31/21.

Japan still under-testing now. look data Tokyo Metropolitan Government, number testing per day (7-day moving average) last days 10,000 + several hundreds. positivity rate among tested cases July 30th 19.6%. 

&lt;iframe width=""560"" height=""315""  I‚Äôm Pfizer trial formed original trial said injecting us vaccine (or placebo). 

They‚Äôre also trials differently sized third doses well third doses target South African variant. they're sitting home. They're going bars music festivals flying airplanes, *explicitly hoping wishing* actions cause enemy tribe lose members illness.

I also think sort generalized misanthropy wishing death upon fellow citizens see opponents harmful, perpetuates divide caused things mentioned above. lot confidence emotional presentation.

Based assumption likely mutations occur frequently and, hence, emerge fittest soonest, number presumed cases per variant concern, I'm going lose sleep prospect. mean, yeah, possible realm emergence another unrelated novel virus evolution airborne Ebola. probability seems low even me, parts consider alarmist. deal terrorists taking hostages? negotiate them? Considering ton hospitals reported 99% Covid deaths unvaccinated people I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty swell Vaccinated people way less likely unvaccinated people get covid. still possible, event get it, might symptoms might feel like cold. However, could still spread unvaccinated people would get sick you. us could care less willingly unvaccinated, gets complicated think people/kids want vaxxed can't. Highlights: Family goes vacation Orlando. Unvaccinated Dad wife/kids feel ill way home; test positive COVID. Vaccinated wife mother-in-law test positive fine. Dad hospitalized month counting. Due COVID guidelines hospitals, kids seen dad month.  


Please get vaccinated. Breakthrough cases documented due intense viral load Delta variant kicks up. said contagious chicken pox (that's big deal!) hitting younger people harder. I'm exhausted.

To honest, happy college announced wear masks classes next year. know biggest thing, still. vaccine mandate, vaccinations high community around us, obv. student population. Given vaccination, total risk probably comparable regular years' flu.

But nope. CDC's guidance, back masks us...

(And please spare ""masks big deal!!"" really find feel psychologically taxed wearing them, beyond trouble hearing fact reallllly miss people's facial expressions. I'm sure they're necessary circumstances, really hate people try pretend they're costless) really mad anti vaxxers? simply afraid putting body. Keyword afraid. inconsistencies credible news sources back forth crap fauci ppl senate calling liar etc people watch stuff adds fuel fire. could wipe away bad info genuinely put good info problem solved Yes, look 10,000 us booster trial now. deal before: placebo shot original vaccine. Track participants antibodies markers blood draws, track Covid infection self reporting symptoms testing. 

They asked us keep filling symptom surveys weekly even end data collection suspect they‚Äôre still getting data compiling new booster trial. would indeed better red tape eliminated! I'm glad understand fact good thing! What's point universal healthcare want covering tests? 

Then again, countries exceptions dental vision coverage care systems. Polio 15% fatality rate. less deadly covid. assume made points worth addressing. Hint: not. care loved ones ever become infected. Vaccines help prevent it. really sucks. finally feeling free. got new job. got new mental health medication. went saw therapist. Maybe everyone fear-mongering another surge. went saw movie theater, hung friends, went family party. life felt like getting back track depressed funk last couple years. 

Then week later whole family got Covid, car died dog, 15 year old cat starting get bad health might need get put soon.

It's like saw light tunnel, turned semi-truck hit hard possible. understand large US is, not?

Yes, fact do, since American myself, happens Singapore.

It Florida. [This downtown (supposedly anti-florida) TODAY. 

We Americans ignorant fuck. go get test yesterday took day find place actually still it. 

Absolutely wild. That's good insurance companies, bad hospitals. They're job keeping vast majority us hospital. disagreeing, viewpoint absent public policy debate it? seems like one wants question CDC Fauci, people shut ignored. Sleep well! üòÖüõèÔ∏èüí§  Well, case weren‚Äôt around see mess last year, waiting act shit hits fan proven disastrous strategy. Yeah, clicks. betting kids affected. 

This bad bet. 

Children's hospitals across South seeing record kids hospitalized COVID. Hundreds children died Indonesia Covid. Many states put maximum security deposit law. think fact Guelph strong life science department. engineering school like Waterloo, would likely lower.  nobody cares path took conspiracy theories   I'm kinda hoping.. fucking die. atleast enough children family members realize. America dying nation. Never outlook bleak recycled BS made get clicks. Wonder teacher's union sue. time. Good, stay mad. exact thought. intended memo cause drama.  thing people actually believe? Like adult humans think true? Wait‚Ä¶ mean things everyone past year? Thanks tips man. Maybe Americans, humans generally good health could fight sicknesses &amp; use good antidotes. want vaccine you‚Äôre really scared go ahead it‚Äôs you. 
Explain conspiracies I‚Äôve said. Strawman. subbing years now, concur wholeheartedly Maybe mark somehow, like wear something clothes.. much history repeating forum. 

You realize vaccinated give get covid, correct? realize simply due fact supposedly less symptoms, preclude develop variants. also interesting note countries like UK Australia vaccinated breakthroughs 40% UK NSW Fold report earlier week 140 141 hospitalized fully vaccinated.

As cdc/who stated, need wear face protection. Vaccinated Unvaccinated give get covid, period. ‚Ä¶ üòÇ top health official Tennessee fired exactly /u/sophelpmedodge did... reveal loophole allows kids 18 get vaccinated without parental permission. added original comment, [here  healthy adult America vaccinated covid fucking piece shit burden society longer.

Don‚Äôt sucker. Imagine posting something related tuberculosis one asked this? wife teaches FL. Even 'mask mandate' school district, lot kids wore poorly, wore old dirty disposable masks, took teachers looking, also ate lunch close quarters without masks. required buses either places, even were, one checking, worn much.

Expecting jr high high school kids comply well enough mean anything difficult, getting elementary school student wear one properly day next impossible.  Unless actual reason believe that, I'm gonna engage conspiracy theories  Viruses don‚Äôt respect borders (and neither Americans, number lied going Alaska vacation Canada let pretty substantial negative taint ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù there). You‚Äôll buy bit time, takes one asshole it‚Äôs pointless. Spoiler alert : zero percent chance many vaccines administered say Israel .

Real talk really annoying happened tho. going major microbiology college. accidentally took infectious disease course nursing (I thought normal course).

What realized taking course (and speaking MD friends) nurses get fundamentally different education comes intricacies body.

So much less effort put teaching nurses *how* *why* things work way do. Get headband mask. Ear loops painful wear long periods time.

You backpeddled quickly called it. 

Can admit wrote post said concede wrong say ?

I write post saying Florida likely develop variant India. However wrote post saying variant likely develop Australia Florida.

It‚Äôs OK wrong little boy. Don‚Äôt need dig hole further. intentionally spreading virus

protect loved ones I'm going assume argumentative question, actually asking genuine curiosity.

That said, health insurance, insurance covers 100% costs associated getting COVID vaccine. insurance, literally tens thousands state federally sponsored vaccination drive locations. cost $0 citizen get vaccinated.

Source: work insurance company largest retail pharmacy presence United States. work Grocery. masks aren‚Äôt mandated presently. wearing many still are. ones chin haven‚Äôt made decision yet absolutely infuriating. look stupid. Either shit get pot. dad didn‚Äôt get COVID mask mandates. vaccinated last appointment 3 months ago today near death COVID. variant started spread near didn‚Äôt go out, stayed close vaccinated friends only, groceries delivered, stopped going church, didn‚Äôt get oil changed car, etc basically cautious year ago It‚Äôs difficult see unvaccinated people problem. life I‚Äôve heard ‚Äúthere‚Äôs cure common cold, common sense‚Äù looks like failed except common sense perspective. people wearing masks vaccinated people. know truth. disliked question don't. victims scam. feel personally described Yeah, come surprise. older people I've talked public transportation like ""UGH, REALLY?! wear stupid mask despite vaccinated?!"" - months ago, country, Denmark recently gotten 50% vaccinated mark.  
I suspect much situation regarding privilege: even realize much hurdle something unless facing yourself. tests flu. California, tested thousands people every week last flu season miniscule percentage positive results. death numbers going hard, like 15 deaths one day (in europes western countrys) somedays even 0. Kids nothing fear covid vaccinate priority. disease spread spread years.  True, possible reuse that's talking hospital setting, lower contamination environment I'd less worries

That said yes, limited lifespan Nah, I'll keep directing anger ignorant dumbfucks understand science gargle whatever fox news OANN Facebook news delivers small enough words understand. Three syllables many likes you. serious? thought heard all.................. Man lot vaccinated people might start dying everyones going freak fuck cant understand herd immunity real evil thinking people antivax causing majority issues. Remember, happening! fine whomever getting sick possible death long ‚Äúrights freedoms‚Äù weren‚Äôt violated. 

As soon vaccine gets full approval kids get think you‚Äôre gonna see much higher level anger blatantly disregarding they‚Äôve told long now. people fueling varieties may vaccine resistant eventually. It‚Äôs going pleasant are. Fair point. next birthday beginning January. to.far away, right? N95s technically respirators, normal face masks like cloth disposable surgical masks. little bit harder breathe in, tight actual seal around face. basically wearable air filter.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* No. unless symptoms.  careful information come recently much subject misinformation poor analysis. I'm saying wrong right saying case rate vaccinated unvaccinated people different supported all. worth, literally damn hero. can't imagine much rage must feel, thinking trying save people refuse vaccinate makes blood boil. question always been, you‚Äôre vaccinated, trust vaccine, scared people aren‚Äôt vaccinated?

Fauci said you‚Äôre vaccinated worried, isn‚Äôt word basically word god here?   still treat patients best can. deny care addiction series stupid choices.  state, around 3 people die day Covid now. Sometimes less. live heavily populated state well. It‚Äôs time return normal. wear masks still irresponsible waiting for? deaths all? never happen. Covid similar flu sense need vaccines probably year similar schedule. Death rate point vaccines almost non existent it‚Äôs foregone conclusion virus mutates becomes dangerous. summer normal pre-pandemic, one know gotten sick hospitalized school ready start again. Thank god. ""experts""

yeah ok lol Oh understand completely, pisses even more!! grandson staring kindergarten couple weeks I‚Äôm TERRIFIED kids. There‚Äôs almost definitely genetic component Covid risk, recall hearing research back.

If one couple specific genetic markers (not likely - usually complicated that) hasn‚Äôt discovered/proven yet.   I‚Äôm furious accommodate unvaccinated willfully stupid this. lost job, followed rules happily complied mask mandates social distancing. much love see natural selection sort out, unfortunately Corona mutate large pool unvaccinated people fuck us up. No, practicing social distancing, good hygeine, wearing mask close proximity people reduce transmission, along vaccines. Spout conspiracy theories elsewhere.  person said two queues one waits till others done. That's triage. That's preferential treatment one group excluded untill treated.

Look history. exactly starts. What's next unvaxxed camps??

I'm guessing allready trawled post history see I'm fully vaccinated.

But ok paying smokers obesity health care? state power cities clearly considering many insane mask mandate restrictions are... California plenty tourism, made tourists wear masks indoors. Sadly people catching Covid without mask restrictions. come visit crowded public places indoors, wear mask. Thank goodness tv! Wooo! We‚Äôre ‚Äúneglecting them‚Äù.

The vaccines free readily available. want us ‚Äúcoddle‚Äù them.

What failed explain value provide society earned coddling. No, 100% wrong. rather small study, 100% wrong. think causing impotence probably what's common: get head ass, self righteous asshole friend's mother old people's home Belgium. concerned part staff vaccinated. actual numbers obscured altogether. good news is, get vaccinated. need worry anymore. Natural selection collateral damage. Although majority hospitalized cases unvaccinated people, vaccinated people hospitalized.

Re open fully large unvaccinated population increases risk another variant compromise vaccine delta variant already has. Delta, it‚Äôs clear vaccines even reduce case rate among vaccinated. idea much less likely ‚Äúget covid‚Äù vaccinated appears old thinking point.

Do sources that? Everything I‚Äôve seen last week suggests vaccines efficacy similar delta variants real difference delta vaccinated people likely viral load large enough spread variants.  Yeah, shit. I'm losing least two days work week, supervisor caught covid. It‚Äôs quite poverty line single person household, add kid two start getting close. 32k roughly amount someone working minimum wage full time ($15 hr lot places now) would make annually vaccines offered liberals, they‚Äôre offered SCIENTISTS. 

These people deserve told they‚Äôre fucking morons. Every day. fact conflate politics science fucking travesty fault liberals. Long covid indeed needs seen Look I‚Äôve already suggested use giant saw saw Florida Loony Toons style push away rest America, noooooo people like ‚Äúyour understanding physics flawed‚Äù ‚Äúgo stand corner‚Äù that. probably direct anger people making ""vaccine""thats killing people. I'm trolling I'm trying help people can't think told. Homeschool.. trust it‚Äôs bad.  Well that's definitely far experience platforms, practices.  
ble.com/vkbeyd-140-hospitaliz  
ed-people-out-of-141-cases-in-sydney-had-both-covid-jabs-othe.html

This conservative site takes context. region new south wales population 8.166 million. 141 hospitalized population low rate.

There's also mention he's referring delta variant.

edit: apparently, can't post certain links here. Amen that. Vaccine stays system 2 months, ‚Äúlong term effects‚Äù already known maybe Missouri, vaccine clinics county fair necessary current rate incredibly low.  number using disease incidence risk infection. Either author completely disingenuous doesnt know basic epidemiology writing articles


If 100 people, 2 people get exposed, one person gets sick, disease incidence one 100 risk developing disease exposure one two. one 100 number nothing risk getting sick since 98 people exposed first place. That‚Äôs fair conclusion draw. also look impending climate doom shrug I‚Äôm well aware people won‚Äôt coalesce necessary. I‚Äôve taken opposite conclusion, since shame makes difference, keep avoid conflict unnecessarily interfering someone‚Äôs day. wouldn‚Äôt appreciate harassed stranger, don‚Äôt others. feel you... think lot people use reddit vent. personally would harm fly, frustrating share planet people. kicker people mutate virus delta susceptible children, vaccine yet. Thanks unvaccinated employee complaining maskne Friday. Lost cool. Something doesn‚Äôt get mentioned enough imo: kids missed two years lives. Two years you‚Äôre kid fucking ages. imagine missing half high school? fucking anti vaxxers ruining adults sure. it‚Äôs much worse kids fucking choice. realize absolutely insane sound?  done masking, countries shown this. Life need stop wear mask movie theatre. Tell niece. immune system got zapped fighting leukemia finishes chemo gets redo whole vaccine panel. every unvaccinated person asshole. Making bunch posts mean fake. Reddit fake accounts sole purpose posting/commenting fake material. Probably even peeved vaccinated person works healthcare. know anecdotal, I'm currently living London know quite (young, fully vaccinated, healthy people) gotten covid last days. other. Seems surprising official case count falling, one explain why. ""Herd immunity"" can't explain tons tons breakthrough cases. Maybe individual level, masks offer full protection. mask mandates force everyone wear definitely helps slow spread. turn helps protect individuals contracting virus. wanna see go right think misspelled August son's birthday... God fucking tired saying but... kids, man. shots kids yet, even parents taken every precaution, still carry Delta variant make kids sick.

If unvaccinated idiots little miracles Walmart, might feel differently, something akin ""fuck 'em"". child infected right choice matter. Yes. vaccine provides much stronger protection longer lasting protection natural blame Facebook misinformation fairness, not. data hundreds deaths, underlying conditions had. underlying conditions somewhat speculation based media reports child deaths I've seen, included sort information underlying medical conditions complicating factors it.

I think I'm saying anything controversial though, children must likely die high risk due conditions adults. Im gonna get downvoted hell this. please stop posting bullshit headlines like this. think want unvaccinated people, they‚Äôre dumb, selfish, ignorant, above, whatever, fucking keep let‚Äôs try create actual dialogue people rather getting ‚Äúangry‚Äù them. fuck (and mean vaccinated people) expect encourage rest America get vaccine start conversation ‚ÄúI‚Äôm vaccinated already, aren‚Äôt vaccinated, waiting?? fault!!‚Äù may fault can‚Äôt return normal needless deaths continue result, screaming headlines like face communicate message think does.

Like said, believe want unvaccinated people, matter ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù think reasons. Maybe they‚Äôre minority hesitant US‚Äôs terrible track record testing vaccines them, maybe they‚Äôre overwhelmed figuring get vaccinated don‚Äôt know yet it‚Äôs readily available Walmart via walk-in appointments, maybe they‚Äôre stuck echo chamber bullshit vaccinated people push edge circle asserting cult ‚Äúsuperior vaccine believers‚Äù. Yes know sounds ridiculous, ‚Äúvaccine-believing‚Äù science, read headline loud pretend second legitimate argument getting vaccine - headline frustrating people pushes even away. 

I agree people absolute whackos can‚Äôt reasoned with. that‚Äôs minority people holding getting vaccinated. There‚Äôs still many Americans reasoned speak equals, respect opinions they‚Äôre hesitating, let come conclusion, terms, getting vaccinated safe, effective, best shot (no pun intended) returning world back normal. I'm going wearing mask help protect people want protected

This pisses exactly. restarted wearing mask crowded stores yesterday...Not many it.

At point really mind unvaccinated choice population suddenly dramatically undergoes mass shrinking.  would possibly get stance children immunized, still still wide open hurt point. government‚Äôs job force protect others

Except 1905 Supreme Court upheld exactly faced v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905), United States Supreme Court case Court upheld authority states enforce compulsory vaccination laws. Court's decision articulated view individual liberty absolute subject police power state.

Seems like don‚Äôt actually understand American constitution all. Again, smoke, *do not* pay due that. 


You disprove statement health insurance smokers paying more. may, do. 

Comparing apples oranges good argument. somehow less deaths per million national average. Meanwhile state (MA) lots restrictions NUMBER THREE deaths per million. honestly want see antimaskers imprisoned. ""... would never, ever wish anybody family,""

You wish people like get vaccinated. getting harder harder show empathy people. That‚Äôs SAID! almost tests. walked shift told 13 PCR tests left needed save least 4 case transfer ( patients transferred different hospital must Covid tested; even it‚Äôs trauma patient). 

Apparently recent uptick cases, reagent running test back order. 1000 nasal swabs collect specimen, can‚Äôt run test. Thankfully travel another facility 6 hours away pick 100 tests. Hopefully get Monday, get delivery supplier. mean, children literally get various vaccines public school college students get least TB test, usually shots, enroll.

This different Understanding problem doesn‚Äôt go deep, lot unvaccinated folks never stopped changed habits lockdown. would feel need get shot they‚Äôve acting way entire time? It‚Äôs frustrating tiring see people act selfishly rather DNA scrambled microchip installed inside me, thank much.    I‚Äôm angry, I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôve learned valuable lesson past year though. I‚Äôve cut people life used think bit there, want endanger families life ‚Äúwaiting see works out‚Äù zero interest part life. I‚Äôm sick crazy amount resources that‚Äôs needing go towards Covid, country could done four months ago. everyone got vaccinated, we‚Äôd back normal lives now.  

I‚Äôm angry, tired, sad, disappointed country filled half population full themselves, can‚Äôt something simple getting f‚Äôing shot big surprise, people telling already got months ago. Like ‚Äúcapitalists‚Äù run local small business? that‚Äôs would hurt another lockdown. screw mom pop bookstore, right? understand Library Congress amount data know ultimately approved otherwise whole country revolt.

At point (passed long time ago) abandon normal processes overcome events focus approving vaccines ""safe use"" opposed ""certifying"" them. Realistically, anticipated situation like ""safe use"" approval process place advance. US. many consent warn others. even way combat level stupidity? shown brink death always enough, what's even left try.  sick hearing rubbish response Syndey's outbreak takes totally wrong message. promotes false view Australians rejected vaccines thought permanent lockdown solution suggests Sydney's failure proves lockdowns work. 

In reality Australia always said vaccines way pandemic made big deal getting access even producing AZ locally. completely messed rollout, that's failure federal govt implementation, putting much faith two vaccines. 

Secondly Sydney failed refused lockdown, put weeks cases rose even implemented hard enough lockdown. Perth, Melbourne, Adelaide already defeated Delta outbreaks opened back thanks quick lockdowns. NZ totally Covid-free since February thanks quick lockdowns. work done immediately. Wait even days trouble. I'm vaxxed understand hate toward anti Vax. Vaccinated people still catch spread virus. also mutate Vax person right? thing Vax good making less sick whenever catch it. 


Even case, worldwide thing. Everybody country could vaxxed there's people vaxxed still world, fly country keep spreading/mutating. 

Maybe I'm missing something seems division. Get vaxxed protect seem protect others... Yeah. I‚Äôm sure portion believes number conspiracies. Sadly, belief non-existence challenged shortly. 

With R0 equal measles chickenpox it‚Äôs matter time they, someone know, fighting viral pneumonia. still deny it‚Äôs Covid want. won‚Äôt matter virus run population. longer novel virus anyone isolated. 

India around 2% population vaccinated. months 66% population antibodies. 2 3 people infected quickly, viruses existence hard dismiss sun rising morning. got better demonizing wishing pain suffering ppl. Literally acceptable case.

If keep trying make sure people want kill us comfortable, going end getting killed lmao. bro. I'll 18 next Spring, long parents believe vaccine kill everyone gotta wait like 8 fucking months, we'll ""variant Z"" something :/ people infected Florida regions. variant likely develop Antarctica. humiliating yourself. misspoke don‚Äôt understand probability.

If 100 raffle tickets I‚Äôm likely win raffle person 1 raffle ticket. Might person 1 ticket win raffle? Yes. LIKELY win it. I'm giving like month new FL-specific variant arrives. think agree. I‚Äôm looking like climate disaster force nature. prepare try mitigate damage. decide shaming doesn‚Äôt help hurt, might start shaming release valve well being. I‚Äôm half joking. Ok misunderstood Some?! Come let‚Äôs get with. like trying get kid door getting put damn shoes on. Would possible kids RSV COVID? don‚Äôt care mask public people aren‚Äôt masking private. studies never involved delta variant... look, quite bit CDC dragging feet on. still admitted virus airborne. Please try wear good mask like KN95 replace daily. know that's going put additional cost you, also going try keep safe possible. Sorry deal idiocy. FINEST ARTISINAL DEHYDRATED SPICED ETHICALLY RAISED BEEF BRUHHHH Attack Vaccinated Karens. ""Politics"". 

We print trillions dollars whenever want days. We're spending well $500 BILLION PER YEAR war started basis false information. 

It's like saying guy driving Tesla SUV mow lawn expensive. realize MSM means CNN Fox News well many others? Unlikely. Even huge number people getting vaccinated, November might even approved younger children.  Ah, reason new mask mandates lockdowns last long   Nah it‚Äôs weird people worried people doing. India stopped testing Boy hate right time.   Honestly, way ‚ÄúCovid ends‚Äù say fuck it, accept genie bottle it‚Äôs going back in. 
 
Vaccinated not, we‚Äôre going exposed Covid. Hopefully, vaccinated mean it‚Äôs able make 10^6 copies rather 10^10 copies get exposed, vaccinated people end asymptotic cases, it‚Äôs there, it‚Äôs going away long time. 
 
It‚Äôs *possible* could avoided people didn‚Äôt politicize refuse vaccination. It‚Äôs also possible variants mutation would occurred one way another. Iceland huge surge, they‚Äôre 70% vaccinated. 
 
Either way, it‚Äôs time life return normal. 2% fatality rate high ignore. I‚Äôve yet found data fatality rate vaccinated people, it‚Äôs .2% .1%, may time say fuck shit, get fucking lives. 
 
In truth, we‚Äôre going get exposed Covid. Whether 2021, 2022, 2023, it‚Äôs matter time, lives actually saved continuing lock down, especially people aren‚Äôt yet vaccinated choice. 
 
We lost. Maybe would‚Äôve anti-masker, anti-vaxxer, etc. etc. community taking things seriously? knows, one way another, didn‚Äôt happen. 
 
But *can pause life forever*. We‚Äôre raising generation children never get play park it‚Äôs slightly dangerous used be. Life always dangerous, fact, 100% death rate. 
 
The vaccine out, people want ample opportunity get it. It‚Äôs time move lives stop pretending Covid going eradicated time soon.  Vax spread less likely infected less severe disease. That's masks encouraged vaxed peeps. Unvaxed painted corner many vaxed people 0 fucks give anymore. I'm wearing mask still child young vaxed want initial exposure reduced hopes vax prevent infection even w/ Delta. least thinning out. see would even controversial. someone needs organ transplant, lifestyle choices taken consideration. 40 year smoker going take back seat otherwise healthy person needs new lungs due disease. 

The thing taken consideration comes covid. Someone could take refuses get vaccine take back seat someone get vaccinated someone needs medical treatment other, non-covid related health issues. Trauma? Dramatic much? Lol happened likely come country US. Feel things normal due new variant. Better safe assume worst case scenario. I'm not. 

I've run energy angry anything last 5 years so. 

Im exhausted resigned fact people selfish wankers, country run straight psychopaths. cannot believe true...I know way many fully vaccinated, young, healthy people who've gotten Covid last month 1 4,628 (weirdly precise number) chance. Delta variant wicked. one ended hospital many bad time. Like, took entire nation India better part year make strain that's slightly worse original variant. make strain renders current vaccine ineffective pretty much impossible. you‚Äôre mobile, go main page sub click three little dots upper right corner choose change user flair options given bunch states already tried vaccine lottos don‚Äôt believe significantly increased numbers.

At point swap carrot-on-a-stick whip. Fine ones refuse it, fine heavy. already fine people speeding endangers fellow man, thing. shame lazy protect family pains see world  Urges people get vaccinated? people like was, cleary listen. problem narcissism. honest UK same, cases going down. difference almost 90% adults vaccinated, shots. I‚Äôve living normal anyways entire time. point 1 year half later let die well bad ones got vaccinated follow distancing alright practice washing hands Lol thought, I‚Äôm healthy person, don‚Äôt need go get right away...

I guess asthma allergies finally paid consider uber healthy consequently got vaxxed.

Irony. evade antibodies. Delta evade antibodies still breaks virtue exponentially higher viral load.

The vaccine forcefield. weapon. weapons overwhelmed presented overwhelming force. School already started me; everyone highschool I've seen 2 people wear masks. many kids (including me) literally BEGGING parents get vaccine, Facebook conspiracies parents vaccinate kids! legal adult yet parental permission know nothing insurance school can't much :/ mean, civil war people dodged draft Vietnam‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like society particularly cohesive follows institutions. aren‚Äôt China. Yep.  likely similar effect going Provincetown case cluster set everyone's hair fire -- uncertainty vaccination rate among population exposed makes hard accurately evaluate effectiveness cluster. wonder work smaller companies. really want brother get vaccinated won‚Äôt. last hope someone, anyone, forcing get vaccine die Covid. works extremely small building company good friends boss. health insurance- know, whole drama- leverage either. ‚Äòbuild‚Äô significant companies would force hand, instead business comes regular people building custom homes. 

His current boss anti-vaccine, care. That's pretty much live! Nobody anything far Republican county mine. think would feel smarter living among dim ""people land"" however pandemic hit, realized made big mistake. Oh well, got vaccinated. Best luck neighbor! 4th slide.

Caveat: official cdc document, give source data, I'd take grain salt. fits much better results countries 99% stats do. amount companies FORCING employees return work alarming

Technically incorrect. employment based meeting employers expectations. don't, ""right work"" there. free resign want employer asking do. employment sides. real reason evidence really. I'm business owner started living street teen parents died. I've built everything less nothing I've learned trust intuitions. 

Maybe 1918 flu story stuck head 3 waves, maybe division globally people, nations have/have not's. Viruses tricky things. one causing problems levels globally people even see moment. 

I'm probably wrong...heck I'm heavily invested treatment stocks hope I'm wrong would mean investments pan out. doctors politicized COVID vaccines.

It politicians idiots. Except safe. Perhaps look camp outbreaks consider Delta variant endanger kids cavalier manner. Yes, kids even developing long haul symptoms, yes, kids dying. course nothing whatever. good parent don't. No, probably not, least places decent vaccine coverage. There's confusion this: although breakthrough cases transmit well unvaccinated cases, fewer them. people news articles read saying get exposed, likely start transmitting virus, whether vaccinated not. case.

A booster shot Delta would nice, course, spread stop without one. company self insured. soon one vaccines fully FDA approved, we'll make mandatory. video responses point. children 12 means leave Florida, it. government care one children. Wear mask social distance community reaches 70% vaxxed status. part lie? dumb? I've seen articles stating opposite. Several times, even. mathematically illiterate think 0.1% 0.001% similar? work chain pharmacy someone come 100 days first dose lol ain't wrong Covidactnow tracks many tbh.

On hand, suspect new converts lazier get second shot. telling me. part younger generation remember one peers telling feel need get vaxxed. Imbeciles. source 15% data? Seems interesting  Dang things really never change huh  ok, make Republicanning harder. husband works office setting (he working home, transitioning back office work) never stopped wearing mask. wear mask time leave house. person wears mask office said co-workers mixed reactions. asked stay away -social distance - ask wants also wear mask simply cannot get used it. 

Everyone office vaccinated, co-workers young families unvaccinated kids people go don‚Äôt wear masks exposure worry us constant. office probably masks September, weird dealing people don‚Äôt know process individual wearing mask. They‚Äôve approved yes, ought become mandatory. cares? Let get sick die don‚Äôt want get vaccinated. aren‚Äôt shutting again. Covid 19 become endemic. people stop unreasonably hating fellow humans based vaccine? majority society struggled biology 101 many didn‚Äôt even make far college level education. It‚Äôs senseless. I'm losing patience provincial government resuming mandates. current R0 highest - far - since started published December. guess consider unvaccinated lost cause government supposed advised experts. ""I'm Buenos Aires say kill 'em all!"" Actually, making children sick. read news. Many children died covid. Yes, older people susceptible atm, could change one variant. yet looking 75% people latest outbreak Massachusetts we‚Äôre fully vaccinated ""only %1 people die."" Says person also plays lottery. thank you!  us whities get vacc, also prefer term 'European American' 'white colored'. I'm sorry, ""99% deaths unvaccinated"" statistic true count deaths 2021, timespan includes lot time one vaccinated.

The latest data, found leaked CDC documents Washington post, says 15% covid deaths May vaccinated people. That's measure covid deaths traditional way, i.e. ""had covid died"", without checking whether covid actually caused death.

That's still good number, considering 50% population vaccinated, includes high-risk patients. second third paragraph still true. 99% stat misleading. working booster VoC.. booster original vaccine enough.. skewing fit narrative. simple fact matter cases dropping.

You went war two countries 9/11 (3000 deaths).

Well, 1% hundreds thousands 9/11s. Healthy individuals (health problems) disease pass Covid vaccinated people immune it?!? Forced birth means lower middle class kept lower middle class. Steeper hospital bills likewise.

Anti abortion legislation means forced births. Anti mask legislation means steeper medical bills.

I definitely think government's main problem way stingy original orders bought doses first BNT deal fell through. even relatively smaller orders delivery batches painfully slow vax rate 30% one dose mainly US/Japanese donations contributing 60% dose numbers. many ever affected known side effects? 

Also, name single vaccine without side effects. FDR said (in essence): Help win war. win this, *you* part.

Trump said: hoax, drink bleach, shine light ass, pretend nothing happening! Vaccines made anything. designed tested. Disease prevention infection prevention really different goals.

Their goal disease prevention, hope infection prevention. ended working out. think able choose soon places (indoors) Autism? Ew that, giving wrong message. future pandemic, people wait wait payed right thing, protect others diseases. Nah things saying easily refuted. meaningful question is:

Is worth forcing hands educated public account uneducated?

As programmer rarely goes out, take vaccine suffer potential symptoms sets good precedent others? encouraging stupidity good precedent set? realize everything shows outdoor masks effect? 

Also, never admitted lying.

I know would make happy, didn‚Äôt. that's number unvaccinated.. also heard movies delayed big events cancelled. 

Why would expect something like that? CDC says mask mandate would good, lockdown. Yeah, people making culture wars mandates things get little worse would need to, expect major restrictions. Vaccine rates well, great help.  AMEN!!!! please stop political BS? mean people's health lives stake.

People complaining back media scaremongering variants, variants load bullshit, even mentioning discouraging people getting vaccinated. got downvoted heavily back pointing experts saying concerned variants. get it. need collectively work together give lesser chances virus mutate. 

Hah. whole concept ‚Äùcommon good‚Äù also sore point folks often zero-summers. Like good others? Whats me?

impossible without depriving rest world vaccines creating even variants. Third shots ever considered frontline medical workers extremely risk population, nobody else. think closer saying

For me, available work mode longer period throughout day (usually 730 600 + night calls occasionally) sporadic. 
I work bursts. 
I noticed working office, resented night calls working anything past 500. 
Now, couldn‚Äôt care less day control, willing keep emails come in. 
I actually think helps stay effective, simultaneously keeping stress level pretty sweet! 

We agreement though. 
WFH better generally, doubly pandemic protections proactively put place workforce pulled back office. 
Perhaps I‚Äôll wear 3M silicone P100 half face respirator work first day passive aggressive message - haha! Seeing perhaps people exist - NEVER end, 'universe(s)'. technically there's 'overarching connected universe' I've concluded - like think concept even existing person - 'fact' existing basically comprise 'matter', matter = individual 'people' mushed mashed together ever matter object. 'overarching universe' person living - ever person knowing without doubt exist - course cannot conclude people exist 'parallel universe'. Like think knowing without doubt like fact never going end..

- like Im - ie whole theory concept 'parallel universe' - technically think root things like 'you' , maybe people - like act existing person mean like act 'knowing own' = 'ever moving energy' - look close someones brain see basically 'person' moving electricity neurons - pause moment looking single electric flow zoom close maybe eventually end 'black hole'.. Via shifting relativity frame course, making everything around slow zoom in, maybe even see galaxies / stars zooming in. 

Its like act someone existing = 'uncertainty' people - like people maybe needing take people order exist - person constantly destroying anyone else - relatively speaking. Technically person fully destroyed - cannot fully destroy people cannot people..

And computers / brain falling apart? build new computer live in..! House falling apart? -Then build new house live in. give up. work critical managing pandemic,but tooany people seemed think soon got vaccinated pandemic over.

Because unfortunately people understand high school level biology. God guy like super moron. There‚Äôs reason state flooded covid. Don‚Äôt listen him, he‚Äôs politician doesn‚Äôt care dying children. Err side caution blows children start getting really sick, it‚Äôs him. So, beginning pandemic, vaccine, covidiots screwed everyone refusing mask/quarantine/social distance. there's vaccine, they're making things even worse becoming breeding grounds new variants

_sigh_ pandemic stay long time unless force vaccinations.

The best solution give us vaxxers booster shots every months let virus kill refuse vaccinations. Yes, still get sick, likely die it. Slowly, remain antivaxxers either take vaccine dead close dying every months. zero sympathy them.

Anyway, yes, hospitals full, give priority people vaccinated people waited 1 month operation Covid related.

Sorry antivaxxers, full means full üè• Well attitude helping kill people selfish, get someone might mad myopic flippancy. still percentages change, 90% admitted still ""small percentage"" 90% geriatric hospital. 

And [general hospitals 62% vaccinated covid covid , dishonest interpretation data ?! majority Israeli public vaccinated.

A person admitted geriatric hospital , geriatric state (you 30 year old move geriatric state transferred geriatric hospital).

The majority Israeli public vaccinated , understable vaccinated percentage people got sick would higher non vaccinated. Go back dark ages moronic take loudest often wrong confirm lot depends age health factors.

If high-risk categories look getting antibody treatments soon People high risk complications include 65; kidney disease, diabetes, heart disease and/or high blood pressure; immunocompromised; high body mass index.  We‚Äôre literally arguing thing.

X event known little social distancing lots COVID cases. Much higher risk profile compared someone going grocery store

And yet news media trying analyze Bear Week outbreak extrapolate rest US. 

It makes sense. No, one forcing pay these. Think mean 100% Mutations happen. Can‚Äôt assume nothing. Still fairly strong reaction. 99% sure thread talking (was interested digging.

Now pregnant people women Absolutely, matter may will. leave mark many people something better avoiding. 

My point vaccine better alternative catching Covid, acknowledging comes potential risks people shut questioning mentioning. important acknowledge we're taking small risk avoid much bigger one. always leave floor open scrutiny amd careful tar everyone ""anti-vax"" brush.

Many probably zero contact covid patient. many zero contact patients. know, gloss effort minimize news. pizza hard part, part can't accept, people line.

Not think killing party members fantastic strategy winning election. know many us frustrated people still holding out, whether early late, folks praised getting vaccine. Let's keep fingers crossed rate keep continuing tick up!  No, since so-called pro-vaxxers trying scare people long COVID mild infections, forgetting risk decreases immensely people vaccinated. It‚Äôs Angry Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (yes, indeed).  relevant context, San Francisco still area *comparatively* low spread - hospitals high vax compliance (and indeed required vaccinated mid-September noted article). 

While huge assumption, assume 90% vaccination rate, 153 183 reflects 50-60% vaccine efficacy. entirely consistent Israel data showing dramatic decline efficacy Delta (at least infections/symptoms) fully vaccinated January February (when healthcare workers vaccinated). I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs obese. ü§î Current COVID vaccines good, perfect.  confuse imperfect vaccine ineffective vaccine.

Hypothetical numbers here:

In village, 95% vaccinated vaccine 90% effective infection.

1000 people exposed; 950 vaccinated.

All 50 unvaccinated people get sick.
95 950 vaccinated people get sick.

Hypothetical CNN story: ""Almost twice many vaccinated people unvaccinated sick."", conveniently failing mention roughly 855 cases happen vaccine. Satan. Thank clarification explanation. edited original comment reflect this. Obesity systemic issues tones factors could outside control individual including genetics pollution. Vaccine literally yes question. Pls research rather fall back fat phobia obgyn associations assume USA based healthcare staff want say ‚Äútaking proper precautions doesn‚Äôt elevate status deserving medical attention treatment, access medical care human right regardless decisions you‚Äôve made circumstances‚Äù honestly, knowing someone died waiting organ transplant couldn‚Äôt keep 10-15 lbs weight follow ups, would spouting complete bullshit.

Unmarked vans SUVs marksman hit least expect it. complain, sure, care, heck pretend fall pain I'll happily make YouTube video sound effects. else would rich people avoid restrictions live normally?  That's me, I'm vaccinated American covid ruined senior year high school freshman year college, I'll dammed sophomore year suffers üôÉ Covid offs enough voters üíØ loooooong time ago call want can't (medical, age, whatever) unvaccinatable. unvaxxable, cuz that's faster type phone stops trying correct me. ""Florida reporting 21,683 new cases Covid-19, highest number ever since pandemic started says CDC. 
 
The sunshine state become ground zero highly contagious delta variant, accounting 1 5 new Covid cases. 
 
Once heralded hero, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis resisted imposing mask mandates vaccine requirements. Friday, governor stopped school districts mandating students wear masks. 
 
Worse case scenario projections estimating daily cases peak 90,000 daily deaths reach 175."" truly sorry. said last week people basically telling worried nothing. county currently 63.3% population FULLY vaccinated still one highest positivity rates big counties. good representation races, sexes, overall health, people ages 23-to low 70s (crazy lifers) regular verifiable exposure virus. Name better cohort. Puff puff pass similar. choice(to vaccinated) negative effects health.

A choice(to obese) negative effects health.

Why pay more? Smokers do. Getting vaccinated easy solution mitigating effects covid 19. Obesity medical problem takes years effort, willpower, discipline mitigate, that‚Äôs assuming person doesn‚Äôt genetic component weight makes even difficult impossible overcome. There‚Äôs comparison two problems. obesity raise risk dying Covid 19 lot things? Yes. dealt getting shot two arm? No. two separate vastly different problems.   question find them. can't believe still explain this. Sick patients NEVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR put nursing homes. people ALREADY nursing homes dispatched hospitals. law made nursing homes say ""Nope, can't come back"" leave patients street since hospitals room them. really frustrating. saw somewhere possible FDA going allow emergency use one vaccines kids 11, September. Perhaps. agree you; time definitely essence right now! Yea people family reunions summer, weddings wedding receptions, go bars night clubs festivals concerts county fairs etc. called normal activities normal non-Reddit people seem summer time. days  okay everyone needs employment make money, % vaccinated stop? 85, 90?

also never chicken pox vaccine disease, wasnt fun hospitals beginning reach capacity, leaves fewer beds non-COVID patients. real crime here. I‚Äôm tired man. anti-vaxx outcomes aren‚Äôt death, including long term heart lung issues aren‚Äôt common diseases. internet friend, too. store goes masks mandatory tomorrow. Well feel bad kids least low risk rest responsible people vaccinated. many arguments seatbelts, installed cars anyway. Take gander covid co morbidity data report back. look obese health problems general. 

No one making anyone pay shit. cost anything put fork walk around block. Sure, get fancy diets gyms/memberships needed. Well feel bad kids least low risk rest responsible people vaccinated. mean clearly polio kids pre-existing conditions, right? Nope. breakthrough infections quite common. Check r/covid19positive. Delta getting around vaccines pretending isn‚Äôt happening serve anyone well. However, evidence vaccinated getting less sick. I‚Äôm still grateful got vaccinated I‚Äôm well road recovery delta infection. Listen, people reddit vs plays real life different. ranking relates economics outcomes, perfect. countries like US Australia, things different state state. think would rather in, say, Western Australia US state that's hospitals overrun due low vaccination rates. dream.

The *internet* issue. One specific site disappearing matter. They'll go elsewhere. hard expensive make forum. given qualities inherent internet, people *will* find *will* spread. going then? Hold ISPs responsible? going shut internet stop people using bullhorn stupidity?

Look I'm banning stuff harmful effects, like guns. However unlike guns, internet incredibly good qualities think outweigh downside allows stupid people yell stupid things making even dumber. could totally see lot insurance companies (both goverment insurance private) getting fed requiring vaccination coverage since they're hemorrhaging much money paying hospital bills anti-vaxxers. front liner nothing work ungrateful public year half wearing mask whole time got vaccinated soon got chance, YES, wearing mask bother much point. Nobody right decide feeling invalid. never minded mask entire year 2020, suggest circumstances haven‚Äôt changed since December would wearing selfish even vaccinated. 

We‚Äôll guess going selfish point life ever decide stop wearing mask since Covid isn‚Äôt going away lifetime. feel like break point. him, Abbott. Like, choosing let kids die. can't enough approval ratings world counter that. I'm really terrified see far go develop, compassion, save lives. extremely contagious though. moron (don't bother answering rhetorical question)? worst part ICU beds taken covid patients elective surgeries could prolong peoples lives happening. friends mom passed away could get procedure really needed due hospital beds taken covid. always covid people dying others negligence. ‚ÄúIf don‚Äôt get vaccine going die‚Äù me: yes I'm happy news report facts anymore! really done along, tied end mask mandates percentage. Im sorry frustration , looks like delta later lambda variants causing breakthroughs. im ready worst It‚Äôs literally thing r u ok Ireland currently 72.5% adults received least one dose, opened 18's last weeks. I'd fairly confident we'll hit 80% soon Yup. Joke them. Vegas packed usual hardly anyone wearing masks. pulled bullshit nothing. Desantis‚Äô justification ‚Äúthe Biden Administration issued unscientific inconsistent recommendations‚Äù single economics professor‚Äôs unpublished, casual observations dashboard. cares??? 1% new cases vaccinated people. I'd wear mask felt symptoms variant actually concerning vaccinated people. I'm wearing mask protect anti-vaxxers.

50,000 new cases USA yesterday, 500 vaccinated people. statistical probability would one people new day asymptomatic spread someone immunocompromised/old can't get vaccine inconceivably low.

Please call us selfish. anti-vaxxers selfish ones. Getting vaccinated far effective wearing mask. DNR = resuscitate  stunningly ignorant felt physically ill reading it. You‚Äôre saint slapping person upside head. FYI guy account suspended. sub fun. go outside loses relevance Fully vaccinated Moderna got breakthrough case. ‚Äúshould‚Äù feel little protected public bit‚Ä¶right? *nervously laughs puts mask* related thing different lines accepted different places people. One country may totally OK 50+ COVID deaths per day whereas another panic 1 death per month. cases: US bat eye 10'000/day whereas China closed entire cities dozen cases. Similar Australia lockdowns. guess different countries set standards what's acceptable we'll see threads can't good country X Y, etc. Question flu comparisons: found way avoid fly better like way better vaccine, less accepting going forwards higher flu death counts &amp; shoot lower #s reflect better tech? car crash said risk covid, depends age. younger people car crash dangerous. makes sense treat situations put people risk similarly. guy fucking sucks. hell OG, hate fake vaxxers know I‚Äôve lost patience. called mandatory helmets motorcycles ""violations freedoms"", too. I've also heard way many anti-seatbelt types hoping get flung car chance catches fire crash. Sorry, glad checked this. shortages potential send south. 

Remember-check verify! dumb way get lot trouble. card free get free vaccine.    un-vaxxers thats something else LMFAO might campaign convince vaccine hesitant. already made sure artificially deflate numbers counting FL residents. compromised immune system A) get vaccine B) take precautions necessary protect yourself. think people compromised immune systems didn‚Äôt exist COVID? Yet need take extreme precautions? clinging COVID cash cow lost election live Missouri took forever get sufficient amount vaccines St. Louis Kansas City ages, vaccines accessible small towns state.

I drove 5 hour round trips twice get doses. prospect Missouri small towns never bothered get vaccinated making effort worthless probably incubating another variant makes very, frustrated.  even get started SSN cards! problem that. problem spread others vaccinated immunocompromised, g vaccinated. sick this.   patience long since evaporated 3 questions...

The new varients seasonal thrive warmer weather?

Would need COVID-19 vaccination every year new varients out? Think losing patience understatement. It‚Äôs furious apathy Little Johnny iron lung clearly crisis actor. #TheMoreYouKnow   father would sue father punching mouth! 

/s   Posted above, isn‚Äôt relevant. There‚Äôs nothing indicating cases primarily happening among staff access Covid patients.

Indeed, article linked suggests vast majority cases occurring community transmission Yep. 


I've lot individuals would call ""overly cautious"" year, vaccinated Jan/Feb- gym, (indoor) bar, indoor restaurants. consorting unvaccinated individuals. store hopefully busy, mask on. going willing statistic end-point efficacy vaccine trial I'm in, I'm going gamble to. 


Look who's ~~laughing~~ crying now.  Another deceiving headline this. Walmart barely requiring anyone vaccinated. Don‚Äôt thank yet. Yeah guess  hemispherist. use light mode day dark mode night. Ya, still spread it. Hence masks. Fuck people compromised immune systems, right!? always protecting others. Refusing intrinsically selfish lot people won‚Äôt happy‚Ä¶.. lot people won‚Äôt attempt compromise right things‚Ä¶ lot people (including small kids) suffer nothing done‚Ä¶. hope POTUS acts sooner later!! I‚Äôll take positives world atm, much least vaccinated somewhat positive think anyone suggesting vaccines helping way.

But much messaging last months vaccines magic ticket ending pandemic, vaccinated pandemic you, observe precautions anymore, vaccinated people can't transmit virus others, on. think lot this, public health policy built it, crashing right now.

Obviously getting vaccinated still fantastic idea, we're evidently woods need adjust thinking.  Upset.....I'm F**king pissed! I'm mad time bioterrorists prolonging ways one! kids missed much year locked non stop year half taken number mental health. soon started feeling ok going again, cases start spiking we're heading lockdown. I'm frickin tired. NC? I‚Äôm Triangle, pretty well vaccines. I‚Äôm worried happens though students start coming back next week. criminal political party spreading missinformation safe vaccine

Particularly know missinformation got vaccine opinion actively using to, including force vaccinate folks. 

Fuck. This. Shit. 

Also, fuck ya'll vaccinated folks disagree sentiment. crazy thrives. forget 20k, fine get vaccine. would scare number look monthly vaccinated vs unvaccinated deaths hospitals. leaned 94% 99.5% unvaccinated depending hospital last months.

Although that, stark is, even somewhat undersells effective vaccines are, vast majority unvaccinated young. And, know, disease harder older people. vaccinated group already much tougher battle, yet still overwhelmingly winning.

Based we're seeing, 60 fully vaccinated, pretty much going die covid unless serious comorbidities bad luck. extremely rare. 

If 60 fully vaccinated, still orders magnitude better 9 months ago.

Get vaccinated. Also assumes deaths metric totally dismisses long covid. like still let polio spread long people die shrugged people iron lungs told suck up.

From [John's effective vaccines preventing long-haul COVID?  also related question whether people long-term symptoms COVID actually might benefit getting vaccinated. Somebody infection suffering symptoms like fatigue brain fog‚Äîdoes get better get vaccinated? There‚Äôs answer that; however, multiple clinical sites, doctors hearing patients they‚Äôre feeling somewhat better. think real answer that, though, going depend studies completed, see whether makes a¬†difference. Fuck man low bar now? ‚ÄúSome‚Äù Yes mild case COVID feels like anywhere mild cold bad flu. considered mild need oxygen. do, moderate need describe severe looks like...as know.  military

guns

drones would create undue hardship people. know anti-vaxxer that, see fairness this. Worst part whole thing. Incredibly demoralizing. 


One people sacrificed Dad. I'm extremely concerned him, still listen. Thanks laugh. That‚Äôs probably exactly meeting went down. don‚Äôt know gave trying convince people anything sometime last year. Same. got new hire couple weeks ago scared tiredness worn body language. normally love job covid beat tf down. Clients behaving outrageously one ounce empathy days. It‚Äôs fucking brutal.

Well course not, would you? Vaccines cause lead death therefore predictable even occasional outcome refer end result either negative positive way. Choosing get vaccine, however, *does* lead death.

Her kids turned great way. One kids got married January 2020 - best timed wedding time. Big family gathering right everything went sideways travel see 18 months. high enough vaccination rate, isolated we'd hell lot better prepared it. COVID vaccine still solidly effective delta variant. 70 year old coworker refused get vaccinated thinks it‚Äôs hoax. We‚Äôre caregivers special needs clients fragile immune systems is. Lucky clients old enough get vaccine shots little side effects. coworker covid work 3+ weeks still thinks wasn‚Äôt bad enough get shot. Live New Jersey, 6 7 years ago.

The notion third shot would boost immunity additional year based baseline immunity weird though. may case since hasn‚Äôt observed anywhere(because can‚Äôt be) I‚Äôd stick lower estimates. 

The issue you‚Äôre assuming Israel data correct. haven‚Äôt seen results replicated anywhere yet underlying assumption basing predictions may wrong. Israel vaccinated vulnerable back December/January we‚Äôre still trying figure waning efficacy function vaccine due lower immune responses elderly/immunocompromised. straight know time. 

We know protection severe infection mostly stable that‚Äôs god send. 

As ethical issue - it‚Äôs clear makes sense focus global vaccination plan boosters vaccinated early. Unfortunately vaccinated super early means we‚Äôre going run risk mild infection.  People refuse vaccine refused health care covid.
The vaccine free everyone costs less taxpayers treating someone ICU weeks. could Covid, wouldn‚Äôt that- that‚Äôs way short. get tested like, won‚Äôt wave anymore. kinda does. vaccine almost literally turns COVID common cold. worst symptoms people vaccine experience low fever sniffles.  see. time comes, enjoy going stores.

Oh ya, make sure followed home...just tip comment reminds Niem√∂ller quotation different subject material came socialists, speak out‚Äîbecause came trade unionists, speak out‚Äî trade came Jews, speak out‚Äîbecause came me‚Äîand one left speak me. Thanks threads. certainly makes sense people start infected similar viral loads, vaccinated antibodies present (or t/b cells produce antibodies quickly) reduce viral loads, quickly without significant immune response.

Those initial viral loads lower start, virus opportunity replicate. expect vaccinated unvaccinated, viral loads initially rise. vaccinated, antibodies soon start attack virus cells, unvaccinated bodies immune system still trying 'understand' against. said takes least 2 weeks vaccination body's response best. infected virus, 2 weeks give virus plenty time replicate many times overcome immune system's response. 

Again, great post. Thank you. haven't, will. appointment asthma specialist tomorrow morning, actually, I'll speak we're get better idea help that, providing recommendations, documentation, etc call school morning. I've given several helpful tips thread things try school help with, I've emailed program director set virtual meeting week.  Sunshine State 10,207 people hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 cases, according data reported U.S. Department Health &amp; Human previous record year ago, July 23, 2020, half-year vaccinations started becoming widespread, Florida 10,170 hospitalizations, according Florida Hospital Association.

Putting impressive numbers there, Florida. know low score wins though, right? That's unfortunate hear. least minimize potential exposures.  Hey, basically I'm gonna take (the vaccine). know - UGH know - I'm gonna take all. HAHAHAHAHAHAH Yeah, US fully vaccinated it'll less success spreading least. helping world deal huge chunk population refusing get vaccinated. US high enough vaccination rate it'd come die rather finding fertile ground spread mutate. I've also followed instructions. Stayed home, wore masks, got vac'd, they're telling need put mask back on, vaccine actually protect new variant, I'm ""super spreader,"" need another vaccine eventually. 

Even still understand believe them, I'm also starting understand people following trail. easily see something like could keep going, keep staying home, keep relying stimulus checks, keep getting vaccinated, keep dependant government. scary absolutely impossible could taking advantage compliance, even aren't. always going stupid variant coming pike undo everything, always entire planet vaccinated page Interesting, UK also JCVI made recommendation vulnerable children be. Wonder government follows starts missed point continue talk US somehow isolated variants start outside US. Studies also shown natural immunity older variants less effective Delta suggest least single shot vaccine needed able neutralize show Delta less sensitive sera

If US Canada check r/CoronavirusUS people reasonable mods proactive deleting nonsenses. Weird. I've moved hateful. ""really"" need spread one conspiracy theory, Russia/China started anti vax movement want compromise health western citizens think enough information make definitive statements yet. I'm sure variation causes LC, vaccine may address one them. already covid get vaccinated extra immunity well. Seems plus point still get vaccinated even covid Water wet literally factually, scientifically incorrect. guess enough unvaccinated people die reach heard immunity. sort controversial Holy shit, man. exact thinking, phrased perfectly. platinum. children grow time. huge spike depression children. Children! isolation distancing. 

I wonder children 25-50% mention equally depressed He‚Äôs victim. Mutations spreading virus got us Delta.

With stupid stuff happening countries opening face Delta spreading populations fully vaccinated opportunity mutation.

Allowing spread mutations continue short sighted stupid.

The Spanish flu spread due mass travel soldiers WW1 took 3 years come end. Travel took much longer today.

I guess get see mutations next.
Maybe next one higher kill rate.

Not seems bother parts world don‚Äôt seem mind senseless deaths name personal freedom. native Norway confirming covid case without positive test. really incentive label flu case covid countries. Truth positivity rates flu tests fallen almost zero, meaning flu general circulating now. viruses, like Rhinoviruses declined, like flu. 

So no, flu cases hidden labeled covid.   No, he‚Äôs right.

As phrase implies, fittest don‚Äôt vaccinate never get sick.

These would fittest. think prioritization vaccines ass backwards. first people eligible younger people go physical work space. elderly last. younger people going work ones spreading it, vaccine would slowed much giving 90 year old grandmother never left house even pre-pandemic. think chin masks fashionable wearing aesthetics? I'm sorry, taking vaccine BAD decision here? longer respect any. single. republican.

History: 

‚ÄúPolio one feared diseases U.S. early 1950s, polio vaccines available, polio outbreaks caused 15,000 cases paralysis year. Following introduction vaccines‚Äîspecifically, trivalent inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) 1955 trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) 1963‚Äîthe number polio cases fell rapidly less 100 1960s fewer 10 1970s.

In late 1940s, polio outbreaks U.S. increased frequency size, disabling average 35,000 people year. Parents frightened let children go outside, especially summer virus seemed peak. Travel commerce affected cities sometimes restricted. Public health officials imposed quarantines (used separate restrict movement well people may exposed contagious disease see become ill) homes towns polio cases diagnosed.

Thanks polio vaccine, dedicated health care professionals, parents vaccinate children schedule, polio eliminated country 30 years. means year-round transmission poliovirus United States.

Since 1979, cases polio originated U.S.

However, virus brought country travelers polio. last time happened fucking hate here.

Degenerates like (being person put poster razor it) belong cross !remindme 18 days ""for first several days infection"" part extremely important, often overlooked - means vaccinated person almost certainly infect many people equivalent unvaccinated person, changes story dramatically ""just infectious"" perfectly understandable takeaway average person seeing headline like this.

People way irresponsible past winter. people cant get vaccinated? That's good hear. Good thing recovered pretty nicely too. Thanks link vaccine make extremely unlikely need go hospital, reduce risk infection around 80-90%, even delta. illustrate could happened outbreak, group partying together people 99% vaccinated, someone group covid, 90% efficacy still means vaccinated people still probably contract covid - scenario unvaccinated people left, left majority infections happening vaccinated people.

The math pretty basic here.

In 6 months however, data show protection infection might wane somewhat (efficacy might reduced half was), fortunately, even become infected, still strong protection severe disease, still 80-90 percent range - seems stable time. really pretty fantastic provides good protection severe infection.

Don't get wrong, incredibly stupid regardless. wanted clarify bit. | think pointless

Making laws without enforcing indeed pointless. admit find little odd fully vaccinated individuals scared shitless around unvaccinated people.

Yeah, odd, literally one feels way. Eh? pretty easy get vaccine least 3 months now. 
in berlin closed vaaccination facilities remaining ones appointment pretty much optional right now. 


Just show get vaccine... 
In smaller places sometimes even get asked wether need vaccine passing since use doses. 
Available doses seem much problem. 


Space time facilities might issue smaller cities though. Trained personell always easy find including mandatory waiting times stuff processing single person take while. Good thing EVERYTHING opened up. Lollapalooza going there's mask mandate one wearing masks. Football season kick off. Schools come back. opened soon, blew load, get hit huge dose reality. I'm extremely pissed point. Wear mask. Get effing vaccine yourself. Get kids vaccinated. Help us end bullshit.

I swear, end variant escapes vaccines even delta appears be, I'm going lose it. Yes, like government's happily lifted lockdowns people like claimed lift. 20 somethings finding Covid strokes caused asymptomatic infection

In unvaccinated people, yes. Israel research they're keeping track cases, clear people like asymptomatic vaccinated people harmed en masse. NY resident really restricted upstate. generally lax places kinda adhered places open illegally Ad revenue what??? I‚Äôm paying news. ...is dead. Given take 6 weeks best till reach full immunity may ready late. dumb list ranked US #1 one point? No, makes a**  new problem Telegram's channel system now. There's ton channels spreading misinformation, **worse** Facebook telegram find crap feed, subscribe channel gets actively pushed notification every time post. Fuck yeah, orgies! That‚Äôs got thing my‚Ä¶ rates cities fairly high overall state 51% receiving one dose vaccine (One dose still significantly protects hospitalization/death). elderly/immunocompromised particularly well covered.

Texas seeing new wave July/Aug 2021 despite high vaccine access moment approved. 51% one dose objectively terrible. country started vaccine drive US we're 75.2% first dose.

Heck, even worse country accelerating vaccine drive response Delta. Meanwhile, politicians Texas implementing policies make harder institutions enact measures curb Delta's spread.

Texas' numbers may worse, ignores numbers could much better awful job done policymakers. got story wrong. One scientists decided perform sniff test blood sample. Why? good reason I'm sure. anyway virus *wasn't* airborne never transmitted. got extremely lucky. one sniff could changed everything.  Darwin work little faster please? precautions take though testing new cases? remember reading something PCR test got recalled. test faulty know results correct? parent 2 young children cannot yet get vaccinated, I'm right you.

In early June seemed like things going well eased back level concern kids getting infected. Northeast, high vaccinated area masking, testing safety protocols long time.

But Delta variant breaking vaccine resulting vaccinated people potential virus spreaders, Spidey sense tingling again.  Thanks needed hear that! meeting school counselor weeks hopefully figure get vaccine soon Some... us lost patience. 

I discussion partners parents, problem blowing 8-ball cocaine night, sharing bills straws strangers think we're ones crazy getting vaccine. 

I'll honest alot fun 20's early 30's plenty powders, opiates, acid, ect get point time think vaccine would killed gave lifetime disability. I've said since probably March, know react getting shot, know(even can't possibly know) reaction covid much worse. bad reaction, likely would died caught covid. care statement true.

Time matters certain level.  talk like lawyers television

vaxx mask feel like ""Get vaccine daily anal covid swab"" would push lot people vaccinated list. minorities good reasons mistrust government. overwhelming information shows institutions created sole purpose limiting integration keeping minorities down. arent things hundred‚Äôs years ago.

And also agree education issue. minorities uneducated due intellect( implying were. get point.), lack resources available/given underserved communities. point trying prevent minorities getting ahead. 

Hopefully opportunity help communities education given vaccine, communities strong reasons mistrust intentions. Yes. would UK wanted close expiry date lots stock I'm immune compromised, year nearly total hermits, I'm tired it. he. ya know what? got vaxxed, hermit another year. I'm sorry can't. sucks. I'm least bit sorry 'proud' anti-vaxxers.

I'm least offended take. I'll stay away crazy people mask 2x rare occasion go public places. I'm sick selfish idjits. 

Here's wishing anyone wants vaccination able get one. I'm hoping people getting vaccinated masking come side intact. need data vaccinated vs unvaccinated cases/hospitalizations. headlines reporting breakthrough cases good zero context. People read headlines articles. really need data this? TL; DR: Everywhere. actually knew anything vaccines work, would know stupid comment is.

You also idea totalitarianism means think live kind libertarian utopia rights absolute civic duties myth. I‚Äôm referring masks. think masks schools vaccines approved younger age groups prudent policy. I‚Äôm referring people put extreme limits socialization prevent kids normal interactions kids hopefully many deaths. Plus old kids sickly anyways died covid brought up. Plus masks kill kids need large groups. Headlines encourage us blame unvaccinated people making rules aren‚Äôt even following rules. expect unvaccinated heed medical advice government sort hypocrisy flagrant? want culture, amenities, good medical, apocalyptic heat flooding? long driveway won‚Äôt help me! shit Tonyüò• ^

I'm angry anymore. care. got vaccinated encouraged anyone remotely mattered same. deaths... can't care anymore. I'm done. get COVID end dying people bothered good decent other... Guess fun lasted. give up.

I went store yesterday sign door ‚Äúface masks required everyone‚Äù go back car find one I‚Äôve gotten used wearing anymore. 

Well, went store man son there, wearing mask. 

Unless start really ENFORCING masks, (which think would nice businesses/whenever else would require proof vaccination, don‚Äôt wear mask, don‚Äôt, mask entry.) going stuck cycle even longer. Lots people never going wear mask, take shot willingly. 

I‚Äôm hoping eventually get vaccine mandate. 

I‚Äôm frustrated, like lots people, part, wearing mask year half (even fully vaccinated, while) people ruining us.

In past 4 6 weeks I'm you. -- unvaccinated part ""willfully"" unvaccinated. people still access problem. Home bound, miles miles away CVS Walgreen, pop site, etc.

Those people access problems immunocompromised others get good immune response vaccines, people getting break infections due feel badly get sick end hospital worse.

Florida reported highest one day total new COVID cases since entire pandemic. middle summer, COVID rates supposed declining due heat. Things get lot worse Florida come fall winter.

Floridians stop partying get used wearing masks again. UK want swap Israel Pfizer shots then, less two months ago? Vaccinated people might ready, that's science works. herd immunity work need set % population vaccinated (if I'm mistaken, like 80%ish). Preach! since students HS 18, can't shit.

Do happen know uncle got fully vaccinated? I'm honestly worried data (that, fair, questioned) coming back Israel seems saying immunity dropping pretty rapidly 6 months (especially at-risk mom got vaccine earlier side).

None data US coming back breakthrough cases vaxxed ppl seems breaking time elapsed since full vaccination. going tragedy many breakthrough cases could prevented we'd jump started 3rd shot booster program. Imagine going life stupid fucking moron.   totally understand. I'm pissed also. decent good people are, I'll mask benefit can't get vaxxed continue small part solution. Dig little deeper friend can!! üëç         That's like cut moron assholes.  Obesity contagious everybody free 50 burgers day. doesn‚Äôt put others risk. COVID hand‚Ä¶   Stay home    Oh look, crazy conspiracy 6 months ago it‚Äôs common sense That‚Äôs weird, news saw tv (Japanese) day Olympics volunteers cannot get tested all.  even entertain could last wave, 75 million people zero intention getting vaccinated? absolutely blows mind. 
An ounce prevention pound cure. 
Seriously, like learned nothing past year half. 
I even saying lock hard. 
Just‚Ä¶ wear mask public. 
THIS can‚Äôt nice things‚Ä¶ *sigh* force schools force them? Interesting. Obviously free Guy barely last election. It‚Äôs hardly slam dunk. said mostly right extent. purely speculation, however I'd theorize idea right however actually downwards curve efficacy next generation variant. 

The existing vaccine still pretty effective Delta variant, albeit significantly less effective original Alpha strain. I'd conjecture would true bars boosters. 

The less fortunate countries eventually getting vaccines, eventually boosters. Always generation two behind, pretty much technology transitions 3rd world today. Eventually entire world degree protection. Keep repeating cycle virus eventually loses. üëÜüëÜüëÜ California ~33% people (39.5 millions vs 29 million)‚Ä¶. People drive speed limit time consequences. offense mean covered health expenses? would fairer comparison. 

Each instance ingesting substance mean waive right health care fair comparison -- puts risk well others statistically. What's sad he's knows wrong. So‚Ä¶ narcissists? feeling check gate isn‚Äôt intense he‚Äôs saying parents right choose kids/parents want wear mask can, schools can‚Äôt force wear one don‚Äôt want also saying, dont people research, said dont think algorithms work all. algorithms designed keep engaged. critical point first start using said social media app. algorithms traps person bubble little first things showed interest in. Like example. like guns. look gun posts follow gun channels. eventually get trapped anti vaxx threads algorithm decided look person. people actually search things within social media apps ofter scroll feeds dictated algorithm. developed Facebook app 2016 peaked behind curtains data get profile. App never went live deleted profile There's logic there. number zero local governments go overdrive. need people call government something. restrictions aren‚Äôt going come back (vaccinated) people aren‚Äôt hospitalized dying problem vaccinated likely masks.

I've slowly masking again, I've vaccinated since April. Meanwhile, know people vaccinated never wear mask again.

The problem situation we're punishing ones following rules. feel like people sub can't seem understand that. 

Vaccine passports mandatory vaccinations way go. want that, another lockdown, unironically, best way mitigate increasing cases.

But unless get another pandemic assistance, think public accept another lockdown   Darker skin tone always caused oximeter devices overestimate amount oxygen saturated person‚Äôs blood. factors, low blood pressure, certain types anemia, dark fingernail polish/artificial nails also interfere device cause give false reading.

This underscores importance seeking care licensed healthcare professional you‚Äôre feeling ill, concerns health. Technology afforded us convenience devices home, devastating consequences laypeople rely devices home skip seeking care completely. 29yo community died Covid.  Symptoms death fast, two weeks. First week weren‚Äôt presenting typical symptoms, got tested second week.  vaccinated. According friends, hadn‚Äôt gotten around yet. Left behind young child. think India reached rough herd immunity regions? sick monkeys transmitted virus another group monkeys air duct. never room. definitely airborne.

It Ebola Reston, known contagious humans proved cause human illness. context viral mutations prospect could transition humans likely human forms Ebola achieve airborne transmission. Also, know monkeys acquired illness. could cavorting humans petting zoo somewhere world know.

It's terrifying. Ebola Zaire 90% fatal. airborne Ebola got loose world essentially zombie apocalypse. evangelicals love Get chip, put mask shut mouth.


I'm joking.   wants kill kids. businesses governments going require masks even vaccinated, seems logical bring back social distancing even indoor capacity limits. Maine chiming in: yeah. People don‚Äôt care. plates every state right I‚Äôm pissed. It‚Äôs doubly crazy last year even bigger shit show non-pandemic times :( links that? I‚Äôd love read it. We‚Äôre terrible job states tracking. found info heard allegedly hunters laptop video 45 69‚Äôing. Allegedly. Nope. late for. That's is. 

I'll getting booster soon available. I'm immunocompromised taking shit super seriously. Congratulations Governor Ron ‚ÄúEichmann‚Äù DeSantis turning Florida destination people - elderly - go die.  issue there's much focus vaccination individual benefit. Yes, may still test positive vaccinated, every vaccination still one step closer herd immunity! CDC lost sense vaccinations group effort, need vaccine mandates ever. Thankfully friends family vaccinated... weirdly enough nobody social circle anti-vaxx. 18+ year olds considered adults UK. think confusion lies times people use vaccination number % total population (including kids), compare popular measurement vaccines per 18+ year olds.

Zephyr compared 18+ vaccination percentage 88.5% Missouri‚Äôs total vaccination rate 47% comparing apples oranges. Chodder responded comparable figures 88.5% Britain 59.5% MO, still wide much better accurate comparison. Wait, isn‚Äôt freedoms? kid wanted wear mask? thought America, specifically Florida Uber FREE. motorcycle helmets, guns galore, don‚Äôt tread etc. would take away child‚Äôs mask free wear it? Good lord guy keeps doubling &amp; tripling bad choices... Sshh supposed read headlines. Yea. odd narrative anti-Vaxxers US biggest threat world. countries less 10% population vaccinated like India several countries Africa. think much research done money natural immunity. looking India vaccinated also peak delta went back (but gone fully away). obviously dont understand social media traps people bubble. dont seek accurate information believe information accurate inaccurate.  I'm essential I'm tired. Lots people are, I‚Äôm not. might surprised find Israel finding significant long Covid ~20% Thirty-one percent infected workers reported persistent symptoms 14 days diagnosis, 19% reported ""long COVID"" symptoms loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, shortness breath, muscle pain 6 weeks. None hospitalized. 23% workers took leave absence work mandatory 10-day quarantine, four returned work within 2 weeks, one still returned 6 heard radio last night, got chance find article today. (I searched didn‚Äôt see posted yet, apologies been.)

This study shows vaccines still 90% effective preventing COVID hospitalizations death, worst news vaccines don‚Äôt slow Delta variant‚Äôs spread.

I‚Äôm going back wearing masks avoiding groups again. fear many places reimpose COVID restrictions Delta becomes dominant strain. called talking irl people know well. slower takes effort form friendships knowledgable people. wonder Pfizer would say Also 5% beer actually 20% stronger 4% beer. joke thread title subject Unlike COVID, polio vaccine mandated. Anyone thinks could reach vaccination rates high without forcing people's hands fool. Literally none US this. America third world country core. first world veneer breaking down. Unquestionable belief Bible paraded around like merit badge...at time facts unknowable. Every single SoundClip news bite 100% designed brainwash Americans dunno....made vulnerable communism. Words thrown around like socialism, communism, sad fact majority Americans could explain either word means. 

America worst school system developed nation. Teachers public schools make less manager fast food joint. shortage skilled labor trying fill high skill job ends companies hiring abroad. hey, property taxes became way public schools funded...every request voted down. Electives like art, shop, music...all discarded. 

This fuels something America holds tighter guns bibles....and racism. Oh racism. central tenant hundreds years. quote goes effect ""you always raise spirits poor white share cropper simply reminding black"". promise white people swear God racist! soon feel safe would majority water weight though fat content. Yall mad people section 8 housing saving hundred bucks month pandemic? Wtf Coronavirus constituent That's weirdest part pandemic, couples disagree huge issue staying together. able it, also boundaries standards lol. bare minimum yes, pandemic better get vaccinated lmao.  That‚Äôs case Munich anymore. get free test satisfy list conditions Almost scientific research done using statistical analysis. Nothing certain statistics, people use confidence intervals provide certain level confidence results. It‚Äôs certainly perfect, it‚Äôs critical part modern science. Wym current cdc data suggests wasnt far off? data point study find encouraging number 84-days affected people much, much lower 30-days affected. me, makes seem likely improvement even beyond 84 days. Ah, best possible interpretation said, I'm relieved. sub never know. bad idea. You‚Äôre half correct. normalcy? problem despite vaccines vaccinated still get disease spread it. 
CDC recommended masking vaccinated well best way reach Democrats talk ""restricting"" vaccine giving Republicans many die Biden get re-elected. Literally nobody want take jab wants type measure anymore. could go back normal right now. utterly delusional think unvaccinated people reason can't get back normal. We're getting back normal goverments keep measures good reason whatsoever.  Thank you. Well mean lived life safely.

Mask house, washing hands frequently. 
I went work everyday, went small safe wedding. Volunteered weekend, went camping woods.


If chose give year life decision anyone else's. I'm one tested family, received positive result yesterday. six us symptoms, six us got it. Three us fully vaccinated, last shot (Pfizer) May 8th.

We actually assumed bad cold *all* it. many breakthrough cases one place, right? lost sense smell Friday made appointment tested evening. Still thought probably rhinovirus though, also take sense smell. Nope, positive SARS-CoV-2.

I'd still say vaccine main job though. parents two vaccinated members household, neither needed medical care despite numerous comorbidities them.

I'd guess vaccinated maybe gives us higher minimum infectious dose, ends quickly surpassed one expose five year old daughter. misunderstanding natural selection works. entirely random. likely vaccine resistant mutation happen one person vs another, completely random. 

If anything, _better_ vaccine resistant variant mutate existence within vaccinated individual person's immune system already ""winning"" fight part infection resistant virus may better able destroy mutated variant spreading another individual. aware plants feelings also? I've watching GOP messaging decades, extremist end shares common rationale. Demonize opponents widen social fissures order persuade working class vote act interests.

The grifters sociopaths ascended environment GOP messaging care supporters die, long die *their* hill.

When over, go back climate crisis important political issue, impact every human planet thousands years come, indoctrinated people who've lost homes, indoctrinated farmers who've lost crops, continue demonize environmentalists making great sacrifices save civilization. wedge issues peripheral ideology, creating angry dissent become whole purpose party. breathe less virus get less sick?  I'm critical science. stating updates kid also suffers anxiety though scary, I‚Äôm using time work mental health. We‚Äôve spent lot time together talking, crafting, working issues. still gets play small kid group we‚Äôre waiting wave sideline. Right! saw üëÄ

That‚Äôs pretty scary  think average person intrepret every study done covid? need experts field break us, tweets interviews, many cite studies/data.  


I degree epidemiology whatever understand study means, limitations are, that. getting vaccinated, don‚Äôt give fuck. upsets feelings, guess what? don‚Äôt give fuck. it‚Äôs black white zero sum game. vaccine 100% ‚Äúeffective‚Äù, it‚Äôs highly unlikely shots using ever 0% effective. Even vaccine ‚Äúworked‚Äù 10% population could slow spread. variants virus emerge, current vaccines likely become less effective still valuable tools slow spread. It‚Äôs reaching herd immunity.

And it‚Äôs vaccines cause mutations lead virus variants. *Infections* cause mutations lead viral variants. sure best place ask, even FAQ fully answer, normal 27 year old female begun consistent menstrual bleeding shortly becoming fully vaccinated? Delta doesnt care vaccinated not... catch spread either way. bothers whole situation amount hate many people allowed manipulated carry. used like shook bottle pop cases like loaded weapon directed people may ever choice vaccine war. amount rabid mouth frothing bullies blows mind. thought beyond used like this. Unvaccinated people ready normalcy since beginning Covid, welcome vaccinated people crowd wants open economy again. Hopefully vaccinated people get way, let things open up. Auto mod removing comments named political parties letting shit like ‚Äúfucking moron‚Äù fly. 

Let‚Äôs see Chitown two weeks hosting hundreds thousands people music festival live broadcasted one wearing masks. Let‚Äôs see NYC Labor Day reopen. hey, Cali venues reopening.

Floridians uniquely stupid Reddit, much would love case. global problem solved pointing local outbreaks blaming them.

No state mandated vaccines, preemptively banned mandate. fact it‚Äôs political bullshit doesn‚Äôt matter. Unless literally quarantine everyone two weeks seal borders (impossible America aren‚Äôt island like NZ) going new norm. You‚Äôre saying going school spreading virus kills classmate wouldn‚Äôt also traumatic. Oh, idk anything going Illinois. meant northeast NYC opened quite now. Everything opened couple months least.

Don't get wrong, we're probably gonna get fucked - they're seeing 30%+ positivity states like Missouri Florida. Whole different ball game. insurance industry refuse cover COVID hospitalizations unvaccinated patients. It‚Äôs preventable come pockets arrogant foolish get vaccine. Well, picture surfaces, would need better explanation.

Overall, part wanting say: yes, purpose vaccine masking make activities acceptable. completely shut even mask vaccine, whats point.

I understand optic issue. would pile see pictures indoor w/o masks. Yes üôå wish death upon anyone. exemptions medical religious. Late comments co workers UT Southwest Texas. pediatric icu flowing respiratory cases. couple Covid children, majority RSV  Unvaccinated people way lol jerks say ‚ÄúNo New Normal‚Äù refuse let us get back old normal. would surprising see spike deviate past spikes trends though. Without vaccines hospitalizations deaths lagged vaccine large percentage population require hospitalization even get Covid. What? Unvaccinated people literally reason we're still mess. Look U.K. cases, going higher vaccinated percentage U.S. skyrocketing people still claiming hoax. going blame vaccinated people everything supposed tell they're wrong? C'mon.  great culling Read story. reception indoors numerous pictures guests wearing masks. You‚Äôre also assuming virtual schooling socializing kids thru zoom = ‚Äútrauma‚Äù. doesn‚Äôt. isn‚Äôt say person interaction isn‚Äôt helpful kids developmentally, is, you‚Äôre quite cavalier use term ‚Äútrauma‚Äù here. American Psychological Association defines trauma following: ‚ÄúTrauma emotional response terrible event like accident, rape natural disaster.‚Äù

Having kids attend classes via zoom trauma. Watching brother sister fight life ICU unit chose in-person schooling got sick Covid however certainly trauma. kid I‚Äôd homeschooling shitshow. Look Geert vanden Bosches research. endemic, still pandemic tell suburban + rural OH doesnt care, vaxxed not. I‚Äôm pretty sure vaccine prevents severe sickness though? Even delta variant. DeSantis children! Well hospital, mild would home. Wow. Worse almost exactly 1 year ago. 

‚ÄúThe Sunshine State 10,207 people hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 cases, according data reported U.S. Department Health &amp; Human Services.

The previous record July 23, 2020, half-year vaccinations started becoming widespread, Florida 10,170 hospitalizations, according Florida Hospital Association.‚Äù also wear mask protect yourself. Vaccinated people still get virus. Newer variants decrease effectiveness. vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean cannot get COVID, means less likely get complications COVID. still vaccinated people wound hospitalized. know someone‚Äôs mom won‚Äôt get vaccine thinks she‚Äôll get corona die. Yeah. I‚Äôm still trying get second shot right, Mark Twain country writer massive crossover mainstream appeal. Wait...she's officiating wedding outdoors according picture. mask mandate indoors. issue exactly?  mean, know lot politicians caught breaking mandates, mandate break? reason parents get protect children others. Sorry easy science hard grasp. Maybe try religion hear easy. tried hard get here. Never seen committed person making sure spreads. antibodies work well, others work all. Oh, want hear suggestions. However, isn‚Äôt place it. antivaxers maskers don‚Äôt want things return normal. want live post-apocalyptic prepper fantasies. Tons people refusing accept Delta breakthroughs really rare first believed.  really old unhealthy makes sense. Kind extreme not.  Smart. Delta demon. That's good. I'm worrier things. Thank Suck mango pepe  Exactly. Vaccinated people thinking superman getting vaccine main problem. I'd pull shopping centers 1 mask site groups people huddled together. Ridiculous

But nah, fault They're smaller part population, so, yes, majority unvaxxed white. non-whites, one big factor distrust stemming long history medical abuse neglect. Community outreach appears help here.

Not unvaxxed - race - anti. Access major issue can't get work get jab recover side effects. isolated area, getting clinic impossible (Uber's available everywhere). Child/elder care (the lack thereof) may also play role.

I know areas offer in-home jabs mobile clinics. need that. thing happened me. went away 3 days Ouuu long time, sweetheart.

Blame want, know funded chaos seeing, poor victims ones blame.

Blame listen noone, want.

You're probably attractive idiot made much money literally nothing, feel nothing guilt, sorrow, shame anger.

Probably want Earth rid ugly sick people stand outside walls, cannot comprehend hell got first place!

Keep climbing higher higher can't smell smoke hear screams.

One less mouth feed communities forming outside system absolute horseshit, go ahead trust Doctors TV 

(9/10 recommend Lucky Strikes! NEVER led believe something safe, later apologize people died live lifelong illnesses! pay settlements keep poisoning poor rich continue use resources without second thought!) There‚Äôs telling what‚Äôs going happen. Thank service this. 

I fear get worse last much longer. isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon. 

Keep you‚Äôre keep protecting best can. sucks. 

One days end. thought 10 days now. attitude still aren‚Äôt rid this! They're prince sending forty million doses back.   I‚Äôve sadly realizing this.

Ive decided sit back watch burn. I‚Äôve learned lot people past year half. especially different people act get power. time treat like second class citizens are.  they're holding contract society. we? Get vaccine queef  lot hospitalized patients suddenly go stable respiratory arrest. odds recovery go decent dire given moment.  lessons learned. Got it! SMH! still can‚Äôt get right!  Jonathan also created propaganda public believed years‚Ä¶ like vaccine scare stories. get vaccinated.  many won't.  so, oh well, time live lives. 35 pediatric hospitalizations day. School starts less 2 weeks. Hey. Lay Stevey! fat dumb happy Florida thru May 21. That's hurts much now. Vaccinations stalled underestimated Delta. Delta EVERYTHING said more. India warning! Mainstream Media meant main new stations like CNN biased. Laws thee, me. They're especially difficult read still maintaining faith humanity. Pretty sure Darwin phrase believe anything less 100% mortality rate ok? Lol Chicago 100k unmasked people hanging Lola soooo  prefer people without experience run show? never understand logic. want people decades experience, good bad, charge. people trying learn fly. hypocritical change view circumstances change. Everyone opportunity get vaccine, want that's choice.

If anyone's hypocritical you. FL sure lot pneumonia deaths 2020. shit, extended albeit vaccinated family members contact going without mask, worst case scenario ill buy trusty revolver blow brains gets bad  ‚ÄúIf thought GameStop went roof, wait reap gains feed store pet dewormer!‚Äù argue person renounced use reason like adminstering medicine dead - Thomas Paine vaccines reduce risk people spreading virus causes I'm wondering worried people stop sanitizing hands. seems though product assumed work equally well skin tones, awful assumption product designer.

wheres source that? guess Offit right last Fall we‚Äôll need mask social distance long time even vaccine stay safe. 

I don‚Äôt see scenario even get first half 2022.  Why? life going back normal go back lock probably 2-3 weeks. It‚Äôs fucking annoying. NEVER FUCKING GOING AWAY. going every fall? go back damn lockdown? country resources, personnel, social buy-in pull off. I‚Äôve since last fall can‚Äôt imagine everyone falling line prevent spread like happening West. 

For context, live mega city registered one COVID death. Virtually everyone still wears masks subway means public transportation. get odd idiot country bumpkin time time security passengers reprimand compliance. fines, threats‚Ä¶ good old social pressure asshole putting everyone risk. 

With recent outbreaks across China, shopping malls public places require masks green code entry. Again, don‚Äôt get people arguing (‚Äúmuh rights!‚Äù style). either comply turn around walk away. Damn...

Die mad guess  Lmao fine Republicans want fan base die it. Maybe might learn something preventable death tragedy  Lol like good chunk vaccinated people, ran empathy months ago seeing sewerage people like post say. compassionate could also mean getting vaccine contagious infection that‚Äôs getting worse right back you. Enjoy getting sick months. May odds favor weld homes much worse here.

My wife China, family friends areas clusters happened. absolutely long lock hard also survey leaving building aren‚Äôt allowed leave neighborhood.

Testing alone won‚Äôt shit everyone running around.  going peoples history back shit up? Step. Away. From. The. Keyboard. sounds like infected group 85% male Okay post CDC death hospitalization data vaccinated vs unvaccinated. unvaxed children vectors? 

The kids need tested cruise, right? Yes, nothing guaranteed life work data available. Right now, data pointing safe effective vaccine. go back lockdown / restrictions, we're following science.  Yeah people assume person Reddit male. Idk hard say ""they"" instead ""he"" Socialist here; lockdowns shouldn‚Äôt happen long vaccines effective severe disease death. anti-human used left option. know people want positive upticks, reality areas stalling probably stop completely soon. specifically talking county, said county. increased slightly one percent month. still well 30% population even initiated vaccine point. know people continue get it, local nurses, teachers, respected members community loudly vocal saying ‚Äúmy gosh choice‚Äù protesting vaccines mask use, lot reasons optimistic.

Should declared state emergency got funding federal government. can't 'socialism' something like that.

it's national review, probably we're trying get back ""normal"", good! refuse basically vaccines incubated within eggs. general, animal testing thing medication. Saying vaccine animals involved saying medicine general. still memory cells though? raise good point definitive answer. doubt vaccination rates would even lower anti-vaccination propaganda shrill.

But, decline efficacy would likely singular event gradual mutations. already vaccinated history infection would still protected time. time essential see health care system collapse.

Meanwhile, I'd use convince everyone know get booster shot :) must subreddit post like this? Right....but cannot live it...that wrong assumption floated experts us. either virus lives us...People want comforting truth hard truth...... Yes is. CFR Covid US 1.8% technically wrong 98.2% people survive Covid. take account CFR counts confirmed cases massive undercount virus causes asymptomatic infection one third contract it. true mortality rate know IFR lower CFR, possibly even 1%. Also ""most"" people suffer long term damage Covid. complete misinformation I've already reported well.  People vaccinated panicking.

I feel like shit explained since spring 2020, yet am, still it. review process good thing. really don‚Äôt like people rushing it. need patient What's response that? Wat Good, makes sense. Yup exactly this. Look Britain. cases like 1% picture, realistically outside Florida hospitalizations still extremely low, really shouldn‚Äôt worrying. Especially since UK numbers quickly peaked almost increase deaths. takes time yank medical license, usually happens eventually. dealing doctors spreading misinformation something licensing boards accustomed dealing with. Hopefully start taking action promptly. put lives hold fucking morons would take jab. different last year's lockdowns. act god. go lockdown again, act human fucking stupidity. I'm fucking fone shit antivaxers die COVID care. bullshit us trying right thing dragged along fucking idiots.

You wanna take hand then? OK. can‚Äôt say weren‚Äôt warned time time time.

Vaccinated patients go front line, IMO. Call cold, don‚Äôt care, truly. 

Consideration given considerate.   where's evidence culture main factor? actually believe that, understand fatigue truly is. thread explicitly talking low prevelance deaths among vaccinated individuals.

It's really secret likely missed bunch cases among vaccinated individuals either asymptomatic mild symptoms individuals elected get tested.

But think pretty safe assumption anyone admited hospital, God forbid dying, tested regardless vaccination status. 

So still really get suggesting. I'm saying vaccine bad. asked question post. angry? Honest question. quite. presense unvaccinated people creating reservoir virus keep infecting vaccinating people potentially evolve around vaccine danger. Almost like vaccine combat time unlike last year lockdowns means defense.   I'm imagining there's gonna GOP/Republican/Representative/etc that's gonna get announce publically mistake remorse.

Super sayin'. Also common knowledge symptoms vaccine. scrolling down

In words hunt click. day still can't fucking believe ""essential workers"" put front line shots elderly. people realize vaccinated people carry spread covid basically unvaccinated people?

So ones unvaccinated people putting risk themselves? 

According CDC data findings anyway goes dick-noses.  They're deep point. Getting vaccine would admitting wrong pandemic beginning. many would literally destroy entire worldview would rather risk death this. I'd say see even higher honest, maybe 80%? ‚Äî including (well, places people forced go e.g. transport (out London) shops; gonna wear hospitality clubs whatever feel like everyone accepting risks).

But really see point mandated more, certainly see point mandating mid August onwards everyone chance 2 doses. charts. Yeah it‚Äôs actually bad look more- amount vaccinated people get hospitalized still low, vaccinated people get hospitalized, 15% die (based study, course). great, catastrophic. Here‚Äôs better idea: Rather ban politics altogether, instead ban posts related Florida. Us people outside state starting get tired seeing Ronnie Ron &amp; FunQy Bunch‚Äôs evil sadistic behavior towards Covid. subreddit, go post articles there. differ playground argument?

Tell parents kids who‚Äôve died gotten badly injured playground! hospitalization death spike ramp right kids going back school. isn‚Äôt gonna good dont quite know would think vaccine-evading variant would come someone unvaccinated.

There's conditions environment would push development direction - pressures 1: become infectious. 2: become less lethal. directions would cause spread environment unvaccinated person.

The big issue would someone half-vaccinated, virus meets resistance vaccine induced antibodies, enough resistance eradicate it. strong pressure develop direction circumvents resistance vaccine.

And finally happens develop vaccine evading direction unvaccinated person pure chance, slim possibility, possibility nonetheless... happen among millions unvaccinated choice - would happen among billions never offered vaccine. afraid ""fear-mongering""? gain downplaying risks? rather overly cautious.

No I'm not. Stop telling am.   Hardly possible masked distancing! said feel bad. Sheesh. Russia

Keep screaming dirty foreigners neighbors pointing knives neck time. counties are. looks like aren‚Äôt mandated either. state looks fine though. McMaster said, adding ""the vaccine works, everybody.""  Interesting point. may right. Maybe wouldn‚Äôt bleak Trump hadn‚Äôt dismantled pandemic response team Obama put together pulled U.S. WHO, did.

Yes, first world centric viewpoint. Thanks pointing blind spot. Don‚Äôt mad fellow citizens, mad people wont admit wrong. 

Biden: 'Get vaccinated wear mask Texas far behind... we'll time schools start sooner. imagine scene hospitals total capacity, come flood kids teachers since governor allow schools protect last year MUCH less contagious deadly version Covid. Seriously, completely maddening! Im fine without it. Myob. exactly thought saw guy! coworker isnt vaccinated, take trip across country towards florida. mentality that, havent gotten virus yet, then, probably wont end getting all.

Holy fucking guacamole. like driving toward bunch stopped traffic, hitting accelerator, like ""Haven't crashed yet I'm going to.""   No, better open messed secret behind closed doors. Exactly, unvaccinated aren‚Äôt ones calling lockdowns restrictions. Everyone get people don‚Äôt take precautions available it‚Äôs choice freedom deal repercussions. We‚Äôre never going get everyone take vaccine point covid eradicated, like lockdowns weren‚Äôt effective people still work travel. I‚Äôm tired example people don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm vaccinated, family vaccinated, I‚Äôm around children, immunocompromised family also vaccinated. 

I‚Äôm going go vacations, travel, attend work person, family. I‚Äôll wear mask areas crowded I‚Äôm going go beyond people refuse get vaccinated. sounds cruel point really don‚Äôt care adverse effects. feel terrible healthcare system (which work patient care). comes point can‚Äôt take care unvaccinated covid patients, it‚Äôs skin back. I‚Äôve become numb don‚Äôt really care anymore.  Fairly early Covid saw meme said Covid perfect time people nice eyes bad teeth! No, truly believe never get infected. Also, mean mask wearing easy going far give everything wear one? time see masks may uncomfortable warrant taking hard exercising work. CDC already recommends vaccines everyone 12 up. makes think vaccines would unsafe kids younger 12? Thank you. sub seems living 2020 still cases deaths tightly correlated. need clear longer case. Vaccine passports/mandates change minds.

Being forced pay tests change minds.

Insurance raising rates unvaccinated change minds. Lol note chiropractor like medical field equivalent giving teacher sick note mom... college. Yes, FL government fucking dense. motivations flauting restrictions based economics logically FL state government pushing like crazy 90%+ vaccination rate. 

They may even considered allowing sort vaccine screening large attractions tourists since would effective way say things like Disney world continue operate least amount restrictions.

They none Governor playing politics virus. sowing division vaccine backed certain brand politician corner. 87% increase first week Olympics mere happenstance? people wear masks want communicate, pull down, lean in... divider service staff, lean get face right opening divider else step side bypass completely.

That. Drives. Me. Nuts.

Better wearing mask want talk someone. enough friends thanks, that‚Äôs afford asshole reason angry. Makes perfect sense get news social media tiktok ignoring doctors scientists. missing point. virus keep mutating variants continue pop regardless percentage population vaccinated. Many people said this. Many experts said this. Unfortunately people like listen WANT listen. virus endemic human population. china could beat virus countries cannot. Paywall almost like there's sort international super spreader event occurring.

[Japan's COVID cases increase 87% first week Provable lie okay. Democracies short lived reason: Getting booster would improve immunity period time, probably 4-6 months. Sterilizing immunity appear wane people vaccinated 6+ months ago - degree wanes hotly contested. Israel says drops 39% , Singapore says 69% Pfizer says 83%. We‚Äôre quite sure exactly efficacy drop is. studies agree efficacy severe infections still 90%, miraculous.

I wouldn‚Äôt advise getting booster unless you‚Äôre immunocompromised. Sterilizing immunity never going something lasts super long time, covid stay. I‚Äôd grateful protected severe disease accept point life you‚Äôre gonna get covid. 

Upper respiratory infections always really difficult achieve sterilizing immunity against, started working covid vaccines 18 months ago , one thought we‚Äôd achieve level efficacy infection. It‚Äôs quite miraculous really testament great MRNA technology is.  dont know hunch guy wasn‚Äôt Deep South Maybe triangulate shit quietly come consensus instead dragging entire population change. 
Oh masks today, tomorrow. Never mind, masks back table. 
Keep mind, still wear mask public, socially distance, shit. 
I‚Äôm fucking tired seeing &amp; hearing flip-flopping every single factoid covid. 
They make vaccine year can‚Äôt figure masks necessary? Lol two imagine it. Better nothing, suppose. Yeah Florida similar India right now. Hey, that's takes end pandemic faster, I'm it. It‚Äôs funny China locking mandatory testing 10 million people doesn‚Äôt even make much news.  6 one, half dozen other. Na big business, cost bunch end. dont care though Yes you‚Äôre still it‚Äôs choice necessity, one chooses smoke one pay his/her treatment later needed. health system and/or tax payers? what‚Äôs happening Sydney? Rinse repeat next summer? 

The simple truth matter can‚Äôt cancel everything forever expect people cool it. Either mandate vaccines figure something else forcing everyone butt-sit home indefinitely isn‚Äôt going fly. seem missinformed vaccination works. vaccinated, like wearing condom, never 100% affected. people refuse get vaccinated higher spread higher risk breakthrough infections even fully vaccinated person. Also, huge factor many people who, health issues, allergies, many reasons, cannot get vaccinated, everyone get chooses to, greatly increases Infections death vulnerable. Source : wife, worked vaccines years, shes biotech engineer two hours ago Waco Texas walmarts..... solid 25% masked......

we half number people hospitalized 1-4th wave peaks..... yet seem.... unimpressed.... god speed...... Honestly that's brilliant idea. Vaccines get description lockdowns incredibly wrong I'm gonna wait get officially marked booster vaccination card. think different. isn‚Äôt single mass shooting happened somewhere else. going kids, friends‚Äô kids, family members‚Äô kids. 

It‚Äôll harder whitewash this. It‚Äôll close home. Nah that's true NRW ""Inzidenz Stufe 1"" need test need wear mask. live town already ""Inzidenz Stufe 2"" ist need test dinner inside I'm surprised Lollapalooza got much attention. Rolling Loud headlines forgotten.

I find hard believe full capacity 400K+ attending, 100K every day, they're checking vaccination status many following honor system masks. test really takes 2mins tops. I'm working 10 people workshop, 3 tests per week mandatory, seeing peeps bit lax masks all, took serious balance out. I'm fully vaxxed laid back NZ? That‚Äôs completely false. Long covid many health impacts Covid major issues. depends draw line good enough. buy rapid antigen tests counter states? Whats rate death children 12 get covid? time, look Nov. 7 similar rise cases (125k day), US 1,000 deaths day. Right 300 deaths day. 

THAT'S power vaccines. 

(Not looking deaths Jan 30, since reflects 250k cases day time early Jan) It‚Äôs free consume less calories it‚Äôs free stop smoking. find hard justify people shouldn‚Äôt also forced stop unhealthy choices hard justify forced vaccine people. 

Especially since always make choice get protect yourself. First foremost, passport incentive get vaccinated. hardly stop spread even rigorous testing, judging fact delta variant everywhere.

Higjly mobile people high-risk group infection come contact people. Nah, let‚Äôs brush rug quietly agree conservative voters die, better.  Deaths lag 6 weeks. point policies point. Never realized powerful piece filter paper could point compare since NY enacted policies would limit spread deaths. got blindsided early since policies done well. Get third test cvs sure. Isolate meantime Looks like January 2022 Pfizer February 2022 Moderna. No. Yeah IQ largely genetic, argument could say stupid people refuse take vaccine victims predispositions ? 

I rarely resort ad hominem talking strangers sound ret*rded right now. whole Vaccine subject really brings worse people smh  I‚Äôm going back isolation. simply sacrifice I‚Äôm willing make vaccinated person.

To answer question, think it‚Äôs former - cities imposing mask mandates. yeah, probably see enforcement across America. think that‚Äôs ‚Äúworst‚Äù gets. Lockdowns would crippling ways economy.

If shots short supply, would feel guilty, literally person vaccine pharmacist told seeing handful people coming shots days. 

Might well get booster way. Every indication they'll recommended CDC coming weeks.

Last time checked smoking isn‚Äôt contagious mutates spreads innocents putting society large danger Given state health care system, delaying, least *pacing* rate infection still beneficial. threw masks sneezed people dying hospital hallways.

I wonder though, since clearly endemic, everyone's choice vax infection (and sometimes both).

Well fair, they‚Äôre understaffed. Solipsism. really disagree. correct measures partial immunity, level immunity different.

Full two doses roughly three times effective single dose. wanted weighted average (which would make approximate calculation slightly accurate), would support change things much. 57%/70% (1/2 doses) would roughly equivalent 60% fully vaccinated.

Which would put UK 20% higher vaccination rate. Still nowhere near double. point you‚Äôre vaccinated covid likely slightly harmful flus diseases never would changed behavior for.

True, easy (and ignorant) consider without choice. speaking generally sense office workers, though.

well thats big problem, country lot people go vaccinations center early morning sell place people came later. Presumably R number drops cycle virus, Delta R0 supposedly somewhere 4 9, lets say 5.

So 10 people infected, spread 50 people, 50 spread 250, 250 spread 1250, 6k, 31k, 156k, 781k, 3.9m, 19.5m...

i.e. within cycles reached unsustainable reproduction rate enough hosts R number naturally drop. combined mass vaccination might quickly lead R number swinging well 1 1.

That might complete nonsense I'm typical armchair expert thats reasoning I've come least...  Yeah, lack permanent WFH aspect incredibly frustrating me. We're currently month-to-month thankfully keep pushing back mandatory return work timeline extended 9/1/21 due Delta variant. frustrating...as fun bonus, sleek redesigned offices (because guess upper management got bored one talk away). new cubes shoulder high *awesome collaboration* (read: sarcasm) upon return.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Yeah last year crazy many fucking dumb. Everyone took vaccine they're still locking us making us wear masks. Two years later. Get brain, grow set think yourself. break infection rate? include asymptotic cases?  no. like fault car insurance vs no-fault. Every case becomes argument whose fault is. never ends fraught unfairness, anything else involves judgemental.  stop? Extreme sport, fault. Crossing street forgot look ways, fault. Slipping ice hurting back, fault. no. Everyone deserves health care, even idiots smoke, ones get vaccine. Society, whole, afford it. stupidity. lack science.  Companies done thing facial recognition. test things employees immediately handy.

They used thing medicines. Tested white men only. women. people color. senior citizens.

This time may well different though. Fewer masks, virulent strain. would really hate case certainly seem likely. fear. get tested now. left house times march 2020 months ago got second dose. primary reason booking vaccine earliest time could. work all.

I say that.

Please use incorrect arguments.

People responsible actions. Unfortunately take best decisions, spend effort get informed. Generally point vaccines reach herd immunity prevent transmission spreading vulnerable groups don‚Äôt get support vaccines. you‚Äôre able immunize population effectively stop spread like Polio chicken pox. virus high transmission rates, it‚Äôll mutate quicker evade vaccines possible natural immunity. 

So hope get enough people vaccinated R approached level slows spread virus. 

But currently vaccine appear offer protection hospitalization death, seems decline long ago get vaccine new variants. 

And viral load delta variant high enough infect others. wasn‚Äôt always case original strain. No, don‚Äôt. President literally constitutional authority force lockdowns. fed 18-49 age group. parents age group? Come on. scars smallpox vaccine  I'm fucking dead. case increase incalculatable 

Correct, case increase defined. That's always been, though. COVID threat healthcare system, testing tracking infections predictive proxy.

Alberta good example use here. going full-on batshit insane. public testing, quarantine, contact tracing, nothing. Hospitals epidemiologists flying blind. 

Doctors cursing government leaders news taking streets protest. unprecedented unconscionable Alberta doing. Feel like there's bit mis-communication (the blame would still fall CDC poor messaging). another article, CDC said \*are measuring\* breakthrough COVID cases, systemic fashion following cohorts looking \*all\* infections.

Assuming true, better way determine breakthrough cases, since people getting tested regardless symptoms collecting passive reporting data people hospitalized died, recognize that, epidemiologically, going give us best information regard rates breakthrough infection, passive data collection generally underreported,"" Walensky told reporters telephone briefing.  order counter that, collecting data 20 cohorts people. include **tens thousands people** following nationwide, include health care workers, essential workers, long-term care facilities, cohorts, **we're collecting PCR (test) data every person weekly**,"" Walensky added.  **we absolutely studying evaluating breakthrough infections** many different sites, many different people, across country. looking data weekly bi-weekly basis reporting soon.""  people testing weekly, whether show symptoms not, best way track asymptomatic infections.   Article probably written (auto generated) computer Miami Herald: Florida sets record 21,683 new COVID-19 cases reported Saturday, CDC could start sharing supply countries need it.

I'm sure 1k per day tickets, averag hotels, food, transit considered reasonable family four days. certainly seems upper middle class. could eliminate enormous amounts death looking everyone inside residences 365 days year, we'd car crashes, shootings, nothing, therefore must great model society, right? don‚Äôt get live longer planets time get vaccine. don‚Äôt want vaccine get sick, let rot don‚Äôt know waiting anti vaxxers resume normal life. die die cares Done DeSantised Florida.

But lose smell would pretty upsetting. Already feel better better. don‚Äôt know body would figure stop taking away smell I‚Äôd curious people get parsomia anosmia regain smell lose again. hope not.

But honestly, point I'm almost *against* restrictions. force anyone wear masks distance. let shit rage let us reach herd immunity. Burning Phil Valentines world bonus. narcissistic jerks want slightest thing prevent pandemic assumed would killing people. need approval admiration. desire prove anything you. please get vaccinated can. are.

Peer pressure incomprehensibly powerful age. fucking shit lol obviously, even source says correct. What, need get new shot every 2 months?  Looking forward post experience dealing long covid gone window

You're right, someone get vaccinated empathy went window long time ago. nice try Im fully vaccinated angry. nothing world, catastrophic event crisis, recieve 100% participation entire population help solve. world always be. refuse preach, belittle, angry people know still havent recieved vaccine. 80/70 damn good turnout. 

Also next variant terrified friend Jim refused get ""chipped"", less priviledged country didnt access vaccine wont long time. No, mean terms conditions first say share information third parties later say change terms conditions time without notice. don‚Äôt mind someone knowing vaccine status, gripes NY State decide give address, phone, email stuff ask for. (Yes, yes, know data shared everywhere anyway, line sand unless start requiring use app necessaries daily living.)

This may changed. decided using back April multiple (and reputable) cybersecurity specialists analyzed app found sloppy lacking. referring someone thought would reap rewards people vaccinating. Basically mooching. Since Republicans obsessed anti-mooch, politically Republican, Republican would ‚Äúviable‚Äù way compensate. people unvaccinated get sicker. like we're trying drag morons fire kicking screaming freedom.  ok? 

Glad know admit fake hate facts. sufficient research search `ACA tobacco surcharge?`  could excuse hide bad acne. People asymptomatic mild cases still risk long term organ damage, including loss brain matter. hoping vaccines would prevent that, research showing doesn't. Even people think fully recovered showing significant cognitive deficits organ damage scans. Anti-vaxxers posting subreddit. interpretation incredibly biased. 

Yes, vaccinated people get ill. likely morons spreading everyone. thing universal mask mandate legal mechanism federal government that, beyond places jurisdiction like military bases, federal buildings, airports, etc. Dems care anymore pretty much swept elections. telling everyone, watch, elections over, Dems reversal, shrug shoulders, never lock again. And, that's precisely California. cares china?  I'm mad, I'm disappointed. fucking lie? Pfizer moderna remember right partake warp speed money.

But sure revision away trumpet people still put money mouth declare bankruptcy fine. Forced vaccination end much higher percentage vaccinated people option. agree. far I‚Äôm concerned, fuckers die covid won‚Äôt care. there‚Äôs universal healthcare, also denied treatment. I‚Äôm feeling sorry people actually can‚Äôt get vaccine, immunosuppressed - actually makes even angrier stupid no-vax assholes. basically can‚Äôt normal life. Yes, agenda you‚Äôre going let go it. Let‚Äôs call day move on. No, I‚Äôm not. Definitely fake. ok? I'm sorry, that's entirely true. worry much unvaccinated, current rate spread Delta variant means catch it, spread it, could become incredibly sick it.  I've heard within next couple months

It happen end month. FDA pulled every available resource get done, getting lot flak experts unreasonably slow moved ""if want work vaccinated""

This basically guaranteed. business likely deal testing/masking/distancing *years*. cost enormous encourage (but all) get vaccine.

I agree. Fortunately, number unvaccinated people gets small enough, much harder overrun wish could get 3 year old vaccinated.

I wish could too! easier get vaccine ID???  kidding, it‚Äôs SARS-CoV-2, everyone calls COVID-19. variants haven‚Äôt anywhere near bad, compared SARS-CoV-1. common recent variants around 1% mortality rate many areas US, compared original SARS virus 2002-2004 10%. 02 version vary potent even survived, long lasting effects. Viruses evolve eventually optimize kill host fast, spread further, COVID-19 has. think recent versions anywhere close original, total dipshit. said, get strain remotely close world initially experienced first iteration SARS, screwed. like poor tax, guess. forced sub-optimal decisions reserves. huge problem without vaccine mandate general public take seriously enough go &amp; get shots, especially 40. seat belt laws, motorcycle helmets even driving intoxicated. took generation American pubic ""re-programmed"" thinking norms, civil liberty issues. Seems like problem republicans financial logistics. Projecting hate onto whole state people don‚Äôt like leadership doesn‚Äôt show sort intelligence, bias uninformed logic. HIV/AIDS still going.


Albeit that's easier avoid still. Get vaccinated Modest Proposal, satire good taught 100 years later. That‚Äôs impressive honest. easier get vaccine ID??? I‚Äôm sorry vaccine 39% effective, mean it‚Äôs 61% ineffective ? That‚Äôs hardly ‚Äúrare‚Äù.

It means 100 vaccinated people exposed Delta Variant, 39 develop symptoms 61 will. Bad bot cloth masks bought etsy shit! wearing n95 may well even bother doubling don‚Äôt understand point probability. OK. Keep repeating variant concern equally likely occur Australia Florida. probability exactly equal actually believe that. got chills raging headache 15 minutes first dose. recommend mixing rides + fair food + covid vaccine. can‚Äôt let burn world unabated

My viewpoint that's going happen anyway, assuming vaccine holdouts continue refuse. yes places (states, countries) vaccination rates reached steady-state, assuming remaining anti-vaxxers unpersuadable, there's really nothing else done. time get lives, come accelerate rate mutation

I think that's true. accept premise mitigations lengthen timeline rather lower ultimate fraction population infected, think mutation dynamics change. anything, mild-to-moderate mitigation measures would probably provide evolutionary pressure stronger variants arise, compared unencumbered spread.  CNN single COVID story front page right now. Why?   Health insurers especially, owned insurance company sure want hook bunch morons' insane hospital bills Covid treatment could gotten vaccine hell lot cheaper, avoided hospital first place. Also, public schools already require vaccines afaik. think covid vaccines different (especially full FDA approval) get angry want. 

Most unvaccinated hesitant FDA approval. It‚Äôs understandable hesitant taking quickly developed vaccine ever made. Give time. mean 50% Americans mad 50% I‚Äôve also read certain blood types fare better vs others forget details. I‚Äôm vaxxed risk averse hoping don‚Äôt get it. I‚Äôll first line booster say need it. happened America know? Use be, freedom choice live consequences.

All issues really big capitalistic America knew.

1. People right opt getting vaccine.
2. People right wear masks.
3. Insurance companies right cancel life insurance policy unvaccinated.
4. Insurance companies right increase monthly premiums unvaccinated.
5. Insurance companies right add clause refuse payment COVID-19 hospital stays.
6. Stores/Restaurants right refuse service.
7. would extremely easy verification system vaccinated (instead paper cards vogue 1930s). Lol. true. I‚Äôve seen backpedaling, good, many people suffered and/or died stupidity.  school GA zero measures taken, mask-optional stance, even ‚Äústrong recommendation‚Äù wear masks. kids supposed start tomorrow, I‚Äôm considering keeping home. district also removed virtual option. vaccine literally free stupid sack shit live inside second largest city Texas. distance learning options us school year, unfortunately. We've received countless updates superintendent. made statement last week acknowledging he's received requests thousands parents require masks school, hands tied. Abbot made can't anything. probably also help district's social media inundated photos summertime leadership conferences events mask sight. think would help immensely administration wore voluntarily set example. Software devs aren‚Äôt bound ethics. you‚Äôve money, isn‚Äôt terribly difficult find someone who‚Äôll write want. 

Even Apple kicks store, web app still developed bypasses walled gardens. unlikely put definitive stop it.  Recall him? We‚Äôll lucky doesn‚Äôt end president That's point. refuse vaccine, healthcare costs skyrocket. non-insured COVID hospitalization would bankrupt people. People still free make decision, forced put money mouth is. 

Don't want stop easily preventable disease? Cool, going cost you. It‚Äôs never gonna go away. People already living many going back lived happened. 

In fact, pandemics history ‚Äúended.‚Äù happened wife eight years ago, well Covid. Multiple hospital visits different hospitals different areas state, tons blood tests scans. took year figured lupus. favorite people medication high blood pressure well controlled medication, think high blood pressure.

I used work health care saw often have. need attack top 2 reasons people still haven‚Äôt gotten it. Concerned side effects waiting see it‚Äôs safe. Side effect concerns way overblown govt done good job addressing that. Where‚Äôs ‚Äúfor people, side effects modest last less 48 hours many people nothing worse sore arm‚Äù messaging? shame polarization gone far people actively wish others die (or least COVID lethal is) order prove point. mad government forcing businesses closed vaccinated, we're concerned variant may affect since higher viral load. 

I'll look booster, thank you!  Im fucking sick everything. 

These people deny vaccines safe, despite infinite sources saying otherwise. well every single arguement make disproven. 

They trying annoying, dangerous meanwhile. 

Im government harsh individuals like. unvaccinated people dangerous.  New studies show vaccination prevent person getting Delta variant also shows carry pass virus people. 

So regardless community vaccinated, would try withdraw school homeschool him. got conspiracy theories mixed up. actually Panama killed expose illuminati created flat earth. people knew true would figure need sail ships canal anymore. Haitians working Elon Musk super secret space program prove flat earth, Panamanians crab people let happen. Elon one knows true true he's trying tell us secret coded tweets designed manipulate bitcoin markets.

It's really complicated. Ah that‚Äôs tricky one. I‚Äôm Sheboygan there‚Äôs way hell they‚Äôre coming back, Milwaukee could see everyone still vector. half-right (or half-wrong), sense. ""properly"" locked California, certainly socially distancing pretty hard. metro area, certainly little eerie seeing way less cars road. People, part, staying put homes leaving necessities. putting people cannot protect risk

I've done thing. Get bent. time virus I‚Äôve seen conflicting answers theories/arguments. lockdown yet 2022 last chance get right believe nothing could done. grandson doesn‚Äôt issue wearing mask. problem is, wear protect kids exposing them, aren‚Äôt wearing one, won‚Äôt give protection needs. haven‚Äôt checked masks, I‚Äôm thinking kids aren‚Äôt wearing won‚Äôt want either.  Ok buddy   Americans vaccinated, new strand somewhat easily contained? Texas southern state, tend lax 

If introduced bill Texas legislature allowing every question homeschooling test 'Jesus Christ' correct answer would pass handily. difference there's simple free way get preferential queue. Get vaccine. best, paper supports finding symptomatic vaccinated unvaccinated people appear transmit similarly.

Exactly. People keep missing distinction. less likely get infected first place due vaccination going spread less unvaccinated person. % vaccinated stop? 85, 90?

85-90% would amazing. I'd say would good enough. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically.

Lots change needs happen Florida unfortunately it‚Äôs gonna take lot bad starts. nothing, mean absolutely nothing, change minds catch it, get sick, get hospitalized, die. 

On side we'll people literally claiming that, ""God spared Covid-19."" Check local county health department site. Many publishing breakthrough infection numbers. think need FDA approval start working variants since emergency auth one never able mandate vaccine. Period. Conservatives literally start civil war happens. don‚Äôt think realize rabid ‚Äúhaving choice‚Äù.

So need give choice:

Covid treatment covered insurance person vaccinated medically exempt vaccine.

If someone refuses vaccine without actual medical cause (such someone HIV, someone age 12), pay completely pocket Covid-related medical care get sick. Don‚Äôt treat them. Put quarantine camp. We're 1.5 years serious pandemic decades. 1918 flu took three years run course. one knows answer question yet, even scientists. soon speculate. ok knowing now.

The certainty is, adhere safety measures now, sooner controlled. Anti-maskers/vaxxers prolonging everybody. make sure smokers, bad eaters, people don‚Äôt exercise people take avoidable risks. son born extremely premature. time damage underdeveloped lungs could completely outgrow lung disease live full healthy life. he‚Äôs currently young mask vaccinate. gets vaccines he‚Äôs year old he‚Äôll last group get Covid vaccine. Lol thinks change people think... Changing people one hardest thing do... certainly excellent news. There's good graph compares cases deaths UK second wave Vs fourth wave. That's also partly fault government. States companies allowed send elsewhere since given government give people. another bit proof clueless ineffecient federal government is. They'd rather gold expire toss allow Kroger send elsewhere cousins kids risk. People vax higher risk. Thinking way exhausting. children face much risk riding car covid. think generally agree sentiment, constant fear extrapolation risk fool‚Äôs errand. data are. Children risk, anyone constant contact children. Maybe there‚Äôs something nefarious around corner; maybe there‚Äôs risk haven‚Äôt realized yet. However, potential risks part reality observe represented available data. would suggest do? 

I'm sure already considered every possible angle. case considered this, maybe find parents area similar dilemmas. Perhaps start childcare co-op guys take turns watching other's kids (verifying everyone vaccinated course). part pay co-op maybe take weekend/night shifts part.

I wish best luck. Plus, personal experience nursing regarded stable career option last couple decades. get trained, pretty good employment options decent pay. personally several acquaintances became nurses failing many aspects managing personal lives. Cousins wife's side became nurse borderline homeless multiple children care for. grandparent essentially paid schooling, forced grow enough hold job. trust people medical care, lookout people like whenever need care.  


For record, also know plenty great nurses. I'm judging everyone past mistakes. know several ""got nursing job"" still continue make terrible decisions. fucking angry least Los Angeles, areas highest population unvaccinated poor urban areas high concentration blacks Latinos. Instead educating communities (with clear concise messages), suggesting ‚Äúpunish‚Äù restricting access amenities common areas. 

Wow, progressive empathetic take ‚Äúcaring‚Äù folks got vaccinated ‚Äúprotect others.‚Äù joke. dumbass receptionist work like, ""I want things get back normal"" yet refuses get vaccine. Dear diary‚Ä¶ know article referring still boils ""experts believe vaccination may assist natural immunity."" simply states conclusions without evidence.

Otherwise though, I'll totally honest - longer trust read COVID. know sounds, representative treat issues, believe legitimacy quality information goes issue becomes politicized. situations like fall back makes sense intuitively, getting vaccine COVID months ago make sense.

It's sides media social structure

Everything leading towards chaos, global control system savior humanity Nah man fine fuck playing basketball mask lmao. signs point mild symptoms vaxxed.  Tell people make vaccines make plasma Valid points, however, current culture tend forget socialization outside peer age group socialization. many cultures, children surrounded bunch kids age every day. know many people would argue actually better development surrounded diverse group, especially people better influence peers, like older neighbors etc. We've homeschooled pandemic son benefitted company adult neighbors able play safely outdoors, chat mailman, etc. We've traveled camped met lots nice people ages taught fish safe social distancing I'm glad got awesome experience seeing nice learn others skill don't.

The way avoid hit herd immunity ASAP easiest safest way vaccines. currently basically ticking time bomb good escape mutation developing putting us right back square one. someone unvaccinated thanks realizing alternative shut like masks vaccination. bad Dumbfucksantis literally threatening strip funding schools/cities mask mandates. psychiatrist, shaming guilting WORK.

If truly want people get vaccinated looking reason gatekeep ""normalcy"", stop incredibly condescending posts.

I undo shit hospitals patients decompensated come start talking covid ""leftist hoax"".

It's people pushing away shit like this. Stop. Well asked trump Latinos voted president. maybe let‚Äôs assume Hispanic people Democrats. sounds like best thing do, tbh! interesting point raise. piggyback ended.

There saying story Buddhism consists Monk peace, meditating mountain, leave mountain devoured lions. Buddhists encouraged find ‚ÄòMountain‚Äô return often. also encouraged leave metaphorical Mountain put teachings work help others. Fight lions come back soon.

For Buddhists, engaging meditating way keeping lions bay, words staving poisons caused living. 

I full-heartedly agree life cause poisoning heart deadening happiness. tough counter poisons.  Propaganda Lockdowns meant concerts sporting events crowds. worry voting block dying off. Unfortunately people listen politics instead doctors reason. went 7/11 briefly last night wearing mask teenagers line weren‚Äôt practicing social distancing.

Then woke morning headache stomach ache. y‚Äôall think asymptomatic Covid? long hopefully info breakthrough cases Alex Morse, town manager Provincetown, said Twitter 900 cases linked cluster, ""there deaths, 7 hospitalizations, symptoms largely mild."" concerning, it‚Äôs still within margins expected vaccine work.

As far hospitalization data, it‚Äôs based surveys current hospital census. find plentiful reports Google.  cares let die, idiots‚Ä¶ vaccinated people give shit unvaccinated people get corona unvaccinated people don‚Äôt care?

Because get sick, allow body incubators new mutations virus (like Delta Variant). mutations could potentially immune vaccine, means vaccinated people get sick too. see numbers moderates? see conservatives upset, expected literally everyone since it‚Äôs sitting Republican president.  received vaccine, symptomatic, receive priority non vaccinated? enough beds/plasma supply go around right now? draft people fight war; force people get vaccinated.  Unvaccinated kids lower risk death covid vaccinated adults.

350 kids died, population 75 million. 1200 fully vaccinated ppl died breakthrough infection, population 165 million. fucking take homelessness keep kid alive

If loses job he'd lose health insurance though. America, suck. might better using advice medical professionals health instead feelings. Google hard.

Good luck everyone   Bet vaccinated proving government got vaccine would violation HIPAA rights. /s aren‚Äôt ‚Äúgetting way‚Äù vaccinated people spread it, too. 

Don‚Äôt let assholes divide us. vaccine promised answer turns wasn‚Äôt. Don‚Äôt mad people didn‚Äôt take it/can‚Äôt take it. Medicine guessing game sometimes vaccine makers guessed little wrong. glad vaccine lower rates critical illness death. know vaccinated people still contract pass others.
Don‚Äôt let divide us!! It‚Äôs us versus it‚Äôs humans versus virus.  They‚Äòll get control days mass testing strategy.
I don‚Äôt understand pretty much countries took approach. key relative success welding people homes testing whole city days outbreak. Death risk, though. Unlike diseases, Covid seems confer longterm organ damage, including brain, even among become seriously ill. I'm dooming kid life lower cognitive function masks annoying.

What bad reactions problems people due vaccine ? don‚Äôt count yea? mask won‚Äôt protect him. vaccine will.

and presumed meant vaccinated, shed less unvaccinated. I've Delta variant produces similar viral loads vaccinated, unvaccinated: CDC

and am, somewhat, confused. Keep friend, I‚Äôm exact boat. Maybe selfish, sorry. Don‚Äôt care. Sure! Since virus prevalent spreading fast, it'll burn unvaccinated population really fast. least part pandemic pretty quickly.

Those us reasonable people get mRNA vaccines pathogens. Hopefully things like universal flu, HIV, Lyme, certain cancers, chagas, MERS, RSV, New viruses, etc.

Employment vaccinated much easier. Oh, wonder he‚Äôs /s little, late. also quite satisfying antivaxers mostly people like many reasons well tbh,in country die hard religious,nationalists alot anti society love comforts society people.I gonna miss them,we many anyways. data also show unvaccinated least intelligent. case, correlation equals causation. simply misinformed. 

A lot French people old read chain mail day. French people don‚Äôt speak English can‚Äôt access English language articles news. 

And lot prominent anti covid vaccine people given radio time tv time (look Didier Raoult). It‚Äôs like cult‚Ä¶ got vaxxed.

I'm also really enjoying lightening fast 5G connection I'm plugged into, really reason it, lol.

Yes, includes vaccine status. honestly even know disingenuous understand basic probability, like people. Hanlon's Razor, right? Well, although think appeal good, different stance children. ask hunch. immune system different. neccessarily condemn people vaccinating children 12. :) tried checking profile, German, idea.  spreading misinformation completely resent that. point vaccination alone end pandemic. want social distance forever, far it, take extra measures besides vaccination, we're suffering death. Reputable scientists agree. Vaccinations part answer, full relaxation non-pharmaceutical interventions happened time individuals population already vaccinated probability emergence resistant strain greatly increased. Consequently, show period transmission reduction close end vaccination campaign substantially reduce probability resistant strain establishment. results suggest policymakers individuals consider maintaining non-pharmaceutical interventions transmission-reducing behaviours throughout entire vaccination period. wear seatbelt air bags roads full drunk drivers. 

Am stupid, drunk drivers? Agree 100%, conspiracy theorists evidence censorship (rather evidence support position, often completely absent) confirmation they're right. Also already approved sent two stimulus checks checks there‚Äôs reason assume couldn‚Äôt again. Unvaccinated people suffer sort penalty something. fucking ridiculous. I've multiple people work stupid get it, gotten either bad time bad regret mild case justifies getting it. FUCK. True! Let's hope taken air good Anti-vaxxers complain COVID biological weapon China, yet refuses take precaution protecting ""weapon"" vaccines masks. Yeah, like realizing need regularly go bars, restaurants, concerts, social events, etc. fulfilling existence.

Or, realizing need many material goods thought needed.

Use less, socialize smaller circle. Good things.  country needs do, China covid, we‚Äôd live covid free world. even talking about? Wearing mask pure misery, especially summer heat.

We‚Äôve told countless times vaccine end goal. got shot personally. It‚Äôs time end. unvaccinated unfortunately made they‚Äôre decision, willing suffer consequences they‚Äôre actions. fact, mandates like entrench side unvaccinated point government lied mandates stay. unfortunately 100% right that. 

My fellow Americans got shot held responsible happens them. They‚Äôll likely fine, ones die unvaccinated, knew risks knew facing. unvaccinated choice continue quarantining risk all. vaccinated, there‚Äôs reason scared afraid anything. Quarantining vaccinated utterly useless. Money language many antivaxxers understand. That's self-proclaimed freedom-obsessed ""patriots"" ""never let government tell do"" give ""morals"" chance win money state sponsored lottery program. Actually, blacks lowest vaccination rate, followed Hispanics. Again, listened bad advice took heart. vaccines going ticket back concerts travel stuff almost everybody took them, clear wouldn‚Äôt case. 

In times, bars friends nights week, going excellent concerts regularly, getting passport stamped whenever money time so. sick, miss life. hope return day, day isn‚Äôt today, know real thing worth waiting for. vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean everyone countries like same, don‚Äôt want dickhead shows demands service it‚Äôs safe *me* that.

It‚Äôs nightmare feel like it‚Äôs mostly enabled digital age gives platforms people saying stupid stuff day people WANT hear feeds fears. People don‚Äôt fear can‚Äôt see guess. It‚Äôs matter personal opinion. People see monster, don‚Äôt think anyone right life. one deserves die, don‚Äôt deserve live either. It‚Äôs job protect it‚Äôs job protect me. interact society necessary, isn‚Äôt obligation keep alive vis versa. see Darwinism taking place Given infectious transmissible delta variant even in/by vaccinated population, lacking long-term solution better lacking solution‚Ä¶ natural herd immunity know information that's coming right would considered good news. substantial retreat people thinking months. 

It means things like travel bans need stay place even vaccinated. means large, superspreader events still dangerous. means large groups meeting indoors (or even outdoors) still dangerous. means resuming crowded office-style workplaces still iffy. means things like masks protective strategies still necessary whether vaccinated not.

The news certainly one hundred percent bad, appears vaccines still improve odds greatly become infected covid, great important. triumphalism last months appears really overblown. First complete long term testing quickly others, impressive sort of. Last scale production level Covid deaths country actually still reach record daily levels, eh kinda misses point vaccines, oh well. sounds good, testing there? honest numbers? lower Sunday? *""Some vaccinated Americans lost patience refusing shot""...* say?

For information, ""t*hose""* refusing jab half country!  Best follow precautions earlier, vaccination - masking, hand washing sanitizing, spacing (especially indoors, also outdoors close confines), etc.

No way. gave much get us point, give people tools protect themselves. gonna tell nothing people choose use them. never lifted mandate. going impossible go back now. Exactly. take account margin error we're looking stats trying extrapolate areas. I've seen lot people taking national averages international trends applying regional outbreaks. like calling state Alabama Democrats national presidential poll shows 5 point gap. New York UK probably terrible comparison, though important remember UK kept public health restrictions place throughout initial outbreak covid country rather fully opened. also demographics, vaccine type prevalance comorbidities. hospitalizations Florida good sign areas without strong vaccine uptake though. make fun Florida lot uptake state level average. number states currently fighting outbreaks left bell curve. peoples dying large unvaccinated choice. Kids extremely low risk hospitalized dying people immunocompromised taking steps protect themselves. 

Antivaxxers certainly don‚Äôt care hurt me, obligated care them? don‚Äôt. care much antivaxxers drunk drivers. that's case, disingenuous. whole pandemic anti-mask anti-vaccine crowd using rhetorical trick. like say survival rate 99.998%. get number dividing deaths total population. bullshit bullshit people trying fight pandemic it. I‚Äôm stunned many nurses know anti-vaccine. truly didn‚Äôt know two could go hand-and-hand don‚Äôt trust anyone taking care loved one moron.  You‚Äôre correct looking local stats US. Regardless people talk Israel 90% vaxxed. soon 12yo daughter able get it, I‚Äôm brother. Maybe relationship size unvaccinated population government issuing lockdowns? Unpopular opinion... Given amount refused vaccination virus will, already, become endemic. continue make rounds much like ""common"" cold influenza...

Cough Thankfully, infrastructure produce virus scale technology allows rapid retooling combat variants.

We might go back short lockdown retool distribute booster shot, going like before. 

The stupid continue die, big deal. Unfortunately, innocent can't get vaccinated legitimate reasons die continue live trapped life.

When comes COVID mostly rely sources bit closer science (TWiV, World Data, etc) find journalists often put spin facts‚Ä¶ hey, guess it‚Äôs taking different sources weighing information best can. No, logic 90% require 3rd dose based updated information they've seen effective vaccines currently are. feel deep empathy children IDIOT anti vax parents going get killed.

I contacted Gov. Cuomo's office asking start making state Covid hot spot travelers quarantine mingling amongst us. appealed getting vaxed personal protection able carry transmit ppl can't get vax. Unvaccinated ppl nullifying hard work &amp; sacrifice taken get here. Enough enough! Get vaxed! I‚Äôm American feeling similar U.K. despite vaccine uptake pretty good.

I lost Mother Grandmother Covid, Covid mother died. got shots soon could. I‚Äôve taken seriously Day 1, yet seems people responsible suffered most.

While also doomed hear people trying delegitimise grief, put everyone else risk childish shirking social responsibilities. want one exploding backyard? dunno source doesn‚Äôt strike credible. Several infectious disease docs pointing even CT value virus noses isn‚Äôt solid proof vaxxed folks spread. Maybe let‚Äôs lay weird financial websites Covid news? Thanks wall text. üëç Uh, University Guelph community college. read another article explained banned. Denying covid exists and/or claiming hydrocloriquine prevent infection etc. Medical misinformation covid denialism European politics radically different own, citizenry greater degree trust government. won‚Äôt happen here. Yes, concern vaccinated people might lead virus getting mutation. correct, infection within vaccinated unvaccinated people could lead mutation. you‚Äôre ignoring reality staring face. concerned vaccinated people wearing mask want come reddit try convince people like wear mask, failing see millions upon millions never get vaccinated accord. fight fighting people like me, waste time. want devote time truly solving problem, you‚Äôd advocating government forced vaccinations, something unwilling do. So, since government doesn‚Äôt want act, unvaccinated don‚Äôt want act, see reason concern putting mask ‚Äúprotect others‚Äù. It‚Äôs simple. would completely change tune Biden came vaccine mandate forced every citizen get vaccine punish didn‚Äôt. Then, would see everyone‚Äôs best interest wear mask little longer. then, nah. I‚Äôm good.   5-10% traced transmissions occur outdoors according meta-study last fall. vaccinated much less likely infected.

Only vaccine stopped breathing. know, I'm pedantic, becoming infected virus mean overcoming immunity even physical Enough vaccinations still essentially end delta variant.

Not unless vaccinated animals carry covid. think got strong case fantasy gone wild there. sounds eerily familiar bother logic. People tired careful safe exhausted caring next person. point I'd wager people would go movie theater bar even told would 100% kill another person did. Even covid basically hated other, reasons to.

Since early July 2021, SARS-CoV-2 cases United States increased coincident delta SARS-CoV-2 becoming predominant lineage nationwide [3]. Understanding virus spreading settings high vaccine coverage important public health implications. particularly important assess whether vaccinated individuals become infected transmit SARS-CoV-2 others. Wisconsin, large local contract laboratory provides SARS-CoV-2 testing multiple local health departments, providing single standard source data using assay measure virus burdens test-positive cases. includes providing high-volume testing Dane County, county extremely high vaccine coverage.

Please advise . Ty Nah, problem there's New Orleans, Parish there's ""burbs"", mainly Jefferson Parish. Night day. use hospitals. Sure. mean live privilege nothing.  still don‚Äôt think so. aren‚Äôt enough medically vulnerable people left unvaccinated.

I would choose vaccine every day.

See link towards bottom, called ""Vaccine Virus"". point possible charge guys crimes humanity? /s really /s. indefinitely- hopeless federal government started build quarantine facilities build last year overseas Australian citizens come home.

It criminal left overseas long useless rich people celebrities come gone.

That still reason open uncontrolled international travel time virus still spreading mutating.

Just travel world fast mean right now.

Time tell correct response this.

I don‚Äôt think letting virus rampage population correct one.  don‚Äôt understand live age information connectivity still little perspective anything. literally entire wealth humankind‚Äôs knowledge sitting pocket day. use play fucking candy crush what. already treating such. issue vaccines allow host body transmit virus, easily non-vaccinated bodies... causing rapid mutation

This happens. question assumes things true. Yep. watch. come back bite them. feel fine day, next day that's little rough. going hung diarrhea fair anyway. work know vaccine efficacy wanes 6 months, especially true exposure infectious Delta variant.

Many vaccinated people places like Florida experience breakthrough infections. going need maximum capacity dedicated COVID. better question whether vaccinated breakthrough cases given priority triage unvaccinated cases, good luck getting done. Self harm Stupid people stupid. news, sun rose morning. Back you, Ted. Vaccines work differently different animals, can‚Äôt give current vaccine. yes already vaccinate animals COVID. Bovine covid around years get vaccinated strain. Already happening Europe. Well think we're talking 2 different things, delta transmissive, reducing efficacy vaccines much initially thought, variants begining show lower efficacy. Geez, made comment much wave? Never guessed. freedom shouldnt depend creatieve smart. said, I'm pro vax think measurements drop, way more, wait one month. course did! wondering word going for. Thanks! think change minds many people got vaccine yet. They're dug listening reason is. approved they'll cling bs reason trust/get vaccine. Yep. start telling pay back stimulus checks 2022 taxes. you‚Äôre willing take steps stop pandemic don‚Äôt deserve money allocated help financial burden pandemic (assuming don‚Äôt medical reason able get vaccine). Potentially. 

That could happen may people like treating eventuality. Yeah, seemed like county added booth excuse require masks distancing vaccination requirements. True actually mutation map immune escape, send want however provides effect virus combos provide immune escape.But know variant can't completely escape vaccines because;
 First vaccines provide polyclonal antibodies. Mutations escape antibody types example R346K mutation B.1621 variant escape C135 isotope antibodies however vaccines even mutation provides escape antibody type can't escape others. Bloom lab actually categorize antibodies 3 class. mutation combo E484K+K417N+G446V dangerous mutations(escape) antibody classes still even see huge drop worst scenario (11 fold antibody decrease example) vaccines still protection level 

Second immunity mean antibodies write Chise's tweet great hand, know people susceptible propaganda ... virus stay. much true. disagree vaccination strategy able overcome virus mutation.

Any spike protein change sufficient completely evade vaccine antibody detection, undoubtedly longer good ACE2 binder. Thus virus evade vaccine, good coronavirus longer. Production. Yep same. Mine young. disagree. Turning millions Americans second-class citizens atrocious idea backfire. contest election results. bet we‚Äôll seeing lot on. mean get it, point, like didnt see coming idk tell you. logical human knew coming.

I like 10 steps ahead policy, politicians county health workers. anyone America ever forethought ability look ahead think hmm..whats going happen 2 months.

I laughing ass people thinking COVID lasting 2 fucking weeks. considered better? worry, lot will. Delta ain't going anywhere. not?

Anyone claim anything publish anyone else believe it. Large groups morons get organized powerful online.

Perfect conditions go right back middle ages war. stupidity happening every country. There‚Äôs nowhere go avoid even want to. think Pfizer pumping stock month, Pfizer announced seen waning immunity coronavirus vaccine, saying picking efforts develop third dose protect people variants.

If so, trust vaccine all? genuinely believe people time dead bodies remotely capable feeling guilt shame. know. bring one back around! took months. people sub come Florida get head back straight. much antivax deserve fate, everyone else hurt hospitals full. hospital area isn‚Äôt surgeries require night stay. Think that. Got cancer? fucking bad. 

You know infected vaccinated people spread virus need wear mask around others businesses. side want on? sure loved one never need non-covid hospital care?

Until let unvaccinated die instead soaking hospital resources, is. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hard make finish line carrying several million pounds unvaxxinated dead weight.  True. Masks definitely nuisance me. Summer better, masks glasses good mix winter. I'm going get contacts probably go back glasses even pandemic gone. Masks both, protect *and* people. higher quality mask, higher filtration well. One thing I‚Äôve seen going around don‚Äôt mind people name variants shitty leaders allow happen, would make one Modi. think deserves name one, India nation not, calling Modi variant pretty fair. Vaccine passports getting winter season masks lot stop spread. earlier get vaccine passports place shorter crisis be. NY digital vaccine proof system, it‚Äôs electronic security sketchy best. Dude. We‚Äôd make better progress beating people accept realty sensational headlines. 

I‚Äôll see five years I‚Äôll still COVID amount mask wearing fix keep reading sensational headlines. Fight good fight. People conned always hard time admitting it. It‚Äôs loss self esteem can‚Äôt handle. Guilt nothing it. Thank you. No, mean actually irresponsible. wearing masks hospitals public transit places totally reasonable. Things like moving mask aside cough. we're blaming. are. point world fully vaccinated time soon. Western countries part vaccinate folks poorer countries. means pandemic continue waves rich people pay vaccinate whole world. selfish morons West - self-centered think stupid, violent society anti-vaccine rhetoric -- share resources rest world. instead arrogantly assume society causing variants spread ok wear masks advocate corona parties since people priveleged society given option vaccinate. People sure quick assume vaccinated antivaxxers...(regarding earlier post husband).


Remember, outside Europe NA, parts world, getting vaccine age 60 difficult. Exactly.

I sympathy someone medical field asshat Many suffering. know who‚Äôs suffering? Total fucking assholes. many get away attitude completely. Unless close family member dies (ie finally affect THEM) suddenly give fuck. may need see lot nurses holding anti vaxx signs probably  I'm saying I've stopped masking (I haven't). I've stopped using masks protect people. I‚Äôm sure end well making factual comparison. 3/4 cases recent outbreaks vaccinated people. First, asking political question, there's avoiding politics. know political taken exclusively mean one party one politician, including rules subreddit, political also means common issues - like public health.

For vaccinated, public health issue multiple reasons. Healthcare systems become overwhelmed unvaccinated patients, receive timely care things. may immunocompromised people people can't receive vaccine lives. vaccine helps long covid rates, bring 0, even 0.0001.

It tempting imagine every man island, affected going around them, look vaccine status. that's world works. vaccinated much better fewer cases community.

I'm sure worried best term, vaccinated move lives need lose sleep it, still need care it. people refusing get vaccine reason virus mutated delta variant. Around 3 weeks ago went Techno rave required proof vax negative test... check anything got in.

I like ""welp hope fear denied entry enough insure everybody tested vaxxed"" me. I'm bitches. Vaccine passports necessary. It‚Äôs even unusual mandate vaccines. unprecedented crisis. I‚Äôm mentally exhausted year half. We‚Äôve taken precautions could, top newborn start last year. spouse got vaccinated soon available. hoped past couple months finally turning corner yet again. honestly don‚Äôt mind wear mask stores, everything else exhausting. Navigating family drama due anti-vax sentiment, working people refuse think virus real. ""People already vaccinated Sinopharm Sinovac given AstraZeneca third booster dose,"" Hun Sen said speech broadcast social media. ""For Cambodians vaccinated AstraZeneca, Sinovac given third dose,"" added.

Interesting approach.  They‚Äôll fired soon enough, continue refuse. country enough Murdock family laughing way bank free advertising Sky News BS. No, time well spent correcting dumbasses think covid vaccinated longer need wear mask.

There ""we"" here, working *against* eradication virus, spreading disinformation.

The government already convinced, shitting pants forecasts, problem population unreachable fantasy land, like \*cough\* present company. know lots low risk young people fully vaccinated now. Sure, knew doctors, got waiting lists, saw slots online, went private vaccination centers. One doctor hometown got hands 3,000 AZ vaccines vaxxed basically everyone wanted. So, bit creativity, smartness research lots young people get vaccines early on.

Less half us fully vaccinated, becoming evident won‚Äôt ever reach even 60% long mandated. antiVa ones won‚Äôt wear masks self-isolate they‚Äôre sick, bunch bio-weapons spreading country. I‚Äôm teacher Texas, governor made illegal mandate masks, even schools, requiring students attend in-person classes starting three weeks. it‚Äôs going get bad. Buckle up, America! Masked people also spread covid Accurate  think you‚Äôre frustration reasoning sound not, ‚Äúvaccines bad!‚Äù might stressed whole situation venting. get flu shot year? Realistically doubt boosters would ever thing yearly. HIPAA killed us, literally, stemming flow something people need see get board. one's life going affected merely seen ICU, closeup shots. percentage stuff still implies pretty good efficacy high vaccination rates among staff (93% one hospital), that's bad news.

But second part good looking bad winter surge (esp. mean staff could get vaccinated). Aka pretty good efficacy still good absolute risk. things good vaccinated, unvaccinated absolutely fucked, still good efficacy good place.

Might wishful thinking bet infected staff got infected letting guard going bars like. words, hopefully vaccinated people ride wave careful Delta subsides here. good point. study wrong several fronts. First we‚Äôre going take years hit level vaccination it‚Äôs oooking US. premise need non vaccine interventions succesfully vaccinate wisfhful thinking practical policy proposal. Second, whether US interventions resistant strains eventually pop rest world. entire world could collectively work tomorrow towards global vaccination would take years. top won‚Äôt poor countries get completely fucked terms vaccine access. We‚Äôve seen delta doesn‚Äôt matter new variants eventually spread they‚Äôre fit enough. paper isn‚Äôt living reality hoping glean useful information video included article interviewing someone changed mind getting vaccine.

Call police country!? think sub circle jerk death it‚Äôs little sad. fact matter Britain thing happen almost deaths followed. I‚Äôm worried.  might need tighten definition ""stalking"" little bit. word means. measles mumps

Most countries thousand cases illnesses **per year**, greatly reduces rate mutation. COVID-19 orders magnitude cases **per day**. Hence, rate mutation orders magnitude higher. Whereas may take centuries others mutate resistant variant, COVID months. Obviously four, difficult find out. correct.

When get vaccinated, immune system learns recognize several different locations virus‚Äôs spike protein. virus mutates, long *some* locations still look same, still protection.

And even get infected variant, immune system cool trick called ‚Äúaffinity maturation‚Äù means refine/update antibody production favor antibodies best job targeting new strain. even immune system needs respond new strain doesn‚Äôt match vaccine, still huge head start unvaccinated person comes long take mount effective immune response fight virus off. Iv read delta variant 1000 times transmissible original strains. What‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs flimsy fabric mask supposed do? Serious question here. seems like waste time energy.  like employers would asking entire medical record - vaccination certificate theres pandemic. Keyword can. feel man, able work year, depressing af. in-laws friends family tested positive (all vaxed) hour ago, stay safe friend, darkest dawn. Stay safe, stay strong. Much love proof age required? make month older? 

If everyone else gets ignore truth risk death others consequence, seems fair able pretend 11 year old 12 make things better. need provide proof vaccination Mumps prior entering Broadway show? x100. accept restrictions--we one thing would actually make difference. Forever lockdowns fringe idea places too. statement doesn‚Äôt say videos information led decision according BBC article that‚Äôs problem have. think detailed possible opposition doesn‚Äôt much argument action , else measures counterproductive.

I‚Äôve seen reports vaccinated people less 1% chance infection obviously misleading compares entire vaccinated population breakthrough cases everybody‚Äôs exposed covid. We‚Äôve also intentionally scaled testing. Ive seen reports referring unvaccinated variant factories vaxxed people transmit virus much counterparts. taking data manipulating favor ur viewpoint imo rather providing entirety information situation allowing audience draw conclusions. know government isn‚Äôt going force vaccines ‚Äî it‚Äôs political would play fear mongering right. 

Your all-or-nothing logic incredibly backwards. would feel frustrated reasoning wearing mask, head far ass it‚Äôs probably effective mask anyways. get it. People spent long time masking vaccine billed end that. masks back table, almost one wants mask wearing mask really suck, especially hot environments summer. 

However, vaxxed keep mind: wear masks, anti-vaxxers won‚Äôt, we‚Äôll continue increase chances live anti-vaxxers increase chances don‚Äôt.

Basically, even you‚Äôre safe virus, it‚Äôs best interests mask keep numbers high anti-vaxxers anti-maskers continue dwindle drain, unclog health system us appreciate it. 

In mind, time silly empathy over. need everything make us survive, lot won‚Äôt. What? kills helluva lot people overweight.

We also capacity work one thing time. Well us anyway. /r/hermancainaward another person replied said, foregone conclusion happen means.

The vaccine targets spike protein, binds cells respiratory tract. order evade vaccine, spike protein change. changes much, can't bind cells infect us anymore. threading thin needle.

Now, might point vaccine efficacy slightly eroded. true, sort of. delta variant much infectious leading larger viral loads overwhelming people's antibodies, getting sick. vaccine still works, getting overwhelmed. boosters looking even another, updated vaccine. one again.

Find hope wherever find let go. pandemic shown us shit people be, everyone. There‚Äôs nothing wrong Correct. It‚Äôs rhetorical. It‚Äôs people‚Äôs job force people protect themselves. Quit histrionic, trying push egotistical moral high ground. Dude responsible anyone‚Äôs deaths. saying likes kind excuse something. Reddit still ‚Äúreport COVID disinformation‚Äù option year half? ‚Ä¶cuz that‚Äôs shit is. I'd say biggest issue Rona fact patients, icu's, treatment centers display.

This big elephant room one talks about. HIPAA major contributor spread COVID, almost zero news videos coming hospitals, they're tight adhering laws. leaves average American trust word mouth stories firsthand experience. different story 1980s AIDS epidemic unfolding... got see many, many times TV investigative reports progression disease like. mean‚Ä¶. government protecting stupid people it‚Äôs getting way living normal life people get vaccinated sense. open doors let people suffer consequences decision. Enough coddling already  recommended. Honestly something come health wise, hospitals may able help help well. COVID. hospitals get overburdened everyone suffers. pro-life never anything quality life. sounds better saying anti-abortion.  Though get mean, think even social services improve lives, still death penalty things like public health.. apparently transfer's over.

Which know really abortion, controlling woman's body, punishment sex (regardless rape), treating lessers equals  clearly true. I've never much trouble figuring terms getting vaccine getting knowing listen to. I've read getting covid much worse potential chance side effects vaccine, time family member ER nurse telling patients coming heart related issues never present got vaccine. I'm torn getting now, waiting vaccine longer period time unvaccinated going create variant controlled vaccines...and going back square 1... they're bunch pansies. think bad idea. wrong, think that.

But say right unvaccinated people knowingly endanger others flatly false legal matter.  isn‚Äôt meant anti-mask, get annoyed argument masking essential help prevent mutation deadly variant. 

At best argument comes lacking perspective, worst self-centered shows special people think are. 7.6 billion people world, many doesn‚Äôt privilege mass vaccination. mutations happen, scale world especially impoverished areas don‚Äôt privilege free vaccinations, working home uber eats. 

It vaccinated people local town went maskless Costco. 

I say someone vaccinated follow CDC guidance wear mask local numbers drop threshold. However, hopefully help local healthcare system. I‚Äôm I‚Äôm delusion I‚Äôm special I‚Äôm making difference future mutation virus. know people hate term, point populations really ‚Äúlive‚Äù Covid. Especially children fair amount time get vaccinated. doesn‚Äôt mean pretending doesn‚Äôt exist living life like used to, though.

It might mean rolling mask mandates based hospitalization numbers. case numbers. don‚Äôt think ever see mass shut downs again. don‚Äôt see gathering sizes limited. Technically, people vaccinated less impact see hospitals.

The world reach herd immunity mixture vaccines natural infection. know sucks immunocompromised, point need let don‚Äôt want get vaccinated risk lives Covid infection. Mandating vaccine isn‚Äôt going something countries do.

Lots die, isn‚Äôt wanted beginning? live lives way want die, die? feel like issue expectations probably marketing. People go fair get vaccinated. thought of, really get tetanus booster soon, never popped head fair.

Zero Covid lunacy mathematically impossible point well. Lets also talk issues variants shall we? Genomic surveillance ideally watch variants may end resistant vaccines, polyclonal abs conferred bu vaccines, highly doubt full escape variant renders vaccine completely useless emerges anytime soon, shouldn‚Äôt tempt fate obviously. think it‚Äôs individual company I‚Äôm sure Walmart corporate employees sick days you‚Äôre worried them. good point. big difference see vaccine alcohol/drugs/obesity individual decisions affect whole society. also need protect can‚Äôt vaccinated didn‚Äôt enough reaction. anyone care months coddling people US rest world facing death serious illness can‚Äôt vaccinated?

What's ""government control"" endgame? What's big goal? information could possibly get already voluntarily given them? Bill Gates want know do? Nobody cares do. Everything stupid. get mad antivaxxers without known polio (or anything similar) first hand. can't imagine amount indignation father feel people. He's antiva arguing bad faith. what‚Äôs endgame, then? even vaccinated people spread virus get long COVID, ever get back normal? decide, we‚Äôve vaccinated super-high portion population, long COVID something we‚Äôll live with? accept COVID common-cold-like virus (for vaccinated people) carries potential cripple people forever? hope therapies treatments developed point road? get long COVID compelling reason want stop spread, but... end? work lucky enough kept job pandemic. live family dog...

I'm still absolutely bored, exhausted depressed Covid. saw friends person past 18 months whatever, nowhere really go nothing do. Feels like I'm literally wasting life.

Obesity bad, infectuous. key difference. everyone needs employment make money

lol like half people refusing make 40k, living stocks. people get flu vaccine. Compared covid, reason to. covid magnitude dangerous.  anti-vaxx take wrong. vaccine isn‚Äôt risky. getting vaccinated risk.  would done differently? wont go full lockdown scale things back, get groceries brought car, hang fully vaccinated people etc. go full lockdown again, vaccinated protection might well mitigate damage idiots surround us don‚Äôt even know point. spent last year half working extra hours; wore mask, got vaccinated moment could, even ran entire state‚Äôs vaccination program month (minus two day scare exposed someone positive) I‚Äôve literally delayed beginning rest life year half and‚Ä¶ go again.

What else could done? defeating. ~~song~~ pandemic never ends say forever. 

It seems Americans, lacking good understanding vaccines work, locked two equality bad extremes: One side thinks vaccines contains tracking chips alter one's DNA. side thinks vaccines sort anti-COVID personal forcefield receive two doses, invulnerable virus, masks mandates social distancing immediately discarded, even less 90% global population fully vaccinated yet.

Like not, virus continue mutate around world, even US vaccinated. chances vaccine resistant strain popping negligible.  swear I‚Äôve seen exact image used like 20 articles today. rough hand, friend. hope things turn around quickly. really feel bad today's schoolchildren. school shootings, cyber bullying, competitive college admissions, student debt, this. Makes appreciate era grew in. know outlier data? week ago, wrote long post shut last year getting fully vaccinated indescribable relief reports falling efficacy Pfizer vaccine, delta ramping up, fact nearly every person talking either breakthrough case knowing least one person one starting spark anxiety. 

A commented, really helped. also helped information happened Provincetown. Sure, first glance vast majority infections testing positive disheartening digging deeper finding one vaccinated person grouping died four (I think?) hospitalized gave perspective.

That also led realize: reason seems there's one breakthrough infection another majority people going come screaming social media news vaccine worked someone know. will, drowned people wanting talk case, people might even lying. 

If still shown Pfizer 75 percent effective preventing infection provides incredibly strong protection severe sickness death, can't stop living fear 1 4 chance. all, get flu shot every year worry 40 percent efficacy 6 10 chance getting flu. 

So fuck it. life over. I'm still going go eat, I'm still going mall pretzel. I'm still getting hair cut. Sure, I'll mask consideration i'm staying away anymore. adequately compensated allowed go work year, line would probably look lot different. Unfortunately, losing home changed perspective. Ive noticed lot people past month literally convinced worst yet come, also masks going mandated literally rest lives never ending. Seriously, fuck happened place? That's part I'll never understand.

Don't wear mask, edgelord, incite rebellion, spread highly contagious disease killed countless millions, [think you] look cool it

or

Put mask go business normal.

I've come conclusion wearing mask opportunity people vmbehage they've always wanted to. give shit disease themselves.

I personally know couple people refusing get vaccine ""idk data blah blah"", jfc least still wear masks, wash hands, distance like care. Wtf? sucks. Like said, though, could people virus died, necessarily died *from* virus. would interested see data that. Already covid, neither happen, got vaccinated, I‚Äôm going life sensible cautious rather trying avoid unavoidable virus costs realistically it‚Äôs going cause mild symptoms contract again. concern passing onto someone extremely vulnerable. We'll see. Lookout following headlines next month: ""Vaccine efficacy 40% lower 'x' variant."" ""increased risk 'x' prevalent earliest vaccine study participants."" Unfortunate, they're going come tell people emergency-approval vaccine risky. isolate vaccine 2.0, they've worked bugs, probably gonna work out. Type 1 especially LADA (that Latent autoimmune diabetes adults) autoimmune diseases.

1) failure vaccinated would result 3 year prison sentence 
2) I‚Äôd raise premiums unvaccinated implement annual penalty come tax season 
3) revoke citizenship arrest unvaccinated people send labor camps fully agree you, think smart move. like idea restricting one's leisure activities. They‚Äôre completely different viruses. Drives nuts. Norovirus related influenza elephant jellyfish.  nice /s   You‚Äôve almost certainly flu. Many, most, flu infections asymptomatic vast portions population infected every season. Covid also vastly transmissible flu.  Lol Fauci. done instead? Lock again? knew vaccines worked, would know stupid comment sounds.

He‚Äôs ""admitting"" anything wasn‚Äôt already known.

Vaccines don‚Äôt prevent catching virus, immunize you, means reduce contagiousness keep symptoms mild.

They also ‚Äî that‚Äôs important ‚Äî prevent dying.

No vaccine prevent contagiousness.

What vaccines herd immunity reached reduced spread almost nothing long-term.

Then, people never even come contact virus thus never catch (vaccinated not). hypothetically everyone gets vaccinated state end year going next year you‚Äôll still clamoring mask mandates? You‚Äôre mind think going forever. believe called ""roll tide"" friend works ER Los Angeles. Tonight told us ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry know took Hippocratic oath don‚Äôt care anymore. They‚Äôre unvaccinated. tired‚Äù Look Brazil Kids grew great depression became hoarders thifty.

For sure mental effects. Pretty much everybody vaccination rate stalled out. big liar. I'm honestly really scared. I'm 20,I live Italy BMI 35,so high priority get vaccine,most likely Pfizer Moderna. I'm healthy I'm shut in,overweight used take meds gave mild tachycardia. visit girlfriend states November I'm debating whether get vaccine swab. get test risk get covid may affect really badly,and get vaccine I'm terrified blood clots. I've read get blood clots likely 20s,female obese. life looking right I'm scared dying something like that. I'd appreciate support stories overweight people got affected them. Thank much never patients murderers begin with. Dr Fauci saying vaccinated people get Delta Variant, also transmit others. Fully lifting mask mandate vaccinated people big mistake, CDC Dr Fauci stayed consistent beginning, would easier time getting people trust them. Instead, botched entire thing beginning releasing confusing, scattered contradicting information throughout pandemic. everybody, need held responsible false information spread disaster overall. hopefully part now, looking solve problems. kinda blows us recent grads feel bad 5+ years younger getting intellectually shafted assholes didn‚Äôt get shit together. 

Just remember weren‚Äôt robbed. deck stacked you, showed up, guy stacking deck fucked over. Makes think Welcome Internet Bo Burnham

Literally listening reading comment. Freaky coincidence. town massively high vaccination rate state high vaccination rate course cases vaccinated people. 

That's wrong question. question what's rate infections vaccinated people compared rate infections unvaccinated, especially infections requiring hospitalization. Remember April last year rioted haircuts? breakthrough deaths reported almost immediately? lot deaths data suggests, then, well, wouldn‚Äôt data reflect also know CDC trying lock information this. We're seeing lot manipulation data.

Source? pretty transparent JNJ blood clots, least. definitely claimed based science.  actual medical experts claiming they‚Äôve made decision based science, several scientific sources cited favor claim, people really expected argue them?

Yes, make claim. 

But based science much less scientific consensus. based cherry picked data non-peer reviewed studies justify ultimately political decision. get away people get exposed high school level understanding scientific method high school level understanding viruses vaccines work. 

The Singaporean government, who's Prime minister undergraduate degree math Master's Computer Science, looked data decided keep mask mandates strict social distancing rules place.

Singapore ahs 5.4 million inhabitants 37 COVID deaths far.

in comparison, Metro Denver 3 million inhabitants 857 COVID deaths far. Bullshit title contradicts article. basically stating vaccination enough **if vaccine-resistant strain appears**.

That happened coronavirus yet, happened huge majority viruses (like measles mumps) past.

This fear mongering built obvious logical error trying sneak past reader.  Yeah... normally chill, introvert guy, found interaction stranger 2-4% possibility ending badly due stressed brain misinterpreting signals, making think person asshole (when case) telling respond kind. bad exchanges where, reflecting them, discovered idiot lashing due stress accumulated due pandemic.

I ~~can not~~ want imagine service sector deal with. Ignorance bliss. agree. Texas rolling right high cases deaths. many deaths avoided protective measures used?  Someone actually died it? don‚Äôt see anything Googling around, although could easily missing it. It‚Äôs fucking tiring. spent quarantine turning social events, spent 18th birthday freezing cold backyard couldn‚Äôt inside together, looking forward finally getting enjoy vacation relax little. I‚Äôm freaking place we‚Äôre going crazy high cases and, IM probably safe, can‚Äôt make stop caring people arent vaccinated. don‚Äôt want wear mask beach. want go RESTAURANTS! sucks. Anecdotal evidence always comes first though. dealing novel virus takes time formal studies. 

Remember months ago, possibly reinfection covid hot topic? original claim CDC agencies was, ""reinfection rare/doubtful, even worth looking at"" everyone board claimed same.

Then people would like: "" that's odd. whole family sick again. Tested positive everything"". (and get mocked voted down)

Well months later bunch studies came out..... showing rare all. know isn't. 

I know way many people got sick hospitalized getting vaxinated ignore it. many stories every day. also know CDC trying lock information this. We're seeing lot manipulation data.

I'm saying wrong, fact think hope it'll turn right - look UK's numbers situation, spiked hell 4 weeks deaths barely even budged. I'm saying can't say sure New York would seeing hospitalizations deaths stacking yet regardless, simply long enough. anyone know Delta changed requirements social distancing outside? told 2 meters distance enough, distance increased increased infectivity? small family keen know it‚Äôs safe walk around local town avoid public places entirely?  pissed. problem ones convinced vaccines safe randoms. organized planned movement resulted hundreds thousands deaths. anti-vaxxers duped shady players. need get vaccinated influencers need pay deaths caused. US stopped suppressive measures way early. country continued vaccines combined suppressive measures. Otherwise result weak. course delta variant making big contributed making things even worse.

If US would want really stop covid vaccines, would need jack everything max: powerful vaccine tailored delta variant high vaccination coverage. otherwise probably need suppressive measures well.

Do remove masks see infections actually going really low. words, vaccine resistant variant likely emerge spread highly vaccinated population.

NO SHIT SHERLOCK. literally evolution works. non vaccinated population pressure virus evolve vaccine resistant variant variant would likely outcompeted ones infectious. However, currently circulating variants would trouble spreading highly vaccinated environment, means vaccine resistant variant would probably competitors would one spreads easily.

It something always known. vaccine resistant variant emerge environment vaccine begin with? give virus competitive advantage itself.

However, says nothing likelihood event. literally true every virus earth - vaccinating means viruses could mutate something evades vaccines. what? supposed vaccinate stay lockdown every virus ever omg 20 years time vaccine resistant variant could pop up? Since sub become mindlessly doomerist? ironic ""no lockdowns"" folks either want get vaccinated wear mask.

Sheesh, get it. need collectively work together give lesser chances virus mutate.  Biden's America don‚Äôt trust CDC. They‚Äôve incorrect many times.

I say care elderly, undeniable society finds death child far tragic. say things like ""think children"" ""no parent outlive children."" child entire life ahead them, someone nursing home probably going dead within year two anyway. society definitely values lives children more. hope, needs everyone cooperate. international medical organizations like Doctors Without Borders continually said global vaccine rollout needed end quick possible. vaccine inequity still major problem.

We've UK now. I've massively downvoted accused spreading misinformation mentioning delta effect vaccine efficacy non-UK subs, bit baffling perspective that's accepted become part strategy expectation. long enough people vaccinated, especially vulnerable, example shows still okay terms hospital admissions deaths even cases get high. areas okay others may be, suppose. vaccines really appear work well severe disease, even delta reducing efficacy catching all. ‚ÄúNational Review American semi-monthly conservative editorial magazine, focusing news commentary pieces political, social, cultural affairs. magazine founded author William F.

People pay $200/mo unvaccinated charged $4000/mo refuse vaccine still absolutely coverage get Covid. pro life party folks would keep wearing masks regardless vaccination status Glad you‚Äôre one smart ones eh exactly, people spewing ""vaccines meant disease prevention, never made preventing infections""  Biden relatively easy now. interesting see handles it. media joke. includes sub. Delta looks like R8 more. means escape matter what, mask mask. fire stop runs fuel. faster burns, faster stop. Alea jacta est unvaccinated Sure, silver lining gets mentioned lot, virus need become less deadly spread faster. would argue get significantly deadlier happen spreads. spread people show symptoms, spread people show symptoms, long window infectiousness people symptomatic. also still adapting specifically infect humans, evidenced convergent evolution mutations across geographically distant variants. variants already deadly original, Delta, producing high viral load cause illness populations original strong enough overwhelm immune systems in. 

We seen novel virus level infectiousness modern medicine, evidence past infectious diseases modern medicine lack data obvious reasons, difficult draw conclusions severe infections were, long may taken ""mellow out"". also many damn people planet now, sheer number opportunities virus mutate beyond anything humanity seen before. also plenty viruses get less deadly way got vaccination, luckily enough mutate immune escapes got handle them.  Fewer 350 children died COVID. 

More die flu annual basis. worn mask every year flu? didn‚Äôt wear mask could caused child lose life. dare you?

See dumb argument sounds statistics data doesn‚Äôt actually back up?  Alberta vaccinated Israel though, it‚Äôs batshit insane really. Shorter incubation period probably helps long deaths hosptialisations low right?

It matter new cases talking like predisposition obese, actual state obese? way 90% people genetically unable lose weight. can‚Äôt see it, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs important physical health.

I actually think public schools Florida thing students want mask. Separate give less privileges, like make stay classroom day. safety incentive mask join peers. suggest read post get bit context. 

The guy quoted thought vaccines made immune proceeded orgies strangers potentially made superspreader. brightest bulb You‚Äôre daywalker.

Congrats guys! nice read good news parts world! many risk covid exposure. Unfortunately total number wrong look well.

A fair comparison would see 42k, many vaccinated many compare rate covid positivity, severity sickness within groups.  Never could be. way attend event like responsibly right We‚Äôre held hostage trash community. Nothing 100%, fact matter far better chance dying car accident dying COVID vaccination. There‚Äôs 1,400 breakthrough deaths far. Extrapolate end year, number‚Äôs probably around 2,500. 30,000 people die year car accidents. People far riskier things every day don‚Äôt think twice it.

I understand risks living normal life vaccinated, willing make gamble. Hey, you‚Äôre supposed wishing death upon want vaccinated. fault, please blame, shame, ostracize, use every negative tool them. Surely, win approval. ‚Äúcountry‚Äù never went lockdown last spring. happened state state basis. states, Georgia, ‚Äúlockdown‚Äù month. don‚Äôt think legally can. Kind like can‚Äôt discriminate pre-existing conditions like obesity AIDS. Someone told back Texas model outcome, cases dropping due high level natural immunity.

I responded even true, immunity high infection rate thus bodies fortunate enough survive exactly great victory. told friend exact thing days ago words ‚Äúwell polio *real disease*, covid isn‚Äôt.‚Äù It‚Äôs useless trying convince get vaxxed point. Even becomes available though probably 50% kids receive vaccine due parents heck even kwn choice older kids. threshold carry far farther? Even they're going exposed entire education system either cannot help shield them? 

Granted, I'm masking scenarios I'm somewhere middle decisions primarily delta. I'm definitely taking purest route I'm completely careless either. corporate headquarters Arkansas use help get. agree headline misleading, though. doubt Florida tourists going significant factor current wave tbh. enough people spreading disease everywhere else.  affinity maturation memory b cells generated first 2 dose vaccine theory result antibodies greater affinity towards spike protein booster turn, lower fold decrease neutralizing activity delta variant.. is. like Covid though, mental disease invisible. it‚Äôs fucking bad it‚Äôs visible. think mean time contraction death new delta variant lowered original 20+ days 20. think able see issue.

Luckily already everyone vulnerable double vaccinated (uptake older groups almost universal) hospital admissions remained quarter highest point. sort rash hospitalizations younger people turn vaccinated yet, stays generally shorter better outcomes. weeks started falling again, thank goodness. 

I know vaccine uptake among vulnerable Florida, hope enough avoid complete disaster. I'm really nervous states countries low uptake low access vaccines. think US resisted taking delta seriously good while, spreads unbelievable rate.  made sense back then, since vaccination rates increasing case rates dropping. delta hadn‚Äôt come along, things would probably still going reasonably well here. Awoooooo! got shot today. parents anti-vaxx plan putting vaccination proof kitchen table find 2 weeks. [What well thought thorough argument   Yeah need cameras inside hospitals.

Exactly. know people want punish unvaccinated, making testing less attractive want that. Yeah that's current, article said would raising 150. Let look Reminds ppl weren‚Äôt bothered Iraq/Afghanistan war pics body bags vs Vietnam war. catch please freak automatically assume long covid sympathy jackasses like Possible, one lives there. get Covid traveled. 100% vaccinated people caught covid. comparing vaccinated people, died covid help. 

It's like saying 10 people died covid town 1000 people calling 1% death rate. Well, no... 1000 people town covid. Maybe 10 people covid, would 100% death rate. maybe 100 covid, 10% death rate. Polio less deadly COVID less widespread. majority cases asymptomatic. R‚Äôs would fought vaccination ‚Äòreligious right‚Äô ‚Äòpersonal choice‚Äô. would argued polio ‚Äúpoliticized‚Äù.

""This mind control!"" Whatever happened something good good country? Yes, emergency care pretty much guaranteed. I'm talking going future. Probably going lots people lung damage, vascular damage, brain damage, knows else, going crying taken care wanting government pay all. happened *them.* 

Personally, say lack compassion consideration part returned kind. this?

When go prison? people Florida allowing this?? problem unvaccinated people probably friends families unvaccinated well. 25 percent adults unvaccinated 20 millions ppl. That's still 5 millions unvaccinated. someone got non FDA approved COVID vaccine mean they're ""antivaxxer"", quit ignorant. Article seems bending backwards cite obvious.

Canadians eh.  polio vaccine actually stops contracting spreading polio though, right? Canada? agree background facts disagree interpretation. risk severe illness mitigated upwards 90%, covid different treat viral infections? risk calculus different wear N-95 mask. Yeah think says something even win state lol Heh tourists significant catch start new outbreaks across country. time? go back public June year (after vaccinated). people know gave June 2020 said ""fuck it."" ignoring covid ever since. Well...Brawndo plants crave, far off, know mean. truly know nothing Florida think that‚Äôs true Covid polio ballpark. want us invade Florida?? 65 y.o. watched many close friends struggle serious health issues. seems psychological issues devastating hardest overcome. health care system really address psychological components disease. Bringing subject considered sign weakness. doctor's note help that. Unless doctor scam artist, guess not. vaccinated individuals compensated well enough take jobs pandemic sizzles out. Sounds like fair trade me. Yes thank dr.fauci funded covid research, also said closing border wasnt right option type people would get smallpox vaccine.... 


:shudder:  


I guess know smallpox Lmao matter. many hospitalizations deaths? obesity AIDs vaccines proven effective global pandemic. Covid thankfully does, choose take it, means statistically higher risk catching costing insurance large payout get sick, essentially means higher premiums. Covid pre-existing condition, vaccine makes costly healthcare preventable. running president 2024 helps win primaries. So, endanger kill others political gain.

Glad hear illness mild, hope feel 100% time.  get car accident, heart attack, medical event. There‚Äôs consensus reason abortion seen wrong Christians, Christians think unborn child person, terminating life person murder/sinful.

Therefore, abortion seen sinful concern Christianity, COVID seen different traffic accidents cancer lightning strikes. 

I personally don‚Äôt think Christianity incompatible science think looking Jesus‚Äô temptation desert warns style thinking many seem have. Matthew 4, ‚ÄúThen devil took holy city made stand parapet temple said him, ‚ÄúIf Son God, throw down. written: command angels concerning hands support lest dash foot stone.‚Äù Jesus answered him, ‚ÄúAgain written, shall put Lord, God test.‚Äù They‚Äôre trying silence critics! /s Again, nobody suggesting vaccines helping. Read article even calls vaccines specifically help. wrong, point I'm trying make public health messaging last months odds saying. else one interpret CDC's mask guidance say literally anything used without mask long got vaccine? said fully vaccinated, pandemic you. still get sick bad, literally safe anything vaxed. said months, now. know that's clearly true need think differently talk ending pandemic. along lines saying actually. media trying push message here. CDC fucked up. I‚Äôm getting vaccinated don‚Äôt care. Psychopath? psychopaths wear masks told so? take vaccine fact schedule appointment first moment could (literally pulled road pick time first shot)?

I think psychopath someone year half later continues latch onto whatever crackpot nonsense wear mask get shot. Someone who's worried bullshit political statement whether whole thing ends ever.

At point, need ask whether side gone far enough enough already. Yeah live Florida. Pfizer vaccinated. today tested positive. ?Porque los.dos? Lockdowns happen areas getting enough jabs. Turn cycles PCR test away go! Cases cases cases. Fear fear fear. stats there, easy understand willing to... Yup. keep hoping people outed health-care workers administered vaccine.  Way.  That‚Äôs hell good response commend stranger. doubt I‚Äôll good job, here‚Äôs response yours‚Ä¶

I think particular points novelty modern medicine high population making mutation likely key points need consider. think lot pandemic data people realize surprisingly great deal pandemics people realize. seems tendency forget finally overcome them.

I want argue one thing: didn‚Äôt vaccines previous pandemics yet passed eventually. flu vaccine 1918 world didn‚Äôt even know h1n1 flu virus!

The likely scenario virus stops spreading people either immune vaccine immune it. That‚Äôs likely scenario too. Pandemic COVID became seasonal COVID (the flu!).

From article cited:

When happen? That‚Äôs big, unanswerable question. ‚ÄúI thought we‚Äôd acute phase already,‚Äù admitted Maria Van Kerkhove, World Health Organization‚Äôs leading coronavirus expert. Van Kerkhove‚Äôs thinking, though, influenced adamant view world could stop pandemic countries would take steps countries like New Zealand, Vietnam, others done, bring transmission control.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing ‚Äî there‚Äôs nothing ‚Äî including virus variants, suggests couldn‚Äôt acute phase already,‚Äù told STAT recent interview. ‚ÄúBecause controllable.‚Äù

Experience last four pandemics ‚Äî ones mentioned ‚Äî would suggest viruses morph pandemic pathogens endemic sources disease within year half two emerging. pandemics influenza pandemics. different pathogen could mean we‚Äôll see different pattern.

[i think right fact don‚Äôt enough data modern times. wit:]

There‚Äôs historical record much illness much severe illness coronaviruses caused started infect humans long took settle endemic state. such, flu pandemics closest thing road maps. ‚ÄúIn recent history, everything influenza timeline within couple years,‚Äù said Jennie Lavine, biology research fellow Emory University first author modeling paper published Science envisioned pandemic might end.

Lavine co-authors predicted older adults ‚Äî susceptible hospitalization death Covid ‚Äî acquire experience coping virus, longer induce severe disease, least people. (Nothing absolute; flu, instance, occasionally kills previously healthy people.)

That immune system training likely turn future Covid-19 infections equivalent cold, authors concluded. time, degree protection becomes standard adults, people commonly catch Covid young kids, infections even rarely serious. That‚Äôs pattern human coronavirus infections.

‚ÄúI think scenario ‚Ä¶ remains likely one,‚Äù said Marc Lipsitch, infectious diseases epidemiologist Harvard‚Äôs T.H. Chan School Public Health. ‚ÄúThat essentially, almost everybody form immunity natural infection and/or vaccination and/or one followed other, persist long enough don‚Äôt get really sick get again. transition endemicity.‚Äù

Lavine unfazed notion SARS-2 could still us pandemic over.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs death sentence way, shape, form say we‚Äôre going herd immunity,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt means it‚Äôs going become endemic question is, going mild endemic, going severe endemic? would say odds mild endemic point. think seems really, really likely.‚Äù

Lavine alone thinking we‚Äôre going control spread SARS-2 herd immunity. Earlier spring, Jonathan Yewdell, senior investigator cellular biology viral immunology National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases, published opinion piece journal PLOS Pathogens arguing coronaviruses don‚Äôt trigger kind long-lasting immune protection we‚Äôd need herd immunity take hold.

Endemic SARS-2 would seasonal pattern, spreading winter months kids school spend time indoors proximity other. Florian Krammer, vaccinologist Icahn School Medicine Mount Sinai New York, said early seasons may severe others ‚Äî pandemic severe.

‚ÄúIf thing becomes seasonal countries vaccination rate low immunity background low, seasons beginning might little bit stronger. countries vaccination rates high, might low,‚Äù said Krammer.

He others told STAT transition play different times across globe. ‚ÄúI think see huge difference West everybody else kind didn‚Äôt get enough vaccines,‚Äù Krammer said. ‚ÄúAlthough might countries like Iran, infection rates incredibly high, think much background immunity bring now, it‚Äôs unlikely come back wave.‚Äù

Lavine believes shift could happen fairly soon countries like United States high levels infections large numbers vaccinated people.

‚ÄúIn U.S., would say far off,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúNot say it‚Äôs going disappear, idea would longer kind pathogenic scourge, think might far personally believe latest changes COVID disease form variants concerning. It‚Äôs far .03 percent death rate, horrible excessively high (clinically, obviously always high affected). opportunity exists mutation suggest, it‚Äôs pattern, don‚Äôt think optimizing possibility ongoing endemic endings.

But article agrees position:

cautious timeline. Historian John Barry, wrote definitive account Spanish flu, ‚ÄúThe Great Influenza,‚Äù noted significant differences Covid infection transmission influenza infection transmission. incubation period ‚Äî time exposure illness ‚Äî longer Covid. People sick longer; they‚Äôre infectious longer, too.

‚ÄúThis like influenza moving slow motion,‚Äù Barry said. Influenza pandemics abrupt endings waves, transmission dying given location matter weeks. case Covid. Instead, human behavior ‚Äî societal shutdowns reopenings ‚Äî appear driving patterns.

Lipsitch worries recent explosive waves Brazil India reason us wary forecasts transition might near. experienced substantial transmission early pandemic, yet walloped second waves triggered mutated viruses, so-called variants concern.

‚ÄúI think account it‚Äôs taking whole year multiple waves still there‚Äôs real evidence it‚Äôs ending country. think slower natural history probably piece it,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs niggling me.‚Äù

C√©cile Viboud, infectious diseases modeler extensively studied flu pandemics, also believes pandemic ends SARS-2 endemic. she‚Äôs sure when.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm trying cautious, I‚Äôve always optimist Covid-19 I‚Äôve proven wrong,‚Äù said Viboud, based National Institutes Health‚Äôs Fogarty International Center.

She suggested it‚Äôs possible four seasonal coronaviruses, ones cause colds, always milder Covid. SARS-2 continue hurling variants us ‚Äî especially comes pressure evolve large swathes people vaccinated. ‚ÄúSo think cautious. like 15 months data something, right?‚Äù

Mike Ryan, head WHO‚Äôs Health Emergencies Program, agreed.

‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know are, first pandemic SARS coronavirus,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúFrom perspective, crystal-balling ‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre even close end it.‚Äù

Ryan picks Van Kerkhove‚Äôs refrain, arguing countries shouldn‚Äôt waiting vaccines virus transition endemic mode. using tools shown stop transmission, said. ‚ÄúI think get high levels disease control, much ceases pandemic sense ceases ‚Ä¶ causing disease deaths filling hospitals. So, sense ceases public health crisis.‚Äù

/sigh

But nope. week's CDC's guidance, back masks us, knows much longer.

Chances low fair risk worth taking, especially alternative literally little bit scrupulous. confirm. vaccinated. I‚Äôve enough unvaccinated coddled. Hey thanks man. Idc reddit thinks. :) people know fake internet points even get dopamine free. So, cares.

If wanna stuff. it.

Otherwise agree you. Chin diaper, FTFY people support governor Florida live completely different mindset rest us. never add pressure. First, think ‚Äúnormal seasonal spike‚Äù, high contagious variant taking advantage unvaccinated. mean, he‚Äôs selling ‚Äúdon‚Äôt Fauci Florida‚Äù koozies website. wish joking. Yes, definitely one school thought says squelch unflattering information vaccines order avoid giving people reason get them. Personally, think lying people covering important information come back bite butt long term, destroy credibility.

In fact, real fuel anti-vax movement distrust government media, plenty real examples cite. latter everything prove trustworthy. way going get this. You‚Äôre aware people taking hospital beds away need more, right? Like cancer patients life changing surgeries. zero sympathy.  People could've received vaccination finished fun. Like that's new.

""Pro-life"" yet favour capital punishment. Can't fathom one person could hold beliefs guess religion plays role. already that, that's Delta covid Based capitalists fucking tired. silver bullet hoped for, it‚Äôs half county thinks don‚Äôt need it.  

I‚Äôm vaccinated, sure, kids aren‚Äôt they‚Äôre old enough. Plus unmitigated spread, we‚Äôre one mutation away vaccines working, Covid getting really bad kids.  

It‚Äôs selfish help fellow countrymen‚Ä¶.what happened ‚Äúask country you, ask country‚Äù welcome try forcing shit lack travel restrictions bane efforts far. reason fine fly around world spreading variants everywhere nearly once.

But talked much, reason. Possible unlikely. place adequate supplies run full respiratory panel. catch almost everything delta variant seems predominantly unvaxxed person's disease (in terms severe negative effects).

For now. New variants seem inevitable possible current vaccine effective - becomes everyone's problem again. chicken herdsman, looks like chickens already supposed vaccinated schedule ( ). I'm surprised. expecting many vaccinations certainly expect many vaccinations routes (water, intraocular, aerosol, etc.) there's probably already methods place tracking chickens, least adult ones, giving individual treatments.

Legit thanks sending rabbit hole learning. we‚Äôre midst another surge, COVID-19 endemic

Let's accept new narrative COVID-19 endemic. vaccinated mean want roll dice thing. 1 5 suffer long haul symptoms. There's also links cognitive decline. something want ALL. may mutate something vaccine protect against. he's rich fashy psychopath, course will.

(Fortunately, severity disease seems much less vaccinated people. vaccines worthwhile, overall picture much different.)

If true, hard overstate much up-end recent thinking manage pandemic going forward. pretty much, although lot immunocompromised people there. sake well, I'm going continue mask distance, booster shot becomes available I'll take soon available. Basically sentiment kids. deserve bullshit.

Vaccine refusers, though... yeah. Anecdotally, can't help notice antivaxxers know assholes used say stuff like ""we need another plague, planet overpopulated."" reminder, Trump got vaccine yet cult refuses. truly idiots. disagree, former smoker get lung concern get deserved quit many years now.

Now abrupt lockdowns again. point would decision makers accept Covid going away let us vaccinated go lives. 

I started agree anti lockdown protests last weeks honest. Social distancing complete isolation society same, Westerners think this. Social distancing supposed mean things like instead partying 15 friends, hang 5 going favorite restaurant twice month eating outside. Social distancing means cutting social life, cutting entirely. still able see friends, family, meet new people. bizarre Western idea masking distancing means never see anyone person make miserable. think must missed part Delta variant substantially transmissible Alpha. ‚Äòhypothetical‚Äô, would mean huge increase young people hospitalized older folks remain protected. would mean great idea young people encouraged get jab ‚Äòas lives depended it.‚Äô many young people, do. day read article someone lost husband, wife, mother, father, brother sister say thing.

Because part process figuring long term efficacy whether/when boosters needed (if certain groups need them, they‚Äôll specify approval). 

Some things, shortcut. time machines skip ahead acquire information deduced enough time. Pfizer opted rolling review data needed, submit data gather rather once. I‚Äôve read elsewhere final submission hasn‚Äôt happened yet. Moderna month behind Pfizer, last saw.

Lots detail process: (original Forbes, archived due paywall) July 30, 2021, NY 278 deaths per 100k. Florida 180. healthy young, yes. People unhealthy lungs risk serious complications. Barring illness death, GOP voting laws passed, believe back years. I‚Äôm sure do, couple countries looking real nice live right now.

These people subject expensive, expansive, effective propaganda brainwashing machine human history. fault. often wonder though haven‚Äôt time, going start to? uncontrolled spread happening world. variant concern could occur anywhere. likely occur Florida Texas? Maybe mRNA change that! news: water wet would think, right? doctor works really good guy they've worked together decades. close friend mine (not RN mentioned above) works office well tells goes on. tried talking NP many times. They've tried every tactic could think of, avail. thinks everyone else brainwashed. refuses sit listen opposing information. thing RN friend seriously damaged relationship past year so. sad. Scary sad. thought Democracy rule majority. homogenize society wont happen anywhere ay time. minority get fucked. Normalcy people making decisions stupid number report. tells us almost nothing also dangerously open incorrect interpretation someone read carefully (that 0.001% breakthrough cases among fully vaccinated die).  need everyone getting vaxxed also using masks distancing possible.

Unfortunately, hardest-hit states tied whole political identity refusing measures. Schools going open Florida Texas mitigation strategy all. masks, distancing, nothing.  Y‚Äôall pussys helps stop spread makes dangerous variant likely.

I hear you. beyond infuriating feel helpless face ignorance. still keep right thing. headed direction. 

In direction new vaccine resistant variant? source? barriers leaving Texas? I'm always curious keeps people leaving states backwards regulations like  Nah, care ppl dying all. point think got internal competition get deaths states. Shit crazy! Biden administration won‚Äôt go ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù ensure massive Republican gains 2022 midterms guaranteed win someone like Kristi Noem 2024. true Fauci others stated 99% figure, media reported it. look closely, stats always ""since February"" similar.

The newer stat posted refers ""% *in-hospital deaths* fully vaccinated"" May.

Of course, possible 15% stat wrong. results countries similar, e.g. testing could factor. Good. belong health care field.  Can‚Äôt spell peace assumes everyone knows dumb acronym Help here, bro. people like understand long covid say deaths matter? title somewhat misleading. supposed say

- fully vaccinated Americans, less 0.001% died result Covid-19 breakthrough case.

But sounds like saying

- fully vaccinated Americans contracted Covid-19 breakthrough case, 0.001% died.

This subtle distinction important fully vaccinated got Covid, even though death rate quite low, low &lt;0.001%.  Incorrect. Good jobs finna much easier find, soon businesses mandate it. ugly wish people economic; honestly way feel everyone taste like poor once. makes appreciate much more. Vaccinated folks way less likely contract covid, get sick, spread it. still possible, vaccinated responsible thing sake community. adult willingly unvaccinated okay getting kids others sick. That's I'm viewing it, personally. Also, new information came out, vaccinated folks believed spread covid.

So, new info, know unvaccinated folks spread covid vaccinated folks. now, vaccinated folks small chance spreading covid people want vaccinated, can't age issues. 

It seems simple interact anyone 12 (or others can't get vaxxed), reality, anyone unvaccinated really fucking anyone wants vaccinated can't **even so** vaccinated people still spread it. 

Plus, delta contagious people seem getting sick. 

Get shot want good neighbor. ""personal freedom"" important getting elementary kids sick covid, rock roll guess.  expert said, understand theory behind facial coverings COVID-19, trouble accepting masks effective reword sentence 

It's one other. everything. Wear mask, social distancing, wash hands, vaccines, avoid gatherings.

Unfortunately, lot people (including yourself?) think pick one ‚Äùuseless‚Äù foolproof measures Israel definitely disagred exact numbers constitutes ""robust"" time. believe Times Israel reported vaccinated around new year may 16% (rather 80/90%) protection point. murky data given tha studies UK seem disagree Israeli position. least, probably pretty good signal blindly accepting manufacture's studies. Instead trusting broader ecosystem non/less bias studies. 


This course huge argument ""boosters"" also real consideration everyone got shots ASAP. got last shot months ago, probably consult doctor latest information protected actually are. Who‚Äôs fault that? doctors political party openly derides scientists science?  mindful symptoms keep contact them. Delta shows symptoms 2-3 days quicker original wild strain become symptomatic 4 days there's high chance COVID asymptomatic. Idk long need infected show positive PCR test. I'd prefer military cops. military protecting grandma's first started integrating schools. I'll never forget pictures. Plus, military stricter rules engagement. back doctors political.... viruses kill.

The fact one kills less doesn‚Äôt invalidate comparison.

You don‚Äôt get decide many people need die take virus seriously you‚Äôre looking excuses get vaccinated wear mask.  Well no, skewing figures fit narrative. drop testing schools longer testing twice week, alot workers exempt self isolation rules using lateral flow tests instead mandatory PCR tests.

I can‚Äôt imagine society technology prevent serious diseases cause untold suffering going, ‚Äúnope, me.‚Äù Well else outlets get fear clicks missing past two months?

Nothing changed major news outlets - they‚Äôre biggest winners last weeks backslide. People past less immediate access information could cause division mind see today also trust authority raised respect more.

I get saying. However, wear mask. like that's okay. okay people hate wearing masks, make whiny babies long it.

Hopefully long-term effects. wife ""break through"" cases. house full awhile. Wife lost taste/smell. not. missing entire point. point misinformation breeds disease ignorant groups population turn jeopardizes safety everyone. 

And incidentally used weapon entire nation. 85% would include children vaccines approved for. 

And suspect vaccine hesitancy would rise significantly parents considering whether kids get vaccinated considering covid largely harmless kids 85% probably unachievable third year resident trying keep people 20s 30s alive currently dying COVID........... Fuck bullshit. Words describe angry tired am. much higher rates Measles vaccine, 85.6% children globally vaccinated values 90s developed nations. Covid close level contagiousness need similar numbers open up. 

Preventing hospitalisation death important, burden Long Covid society could great long-term since impacts many young people. boosters work, everyone getting them. amount fraud committed test centers insane. town 45k people like 4 drive thru centers, plus 3-4 test locations. used app registration app provider kept statistics page website. According drive thru centers almost every day 100% capacity, would mean like 1 test every 30 seconds, CONTINUOUSLY 12 hours straight. go drive by, often saw like one car waiting, sometimes cars all, busy times see maybe one car processed per minute. would go far claim 75% tests declared government get sweet ‚Ç¨18 never happened.  
There also stories people appointment test, get test done reason, still receiving confirmation negative result 15 mins later. CNN took speculation authors (the word ""appears"" dead giveaway) presented fact title.

Got it. think Compile video list bad covid cases link to. difficult find    obviously projecting sentence really works well. virus continues spread worldwide unchecked therefore likely mutate, time booster shot becomes widely available, possible news talking theta variant. still, get results within 10-20mins simply impossible PCR test. Maybe essential trump reelected... else would able convert antivaxers? That's really true, though. Antigen tests limited use vaccinated individual generally speaking absolutely useless time highest viral load. however, great screening tool. PCR-Tests however always give correct result, done correctly.

I also assure that, whatever test commentor done, definitely PCR test. anyway, started blasting‚Ä¶ think headline saying that, every 100,000 vaccinated people get COVID, one us dying time. anyone know equivalent statistic unvaccinated people? hope guilt, probably ego though. People would rather dead wrong.  Nah dude. literally second shot week ago. really woke.

Good buddy. Nice critical thinking, piss jocksüëç I'm sick tired many others too. ""some"" quite lot. Delta specific booster trial starts month. literally began comment saying, ""What dumb comment."" That's personal attack first sentence.

You went accuse everyone else liking propaganda words, convincing face masks stop virus (as read minds), interested saving lives--all glorifying intellectual superhero special knowledge truth, victimized evil people Reddit. News flash: writing oozes condescension. Personal attacks way asshole. Tone matters.

If actually smart think are, know promote ideas without talking people putting defensive. stands, can't even see it, repeatedly murder good might otherwise gotten readers. reject it, play victim. turns even further.

You referred humility comment originally replied to. Perhaps that's word meditate light online decorum. Funny ones bandying ""ReOpEn EcOnOmY"" comes time can't bothered. [80% Israelis 60 fully one's getting third jab now. There's nothing wrong article reporting study. Here's something says (emphasis mine): results model provide several qualitative implications strategy forward months vaccination. model, probability emergence resistant strain one individual per day range 10‚Äì5 10‚Äì8 population 107 individuals. entire human population ~‚Äâ1010 probability would 10‚Äì8 10‚Äì11, seem improbably large. February 2021, ~‚Äâ109 individuals infected SARS-CoV-2 average 14 days sickness per individual, number total days infected individuals. Furthermore, highly mutated strains may emerge result long shedding immunocompromised individuals, rare realistic scenario. **Taken together, emergence partially fully vaccine-resistant strain eventual establishment appears inevitable.** Sure üòÇ

Funny repeat talking points Faux News antivaxxers somehow claim vaccinated. acting current knowlage year ago. saying would known perfect answer difficult problem day became known world? saying 'stayed consistent' means changed advice based current information. know something did? 85% number countries ever meet. Even back Norway think 90% eligible population max, equals 72% total population. 

Giving boosters risk make sense least hospitalization death kept control. conditions )apart stupidity refused vaccine)? I‚Äôll wager lot obese.  Yeah, like Aiwanger brought S√∂der kind precarious situation. How's Pfizer booster shots Delta Lamda variants? that, Covid _not_ survivability rate ""99+%"". That's factually incorrect. around 97 98%. Plenty places hiring. Case rates still low, albeit steadily climbing. Looking countries, certainly change. mean. There's area's right ICU's full capacity we're starting delta variant.  make sense move many people vaccinated. makes likely worse variants spread. avoid wearing mask much possible time around. saving sick elderly, problem wearing it. saving idiots, care less. made choices. I'm putting lock downs masks chose protect  higher. None crap would happened done proper contact tracing immediately. name Andrew Wakefield chance? 1. ""Extremely rare"" mean can't

2. die, mean suffer unnecessarily suffer long-term health effects.

3. Delta future variants could change moment.

I'd prefer kids get sick hospitalized *at all*, hearing ""extremely rare"" makes furious. still transmit amount. entire point/argument getting vaccinated protect longer factor. It‚Äôs back personal choice Yea it‚Äôs frustrating especially consider many freedoms many Americans don‚Äôt have. lot cool people we‚Äôre stereotyped reason. Agreed. anti-vaccers also get denied access emergency room hospital services get covid. 

Your choice, consequences. reason idiots fill wards possibly block resources non-stupid. No, non answer hearing people died say ""well know anyone"".

We get it. care people outside circle. Thanks letting us know selfish disgusting are. move on. mean supposedly Pfizer approved early September. 

Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm sure antivaxxers move goalposts yet again. 

When vaccines receive FDA approval, insurance companies state unless you‚Äôre ineligible shot medically prohibited getting it, won‚Äôt cover Covid healthcare costs you‚Äôre unvaccinated. Give 42 day grace period people ability get fully vaxed that‚Äôs truly waiting on, get vented survive, you‚Äôre hook 6 figure bill.  Yeah screw kids! Absolutely!    realize soon use term ""MSM"" everyone knows exactly are?  Republicans: Polio really worse flu. No, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm saying comment above. understand want frame like that. It‚Äôs easier argument make rather responding actual position. mean couple weeks vaccination feel better? comment sums perfectly. angry, year part, I‚Äôm tired it. really sucks, first year high school served good buffer middle school high school, really hope next three years better even though school online anymore, hope able adjust high school sell You‚Äôre wrong. fact is, people dying. get vaccinated, somebody would died covid might to. refuse make choice, profoundly selfish. everything right

This strange formulation. ""do everything right,"" get reward fair universe!

I grieve tell life like way. everything right frequently effect, worse. appears one times. truth claims Fauci able sue? give near immunity serious illness, hospitalization, death. Vaccines never designed make immune even contracting virus.  work restaurant central FL 6 employees test positive week. still open. guests wearing masks. I'm server wearing one. worried getting infected even though I've vaccinated form income risk. People around incredibly selfish irresponsible still surprise.  rally country. states around 50% vaccine rate nationally rallies probably every state. win 2022 Florida. think rest country. Wait see Florida looks like month. pesky hypocratic oath‚Ä¶

No seriously, quarantine camps pretty much solution point. antivax people can‚Äôt trusted autonomy they‚Äôre risk us. link work, FYI generation caring people 12 exactly what‚Äôs wrong people don‚Äôt care others.  Pretty simple solution: vaccine (unless health concerns age prevent it) = access icu healthcare. choice, outcome. I‚Äôm confused many people want then, earth they‚Äôll ever comfortable moving despite safe so. Delta, know 1 13 infections friends family unvaccinated. rest shots months. Thankfully different vaccinated 1 ended hospital he‚Äôs home, he‚Äôs taking time recover. Sounds like delusional anti-vax parents. Vaccinated parents probably wouldn‚Äôt deny child vaccine. total deaths per 100k? Unfortunately take hospital beds people really need (emergencies, gunshots, strokes, etc.) well risk immunocompromised folks health.. agree sentiment it‚Äôs lazy Ahh, apologies unnecessary back forth. sure country US CDC changed distancing requirements, fully vaccinated people recommend social distancing even masks outside.

They even stated page 20 internal document ADJUSTMENTS OTHER
INTERVENTIONS
‚Ä¢ e.g., distancing, isolation,
no gathering restrictions effin doubt Dude talking vaccine escape mutations saying delta transmissible spike changes mean topic look still vaccines effective still spike Sars Cov-2? proof. mean Oxford team support idea lol vaccine developer? talk like can,may etc 25, healthy, fully vaxxed months mask come off.


This over. since vaccine available, there's excuse get shot. potent delta variant spreading fully expect hit household way matter careful are. know expect I'm liking stories I'm hearing doctors, nurses experts subject. 

I'm terribly sorry go hope best. someone infectious disease research. longer feel bad people get COVID end hospital. Yes, first one. Sorry confusion. actual risk could die could lasting side effects virus never masked went DAMN STORE. Something wrong you. Get reddit bit dude one never thought would pathetic.

Its huge reality check sure. Say COVID yes obesity diabeetus  I‚Äôve always wondered: unvaccinated gain? Like make sense get something help out?

It‚Äôs mind boggling. Imagine thinking US government anti-Israel... already basically reopened. It‚Äôs gonna take lot us especially strain develop completely resistant vaccines severe lack empathy critical thinking country. regarding pandemic, thought process many facets life. problem I'm personally effected. states 50% nationally, freaking 50%. America full idiots. economy cannot handle another lockdown neither could people's psyche. never happen idk bad delta gets. show must go on.. Yea except unfair kids young vaccinated. would say point past angry‚Ä¶ constantly try take two steps ahead think others‚Ä¶ wind four steps back. 

It absolutely infuriating.  HELL yeah! sending mixed signals. like things wrote. Thanks. Jesus. Y‚Äôall insane. 100% error, calls head Germany's Red Cross government ultimately decided reject idea. Wait. elected Donald Trump president? tacky conman upper East side keeps bankrupting himself? *That guy?* bet people even furious another variant arises vaccine can't protect against. getting ridiculous. I'm frustrated beyond belief. People get vaccines babies, school, HPV shot, travel, name it. mandated nationally. much verification require that? check box says parental consent. bring older person pretend mom.

They never took ID got mine, right I‚Äôm seriously planning go get another one booster. feel it‚Äôs ok lie form life stake.  thought Isreali data reliable. Donald's wife? Heard breakthrough cases? Kids young vaccinated? immunosuppressed? Sure. Let die, too, right? Yeah weird. Spot on. I‚Äôve voiced similar sentiments sub. post needs attention. make decision based data evidence political pressure. article kind thing makes vaccine hesitant even hesitant. helpful. angry though. never stopped masking indoors (aside trips restaurants). huge part trust social contract irrevocably dead. spent long learning build communities support survive far removed even close family friends act ways endanger people love believe wild conspiracy. let em die

Only &lt;1% em actually die though, rest incubators variants. Right?! live next door nurse. Guess parties constant parade different visitors entire pandemic? nurse. saying well people following rules I. That's pretty childish. I'm pissed I'm still gonna wear mask. heard something like 90% delta variant infected unvaccinated. So, vaccine work delta variant, less normal variant. pictures Lollapalooza broke me. Cringe unvaxxed living normalcy, whole time fair play them. spread misinformation. Quarantine camps. don‚Äôt seem mind putting perceived threats cages, take issue? (I‚Äôm somewhat sardonic, time wouldn‚Äôt bat eye)  You‚Äôre gonna better ‚Äúhey go look Twitter yourself‚Äù üòÇ

Please don‚Äôt share can‚Äôt back valid sources.

I encourage read sources posted, may help along journey I‚Äôm angry unvaccinated keeping restaurants movie theaters. I‚Äôm angry don‚Äôt care preschooler grandma get sick die. best post read today. Let's keep up. Variants. Antibodies vs spreadnecks UK uses longer interval Pfizer AstraZeneca..
 
the vaccines longer interval known immunogenic..
 
that said, suspect UK increase last month school childreen probably Euros..
 
so still risk another wave going back school.. winter comes.. right believe medicine real science. bright, base start dropping like flies soon correct Thanks informative answer!  Antigen testing good PCR test usually I‚Äôm sorry Ben Wakana reputable source? BA degree philosophy political spin doctor Biden administration. job deflect negative e press Biden administration way can. problem two sources though.  kinda weird sudden MSM bed Delta variant.

I'm wearing mask things get REALLY bad. Yeah many Schnelltestzentren closed last months D√ºsseldorf announced close any. Schnelltestzentrum right beginning Altstadt 2 ones nearby (and know send people specific one want PCR test Sunday) close 8pm (or 7pm Sundays) we're ones close late.  I‚Äôm hoping start refusing cover anything related Covid unvaccinated. Possibly upside nightmarish healthcare system. social media even 20 years old yet. 

We doomed. P-town outbreak doesn‚Äôt really tell us much without knowing overall vaccination rate people attendance. Given demographic vaccination rate likely significantly higher general population, could easily 90%.

If vaccination rate total Bear Week partygoers 91%, vaccine efficacy infection would 72% 85% symptomatic infection. 

Without vaccination, likely would 5,000+ infected dozens/hundreds hospitalizations many deaths. outbreak Provincetown area would getting worse instead rapidly improving.  he‚Äôs putting ball CDC, dept education‚Äôs court. 

A nakedly political play, wants run 2024 use line, unironically, ‚ÄúBiden made kids wear masks!‚Äù rallies. 

I hate timeline. Anyone seen grandpa Rick lately? galaxy brains saying ""if great, PAY take it?"" vaccine works, misinformation kills Oh, mean like Fauci saying last week boosters likely coming?

Stop spending much time trolling bit learning something.

With that, I'm done responding you. reading CNN article data CDC released, advantage vaccinated comes delta variant? Please tell I‚Äôm reading wrong! I'm honestly really curious becomes super spreader event not, tickets bunch concerts fall. vaccinated plan wearing mask attend (assuming shut venues).

Has data concerts inside venues mixed vaccinated/masked attendees? outrageous DeSantis threatening withhold funding schools mandate masks. lunatic. 'Could result discriminatory denial life-saving health'' terrible morbid topic find part passage .. interesting.

It seems discrimination care -is- goal following crisis care standards- obviously limited resources used postpone short amount time someone's certain death would effective granting life someone recover eventually walk hospital. position healthcare system individuals make systems ever want find knowledge no-one taken vent early sake giving someone else may fare better. implications though health wealth correlated also correlation wealth race. see next week cancelling good idea not. Part lot people *selfish fuck* care keeping neighbors catching disease. That's kinda unfair divisive  agree hope right. Selfish - bingo. many refuse vaccine, willing mix crowded bar, spend afternoon grandma. better. comprehend shit show would unfold don‚Äôt approve Pfizer? I‚Äôm you‚Ä¶ fucking paywalls! Today ‚ÄúNo Shit Sherlock‚Äù headlines‚Ä¶

In seriousness though, point anyone medically able unwilling get vaccinated ridiculous. never thought would live time intelligence science would looked upon large section population. kind anti-intellectualism leads fall empires. sad part can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre joking not. thought internet would make us smarter could access information easily. turns out, gave bullhorns village idiots.  way Weeeellll...cases could become long covid. I'm sorry. autoimmune issues pretty much idea effective vaccine now. anxiety past year turned feeling defeat. never understand vaccines cant mandated now. Idgaf approved emergency use. Mandate like chicken pox, polio, tetanus etc. now, older age group fastest drop effectiveness?, they're offered first younger need boost month two? that's data important have, Meanwhile, US CDC collect data US know 3rd dose needed since collect data.

That's important keep track breakthroughs identify if/when certain groups everyone starts experience drop effectiveness ""mild"" symptoms prevalent I'm afraid people may start killing people this. cdc greater scientific community recommending it? cherry picking science here?

Oof.  I‚Äôm Missouri resident city reintroduced mask mandate. people wearing mask 25 under. week last week young kids refusing wear it. absolutely believe this.  means always them, sufficiently vaccinated population happens slower allow reaction. know I'll get downvoted, understand take. I'm frustrated too, so, much better starting square one:

- 49.7% America vaccinated, dramatically decreasing hospitalizations deaths, including 87% 75+ 92% 65-74 year olds 

- Major medical advancements treating covid hospitals. checked hospital much less likely die January 

- Hospitals better understand handle capacity, flex, mitigate increases. They've learned last year, much better plans + experience today 

To say back square one discounting many peoples hard work achievements, false England school summer holidays started week drop started.

In Scotland schools broke 3 weeks earlier drop started earlier.

U18s significant proportion population unvaccinated. fact occurred bear week low key one hilarious things whole deal hit highest one day total since pandemic began. unvaccinated least‚Äîthere breakthrough infections  Doesn‚Äôt HIPAA protect information death 50 years occurred though? Who‚Äôs searches? 

Mixing health information political information seems legally impossible, unless every family voluntarily consented search (which seems doubtful especially they‚Äôre Republican). Duncan, vaccines count. greatly reduce COVID hospitalizations death. BUT, Delta variant ‚Äúless likely‚Äù spread due vaccination alone. THAT‚ÄôS NEWS. it‚Äôs good.

From CDC report linked article posted:

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Summary
What already known topic?

Variants SARS-CoV-2 continue emerge. B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant highly transmissible.

What added report?

In July 2021, following multiple large public events Barnstable County, Massachusetts, town, 469 COVID-19 cases identified among Massachusetts residents traveled town July 3‚Äì17; 346 (74%) occurred fully vaccinated persons. Testing identified Delta variant 90% specimens 133 patients. Cycle threshold values similar among specimens patients fully vaccinated not.

What implications public health practice?

Jurisdictions might consider expanded prevention strategies, including universal masking indoor public settings, particularly large public gatherings include travelers many areas differing levels SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Soo paying unreliable PCR tests actually work intended orrrrrr. want understand, it‚Äôs constituents want. It‚Äôs direct result certain type media. know kind. verify? wasn‚Äôt vaccinated got covid. Ems asks vaccinated think I‚Äôm gonna say? what? Show card. Well lost it. what? 

This isn‚Äôt gestapo health care workers demanding see ‚Äúpaper‚Äù. 

This virus shown dark side human nature selfishness, greed, lack passion, mud slinging, brewing time finally brought light etc etc etc. you‚Äôve seen extended family members, friends, colleagues, neighbors, etc etc etc. No, concerned getting sick unvaccinated. That's terrifying, I'm sorry hear that. feel fortunate work school city taking COVID seriously. preschoolers school manage wear masks day, even 3-year olds keep time. Really putting asshole crybaby adults shame.

We're bit nervous going new school year obviously none kids vaccinated. least trust parents vaccinated, strict testing policies notice kid sick, school director supplies us tons masks, gloves, cleaning supplies. boggles mind every school district taking every possible precaution protect children staff.  There‚Äôs provision Constitution absent complete societal collapse shouldn‚Äôt be. feel like COVID vaccine going mandatory receives full FDA approval. Tucker Carlson try start war it, finally end pandemic US powerful bureaucrat dislikes free speech. classic 

maybe government lie much, it'd zero credibility. vaccinated individual, symptoms likely mild work home anyway... getting COVID would severely impact life means continue mask socially distance... people risk low enough 0.004% people fully vaccinated Covid-19 experienced breakthrough case resulting hospitalization less 0.001% died disease, according latest data US Centers Disease Control Prevention. looks almost like it‚Äôll become form ‚Äúvolunteer eugenics‚Äù. 

There popular misinformation-based ideas account antivaxxers, 20-29 seeing priority. there‚Äôs one reason think acknowledged: person is, quite simply, *stupid*. 

After all, 25% population expected IQ 90, internet age upon us, ability navigate volume information available, good bad, becoming less common.

I see troubling volume people leaving high school days barely write simple sentence without making obvious error. make matters worse, English requirements graduation stricter math sciences, meaning even people floating around don‚Äôt adequate scientific literacy. 

It‚Äôs terrible innocents genuinely *can‚Äôt* vaccinated put risk modern day village idiots. Already read account entire band crew got sick playing concert. vaxxed. We're really lucky covid kinda infectious kinda deadly. still pretty serious, could've much worse. 

Hopefully we've learned lesson next time worse cannot even speculate doing, 2 different test types Germany certain things need PCR tests result, qualify result.  Lmao, childish troll ignoring science vaccine manufacturer country begun giving boosters.

But keep checking posting history, that's perfectly normal behavior. took couple weeks, yeah, finally getting better. Live fast, die young, that. 

As late 20s person west coast, it‚Äôs pretty evenly split 100% YOLO crowd cautious still we‚Äôre planning concerts, fall winter vacations, etc. pretty much one total lockdown anymore. prevailing attitude is, got vaccinated Jan-May, thought good go. 

It interesting watch start medical worker friends (researchers nurses mostly) got jabbed January. balls wall early June close calls. they're afraid unvaccinated. want infect them. dude devil. don‚Äôt understand conservatives. evil point. Yeah, smallpox BCG dermal.

Smallpox leaves indent. BCG leaves raised scar usually, think. Early same, kept away people isolated best could. vaccine rollout hesitancy began figured worst could stop talking facts. stop talking. Eventually coworker, neighbor family member listen. voice fight plauge misinformation there. Yep. places finally starting care communities getting devastated. dumb sad completely preventable majority people gotten vaccinated months ago. Brazil peaking? Republicans Trump yes, Desantis got elected suckling Trump's asshole, yes killing people gain points Trumpsters FL runs president 2024 stop caring cases focus deaths hospitalizations world would better place immediately Facebook went away. health insurance gave $100 back paycheck month, since could verify I'm fully vaccinated. see reason charge unvaccinated people more. Reminds quote Big Daddy:

""This Sid. five year plan.""

""What it? 'Don't die?'"" worst news vaccines don‚Äôt slow Delta variant‚Äôs spread.

This 100% false. take word it! three reputable sources.

[Ashish - Head Brown School Public Health

[Ben - White House Covid Response Team

[Bob - Head UCSF Department Medicine

The short (a) infected spread virus; vaccine makes ~1/5-1/8 likely, (b) vaccinated clear virus much faster, spend less time potential spreader. 

These BIG effects. vaccinated, Rt&lt;1 meaning virus would die out. vaccine really, really slows spread.

As final note, Leana Wen, great job describing [Washington Post fact vaccinated sometimes spread disease mostly relevant people live elderly, children, immunocompromised. unlikely vaccinated people ventilator. you. 9 days ago. 

I'm point even care. Vaccinated people protected morons refuse follow science going pay stupidity. Seems like win/win me.

Lmao. way following science deciding get 3rd shot without science telling you. thank Ron DeSantis, High Priest Nurgle happening. Small pox terrible eradicated it! Israel said 60 immunocompromised. ignored answering question. mostly drank beer friends basement CDC fear mongering every day. Breakthrough infections RARE. RARE. thankfully unlike last year get vaccinated protect hospitalization death. work service industry Baw√º there's huge increase passers asking nearest Schnelltestzentrum is. Unfortunately ones knew mandatory testing closed Saturday evening know direct people Google maps info super date late 1940s, polio outbreaks U.S. increased frequency size, disabling average 35,000 people year. Parents frightened let children go outside, especially summer virus seemed peak. Travel commerce affected cities sometimes restricted. Public health officials imposed quarantines (used separate restrict movement well people may exposed contagious disease see become ill) homes towns polio cases 

Today people would chomping bit cripple children tout natural herd immunity polio. Since kids rarely died what's big deal? Good thing Rick made illegal Florida schools mandate masks. Politicians making public heath decisions based poll numbers *fucking insanity*. don‚Äôt know people thought actually going weeks. knowledge US country politicized health it‚Äôs citizens international pandemic. vaccinated person believes science, particularly Darwin clearly discovered species adapt survive.

Having said above, say let die, natures way. Alright then. CDC Report- 13 million estimated number people United States living sleeping TB bacteria. TB positive tested. means 13 million cases TB present.

Link- Sure, entire population US vaccinated tomorrow, entire population US could go maskless 5 weeks, vaccines kicked in.

Obviously people elsewhere need keep precautions populations well-vaccinated cases low.

Obviously virus would continue mutate elsewhere, masking US would little-to-nothing prevent that, scenario.  Look bright side. age demographic extremely low risk, really don‚Äôt need worry much. letting people know! 

They're keeping businesses schools requiring masks. They're interested toeing party line. Traitors.  Ah Texas new Florida. However, eventually come end. Everyone still died. end. see chin maskers. 

Every time see one, ask wear undies. i'm seriously tired protecting Stupid. Especially throw right back face. sacrifice not; feels like we're treading water point.  Yeah, instead we'll end seeing good folk compromised immune systems die (both vaccinated unvaccinated) stupid anti-vaxxers likely end getting mild covid. cases start dropping near nil like June  absolutely furious selfish morons. probably minority opinion. think people leaning Darwinism bridge gap can't seem cross point. Florida's case rate 5 TIMES California's right now. vaccine appears it‚Äôs job keeping people hospital/death, knows long that‚Äôll hold Well outs now. either get can't work. makes happy. I'm rad tech. cat scan student 2020. clinical site 50 hours week scanning covid patents. rules kind went window. Paid to. want best people work with. mean that. National poverty line $22k.  family four! fine. Follow science say. Yet even science following words. particles virus smaller spaces cloth masks. WORK. N95 masks Surgical masks 2 work. NEXT: Masks ALWAYS worn A) sick INFECT others. B) Doctors &amp; Nurses performing procedures. Surgical N95 masks worn prevent little germ doctor nurse infecting patient procedure performed. 

Now say vaccine nothing Variant virus. getting Fauci Ouchie nothing us except allowing mRNA vaccine manipulate DNA logic is... would anyone listen people demonstrated values diametrically opposed theirs, wished death upon them, ridiculed 4 years differing opinions? Everything political divide going bridged anytime soon.

If called moron every single day one day appeared want help still muttering moron breath, world trust me? I'm wasting vax ...or getting sick it. science says since iv natural wonder making sure idiots get quickly possible also effect vaccination. immune getting better, get better is. that's choice (except can't get vaccine).  Link podcast? Vaccinated back January last year hospital, wore N95 coming going public transportation started seeing surge patients ER's.

People gave funny looks, one dude screaming government hoax I'm asshole. April hit, asshole lived near me, longer lives thanks covid.

I care people thought, worried bringing virus home family, possibly infecting patients I'm around hospital (IT guy, I'm units, ER's, OR's).

Now still ramps freezer trucks were, I'm dreading seeing things come back.

Therapy helps still can't shake uneasy feeling tired, half nurses refuse take vaccine that's insane. even think twice, research, use social media (except reddit).

I'm walking egg shells, N95's still back pack waiting bad news. Thankfully family vaccinated heart goes ill informed refuse get vaccinated.

You right, going away, might lessen lethality time many lives lost drastically changed due effects moderate/severe infections. Yeah except state would collapse without tourism considering entire tax system based ok. Way Florida man Florida man.... It‚Äôs going happen across America. FL easy point clients across America entertainment industry getting ready reopening. simply choice. open go under. significantly less likely caught/transmitted vaxxed people. impossible- less possible. higher rates vaccination chances could stayed low enough could likely able indoor live shows winter. borderline impossible. 

You‚Äôre welcome explanation. Okay exactly need wear mask?

Because reduced transmission... Asian countries seeing much worse spike US due poor vaccine rollouts like said wear masks.

And generally asian countries significantly denser, increases amount people infect. depending part Asia, people believe alternative 'medicine' poor medical care. everyone wants vaccinated, point wearing mask significantly less effective?

Being vaccinated give 100% immunity. mask give 100% immunity. combine two, get pretty good chance **not** getting infected, though again, **still 100%.** vaccine, great reset happen non conformist ???? Kids future nation. Screw screw country. Kids innocent ones risk parents refuse get vaccinated. ones due age limitations anyway.  government. let people unvaccinated deal consequences it.

Open society let people live lives. gold medal. optional unvaccinated staff. interesting part customers seem interpret masks cautious reality basically opposite.  non conformist interested 4 5 (80%) people hospitalized outbreak fully vaccinated.

Can post source this? see 7 people total hospitalized outbreak, find many fully vaccinated.

Even 80% claim. number people involved small (7) impossible assign statistical significance point. he‚Äôs vaccinated, good news won‚Äôt worry COVID. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  alternatively, double mask. Weather might preclude this.

I got KN95s good price couple months ago, sure they‚Äôre charging they‚Äôre widely available. recommend either getting mask helper thing tying knots elastic ear loops tighten seal do. true Malta, required show proof vaccination sign kid school. Reddit social media cycle jerk. understand last statement. left house vaccine? I've working whole time job. may changed routine little bit family still went stuff. can't reason anti-vaxxer, could, any. I'll let feel like won. obvious conclusion here. say I'm copping info wrong. That's fine. correct. said another post, I‚Äôm sure fewer 340 children die year due food allergies, yet still consider risk take seriously. say isn‚Äôt important raw numbers ridiculous. Plus, could well argue child‚Äôs life important years life remaining. counts health statistics. pharma corp public institution claimed vaccines would stop infections altogether. That's vaccines work. would give antibodies make infections less likely, meaning reproduction rate would decrease point virus would run steam even without lockdown. Wow. Real poverty wages Sure fuck does, evidenced fucking joke ass losers passing pile bills around country trying make mask mandates illegal pandemic. Back Florida, previous COVID infection got Pfizer back April. get tested?

Not symptoms currently friend pointed there‚Äôs chance test come false positive. People household vaxxed, except 18 month old son, already infected back November. ‚ÄúLittle boy‚Äù that‚Äôs kind weird call people sure

You one said ‚Äúthe variant likely come UK Florida‚Äù. you‚Äôre changing argument proved wrong showed several places higher numbers UK Florida. mean variant come places? No. might, I‚Äôm like make bold, definitive statements nothing back up. 

It‚Äôs okay wrong, nothing ashamed of. ones? saying test centers differentiate positive test vaccine vs covid ? thought incorrectly vaccine might get false positive test result case anyone curiosity which/how many vaccines Mexico gotten far. breakdown one's they've applied though. hospitals closed covid-19 patients provide services vaccinated.

We need house unvaccinated covid-19 patients something like military field hospital place house undocumented people applying legal refugee status receive care environment cannot harm people care protect. good enough separated migrant family, good enough unvaccinated Covid-19 patients get vaccinated. won‚Äôt worry so-called ‚Äúidiots.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs really simple. vaccinated. care aren't? Let be. like harm. Honestly, spitting ill see sub directed unvaccinated. amazingly vindictive spiteful bunch here, shy showing it. Well thank acknowledging they‚Äôre stupid then. generation referring to? What? putting people cannot protect risk preventable virus. consider something make someone justifiably mad? lifeguard supposed watching kid phone instead would angry? mention easier variants appear spread people unvaccinated. 

Do lack reasoning skills? I‚Äôm vaccinated still wear mask indoors, don‚Äôt care unvaccinated hospitalized people FFs.... made realize part ploy undermine public education system.... ""The family scared get vaccine, McCall said, health conditions know bodies would react shots.""

Shoulda worried bodies would react Covid. Stupid. Gonna better form printer piece card stock though. Eventually, course variant beat vaccines. eventually need booster shots every 6-12 months that‚Äôs updated current strains. go people naturally reach level cross immunity render mutations essentially level common cold  often one convinces antisocial stop committing crimes follow social rules.... find motivates use convince behave prosocial ways get want. 

So like point....

Or, vegan alternatives contain palm oil better ones contain 1% animal-derived gelatin? best examples course enough capital (including time) get something vegan fairly unproblematic arenas. Also probably best examples I'm assuming sufficient capital buying organic whole foods totally unprocessed high-quality sustainable clothing. 


Sure already thoughts set in-laws spouse. wonder though whether like, essential oils stuff, detoxes or... know, kind thing? 


Sorry I'm preaching choir here. bet I'm angry! want able go shopping without worrying who's going walk past isles, want able go concerts again. want Ren Faires back. miss conventions, miss rock gem shows, expos, FUCKING EVERYTHING.

It's literally matter time (and much time, things looking) get another new variant care vaccines.  Moderna recruiting kids 12 expand study. signed 1 year old (haven‚Äôt heard back yet) send link want. (Note: live within 50 miles study site)  happens. Seniors vaxxed. younger people dying. Well article says this:

 ""There also 12 new cases reported central China's Henan province, flood-stricken city Zhengzhou reported 11 new cases Saturday, well **16 asymptomatic cases, China include official figures.**""

Does help make sense? 

This article might also help Easy fix impossible enact. Mandate it. Anyone wants state issued ID need prove vaccinated diseases doctors want vaccines for. Anyone wants attend publicly funded school need vaccinated. would include school gets money taxpayers federal, state, local taxes.

I‚Äôm sure Republicans claim libertarians something say mandating women can‚Äôt get abortions. interesting. R√∏ truly close 10 wouldn‚Äôt even amazed burns mid summer makes even angrier even accept MSM = MainStream Media still know he's talking about. ask 5 people mainstream probably get 5-10 different answers.. sure westerners would rather die lose ""freedom"".

They getting wish fulfilled. Truth idgaf unvaxxed stop shutting everything giving freedoms away, vaccinated unvaccinated. Everyone letting govt take freedoms. seems everyone willing give away hope thing go away. won‚Äôt. live life. get one. it‚Äôs short.  feeling way myself. Graduated University pandemic announced. mess, found job that'd help getting live life call own. live middle fuck-all, Montana, there's jobs related diploma (Media Arts) apply within state. know always make game animation something, I'd relying shakey ground income. time took read history given quote, Q types brainwashed additional 100 people  certain states, sub robots let identify, public shaming occurring get shot.... fair seems like awfully public place get shot.

Do think Jim Bob convince buddies he's going booth stickers? that‚Äôs don‚Äôt want wear mask:) Wonder end it'll democrat base funding Trump independent run.. he'd shy take money. Probably threat means he'll become chosen candidate. three. gonna keep praying though, know come together figure stop arguing race politics focus love, environment, unselfish. don‚Äôt understand can‚Äôt meet middle. sad. tragic. happen.  Exactly! can‚Äôt lift bootstraps! NIH saying vaccinated need mask-up even home due variant.

Where getting from? yet read recommended one mask home. shut downs sake unvaccinated getting hospitalized. body choice mistake coffin. cater least common denominator anymore chance blew never will. deserve die made poor selfish choice? could care less life. opinion, want watch world burn. Right now, anti-vaxxers greatest threat long-term survival. So, yes, choose let dangerous virus run unchecked freedom means whatever want expense everyone else, deserve die. empathy them. Trucks cat muffler. ‚ÄúBWAAAAAAA, BWAAAA, BWAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH‚Äù No, it‚Äôs scientist clarifying government‚Äôs data. question data, media public interpretation data. course - anyone really wants one get one lying saying yet gotten vaccinated. people hesitant, places require documentation address health insurance. 

Most people want ""follow rules."" rules make clear supposed get third shot yet. really, really is. mom got J&amp;J wears mask everywhere goes, still got breakthrough case. It‚Äôs scary, honestly, breakthroughs touted rare figured would fine, especially precautions. Definitely glad vaxxed extremely grateful make less dangerous, Delta‚Äôs beginning feel like Russian roulette. I: way society last couple centuries, people would still die childhood horrific ways life expectancy would still like 40. insane.

Saw someone comment news vid Delta something like that, ""Unvaccinated proud,"" bet anything (and really Delta's r0, feels like *when*) get Delta, end severe infection, told put go vent, knowing full well might wake up, ""proud"" then.

I read article doctor Arkansas, believe, said deal terrified COVID patients begging vaccine put ventilator, explain make difference even did, late that. people idea possible hell they're signing for. Vaccines work, magic.

You might well shout front rock sub. basically declared pandemic day first vaccination results annouced (not even published announced company making them). even saw article (from equally gullible news agencies) shared ""Young people ready party like roaring twenties"" bullshit like that. friends boat. We've robbed. society government failed us. daily deaths low 90,000 cases? thought Delta bit deadly. due vaccinations? prevaccine. Haven‚Äôt seen studies asymptomatic risk factors - find let know.

The vaccine probably helps level, extent hasn‚Äôt really studied. also number things observed asymptomatic disease‚Ä¶. story, new studies. Freeze unemployment money, disability, etc form income get Note: CNN employs fewer competent fact checkers buzzfeed That's true. best predictor whether vaccinated supported president 2020. Age another big factor. Race third. nothing link wasn‚Äôt already reported. waning immunity infection, decreases sharply 6 months, vaccine (Pfizer case) still provides strong protection serious illness. get infected, likely asymptomatic mild case. partly CDC issued new mask guidelines week. point White House CDC aren‚Äôt even page, it‚Äôs fair wait information.

By means, believe whatever want believe, news media seems pick whichever story gets clicks, matter misleading might be.  heralded hero

When? really visible. see little kid wearing crutches (or iron lung), see dead people morgue. states must close borders Florida ! I‚Äôm familiar HIPAA, idea there. could also based looser correlation state/county Covid death numbers proportion dem/repub voters area. 

Anyway, ‚Äú4 1‚Äù ratio seems plausible, serious doubts came legit study, reasons like mention (and fact hasn‚Äôt paraded around media)  True understanding case drop stopped overall they're longer lockdown.. meaning wouldnt cause? good hear. course exceptions love hearing them. hoping return goes smoothly 2 weeks. masses need three second sound bites. Running 7-day cases US right around 20K 3 weeks ago (now hovering around 75K) Delta wasn‚Äôt dominant yet iirc. don‚Äôt think anyone would blame you, escalated quickly.  yet far ones *actually* attacking (and cases *killing)* people vaccines even simple masks opposite side.

Funny plays out, innit? Totally agree!!!!! Yea fs sake going back masks work. nice lasted getting shot isn‚Äôt issue person freedom, collective. I‚Äôm damn ready us move past this‚Ä¶.which point may never. people vaccinated? Oh vaccines don‚Äôt work now? Ok People angry multiple things once. say ban health insurance make pay every single medical expense pocket. understand hesitation, think days 'when go low, go high' rear view mirror, tbh.

Live little. life though. Like get pneumonia flu. got shot wear mask deaths haven‚Äôt risen vaccinated fear Yup. Please mask kids young get vaccine. people getting unofficial boosters. USA doesn‚Äôt central system checking someone‚Äôs Trevor Achilles, 27-year-old vulnerable Covid-19 received kidney transplant, said struggled get appointment CVS third vaccine, even doctor recommended one addition two doses Pfizer already received.

He finally able make appointment local pharmacy Charlottesville, Va., lives, Moderna vaccine Thursday. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm excited,‚Äù said Mr. Achilles, dishwasher. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm incredibly vulnerable don‚Äôt want take chances far Delta.‚Äù order compel seatbelt use pass laws requiring use. children‚Äôs car seats. Bottom line certain portion community stupid live. Floridian here, hotspot 3 weeks ago, things ""just fine."" Vaccine keeps hospital, still feel terrible catch it.  Long Covid isn‚Äôt real parents fully vaccinated I'm worried about...we covid well. 

How bad could delta them? understand concerns sympathize, like many things always exceptions, example niece friends (all Sophomores UF) vaccinated since May.

She telling almost everything knows vaccinated Sorority unofficially made requirement everyone vaccinated Sorority huge. TheRYe pAYinG doCtORs BLAme EvERy dEAth COvId though Yeah, hate data fundamentally misleading. protect kids. vaxxed here, comprimised immune system


The word screwed. Open butt crack lets get work.

If can't figure out, issues. really sick?? Oh shit Link CIDRAP article well viral load, similar spreading ability

Yes, theory, vaccinated person actually gets sick. Sick tests positive, likely symptoms. It‚Äôs unclear asymptomatic vaccinated person tests positive delta spread (but supposed isolate anyways, know more). 

The key vaccinated person exposed infectious person vaccinated person much better chance getting sick all, testing positive all, compared unvaccinated person. would take much higher exposure virus overwhelm vaccinated persons immune system would overwhelm unvaccinated persons immune system.

My mother new anti vaxxer mindset ""If post Facebook gets fact checked, telling truth.""

There's nothing convince people I'm afraid. Exactly, politics issue? democrats trying force masks children don‚Äôt need them? It‚Äôs ridiculous. Harbinger Granpa Nurgle getting COVID hospital.

I swear discourse online high trafficked areas, sensitive topics.... flood opinions closely mimic other. 

You find discussions clearly targeted manner tell difference. next phase. blame game. Dang thought COVID victims would collapse spot like aliens end Avengers, you‚Äôre telling patients actually end hospitals? Wack remember wasn‚Äôt quite old enough fully grasp going on.

Seeking people struggling breathe honestly scared me. Within two minutes understood bad flu. So, yes, need show people what's happening. 

We show beginning. people seemed understand it. Remember people used applaud nurses doctors left home work? somehow people got tired. time vaccine here, gotten used news telling us many people died today. somehow lost sense urgency even though far over. Tsk tsk... Typical bear week incident.... Polio still thing, countries require take booster shot visiting countries africa still pretty much active there. brother two vaccinated people friend groups. part evangelical community. able successfully convince one friend vaccinated. It‚Äôs science, facts, doctor says them. It‚Äôs member community seeing vaccinated ok. 

Even one persons mind changed win me. hope stir change communities. starting infect areas world since get watch US 24/7 I‚Äôve told don‚Äôt care feelings. that's 122,000 new incubators giving Delta-covid chance mutate something even dangerous. Scary. mean... 


He's wrong... ""y'all""? I'm mad. think short-sighted. predict building, 2-year waitlist, gonna feel free kick pay rent right street, move people waitlist. think vastly misunderstanding disease genuinely think people going start dying streets. disease simply deadly enough that. 

The people statistically significant danger elderly infirm. purpose lockdowns vaccines protect weak healthy society would do. Truly sign degenerated cannot even agree protect weak. Exactly. tidal swell furious anger restrictions administration trying operate in, hell else going say especially weren‚Äôt sure regular ‚Äúmedical‚Äù masks solid solution (even now, one person wearing there‚Äôs crazy benefit) plus weigh risks cutting healthcare workers would literally die without it. remember shortages first months covid said wear mask. nightmare. You‚Äôre developmentally disabled think many politicians aren‚Äôt bought owned well maybe hyperbolic covid ending everything fine. happened biden's CDC told everyone drop guard Masks part lives while, yes. Yeah that's problem, media folks put fingers ears talk view point doesnt come msnbc fox news. need much aggressive public health policy focused zeroing covid cases want get anything done involves making hard medium term sacrifices help get politicians re-elected grew poor lived around drug addicts much life, yeah, tell people spending drugs usually do. go back gathering groups beating people proud unvaccinated unmasked like they‚Äôre liability humanity. Ah, I‚Äôm 40. no, whole life. started getting bad 20‚Äôs going downhill since. I've heard Pfizer, least, fully approved end August/early September. Moderna right behind them. sure thing, they're mostly processing paperwork double-checking figures make sure missed anything. Vaccinated Unvaccinated people wear mask! kinds right masks useless, least outdoors.

no admitted lied later. pretty abhorrent parents rope kinds political 'stands'. wtf wrong DeSantis? (rhetorical...not enough room record things wrong him)

For Pro-Life party actions seem counter intuitive say least. Plague rat apologist Honestly, kind do. know love them, see lot consideration paid kind future lays ahead them. clinate change, though that's big one. overall disinterest future world kids live in. never thought would live time intelligence science would looked upon large section population. 

Dude, they've like whole life. noticing? purposely obscuring statement exclude ‚Äúhold people forcefully inject them‚Äù. instead claim said ‚Äúthe Covid19 vaccine rape‚Äù. hold stance statement thanks. ordered 150 masks. pending charges $150 $200. assume $200 shipping handling. I'm bit frustrated ordered Friday, called next day noticing pending charges, lady answered said cannot help online orders. called second time, said ability check orders hours.

I'll wait charges settle ask CC help. Thanks reply. really.

He reacting developing situation much said true despite called lies some.

He kinds right masks useless, least outdoors.   grandma casually texted morning 4 young cousins care covid. Im kind pissed got vaccinated immediately despite going covid hoax, didnt take 2 cousins could vaccinated her.

Just ridiculous üôÑ PC stuff gotta say, idiot Well ofcourse, average worker prime 30's collecting social security 60's that's profit-driven corporations/countries see people as, hence countries like U.S. China gutted care systems elderly. hand, children future society lies. literally entire elderly population country dies scary transfer wealth might convince current working generation work less far less dangerous country 10-15 years literally zero people work force every child country died. Hell, reduction prime work force combined lowering standard living less availability work (e.g. families sold car able work) significant contributing factors labor shortage U.S. bet ""google search"" leading Fox Facebook reached point burying bodies (and reached mass grave level pandemic), there's nobody left make vaccines. Body collection burial services one last things go functioning society. Yeah wouldn‚Äôt support go fund me. willing gamble I‚Äôm helping debt.  Fauci spread false information. Ever since CDC dropped mask mandate. went around sub yelling people going spiral xovid control are.  Especially country...  Muslim? people ready internet. mean one group controls ""truth""? LoL imagin√© voluntarily nurse doctor Florida. Looking demographics Japan (because that's live), largest number cases 20's 30's, 20's almost double 30's. case numbers. 10% 20's needed hospitalization (generally supplementary oxygen). 


Data collection piss-poor though, sure much says. 10% large (mostly unvaccinated) population needs hospitalization, quite bit. goes back way Trump. Half America always like this. Well vaccine really 100% effective shouldn‚Äôt see breakthrough cases would imply vaccines failing. One thing note people working major hospital likely exposed average person. 9 year old voice reason, something gone terribly wrong. That‚Äôs 50 billion dollar company work for. Around 75% adults fully vaccinated MA, low.



As simple example, suppose 100 people hospital, 20 vaccinated 80 unvaccinated, ratio stated article. many would everyone unvaccinated? multiply 80 unvaccinated 4 (1/0.25) scale 100%, since 25% unvaccinated, giving us 320. vaccinated? calculation scales 20 1.333 (1/0.75) 27. Vaccination thus prevents 293 hospitalizations, 320, efficacy around 92%.



Some people ""unvaccinated"" group received single dose, previously recovered COVID, reducing numbers category, real efficacy fully vaccinated compared immunity would even higher. context, add Wake County Raleigh, capital. sizable city mask wearing generally frowned upon. Mexico, crappy health system. Please understand point made. point blanket statements. thought moderna already working booster? That‚Äôs one big issues. (No pun intended) amount overweight (not obese) people world super high people don‚Äôt seem realize counts at-risk category. Never mind healthy weight unhealthy lifestyles (totally sedentary, smokers, vapers, etc.) Unfortunately he‚Äôll likely continue capitulate donors: universal mask mandate serious restrictions‚Äîhave keep minimum wage earners (still getting paid 2009 rates) risking lives front lines keep profits coming in. know topic mind asking.

What cycle disrupted made something want risk again? person always irregular cycle, I'm curious ways impacts people something I've always dealt changes perspective I'm grasping people experiencing due vaccines, like different experience. notice anything cycle following vaccination idk that's expect predictable. What‚Äôs solution? people vaccinated still keep masks forever? would man selfish put whole family though stress ? Alas, hillbillies don‚Äôt think make life living hell. robust testing system place determine that, though.

That's frustrating part this, aside inability decipher actual truth anything CDC puts anymore. How, 17-months this, still mass testing system place. heard doctors scientists beginning testing important thing, major tool get us pandemic. *still* issue? side effects? 

Except fever arm ache days vaccination, there‚Äôs recurring side effect. Even context understand he's going soundbites highlighted montage. Well people anyway. Clearly all, most. always rational sensible, America lucky , National Treasure always noted dips like occur every single weekend. way since literally start pandemic. Less tests perform fewer results produced. usually continues Wednesday numbers often peak.

It literally every single week happens news always acts shocked optimistic numbers Sunday.

It may useful look weekly averages Korea ameliorate problem. ‚ÄúMy 9-year-old kept saying ‚Äòwe need masks on‚Äô put mask.‚Äù

Smartest person whole family Many thought masks would never make comeback.

Now quite think capacity limits social distancing return schools remain open. rely herd immunity thus getting vaccinated. like, got vaccinated stayed locked several months year. new virus. That's biggest scam all. virus around 20 years. different strain. Refer original comment kids. problem protect kids area parents don‚Äôt feel need. Good, governments want do/feel. 

Divide bring society tipping point, people literally beg government introduce new social score system. would done same. 
these ppl determined drag country hell.  I'm published scientist. 'Appears' means modelling predicts happen. never see scientific article say something like 'this happen future',it always wording like 'appears' 'our analysis suggests'. nothing 100% certain, good evidence it. 


It's real shame may people read carefully worded scientific articles get wrong message. see problem headline reason, supported best evidence general public dismiss careful scientific language. Yeah still burden society tho.  Thanks good know  deny people access certain things. Like county fairs. Theme parks. Pools. Hotels. Restaurants. Theatres.  Basically Vaccine passports way get stop nonsense.  vaccinated care needing it. This! anger vitriol scary. brother-in-law part-joked wanting run group anti-vax protesters yesterday. see people claim 'moral high ground' vaccination go threaten death unvaccinated. üòÇ yikes called Alabama  No..they're already saying vaccine gave everyone variant. 

In us, BI0L101 first level college biology course right talking country knowing BIOL101. 

Did mean high school biology?  still reinfected shed virus children, immunocompromised, even cause breakthrough cases, lengthening pandemic's duration.

It's black white thing. Please reconsider point You‚Äôll okay. explain me? I‚Äôm American that‚Äôs see looking in

I mean videos accused sounds like that‚Äôs happend want us believe burden healthcare? they‚Äôre firing unvaccinated nurses / doctors healtcare.. make sense you? way things improve society stop tolerating it. Dont hire them, dont associate them, dont accept them. 

Yup. true.  beginning pandemic  Yeah, right. totally wrong. Complete misinformation wish Reddit tool flag comments like this. Except simple.

Unvaccinated people give way variants, overburden medical system, catch virus readily potentially transmitted children, immunocompromised, cause breakthrough cases pandemic's length.  already happened whole 1% protests.  pretty much ended bridge NYC protesters funnelled onto bridge arrested fined disrupting traffic. needed get back work need money. 

This ramping many people still waiting work start again. lost jobs.  there's nothing else do. People vaccinated choice often really expect anyone wear mask them. conversation people can't vaccinated understand. You‚Äôll okay. reason angry. People subreddit always hyperbolic project want reality instead following logic science. comments post perfect example. would go far say comment sections subreddit actually one lowest quality discussions topical subreddit. number creep people die republican party cry why? Why? Why? rules smart people like you.  Caught COVID bad denominator too. Exposed COVID would better one, basically unknowable. Lol. Right. Also, literally vax/unvax spread covid (according recent cdc report) you, kind, focus health, take care yourself. God bless geriatrics vaccinated, course hospitilized geriatrics vaccinated. misleading fearmongering interpretation.   Nah, pretty small, subreddit back February? point variants might pose problem variants could evolve vaccine resistance back then, think people assumed anti-vaxxer pointing out. variants may also pop up, thanks appear want keep circulating wild selfish stupid care others.  


Yet sad hear ICU nurses saying unvaccinated, put ventilators, begging vaccine.........but late them. yet anti vax movement managed reduce vaccine levels point childhood diseases like measles becoming problem again. Although won‚Äôt get ‚Äúapex protection‚Äù antibodies provide, still Memory Cell Immunity. immune system officially know COVID better equipped respond efficiently create antibodies naturally issue mask mandates social distancing mandated, pretty much tools slow spread virus. vaccine, ever better tool safe, convenient potential bring us back normal. It‚Äôs anti-vaxxers prolonging pandemic point so, yes, I‚Äôm truly pissed anti-vaxxers. ? could never work industry help people help themselves. Vaccinated spread get infected virus. discussion. It‚Äôs ridiculous blame unvaccinated, they‚Äôre making harder they‚Äôre protected. Blame government, people. you‚Äôre vaccinated doesn‚Äôt mean everything going get back normal. ? Especially since unvaxxed wear masks anyway ‚Äúl‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äù,‚ÄùI‚Äù.

Says needs say right there. many people even got vaccine get sick infected. Define 90% people hospitalized geriatric hospital Israel , 62% general hospitals.

You asked many , gave links show 62% hospitalized covid patients general hospitals fully vaccinated 90% people hospitalized geriatric hospitals. 

Over half people hospitalized vaccinated YES!! wonder people don‚Äôt trust CDC, especially minorities. wiping surfaces thing stupid. masks don‚Äôt protect stupid, wearing mask outside (in circumstances) stupid. say‚Äîlook, really want safe, wear mask indoors crowded spaces. know going fuck boosters. dont problem things made news reports wish would also include counter point balance articles out.

If read text full could, possibly, maybe, theoretical, prove, ect. recently read articles scientists ""shocked baffled"" fast decline infections UK one seen comeing all.

It gets people confused. pointed sub February/March got heavily dowmvoted. People back we're complete denial danger variants possibility evolution vaccine resistant, complaining media 'scare mongering' vaccines. Seemed anti-vaxx merely pointing vaccinated people going back normal surrounded unvaccinated people bad idea. Vaccines work critical managing pandemic,but tooany people seemed think soon got vaccinated pandemic over. Agreed, enough stupid rules mask.

If delta really making 1000 times virus cloth mask worth 1/1000 supposed benefit before. Ignore chum..

This preventable.

Sadly politicians running show care fucking votes money people.

Eventually intelligent tired done, look anti-vaxx. saying study wrong (I looked ), solution proposes self-defeating. Acting like vaccines work make sure stop working.

It's like saying ""you drive car might break able drive anymore."" 69% least one dose (a stupid metric opinion). 63% fully vaccinated (two doses plus two weeks). 74% infected vaccinated means vaccinated people represented. I'd chalk feeling life ""normal"" acting irresponsibly. 

Get vaccinated. Wear mask. Distance. 

Read HIPAA: Allow us introduce Im losing patience people thinking get vaccinated think unvaccinated thing pre-COVID normalcy, really misunderstanding current predicament. stat dishonest interpretation data. means transportation destination. Travelling friends and/or family car outweighs risk sitting flying soup bunch strangers. Massively underreported. can't get 12 hr shifts hospital work at....I'm burning five days eights. getting old asking people wear mask....matter fact think staff stopped asking patients comply 

Thanks part problem, least angry selfish burden rest. idea says surf page, people saying going wear masks , seen people wear . Remember news vetted. Ah old good days . power expense paper real editors protected us garbage. Thanks I'd leave kinds conclusions epidemiologists random redditor. Some? What's difference getting infected German beach getting infected Italian beach? virus care arbitrary borders. Mask mandates similar measures might stay around Singapore long time.  matter given, dispensing pharmacy record name.  Damn lot vaccinated people sub sounding like unvaccinated mask mandates social distancing first issued. Empathy gone window selfish thinking jumped right in. hypocrisy makes sad. I‚Äôm 29, healthy, vaccinated still wear mask public. It‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs protecting others, even disagree choices get vaccine. True, also amount misinformation astonishing.  maybe. me, yes. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm angry. noticed they? soon Singapore lifts restrictions, virus come back infect people. going go away. There's vaccine sterilizing immunity coming next year take laugh everyone lived lives year.  link study, words. think feel bad might spread people. worried 0%, careful don‚Äôt want worry parents family members immunocompromised don‚Äôt to. Still go much usual, buying better masks test I‚Äôm exposed now. Same‚Ä¶‚ÄùA misanthropic anthropoid‚Ä¶‚Äù Also food service, exhausting. We've losing people since December, we're always staffed. We've one person schedule shown 6 weeks management can't find anyone else. Constant juggling, getting 1am (10pm close) I'm shutting 2-3 stations touched since mid shift left washing literally dishes since 3. 30¬¢ raise they'd hyping months, glad put two weeks last week. hospital teaching it‚Äôs staff wash hands? don‚Äôt already know properly wash hands way bigger concerns covid. completely contradicts previous cnn post 'the invalidated varient factory'

The virus change without vaccine, strains generally get weaker &amp; transmissible strain varient result vaccine actually resistant.  90% small percentage ?! One cut one's cloth. strategy worked, that's matters. Kudos. smallpox? act differently!  


This last time deal ignorant mindsets. key mention neighbors, say something like, ""Once 70% people vaccinated, stop masking, get vaccine today!""

A message like appeals self-interest also acknowledging vaccination group effort. Well yeah, point :-)  getting COVID may also long term health implications, known minimum rate. Yeah got you, know insurance companies won't... every chair theatre broken give tetanus. date right? can't both? know certain people prefer mode operation big group.. every kid 12 can't get it.  Except really science, clickbait science served make shame fat people paying diets useless shit.  good news, completely expected anyone paying attention data Israel. Israel's data pretty damn clear: Delta, 6-7 month old vaccination good enough efficacy infection dropping less 50% (compared vaccinated three months prior retained 75%+ protection Delta [Source - slide 

It would entirely expected healthcare workers primarily fully vaccinated January February getting Delta relatively high rates (still better unvaccinated course). 

While still relatively robust protection hospitalization severe disease (which mediated T- B- cell response design wane anywhere near quickly active antibodies), FDA really get around authorizing boosters least subset population (5+ months past initial vaccination higher risk). data clear day point needed control infection. clarified ‚Äúfor anyone medically able refuses.‚Äù course wouldn‚Äôt wish someone cannot, valid medical reason, get shot. asshole. Funny. Polio manufactured NIH backed lab China. Almost 40% ICU beds used covid Dec/Jan wave - 90% full

Now 99% full 20% covid. kinds exposures necessarily representative. family reunion means people spending literal hours together relatively small space probably well ventilated space. exposure event everybody exposed going get infected regardless vaccination status. 100% wrong.

Think channels would reported it. Think anti-vaxxers are. ask really think anti-vaxxers would listen goddamn thing channels reported. 

This problem one half country that, conveniently, largely identifies one group. way get rid problem getting rid them. Thankfully seem intent themselves. Less thankfully, disease contagious killing innocent bystanders well. I‚Äôm breakthrough infection. Pfizer March, covid positive last week. Check r/covid19positive. tons us. Americans. Canadian feel frustrated choosing get vaccinated. Why? much interaction children nieces nephews freaking out. Hell one nephew different mask day week different ninja turtle super hero. people see freaking masks days adults hyper reactionaries. Sounds like could use new dork friends. Imagine headline like this, metropolitan area crime statistics. Everyone would lose - saying it‚Äôs right stereotype, etc. Love double standard y‚Äôall. I‚Äôm hoping start refusing cover anything related Covid unvaccinated.

I really hope happen, people medical reasons can't get shot. know evil insurance companies going differentiate anti-vax people. Omg. read article said event geared towards men thought curious mention actual event was. Makes much sense now. problem arises people start committing acts violence employers places business. many - perhaps even - us here, almost impossible us comprehend mindset many people fed nonstop disinformation covid, vaccines, etc, still important us try.

Many people literally believe government trying strip rights little lose. Rational minds see that's case, propaganda disinformation goal - highly effective - radicalizing otherwise rational people. Hopefully remain peaceful move leave behind or, better yet, they'll eventually join us. numbers really useful. high percentage total population die recently, absolute death rate meaningful without knowing absolute prevalence. Hospitalizations deaths important cases honest would everything power move. know teachers develop relationship community really willing catch covid? matter willing bring home family? 

Best luck pray tonight. It‚Äôs ridiculous often news goes straight sensationalist headline, especially regarding Covid. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre cheering Vaccines questioned. North Carolina.  antigen test swab collected lab staff is, obvious reasons, official swab collected Anyone idea long takes?

I tests home, things need digital certificate official site get you... use [the CDC's breakthrough deaths currently 954 1263*. March July seen ~100,000 reported COVID deaths US (we hit 500k Feb 23rd, ~613k).

Even non-medical things, too. Like seatbelts, example. imagine people calling ‚Äúconstricting death traps‚Äù ‚Äúviolations freedoms‚Äù make asshole? Fact obese much worse outcomes covid health problems general. 

Thats science. I'm surprised self-insured companies gone road more. Yes I'm also aware 0.004% people fully vaccinated Covid-19 experienced breakthrough case resulting hospitalization less 0.001% died disease, according latest data US Centers Disease Control Prevention.

I feel can't get vaccinated medical reasons... among group I'd simply stay home like 1.5 years better solution available. would decide rolling dice worth me. would go public get mad vaccinated people unmasked.  saw someone argue polio never disappeared, renamed autoimmune disease. 

I felt dumber conversation. Maine morning. lake house come every weekend. actually thought area pretty tame compared weekends. kind cool outside less people around Sebago Long Lake. easy end this,my ex father law vented right now. got vaccine early wife daughter it.

We need cone together nobody ""safe"" this. guys really need get republican control.

Hurry shitbirds Disabling 35k people per year, called one feared disease US. Another disease 500k fatality per year, called hoax. Guess people's mind work differently now. dad contracted polio vaccine available. local newspaper picture grandmother standing hospital bed 1959.

It works OK delta. Maybe better OK, maybe quite good OK. data place that.

This article really much clarify part picture. dad got polio child 1940. vaccine came out, asked doctor get anyway. doctor said yes dad got it. He's feisty dude mid-80's verbally rip anti-vaxxer chooses cross path.  No. They‚Äôll never stop - even someone who‚Äôs already vaxed. can‚Äôt force somebody else get vaccine, force me. I‚Äôm angry anyone, vaccination protects I‚Äôm content that. 

If people want take risk that‚Äôs them. Beware base rate fallacy. numbers vaccinated unvaccinated people event equal. barely care countrymen/women. Forget foreigners. Despicable really country, they've opened summertime, fuck school kids every September.

I hope antivaxxers blatant non regulation followers choke lungs thus year. Get planet. I'm annoyed tired. I'm also thankful employer WFH pandemic.

Also ask doc muscle relaxers take night maybe.  Good luck you!  Back pain awful. think masks become part life long term. restaurants bars reopen. We'll accept transmission occur maskless environments public transport shopping masks new normal. Honest question, politics. vaccinated people worried? read, vaccinated people safe, extreme cases, may catch it, mild. flu others. 0.001% end bad. flu virus, driving accidents, etc, etc. part life. 

My logic: 
1- People vaccinated: part. Enjoy life. 
2- People don‚Äôt want vaccine: decision. life. $ treatment. 
3- People can‚Äôt get vaccine: Wear mask option. 

In big picture, politics, want missing? point 100$ tax cut bonus take vaccine proof. waited long enough people able protect vaccines. want see friends live life again.

Covid going away need figure personal risk tolerance need protect *your*self. includes masks distancing fine.  Keep voting people want money still want kill you. brother law wife got diagnosed w/ covid pnuminia 2 weeks 5 days ago. 3 weeks ago baby's birthday party.

He straight enough shooter figured would vaccinated nope! much media impossible tell truth, lies, delta variant might even exist... 

And ofc, goes everywhere without mask 'nobody else is'. 

Im tired. kid goes daycare gotten covid (3 year olds dont get vaccinated) would exposed 60+ people. would exposed people?

Brother law didnt inform us covid bored hospital 3 days ago. 

Just fucking exhausted. dont worry yall, wife recovering home now! all, full treatment Remdesivir!

Because Remdesivir is... Youknow. Safe... vaccine isnt... something. mind wearing mask. ""accessory"" protects others way myself. would get instantly rid mask Corona (although vully vaccinated) teach protesters/anti-vaxx lesson. Let wonder ventilator might made wrong decision before... SARS-COV2 vaccinated people dangerous flu, act like new smallpox. I've fulfilled part deal, society's turn.

We went sars-cov2 like flu sars-cov2 like flu vaccinated people . 

There people got vaccine still get sick , see happening Israel. vaccinated people infected vaccinated people.

[90% people admitted covid19 geriatric hospital (meaning bad state was) vaccinated single day hear fully vaccinated people hospitalized covid19. 

You could infected someone else also vaccinated. Please understand point. met statement origin point reason responded asinine comment begin with. It‚Äôs blatant misinformation knowing sub y‚Äôall like kind thing. August. fear going happen winter work tribal casino, reopened may 2020....then balls give us shirts logo followed essential. Also reader board said ""still safely open"" longest time. We're big casino means took slap face small local businesses shut temporarily permanently. Sucks continue working company pay bills keep family fed, roof heads  seem missed masks mandates social distancing immediately discarded, even less 90% total population fully vaccinated yet. 

That suggets vaccination important, word ""immediately"" implies restrictions removed point. Definitely agreeing this. 

Indeed population eligible vaccine time. indeed ‚Äúeasy‚Äù make decision comes children becomes suddenly much difficult, especially due lack long term studies particular vaccines children. 

Sure mRNA technology around adults never caused anything major report, good enough feel good me. coming children, haven‚Äôt seen much really would understand parents would like specific studies rather ‚Äúrelated‚Äù results.  school year even started. husband day 6 symptoms starting lose taste smell. 

Since unvaccinated seems higher chance long term. stats recovery this? don‚Äôt understand key reducing community spread level virus everywhere. COVID become endemic, mean mean always midst pandemic.  pandemic subsides, COVID still around pockets, life go back normal, more-or-less.  Maybe, outbreak occurs school, close school weeks isolate affected population stop outbreak.  cannot that, literally everywhere - every school, every restaurant, ever town, every city.

The problem people thought pandemic moment got vaccinated. Um people severe adverse reactions? look FDA website. Pro Tip: keep mask on. Wow, everyone history used exact line thinking instead fighting society‚Äôs injustices. ‚ÄúIf want part society, follow rules.‚Äù Tell people history fought rules unfair discriminatory. followed guess. ‚ÄúYou can't reason someone something reasoned first place.‚Äù - Mark Twain Unvaccinated getting way government is.  country would cost nearly half salary get tested twice every month based pricing would bit harsh. get test done public health care results take nearly week return, privately within 24 hours so. hear 6x? heard 2.25x versus *original* strain (less vs. Alpha). Many people tend fall one other, us don't. Unfortunately, I've learned trying advocate discussions someone categories exhausting waste energy usually. many us, loud, here.

However, attest many know tend fall one other, understand ""this that"" break down. made political issue instead public health issue agree contributed binary. That‚Äôs really good idea! cheaper another lockdown. No, live 1800 years refuse wait another 3. ""maybe"" exactly part problem, 5?

I've stopped caring go way live ego-trip getting vaccinated. end day, choice want become immune: vaccination infection. important respect choice let get way immunity.

Tens thousands (depending country live in) die winter flu never mandatory social distancing. discovered west Asia knew decades (that masks work), going get mask mandates lockdowns every year?

SARS-COV2 vaccinated people dangerous flu, act like new smallpox. I've fulfilled part deal, society's turn. lot vaccinated people getting positive test results, would surge cases caused been?

I knew one person got it, pre-vaccine rollout. Since then, know 3 people, fully vaccinated, gotten it. Minor symptoms, yeah, positive nonetheless.  Happy cake day. :) ""Some""? it‚Äôs 0.6% amongst unvaccinated. 600 times more. fully agree!  Trinidad. WTF? actually team virus?  Singapore, example, 76% population received least one dose 57% received two doses mRNA vaccines. However, masks mandates still HEAVILY enforced restaurants remain closed exactly well known SARS-Cov-2 spread among vaccinated.

You must real good reading skills draw interpretation post.

He also wrote [another talking Israel administering third dose desperation vaccines working. community college, like Sheradon College Oakville, would well known animation department Conestoga trades stuff. don‚Äôt scientist know this.. it‚Äôs matter time. look delta variant way aggressive it‚Äôs predecessors. I‚Äôm also sure scientists find way beat current strings. We‚Äôre ahead 1 year ago. people ""adverse reaction"" many vaccines, possibly bad hangover. expected, quite frankly pathetic excuse avoid vaccination. really, country costs quarter salary get tested, within month spending nearly half salary testing. Sucks get voted say like masks valid reasons, matter. I'm masks schools too. teach elementary children English second language. Masks make job hard makes stressful little children. fact. stress young children real damaging children. personal experience documented children stress anxiety means nothing. point give every fully vaccinated person 2000 euros call day. Would boost economy health. mean many risk covid exposure? Everyone risk covid exposure unless stay locked zero contact house. There‚Äôs weird taboo sub able say dislike mask. 

For reason enjoying mask wearing experience equates anti-masker here. 

It‚Äôs one facet lot black white thinking see here. kinda agree survival survival fittest approach There‚Äôs certainly large number antivaxxers, people lazy misinformed. France, rate recently accelerated government basically made vaccinations mandatory many public places. Germany far doesn‚Äôt this‚Ä¶ eventually they‚Äôll well. great != chance. 

The children's hospitals high risk areas filling up. Kids dying Delta. mention potential long CoVid kid could mean less functioning adults 10-60 years putting drain country comes fear mongering There's another point, count infected admitted HMO perform test something. covid test anyone (only symptoms, verified contact sick person etc). still missing point. They're claiming virus spread among received vaccine many people didn't. punish hand washing? Hell, remember early stages covid Italy slammed, pictures everywhere people took fairly seriously...until hit US stopped. I'm betting we're going find years Trump administration pressured major outlets running ICU stories showed extent covids devastation. Wat I‚Äôm angry. I‚Äôve accepted it‚Äôs longer responsibility help protect others choices. made personal choice get vaccinated, longer needed wear mask. normal summer threat. continue ignore mandates recommendations. 

Before anyone says,‚Äùwhat children‚Äôs!‚Äù, children masked area time, including county fair attended week. There‚Äôs need one cares. I‚Äôm concerned hero. Yes. would nice endemic population chance get vaccinated. According OP, - could also virus spreads among vaccinated.

He literally wrote that. vaccination Germany seems slowed speed tremendously last couple weeks. Even France overtaken Germany vaccines, really many antivaxxers Germany?  stopped wearing refuse wear them, high income area today many without masks, confronted one said need one I'm vaccinated, last week entered office building wearing N95 maskless person took distance asked I'm sick sick wear masks.

While anecdotal, rich people places still frightening me. 2% fatality rate. got second jab week ago. I've seen perhaps 10 different people last 500 days. everyone (except kids) chance get vaccinated, there‚Äôs reason tolerate unvaccinated people spreading virus traveling. US government roll in. That's huge part problem. certain levels government blocking preventative measures. Im wearing mask! Eff that! Got vaccine, didn‚Äôt thats you. Scared? Stay home! Don‚Äôt make lose rights want exercise yours! there's plenty data suggesting vaxxed getting infected high rates too. 

Vaccinated people catch it, causes mild illness, like catching cold, people care.

Have ever gone might catch cold? That's see it.

If get sick, I'll stay home. I'll wear mask crowded indoor places. hell getting enjoying myself; I'm going suffer idiots want get vaccinated getting sick. old work colleague know thought vaccine dangerous etc always went avoid vaccine thought covid like minor flu. He's 43 severe ashtma ended catching covid. Initially fine soon ended hospital ICU. Fortunately survived low behold changed opinion vaccine actually ended getting 1st dose last week.  would yes. know long covid immunity lasts infection, know another shot gives strong immune response.

It helpful. Well, one political party can‚Äôt stand Florida, another political party loves walls. feel like maybe come compromise. lot stuff shut Washington early pandemic we've slow re-open. fatality rate low, problems anti-vaxxers. everything right. lived like hermit year. single human house entire time. groceries delivered. trips sales work week, drug store trips, gas station visits. That's it. Never went inside restaurant, even drive thru. retail shopping. parents died years ago, see sibling's family 15 months. Got shots ASAP available. 

I patient stupid ignorant. figured they'd see right way eventually. yet are.

I want life back. want back NOW. I'm beyond frustrated now. I'm angry. I'm 3 months away demanding government exterminate shitheads one one. want GONE country. ""Where Ron DeSantis go get apology?""

Lockedup protesting lockdowns. Everyone option vaccine point. don‚Äôt want suffer. It‚Äôs choice. Let die want to. we're prevaccinated levels infection

We prevaccinated levels infection, least peak. hitting upwards 200K cases per day, we‚Äôre currently bouncing 50K 100K. definitely understand could get back there, let‚Äôs precise words plenty data suggesting vaxxed getting infected high rates too

This completely untrue, unless vastly different definitions ‚Äúhigh 125,682 ""breakthrough"" cases 38 states represent **less .08 percent 164.2 million-plus people fully vaccinated since January**.

Breakthrough cases happening, sure, way would say they‚Äôre happening high rate. fair, article later says number likely higher due states reported breakthrough cases, much higher really get unless tens millions breakthrough cases hiding 9 sub needs stop deflecting blame antivaxxers

I think it‚Äôs completely fair deflect blame antivaxxers. everyone vaccinated except children 12, would whole different ball game. it‚Äôs vaccinated people pick ball back little while, sure. tool beat thing, choose blame refuse tool. Lockdowns ever meant temporary fix. Source? 99.9% children get mild symptoms? believe fearmongering... would think literally millions kids getting vaccine already (both doses fact) US Canada would proof needed every regulatory body approve adolescents already. man, it‚Äôs going okay promise. greatest scientific minds immunology came together create multiple solutions deadly problem, yet dumbest minds think know want trust smart people. We're living Idiocracy. like... care? Show deaths hospitalizations per cases. one gives flying fuck case #s people fully vaccinated you‚Äôll still able catch COVID won‚Äôt serious side effects it.

All increase cases headlines fear mongering see increase deaths. Florida also lower deaths per capita states much older population. 

So despite 1.5 years anti mask anti restrictions isn‚Äôt obvious increase deaths compared states imposed mask mandates restrictions. Total average number tests done here, reported, around 40-50k per day. Wow , optimist would absolutely love get garbage hole. 
NC CA dream locals .  absolutely cannot cancel postpone, least wear mask crowd. good news vaccine protect hospitalized dying. imagine much better would going US didn‚Äôt leader emboldened beliefs worst types people country 4 years? mean they‚Äôre still fucking morons obv wouldn‚Äôt going swimmingly, still‚Ä¶ true would catch lot diarrhea coming mouths.

But hell like 50% health care workers vaccinated. wanted give preference front line workers safer us get shots asap.

I'm tired crap. hope employers insurance companies kick able unwilling hell out. vaccine you, that's OK, cover cost oxygen rest life. Jesus Christ, COVID ""couple years"" already.

to name few. Check out. 74% new infections 80% hospitalizations FULLY VACCINATED great, actually symptomatic suffering disease? No? news?

Yes? I‚Äôve vaccinated since April (Pfizer) suffering COVID past week. severe walk park either. Going day 3 taste/smell. Still glad gotten vaccine since I‚Äôm sure reduced severity, naive say vaccinated aren‚Äôt symptomatic suffering disease. know studies done yet remember lot hypothesis vitamin positive effect survivability among infected well. I'm uncertain be, u/vote4any came information explain (logically, me, although expert) thread. Basically, anyone who's infected start viral load (the amount virus breathed in), difference days vaccinated reduced load unvaccinated increased load. 

Now, I'm saying definitely correct. makes sense me, studied biology chemistry 'A' level (18 y/o) am, means, expert. part ""no difference viral loads"" find difficult believe, immune system fighting virus (surely?) reducing viral load. part saying ""viral loads consistent ability shed infectious viruses"" totally get with. Yes, absolutely infected covid, regardless powerfully immune system deal it. Except ones die agree this, state patchwork learning options. included distance learning. However virtual school option dismantled. absolutely insane. live state delta variant surging.  People already vaccinated would get vaccine. good one.  days 6-10 going hell. year... days worst. living made father ready bag go hospital moment's notice oxygen therapy blood ox dropped far.

What saved cpap machine, nasal pillow, could keep mouth closed simply breathe nose. Mouth breathing made immediately cough irritating point got dizzy lightheaded. nasal mask, slept force air nose, bypassing mouth.

Stay hydrated lots sleep, wrapped sweatpants blankets sweat best eat high calorie broth soups stay nourished.  miss days NNN stood Nut November  vaccine meant keep hospital dying. make invincible infection hence term ""breakthrough infection"". Say vaccine 95% effective, that's still 5% chance isn't. Still low, zero.  kid needs use well-fitting N95 mask. reduce amount virus inhaled reduce likelihood infectious viral load.

The one two mutations away statement misleading. implies next mutation one vaccine resistant. think actually meant it‚Äôs *possible* 1-2 unlucky mutations would cause vaccine resistant. 

The reason don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs likely (and I‚Äôd really like someone explain I‚Äôm wrong, expert) vaccine targets spike protein, i.e. protein binds cells body. seems unlikely there‚Äôs mutation would cause big enough change shape spike protein vaccine also still capable binding cells body (which believe dependent shape). Lung damage (less stamina) increase clotting risk (strokes, PE, MI) two things I‚Äôm probably focused on. might even notice anything next day. needed this. Thank you! unvaccinated way. vaccinated living normally. care people do. Nobody way all. 100% this. worry immunocompromised can‚Äôt get vaccinated, far larger cohort under-12s don‚Äôt vaccine option even consider. that‚Äôs U.S.
 
The behavior vaccinated compared unvaccinated vaccines available way comparable, much less parable teaching moment empathy. 
 
Before vaccines, fight get selfish idiots world act like weren‚Äôt living humans Earth mattered, dealing petty whining inconvenience wearing masks missing tanking Old Country Buffet.

/u/TeachinAnon please take note. empathy, laughable general, misplaced, wasted, undeserved. really practical even possible, would nice world could distribute vaccines regions prioritized population density, impose travel restrictions going limit spread. Sure, disagree. However, already discriminate organ transplants drug addicts/alcoholics. finite resources limit actually benefit them.

Our medical resources overwhelmed time start rationing actually benefit them. right mind would go cruise right now? Wow know people want medical pharmaceutical intervention tired angry well. Science constantly evolves find facts correct answers. That‚Äôs answer. Nothing guaranteed pandemic may never know OP's son respiratory condition, scarring caused flareups.

Other little kids, anyone wants vaccine could get now, even poor (I'm speaking America, realize international community).

The fact we're right thing, we're still going get punished dumbasses unreasonable. Never mind fact entire point behind masking/shutdowns/etc stress public health system. live state currently ZERO strain system, yet CDC scientists tell 5 cases per 100k people considered ""high"" masking indoors everywhere. vaccinated kids? Masked 100% school fall - option.

It's bullshit. 

If family little one, wear masks. child 12 entire family would masked right anywhere indoors today - despite currently miniscule numbers. 
However, don't, feel necessary so. raise stink masking rules businesses want put place, unlike last year supported every single one mandates...this year different. Yeah masks delay COVID infecting people. long term solution like vaccine better I'm concerned longer spreads higher chance mutates, gets worse vaccines effective. Great, go get fucking shots then.

At supermarket, people probably infected.

Ms. Zacharski reached sliding doors patient‚Äôs room peered inside.

‚ÄúWe intubated her?‚Äù asked doctor. ‚ÄúWhen? morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúYesterday afternoon,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù Ms. Zacharski said, voice near-whisper.

Covid-19 patients never stopped arriving Medical I.C.U.-B., unit Ms. Zacharski tended since March 2020. onslaught admissions slowed. glorious period, unit shrunk three patients. end pandemic seemed within reach.
Now patients fill I.C.U.‚Äôs eight beds again. second unit, 50 additional beds, opened week.

The resurgence coronavirus burdened hospitals anew across country, rush patients fueled virus‚Äôs virulent Delta variant catching doctors guard. Florida reported highest daily average hospitalizations nation, 36 every 100,000 people past two weeks, according data compiled New York Times.

About 61 percent Miami-Dade County residents fully vaccinated, higher state average 49 percent. Miami-Dade holds one highest vaccination rates among nation‚Äôs large, socially vulnerable counties, characterized high poverty rates, crowded housing poor access transportation.

But even high vaccine coverage may hide large gaps immunity ‚Äî among younger working people, example, vaccinated lower rates ‚Äî trigger outbreaks, said Jennifer B. Nuzzo, epidemiologist Johns Hopkins University‚Äôs Bloomberg School Public Health.

Carlos Migoya, Jackson‚Äôs chief executive, said vaccination rate among hospital‚Äôs employees ‚Äî 60 percent Thursday ‚Äî low, problem plaguing many hospitals, started mandate shots. Jackson, 91 percent third-year resident physicians vaccinated 37 percent patient care technicians.

Jackson also admitted vaccinated people, almost transplant patients compromised immune systems. last week‚Äôs visit reporter photographer New York Times, none I.C.U.

Inside hospital‚Äôs main Covid ward, known South Wing 7, Victor Suero, 34, shared room another young man, privacy curtain drawn beds. loud pump sucked air window create negative pressurization.

Two days earlier, Mr. Suero, power lineman mermaid tattoo right arm, run 102.5-degree fever. recovering leg surgery called doctor, told get Jackson emergency room, tested positive.

Mr. Suero said gotten vaccinated several reasons: lived recently less densely populated part Pennsylvania. mother sister vaccinated. felt protected youth generally good health.

‚ÄúI thought, I‚Äôm healthy person, don‚Äôt need go get right away,‚Äù said bed, four boxes apple juice lunch tray. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm really it.‚Äù

His illness still felt like ‚Äúreally bad cold,‚Äù said, worried would interfere surgeries needs: ‚ÄúIt pain butt deal this.‚Äù

In retrospect, wish gotten vaccine?

‚ÄúHonestly, still feel same,‚Äù Mr. Suero said. ‚ÄúMaybe don‚Äôt complications leg surgeries coming ‚Äî would probably reason would get vaccinated. this, probably wouldn‚Äôt looking get vaccinated.‚Äù
However, added: ‚ÄúI hope nobody else gets Covid, ‚Äôcause sucks.‚Äù

In Covid I.C.U., patients could speak eight ‚Äî six age 50 ‚Äî intubated.

Monitors beeped. box lay floor, stuffed bags clear fluid clean kidneys start fail. Posters outlined tips turn patients prone stomachs help breathe.

A year ago, avoid contagion going patient rooms, cables stretched IV monitors hall, Ms. Zacharski recalled. Doctors nurses wore protective suits made look like astronauts. equipment remained inside, staff dressed scrubs N-95 masks.

Ms. Zacharski, 52, came Florida seven years ago Michigan. immigrated young woman Colombia, married man Poland, learned Polish raised two Michiganders, 28 29.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worst feeling ever,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWhen watch somebody looking like, ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt breathe, help me.‚Äô that‚Äôs worst image mind. never forget it.‚Äù

Then took breath looked next patient. funny thing actively stopping local governments imposing mask mandates, local government bodies requiring employees attendees vaccinated, he's actually killing *own support base*, support base antivaxxers antimaskers measure reduces transmission. According CDC 40-49 2x likely hospitalized 10x likely die 18-29. looks like might 7500 nowadays  strongly disagree this. new strain emerged targeted children serious way, country would grind halt. Could‚Äôve shown symptomatic. so, sorry. Sending healing thoughts. üíõ song actually first thought heard P-town cluster! Delta contagious original Alpha variant.

So before, worse... Florida case study school starting Aug 10 brother vaccinated. wife won‚Äôt get vaxxed. idea get along her. would work me! Like, ‚Äúwait, don‚Äôt care give covid?‚Äù Good luck! üòä  sucks. It‚Äôs bucket list, definitely pause time being. Sorry friend! knowledge, nothing indicating Delta severely worse children previous variants.

The difference wave elderly people vaccinated, infections concentrated amongst young (inc. children). Hence, metrics average age hospitalization down. difference (if vaccinated) much much lower chance long term harm health. 

Genuine question. say absolute certainty? soon, vaccines still relatively new? least May, CDC even tracking breakthrough data unless cases resulted hospitalization death. I'm field study all, seems would need time sure. 1) India much younger population
2) awful reporting. Case numbers deaths likely severely underreported. Yup, happened lot recently even though school started 5 days ago. Everyone scared time bat eye us expect school system government turn blind eye :/ DeSantis People care. vaccine needs mandatory sound really stupid. two reasons unvaccinated idiots getting sick affects me:

1. chances thing mutate something worse vaccine can't protect effectively against.

2. people taking ICU beds instead used people heart attacks, strokes, etc.

Also, vaccine makes get lot less sick helps prevent spread. never meant give 100% immunity.  I'd love learn point connection Branson, Missouri India. can‚Äôt compare refusal get shot keep getting severely sick complicated medical problem. They‚Äôre apples oranges. Lmao how‚Äôd work you

MSM pretty well-known way‚Ä¶ worry this
 Dear Lord, poor children bearing burdens. Anyone wanna help move literally anywhere else? Sincerely, Floridian FED FUCK Florida inhabitants. another person replied said, foregone conclusion happen means.

One problem lot backwards logic though. people getting vaccines actually makes super variant less likely exist yet large cohort saying vaccines make likely. give virus brain explain trying figure beat vaccine simply statistical game duplication, higher chance bad mutation. Pfff already quitting tune hospitals pumping bonuses working extra shifts time.  Kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated think also start denying coverage obese people need treatment type II diabetes, heart attacks, cancer?  Makes sense, cover people get sick due using preventative, surely would people get sick due actions.  sure brain spit 90 months, meant 1 year half 12 +6 months   I‚Äôm Sheboygan, live Philadelphia home thought last month WFH. Believe not, point stands, predominantly rural areas don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs chance capacity restrictions coming back (bars open inside since May last year), non-southern cities think it‚Äôs somewhere spectrum possible likely sounds horrible stupid. repeated stories young people bringing virus home - everybody including gets sick.but older people tend get sick Fuck up. part statement racist Noo no, works here... covid spread faster different environments own?

So friend (21F) came statement; people catch corona faster countries own. going contact people, purely it‚Äôs different environment. says people travelling (even they‚Äôre low key) right stupid covid spreads faster you‚Äôre another environment.

A neighbouring family (we live street) recently caught covid, she‚Äôs convinced caught vacation Spain (they traveled car stayed private airbnb, restaurants crowded places even beach son immunocompromised, low risk). asked why, said she‚Äôs reading Noah Harari book led conclusion. 

The family back almost 3 weeks now, recently (4 days) tested positive coronavirus, country they‚Äôve local pubs concerts think it‚Äôs likely caught average incubation period around 5 days. 

I asked links etc hasn‚Äôt showed said ‚Äúwell I‚Äôve read it‚Äù, told I‚Äôm sold theory. 

I know get sick quicker (like cold) environments body isn‚Äôt used like usual one, don‚Äôt think applies airborne highly infectious virus like COVID-19. Covid covid infectious side planet.

Can anyone provide info I‚Äôm really curious this. cares

Stop telling everyone do

If people got it

They catch get ill

Stop authoritarian fear mongering Sorry inclusive language would prefer use? /s  course. plan getting multiple tests reason.  going suggest maybe taking break wearing it, since strictly required there. I've fortune able work home such, often wear mask extended time. occasions did, tiresome hour two. would struggle wear 8 hour work shift. homeschooled k-12 missed key socialization. bad -- basically really steep social learning curve college I'm fine -- think got anything return.

I think couple years homeschooled would totally different story. Mutations always happening within infection, odds vaccinated person infected ""normal"" virus mutate vaccine-resistant body seems low, since odds infection normal virus low begin with. think *possible* vanishingly unlikely *that* many breakthrough cases gets try this, relative number unvaccinated cases. 

So since people infected vanilla virus unvaccinated, they'll ones incubating various mutations. mutations harmless transmission stopped usual vaccines, vaxx resistant mutation gets it'll quickly become dominant throughout population *everyone* carrier now.

That step specifically vaxx resistant mutation develops unvaccinated person unclear, think dumb luck, rolling dice spikes look different enough *and* host goes spreads it. think really becomes dominant ""patient zero"" unvaccinated person, there's little bit mutated virus lot vanilla virus. gets coughed air vaccinated people easily fight majority vanilla load, smaller mutated load manages take hold it'll spread like crazy. infected vaccinated person competition within person either, obviously it'll dominant within individual. seems like unlikely scenario... well think right, there's millions people rolling dice every day needs succeed once. 

Full disclosure, education done research here. seems like big game probabilities, deal pretty well. nerd's best guess+opinion based makes sense aware part fired person responsible publishing Covid data, refused publish incorrect numbers Governor's office wanted to. trust FL state data independently verified. stuff like counting deaths state residents live Florida half year, FL residents. tourism industry, ton people go there, catch it, arent counted diagnosed back home state. whole situation fucked.

Also, know deaths indicator lag behind cases hospitalizations. need wait 2 months people dying know good way handling things. gotten better treating COVID-19, lot cases super stressful incredibly annoying without captured deaths hospitalizations. number younger friends get Covid said worst illness they've ever experienced took full 2 weeks recover. people long Covid symptoms last months fully understand. Permanently reduced lung capacity lost sense smell, nevermind things like increased risk stroke whatever havent time study.

I agree pure case numbers great metric use something else too, deaths thing care about. folks charge need aware entire social, economic, health situation. add two weeks ago tonight. 00:01 Monday morning 19th, clubs able to, many did, open doors. hate stupid humans much. delta variant different kind beast.  regards headline, YES  Try full 14 day isolation get another test end. could exposed end trip. people natural immunity, know, everyone dies get Covid, right?

Just mainly elderly people comorbidities, 99.7% people survive, knew already. LOT comfortable me! fit much better. So, monitoring vaccine status testing positive?  Yeah, keeping folks dying minimum asked vaccine.  Keeping getting annoyingly sick, spreading around also desirable vaccine.  CDC tracking things? Thinking fault unvaccinated shit policy decision governments. 

bahaha

80% good going get. Yeah normal unsustainable goal, governments eventually forced enforce rules There‚Äôs evidence vaccinated aren‚Äôt also mutating spread it, since proven one get virus even vaccinated also spread it, still. get wet! removes inner electrostatic layer basically makes go 95% 60% even drying.

It seems weird honestly best way ""clean"" sit paper bag dry place 2-3 days, that's it. many people sub pushing anecdotal evidence presenting like data. Keep mind easily manipulated anti-vax are, need scare validate fears. Let die. Fuck it. Waste air resources. earth cleansing literally natural selection.  already gets denied. Welcome America bucko 90 months (7.5 years)? mean 9 months, right? 90 weeks (630 days ~1.7 years)? Almost til realized sarcasm know someone hospita 2 weeks getting shot damaging them. way getting thing. know someone else lost 3 extended fanily members taking vaccine too. Unfortunately that's true, all. happens time, prominently anyone deconverts religion. happens, right DEMAND government get involved healthcare, without hint irony shame  Why? science clearly shows benefits massively outweighs negatives. say? resistant strain shows up

so basically like new virus appearing vaccine  work night shift medical lab technologist (in fucking Florida lol) amount positive covid tests I‚Äôve amount convalescent plasma I‚Äôve give past month infuriating.

That's veganism taken extreme. literally said me, could talked position. need much convincing, matter fact, already support it, bring firing squad. mask, vax, problem, line there, shortly. alas, make decisions me, gets ballot, I'll vote favor it.

Cause doesn‚Äôt matter. there‚Äôs mask/social distancing rules vaccinated people it‚Äôs basically admission things never go back normal even get vaccine. took risk got mRNA vaccine (which never utilized Covid) since wanted things go back way I‚Äôve pretty much lied to. Nice article, Bezos. Perhaps could explain effective strategies engaging people? genuinely curious. you‚Äôre still running around unvaccinated unmasked, consider issue. painfully stretched medical staff start getting sick? say screw start quitting? Who‚Äôs going take care then? need skilled care?

In many parts country, covid rampant are, again, long waits testing. Hospital space getting full, we‚Äôre going see return beds halls, tents parking lots.

Same goes vaccine - if, say, people choice, whole country would double vaccinated long time ago. quite lot holdouts amongst Chinese friends, many recently chosen get vaccine due recent outbreaks.

I would concede comes outbreaks, absolutely right - level control, well sheer coordination oversight would possible West. that‚Äôs also Guangzhou/Foshan cluster quashed within couple weeks without spilling over, well earlier Shanghai cluster, Ruili outbreak, etc. as√≠ worth noting areas dealt outbreaks, rest country continued live normal life. humble conclusion experiencing bungled response UK moving China afterwards democracy/liberalism place pandemic. fact admitted it‚Äôs airborne, mask recommendation put place that. previously thought masks would help stop wearer spreading virus, blocking droplets. believed masks provide protection wearer, provide protection airborne viruses.

The history aerosol/droplet dichotomy doesn‚Äôt inspire lot confidence epidemiological community. 5 micron cutoff likely result misreading old research paper TB, evidence indicates many diseases airborne admit.

Jesus Christ. started seeing therapist anger misplaced  Oh apple, arbiter truth Seriously! I've saying along. STOP ALLOWING anti vaccine folks hospital ER come COVID. little safety net goes away, vaccination rates go up.

As far concerned, putting nurses doctors risk breakthrough infection, keeping virus going longer, taking space needed medical emergencies. Based new data I'd fine. vaxxed dropping dead. Exactly. sub cancer holy hell Cool.  breakthrough infection still likely going originate unvaccinated person that's statistics it. vaccinated breakthrough case contagious, yes says current data. Who's likely become infected next link chain, data says unvaccinated (as still protection current vaccine.) That's issue moment like said combinations factors right issue quickest way vaccinate many people US globally. going going years come. Stop shaming people wanting get vaccine it‚Äôs fucking dumb
If wanna take risk let them
You vaccine fine right ?
I‚Äôm vaccinated don‚Äôt give fuck doesn‚Äôt one

Fucking lame hope become it. seems way get empathy them. primary care doctor? time comes booster fall, talk doctor getting vaccine early. Many states let get vaccine earlier higher risk, defer doctor's determination. Haredis Israel rabbis tell them, rabbi's parties government time. 

Also, Haredis small part population, Jews Israel ultra orthodox.  It‚Äôs pretty clear people rooting another quarantine. Pretty sad. wish articles title exacting. FDA pressure prioritize process granting full apaproval quickly, pressure approve COVID-19 vaccines whole. makes seem like vaccines spec FDA pressured pass when, really, pressure drop things focus approving vaccines. Guaranteed anti-vaxxers read article passing along sort proof vaccines safe. Damn Lack surveillance flu. Response government-wide orders control coronavirus similar symptoms.  Funny posts get taken mods Florida news somehow keeps getting posted. I'll still wear mask business asks to. wear one I'm literally person around on? There's really point rarely see anyone masks on, even places ask unvaccinated people wear them. (I'm vaccinated). vaccinated become infected, small minority vaccination 80% effective virus. ""DOES MEAN 20% VACCINATED GET INFECTED?"" that's statistics work. 80% effective exposed, 92% effective severe forms virus, vaccinated far less likely spread (20x less likely, according Walensky).   can‚Äôt believe national news story Ok then. Shall abandon hope now? 

I'm asking antagonistic often wonder give ever getting enjoy everyday social activities again. clear, I'm essential worker, masking since advised got shot turn. 

I missed lot social activities past year half due cautious Covid. Stay home. leave house work and/or groceries., etc.

I get enjoy short time hope horizon even got enjoy bbq fully vaxxed friends back July. 

However, new variants, become clear masking pretty much returning stay-at-home lifestyle gonna thing again. Local Health dept re-issued mask mandate. advised. plans travel attend funeral Nephew passed away recently (not Covid related) seems need cancel said travel plans.

With said. continue advised local health dept. Wear mask leave house, go work, get groceries stay home.

If get opportunity get booster shot vaccine, becomes available. Otherwise, like before, I'll hope catch it. 

Apparently that's get foreseeable future. guy Reddits Well, secret can't even talk study it! trust me, someone knows someone tried someone else knows someone said worked guy stood near doctor once. censored course, can't even look details Bill Gates erase you. mean, absolutely right eventually someone pay vaccines. I'm expert government appropriated tax dollars pay vaccine.

To answer question insurance companies use excess profits, say company work either lowered premiums 2021 actually refunded premiums. 

As 2022 beyond, I'm sure premiums adjusted match much money paid claims. Pro choice party super ambiguous point. Historically referred democrats regarding abortion rights.

Good luck, since think know doctors scientists anyway. exception would make children cannot get vaccinated yet medically cannot get vaccine. experimented yo mama bedroom last night coof vaccine neither works FDA approved pandemic results even shorter life expectancy Americans due poor handling pandemic. Neither masking lockdowns completely done selfish. Science helped us defeat many diseases, require folks take vaccines. history, use vaccines saved many lives ever harmed taking vaccines. Ignoring advances modern world selfish use ones freedom harms everyone, making life even shorter thought. Fucking seriously. Blows damn mind. Let‚Äôs clear here. DeSantis idiot. He‚Äôs Ivy League educated feigns idiocy pander base + trumpets. exactly dangerous. vaccine cause lower viral load? I‚Äôm sure certainly seems appropriate study. took kids RSV checked covid antibodies RSV free age based cohort. Maybe correlation. thought may air quality poor wildfires. Early pandemic many cities California closed activities including boardwalks, beaches, parks etc. despite relatively low risk due outside. entire state park system (which mostly trails) shut well. 

And Disneyland California shut 15 months, three like Florida.

That said correct even California never real lockdown. stay home orders governor couple occasions restricted things like houseguests never enforced police. still normalcy vaccinated not! Still gotta mask up, still gotta social distance, still contract virus, spread virus. difference people got vaccine people didn‚Äôt lol People coming back vacation

Tourist cooties... We‚Äôre talking article U.S. news organization focused vaccination U.S. both? hospital worker can't vote comment much would like to. Hilarious. coward calling scared. 

Anyway, welcome year long paid vacation. One note pony crying police army enforce beliefs.

In fact, never allow go outside period. It‚Äòs dangerous  don‚Äôt think anybody cares feel bad for. Vaccinated folk becoming infected new Delta variant. already happening. done 2-3 week shutdown everything right away. think could nipped covid bud?

Yep. ends vaccinations. longer governments drag feet accepting this, worse be. researchers understand mechanisms, it‚Äôs counter-intuitive vaccination _can_ lead worse outcome.  Calls moron.

Can barely write intelligible sentence. Overuse fragrances dealt social stigma/mockery workplace policies politicized like getting vaccinated is.

If unvaccinated, danger public health strain healthcare system. 

If die unvaccinated, good riddance. Well since get sick like antivaxxer spread covid Disney vacation like anyone else, conclusion kind moron talking reason keeps going special kind human part pandemic all. choosing individual interests vacationing risk pandemic like antivaxxers do. offense, stating obvious conclusion comment above. Yeah third jab definitely informed studies point. They're experimenting going Pzifer's claim third shot effective.

I think studies safety third jab? (I'd love see some).  Surgical masks 60% effective protecting (which protection get vaccine WRT Delta variant). CDC publicize fact lied whether needed mask first 2 months pandemic. plague waves lasted hundreds years Europe. never actually went away long time, would kill many people lose people spread to. people dropped guards would come right back fuck next generation. Repeat process like 8 times antiobiotcs discovered. think officially there‚Äôs like three big plague waves though 

And that‚Äôs bacteria, never mind shit like smallpox polio that‚Äôs around forever. It‚Äôs bizarre article keeps repeating mantra kids need school. don‚Äôt know delta variant spreads schools. don‚Äôt know long-term effects delta kids. know child who‚Äôs suffering long-haul COVID (from one earlier variants.) used active dance classes etc, barely get bed without lips turning blue lack oxygen. kid would lot better skipping school getting disease.

Not much gamble decades vaccine experience considered. AZ currently looking like several months first strong interval. I'm sure clarify. never classroom went college, experiences Americans consider universal share.

I'm 30s standout memories anymore traumatic, homeschool children way. Maryland's vaccination uptake poor developed country standards average excellent usa.

I'm state similar/better numbers, neither states near enough uptake. 

Neither state significant summer surge last year either. expect Maryland, Northeast escape winter / fall wave. Hospitalizations better mitigated, especially deaths elderly uptake.  Yeah they'll fix paying taxes. They‚Äôre vaccinated, cares. Lol, like clockwork. There‚Äôs evidence showing waiting longer shots actually increases length effectiveness.

good luck fellow men women may hearts health strong Also testing more. Test kits ordered online packs seven (idea test every day). Plus lots shops, pubs, etc handing well.

I'm masking-up shopping trips instead testing social gatherings (where I'm longer wearing mask unless venue demands it).

...I work home use public transport issues either. Israel Pfizer say different. Israelis giving boosters 60s. Note Israel early efficient vaccination campaign ppl wre vaccinated Dec/Jan/Feb.

In fact citizen country ever accept government put foreign countries them. National interest prevail first obviously. Kinda running sympathy point. Polio vaccine didn‚Äôt stop infection. reduced limited symptoms mild forms. asymptomatic cases discovered contact tracing. Really depends Canada handled it.

I‚Äôm still trying spend less time general. I‚Äôm weeks away going back work first time since March 2020 (entertainment industry) livid prospect getting delayed. lot easier Northeast positivity rate like 1-3%. Wonder could be?! 

Honestly, feel like we're get walloped - hopefully bad places like Florida Missouri, really talking. everyone's problem, unfortunately. way things going going massive losses 22 anyways. current strategy throwing hands even worse. worry. safe. Everyone smart enough get vaccinated safe. people trying protect new mandate stupid help themselves. say let be. worded well. agree you. need informed risk order make decision feel comfortable parents. 

It‚Äôs one thing play ones fate, make decisions another person carries much weight. feel it‚Äôs responsibility err side caution Parental consent required vaccination 41 states. easy may believe. Says faux news. incredibly ignorant sociopathic fucking cave dwellers? Oh, stats that? Dallas 15 beds children's hospital? Man! go mental contortions feel sort moral ecstasy. said unlimited games get vaccinated. curious, U. S. crazy surges covid delta? stagnated countries U. S. still rising? parents disown getting vaccine really love too! people aren‚Äôt getting COVID vax arent anti-vax. don‚Äôt know redditors keep using word. I‚Äôm pro-vax, anti-COVID vax it‚Äôs fda approved. Sorry gets panties twisted. Yeah right dead wrong.  look nobody talked massive increase drug abuse overdoses since onset pandemic proof. understand airports still. things work around. #FUCK unvaccinated Plus average person US mobile international scale average individual Africa. Vaccines don‚Äôt work way today before.

We‚Äôre 2021, haven‚Äôt noticed.

Also, quit reading faux news. ""Hold proper people accountable""

Yeah, ourselves.  Media organizations aren‚Äôt covered HIPAA, medical professionals are. Exactly. can‚Äôt go right drink drive. Why? freedom choice doesn‚Äôt matter choices actively put people danger Thank you! happy feel invincible receive medical bills live. tears joy. Unfit serve. Gonna honest. you‚Äôre willfully unvaccinated, don‚Äôt give single fuck you, I‚Äôm willing make sacrifices you. like don‚Äôt feel bad adults slam hands hot stoves they‚Äôre told it‚Äôs hot. 

I‚Äôll wear mask public spaces it‚Äôs mandated (not recommended. mandated.) that‚Äôs I‚Äôm going vaccinated person. Sorry don‚Äôt like answer. thought referring people unable get due health concerns, people approved *yet*. That's pretty distinct difference, clarified. Except he‚Äôs not, he‚Äôs leading Verstappen 8 points. lot afraid realize it, that'd nicest thing say understand. unvaccinated want wear masks. vaccinated want wear masks. What's problem? hilarious reversal. one early ones get vaccinated going mask mandate, think new one ridiculous.  know that's bullshit.

Had gotten vaccinated even unified 70% nationwide numbers would completely different made hypothesis evolving situation never said knew fact.

Just like don‚Äôt know whether came lab Wuhan likely never know. posted over.  Yeah, lazy and/or stupid get vaccinated fuck rest us.  Nope. Locals coming back Vegas. Everyone know sending kids virtual school let kids play outside kids spring summer cases low. ""getting way""

What way unvaccinated people getting? make sense? Science  Lmao thank you! high level fishing humor obviously went head üòâ Anecdotal evidence pretty worthless.

But we've also got stop idea kowtowing anti-vaxx weirdos.

They've got position purely emotion-driven reactionaryism.

We need stop letting low-brow freaks hold us hostage muppetry. it‚Äôs done health care professionals. media covered HIPAA. Ouch survival fittest Nah, upset government situation. Yup. finally bought N95s anticipation fire season fact they're sale now. Even vaccinated, I'm interest catch ""cold-like symptoms"" middle summer. outside venues N95 on. Delta's R0 way damn high. 29.8 percent adult mental health disorders linked childhood adversities trauma ‚Äúlifelong medical problems‚Äù. Months upon months limited socialization peers could absolutely trauma-causing event young child. Everyone like ‚Äúlong Covid, long Covid, long Covid‚Äù conveniently ignoring mental illness by-far prevalent chronic medical disability America contact tracing. Literally almost nothing attributed games. Scott Gottlieb essentially said thing, wrong call start pushing masking going put people actually driving spread deaths/hospitalizations 

The vaccination campaign completely changed dynamics looking likely final wave pushing opioids everyone causing opioid crisis we‚Äôre still dealing states. what‚Äôs point again? anyone filed wrongful death lawsuit anyone spreading misinformation vaccine? feel like slam dunk point. people spreading misinformation costing country untold thousands lives people allowed profit lies. Moving costs much less funeral. saying. Strap wild ride I'm sitting hospital Tampa write this. fear completely founded. We've many patients roll department past 2 weeks unbelievable. seen like since *the height* Nov-Feb wave. getting started, think. /r/boneappletea natural immunity work.as.good vaccine. Know say mild covid case need vaccine natural immunity better. Plus say even get since first time like second time also. really immune many people vaccinated testing positive? can't get straight answer. 

It seems though vaccinated people able pass virus been. I‚Äôm ready mothertruckers meet God.  I'm sorry difficult place. Hope manage sort something safe affordable out. time thought could get AIDS coughing, swimming pools, mosquitoes toilet seats, AIDS believed actually infectious covid.  like start 2020 Oh no. Someone supports party don‚Äôt support. Impossible. 2-party system already failing America anyways yh kid vaccine? Count lucky unlike others kid low chance *mortality*. many parents without reassurance Fall really like dystopian vaccinated/unvaccinated future going. That's friendly response, something would written, personally. cannot hold world high standard, hold it.  Good luck.

Baited breath means chewing worms. think mean ""bated breath"", means subdued. international context, UK 7 day average 26,000 cases come peak 55,000 cases per day, yet 5,600 hospitalisations.

Vaccines. answer vaccines. spike deaths 2-3 weeks now? like call ‚Äúarrognorance.‚Äù arrognorant people special class shithead deserves word. please stop calling people legitimate questions fears ""anti-vaxxers""? you‚Äôre comparing missing socializing months get vaccinated severe case Covid even death, think it‚Äôs brainer. kids glued screens social media form anyway. Whahahahaha CNN That‚Äôs little dramatic. family basically self quarantined year prevent us catching covid, school aged kids remote school, worked home, etc. 3 us could get vaccine got vaccine, little kids still risk, 4 kids younger 12. actually think 8 year old happier remote school end year went back in-person couple months. idea kids huge amounts maskless, indoor, group socialization face developmental issues absurd. plan keep sheltering much possible covid hopefully get without infection.  Yeah told someone woman got response: ""Oh, *sure* are"". Asswipe kept insisting man. I've never maliciously misgendered before, like it. Shoutout trans brothers sisters, dude really sucked. noticed days mine, majority coworkers. felt like shit. brother essential worker London, job taking multiple sites around capital every day. He's fully vaccinated, wears mask public spaces (his job often working empty/closed buildings, exposure someone working supermarket), day since began.

I'd say vaccine hesitancy higher London rural UK areas, better lot US southern states. Still, many people report mask wearing generally high London transport (tube, bus, train). really worried, walk around central London - sites - pretty easily. Travel peak times (10AM 3PM) public transport, make good use parks, take good care health (look vitamins fighting virus), take precautions would home. Also decent medical insurance hurt. 

In short, probably much risk now. Enjoy holiday. Lol post sub great ""Travellers US""

People refused basic things like social distance wear masks, now, point getting vaccine becoming option left really fight thing; people saying clearly masks social distancing didn‚Äôt work, would vaccine?

And yes, fucking angry. Absolutely! able leave house 4 times 2 half+ years self-centered scum. could Grandma died. want vaccinated stay safe Delta variant job rest ruthlessly never think covid except eventual memorial holiday. Yeah actually do, reported hospital. many covid patients hospitalized. Vaccinated people: going Disney land, nightclubs, pool parties music festivals 

Also Vaccinated people: fuck unvaccinated guys making shit worse!

Lets call spade spade people. guys ditched masks started whatever hell wanted assuming worst done life returning normalcy. Quit blamimg unvaccinated people everything take responsibility. Yes, contribute problem, no, fault Facing facts fearmongering two different things. Saying ""the virus may mutate evade vaccines"" different ""omg we're gonna die"". sad state affairs virus stay due fact world interconnected way makes lot easier spread, one knows going happen trying stay step head might give us chance avoid another fiasco. need continue monitor sequence virus order get data need fight future. quick question vaccine. tried google get answer. got second vaccine yesterday feel fine site jab itself, there's lump inch wide feels warm touch sore. normal? got first jab sore hot lump.

Thanks arguing don‚Äôt accept Christian dogma era cannot reasoned with. **sigh**  That‚Äôs true all. don‚Äôt think lockdown solve problem, I‚Äôm addressing angle. start learning things like virus, lots unknowns. progress data becomes available, less unknowns. You‚Äôre speaking something data for, experts article cited said isn‚Äôt conclusive, you‚Äôre trying present conclusive. That‚Äôs improper argument. said, expect results carry long-haul breakthrough cases exceedingly rare, however think it‚Äôs dangerous pretend data currently enough proclaim that. Delta new spread rapid. There‚Äôs way knowing moment long-haul effects have, who. true, I'm - probably something collectively work changing. This, much. dutifully followed rules, masked everywhere, got vaccine. CDC okayed getting rid masks vaccinated, like huge weight shoulders, many people felt same.

When backtracked, like.... done. like something flipped head; feeling dread idea stepping backwards filled me. I'm mentally done. I'll wear mask crowded indoor spaces, businesses say required.

The mental health effects pandemic likely bad physical effects end. feel like I've handled less well, many people know far worse place mentally. We're done all. quote stood me. 

Being ""conservative"" thing matters lot people.  means vaccinated, argument get so. Pretty sure you‚Äôre alone saltiness! Thank dixie, Lil Ariandrin. I'm part immunocompromised group thank wearing masks about. 

I've Pfizer doses. felt safe enough 2 weeks second dose back April stop wearing mask could. still felt OK getting shopping mask mandates lifted state stores stopped post mask required signs. still felt OK everyone, vaccinated, stopped wearing masks.  (Every piece news, reports research observations esp. Israel, etc. mention group specifically left out. trials even included us.

Then people started dropping left right India. Hospitals ran oxygen. -- new strain COVID ended calling ""delta"". said hoped strain get started here. Everything pointed RNA vaccines working it.  every immunocompromised person included news research. Research Africa became worrisome, CDC recommendations changed, latest Israel showed ineffective Pfizer vaccine immunocompromised person.

So, I've wearing masks again. bought new box got supply N95s, decided start ordering Amazon going groceries little can. -- curbside pickup much possible.

I feel isolated anxious last year. spring definitely cabin fever could hardly wait get 2nd dose. Now?? I'm feeling new self imposed ""lockdown"". depressing already last year.

Between new variant seems almost new virus, recent news may good immunity, lack approval 3rd dose, Trumpists anti-vaxers Karens Richards people afraid needles, plain stupid dumb people, really know I'm going maintain mental health fall winter.

So thank caring part keep people like safe get among ""the living"". keep seeing people say politicians done anything stop kids killed guns. teacher go safety trainings triage first aid, doubt consequences kids dying illness. Please someone change mind, that's truly believe.  Afraid vaccine likely, I've living hermit essentially spending 99% time room. I'm happy take vaccine get it, get complications. Like heart inflammation Israel noticed young adult males, already can't function normally chronic fatigue issues. 

Took first shot idk second shot yet shit fucking sucks. either roll dice vaccine covid stay hermit. 

Realistically go vaccine still means embracing may fuck up. shit situation matter pick lose. lose.  really think lead shutdown i.e shutdown schools, business, travel, gatherings, heavy social distancing required implemented again? freaking way happening. vaccines past that. unvaxxed screwed many vaxx test positive must push forward comfortable mitigation living this. AMEN. coming wave sickness death unvaccinated. Yes. I‚Äôm worn down. dad cancer, SIL cancer, grandpa‚Äôs heart give out, I‚Äôm isolated family friends, earth destroyed, ear infection (minor gripe, COME ON!)‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs piling lately. 

And I‚Äôm tired time. motivation much anything. started feeling like I‚Äôm good enough job handling this, it‚Äôs much. exclusively demise:( We're fucking boat they're punching holes long exposure would take counter test like BinaxNOW show positive result? friends go Florida week ago. Came back fine. That's really interesting.

It's counterintuitive, like putting extra armor WWII bombers places bullet holes.

Though Delta variant apparently came India, really struggling hear. wish unfounded, TBH.
But appreciate honesty. vaxxed age underlying health issues, plan hunkering like last year. 
Stay safe neighbor! Lol stop tryna right. throw terms clearly dont kniw anything rhetorical question that‚Äôs great response. No, good; stating it, he'll inspire opposite says (largely group people refuse mask vaccinate) lock defiance him.

I'm onto Dr. Fauci. see doing.  Even believe it, don‚Äôt think joke deserved four ‚Äúha‚Äôs.‚Äù mean ‚Äúlol‚Äù could understand, laughing hard ‚ÄúBiden can‚Äôt complete coherent sentence‚Äù you‚Äôre going brain aneurism ever hear something actually funny. headline comes across like vaccinated ppl letting anger get way happiness, fault lies refuse vaccinated. knew vaccines worked, you‚Äôd know COVID-19 vaccines work.

Vaccines don‚Äôt never prevented infection.

Immunization resistant virus developing mild symptoms dying. 

It never catching virus.

You‚Äôd know actually basic tools understand scientific publications weren‚Äôt research internet reading RT Faux News publications.   studies recently come showing vaccinated unvaccinated people roughly viral load noses

does mean  spread same

&amp;#x200B;

[White house \-- [study  glorious thread agree need await details information that's coming last weeks. 

Most stuff Twitter thread seems pretty hand wavy conjectural, itself, seem like adding anything new (I know credentials poster). saying wrong, definitely need wait see.

As aside, notice seems strong instinctual need many people's part play cover discouraging words current vaccines. saying that's what's happening here, course, see lot sub. I'm guessing comes fear giving ammunition anti-vaxxers something. *really* provides fuel anti-vaxxers, however, lack trust government media, suspicion covering things up! need make sure information, good bad, comes transmitted quickly honestly population. That's way going win pandemic. much contempt humans must rough! Enjoy cases, breakthrough cases?

Not everyone vaccinated testing positive. dead disagree... well would could.   You‚Äôve got backwards‚Ä¶of course virus mutates. It‚Äôs fact life every time DNA replicates, *x* number mutations per *y* number base pairs. means virus is, mutations are. Unvaccinated people get infected proven carry higher viral load vaccinated people get infected, thus mutations. Unvaccinated people cause *far* mutations vaccinated people. ü•± apocalyptic heat flooding

Good luck- aren‚Äôt south more.  Move Europe isn‚Äôt fault fault. It‚Äôs shitty situation. Camp serves de facto babysitter lot parents (like school) get difficult parents option. may least intelligent person I've encountered Reddit year. Congratulations. That‚Äôs happens don‚Äôt follow science always peace West Taiwan data J&amp;J? Prancing around like bunch idiots mask laughing giggling going eat amusement parks shit , sit happy ass , far r/coronavirusuk 

I spent month UK middle surge. double-masked flights (and didn‚Äôt take off) generally careful (masking indoors avoiding crowds). decided skip Silverstone, still grocery shopped went sight-seeing car attending Goodwood (with mask). came away fine. took one chance happiness, crushed it, crushed little, tiny, bitesized pieces! Still better idea fucking moron get vaccinated instead get tested every week missing work got sick. Yes plenty people hospital fully vaccinated. much lower mortality rate still end hospital.  lolololololol Scientists elected know? 

Science left popular üòÇ

Also, liars faux news. argued someone anti covid vaccine data world nothing power belief. simply believe it. believe liberals. believe scientists. conspiracy theory massive scale. I'm sorry read frustration, 100% understand coming from. I've also seen different side humanity past 16 months. 

There's always selfish people, guess, see people utterly unchanged freaking global pandemic disappointing tiring. saliva swabs bud. Cali full open Labor Day. wait. equally immoral. Tinder already exists. go back normal drop like flys, it.     think claiming something isn‚Äôt true doesn‚Äôt go way makes untrue? üòÇ

And no, you‚Äôre wrong too. 

First, non vaccinated spread virus far quicker vaccinated, making likely cause new variants spawn.

Which non vaccination threat whole vaccination campaign. 

Second, vaccine less effective delta variant, it‚Äôs still effective. You‚Äôre still much protected non vaccinated.  honestly know, seems like people think anything involve complete social isolation means care COVID mitigation. Meanwhile, countries (that high rising vaccination rates) care actually focusing making life easier vaccinated people still focusing COVID mitigation. US bizarre all-or-nothing attitude towards COVID mitigation seems prefer fear/panicking foolhardiness/emotional thinking kind action plan. like 3 every 1000 people I‚Äôm fucking sick people complaining mask policies reenacted work. lack empathy around even shocking anymore. went coworker complaining everyone would listen. everyone wore mask first time around i‚Äôd probably still father. man tried stay away public even though made terribly depressed could remain safe. can‚Äôt see dominos knock act like life normal. i‚Äôll always consider people murderers. Oof, wrong. longer people remain unvaccinated, variants gonna pop up. vaccine resistant strain Covid emerges, I‚Äôm 100% blaming unvaccinated people. Meanwhile DeSantis threatening people wanting mask mandates. Ok.  Nah don‚Äôt time care people don‚Äôt care society general. Testing free. Vaccines free someone sends bill, report cops.  fair, work salesperson although I‚Äôm fully vaxxed still wear mask around customers also masked make comfortable, also protection around peeps give anti-vax vibes. end wearing chin lot shift quickly pull up. Might look silly I‚Äôm trying respect different people‚Äôs safety concerns, maybe that‚Äôs cashier also to? hate purist weirdness. They're idiots.

Am vegan, idgaf. animal-use free alternative medicines vaccines take hardly care. Suffering suffering, millions humans dead debilitated good trade conceivable number primitive arthropods. lot people option. choices job get kids killed, homeschool lose home kids killed anyways get sent school home homeschool in. miss 100% shots take ‚Äì Wayne Gretzky ‚Äì Michael Scott‚Äù  would effort irrelevant occupation it? Fair, gotta maximize profits. never supposed stop spread. scientific experts always confusing people since start pandemic, thats ending Check graph showing latest case trends that's SpaceX launch. That's increase 7-day running average cases. Florida really going all-out here. ""most people""

[citation needed] many hospitalizations deaths? it‚Äôs still low fucking risk get vaccinated continue die ‚Äúvaccine bad‚Äù hill. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll work great mandate it. work grocery store us customers feel uncomfortable interacting unmasked person. Pull feel better, pull it‚Äôs easier work. doesnt matter get peer-reviewed scientific analysis BizNews! /s stories mean nothing more. Yeah sad. amtivaxxers dealing covid globally means covid around several years Already natural immunity far superior. But, thanks putting bed idea vaccinated people compassionate caring members society. ;) willful non-compliance. say slipped off. think that's pretty positive effect writer, appreciate response. like Sadly it‚Äôs late that. need learn live it. It‚Äôs it‚Äôs going I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶.so tired Nope , nothing all. even think sick home days

You mean isolate 10 days they‚Äôre longer considered contagious, right? vaccinated people test positive need isolating don‚Äôt increase spread. bad people catch follow-up articles correct kinds mistakes. Modern day social media press really screws public health. Exactly! type masks kids likely wear? Like cloth children's sized KF94s KN95s? Yup. jobs actually paid decently, lefties like could afford moving away people want us badly... You‚Äôre selfish don‚Äôt get vaccinated. It‚Äôs matter vaccine X me. Everyone taken it, world leaders, community representatives, you, me. boat, don‚Äôt selfish make COVID like flu, everlasting, take jab.


Thank coming ted talk Yes, companies can. EEOC/NLRB said this. Yep. applies abortion right? üôÑ unhelpful definition, vaccinated person get covid, get long-covid life-altering long-term symptoms, without ever hospitalized problem people getting vaccinated, problem vaccine working. much fear-porn news watch everyday? close family members literally lost respect free-riding this. selfish. Yeah, fucking angry, litterally could've stopped got politicized, truly shown inconsiderate people are, esp unvaxxed lie wear mask.



Im going large concert 3 nights im vaxxed everything stay safe, im gonna stop life work partner anti masker/anti vaxxer. truly give fuck dude got sick me. honestly wish antivaxx/mask people would catch it. Fuck em all. Nothing change minds even then. boss‚Äôs family got it, father ended hospital death‚Äôs door, deny even COVID definitely gonna get vaccinated they‚Äôre ‚Äúimmune‚Äù. Delta, too.

Fauci cdc. Continue angry.

The world vaccinated. shit continue happen long US continues try profit vaccine could link /r/batshitinsane something equally reputable. breaking glaucoma info, anyone interested?   Everything well stocked grocery stores town. thought ‚Äúasymptomatic‚Äù mainly means don‚Äôt severe symptoms, like loss taste/smell, lung damage. I‚Äôm ok starting world war means people get normal lives worldwide. realize you‚Äôre control group, right? You‚Äôre still part experiment small subset individuals can‚Äôt safely get vaccine. 

A fairly significant portion humans can‚Äôt legally given vaccine.

None obstacles listed fixed. enough resources ""fix"" 1000 Floridas. top page right ""TRENDING"" ""COVID variants"" scrolling there's article vaccinations little there's ""Life pandemic"" heading.

That's showing anyway. whynotboth.gif? known doctors long time already aware it. sure laypeople making big deal now. Lollapalooza outdoors. Isn‚Äôt virus supposed rise air get sunburned? missing point. peers also anti vax. Well know 34% folks unvaccinated said they‚Äôll get vaccine fully FDA approved, 10% increase today. 

Many people wait see headline ‚ÄúFDA fully approves Covid vaccine‚Äù. Simple that. ""watching convincing videos"" mean ""reading experts discuss possibility"" yes

QUESTION: recent positive Covid test results, many vaccinated individuals?

If become ""pandemic unvaccinated"" needs backed facts. part also parents pro Trump anti mask anti covid Vax can't get anyway. can't go others suggested (allergy tests, DNA tests, etc) I'm 18 anyway medical authority myself. I'm free lol I'll reaching Dcf files getting DNA work done know history vaccines things well Indeed. that, scientists medical experts still debating study, think still bit soon say anything waning immunity. UK data seems different well small % vaccinated people get infected. virus less likely infected vaccinated person even delta. likelihood vaccinate person spreading another vaccinated person gets exponentially smaller smaller every link chain. 
We need better vaccines, (although variant booster would likely helpful) need larger % population taken it. vaccines dont stop spread people wrong. hear there's vaccines that. I'm part, work unvaccinated.  Lmfao thinking work people get charge. Waiting, no, I‚Äôm crying-mfao. unvaccinated dumbasses choke ICU. I'll wear mask mandated Facebook January 6th warriors brought themselves. sound like moron sounds like fairly thoughtful person. 

There better vaccines waiting completely fair. mention contract virus better immune response anyone simply got vaccine. ignorance ended friendship you‚Äôre saying even true. vaccinated person still get virus, transmit people, develop symptoms, getting ""selfish""?

You might cut elastic little shorter hot glue back place, head smaller.

I feel like I'm grown version son, bad lungs, constant infections, scarring, etc. earlier gets used needs done protect future infections, better.

Best luck year! Nah, get company makes ventilators. Yeah vaccine requirements much path forward. reason vaccinated people able enjoy meals put, theaters, safe workplaces, etc. time get lives, come may.

I can‚Äôt argue desire that. would love nothing things back way generally were. think correct earlier prediction going endemic problem. Getting lives won‚Äôt cut dry. Agricultural regions tend higher concentration anti-vax beliefs. knock-on effect food supply. I‚Äôm ok gardening. don‚Äôt first clue farm it‚Äôs skill taught short order. applied number industries see major drop work force. 

Since we‚Äôre talking logistics, we‚Äôre going address bodies piling rather short period time. we‚Äôre talking numbers order magnitude would make scene NYC look like bright sunny day. going shove mass graves go mass cremations? Typical funerals probably won‚Äôt option except wealthy refrigerated space going premium. 

That world doesn‚Äôt sound like getting lives. sounds like recovering disaster. think mutation dynamics change. 

Mutation dynamics sense mutations per replication cycle may unaffected. However, advancing rate human infections per unit time increase number replication cycles per unit time, subsequently number mutations per unit time. virus type would burn out, wouldn‚Äôt much problem, isn‚Äôt virus. anything, mild-to-moderate mitigation measures would probably provide evolutionary pressure stronger variants arise, compared unencumbered spread.

That certainly possibility. hand, vaccinated recovered individuals provide evolutionary pressure. seeing delta variant, virus definitely ability overcome pressure. wasn‚Äôt highly vaccinated, highly mitigated environment variant emerged. came region low vaccination low mitigation virus burning population accelerated rate.  

Simultaneously, mitigation, applied correctly, also provides opportunity bottlenecks. New Zealand excellent example this. recognize immense advantages NZ implementing this, demonstrate thorough mitigation do, there. 

But hey, die end, right? Go Amazon right least buy real N95 masks. Don‚Äôt send cloth surgical. It‚Äôs best tool moment. might surprised find Israel finding significant long Covid ~20% breakthroughs. However there‚Äôs nothing really published asymptomatic risk factors they‚Äôre finding. Happy read anything you‚Äôve found.

Thirty-one percent infected workers reported persistent symptoms 14 days diagnosis, 19% reported ""long COVID"" symptoms loss smell, cough, fatigue, weakness, shortness breath, muscle pain 6 weeks. None hospitalized. 23% workers took leave absence work mandatory 10-day quarantine, four returned work within 2 weeks, one still returned 6 could get fuck Texas. blame anyone choose plan. online charter schools? Maybe even semester? course im sure someone day. two years high school worked fine. Anyways sry sucks Ok isn‚Äôt anger bit misplaced since many Delta studies inferring vaccines aren‚Äôt effective blocking transmission, extremely effective reducing severity symptoms? unvaxed friend recently instincts said keep away kid get mad choice, seems like science doesn‚Äôt support like last strain. Im mad unvaccinated. Im annoyed people think okay healthy COVID doesn‚Äôt hit hard. go work anyways, military won‚Äôt let stay home, even financial systems today continue push people broke corners. Well situation really shouldn't. kill people, refuse Vax can't. that's ok.  know something simultaneously scary deadly, wearing piece cloth face makes immune. 



Fauci another guy. real say. 


I wear seatbelt, sell car. 


I got vaccine. I'm done restrictions. Ministry Truth decide whats real fake 

Man thanks god thinking us children,

Exactly, perfect description stayed week. probably got time. Southern California. vaccinated mom sniffles. unvaccinated aunt 102 degree fever barely move. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs great case vaccines. wrong fact circulated people get vaccinated. 'Carrot' Makes worry hear going work kids returning school saying supposed tested weekly. KN95s plus another mask I've rolling ever since getting fully vaxxed 3 months ago. I‚Äôve read third dose Pfizer showing bit safety net delta. also know nothing official ‚Äúbooster‚Äù doses yet. 

Would possible even advised try get another dose point? dumbest mother fornicating thing keeps getting circlejerked over. data shows breakthrough infections significantly higher rate expected. vaccines still somewhere around 80% effective stopping symptomatic infection.

Everyone sees shitton breakthroughs somehow believes numbers wrong. aren't, deck ton virus lot vaccinated people. Hence lot breakthrough cases we've seen past.  Judging downvotes, Americans prefer lockdowns vaccine passport systems like Israel, Germany, France have. That's pretty damn depressing.  sucks saying vaccinated spreading virus. people need get together stop trying divide us. vaccine still lets virus in‚Ä¶ get get sick‚Ä¶. transmit others‚Ä¶ yeah far over. Eventually virus mutate vaccine resistant. far over. F Older sibling?

Hopefully washed hands, even low risk. isn't, germany need vaccinated negative test activities like going restaurants, events crowded places. Ok, say it‚Äôs time ballsy leadership mr Fauci Ha, ha. everything Fauci says find opposite opinion Fauci. Surely whole point follow PCR positive results? jealous last year I‚Äôm glad US vaccinated everything open. Chasing zero COVID like chasing zero car crashes, it‚Äôs possible Monday, 300 unarmed soldiers begin patrols Sydney ‚Äî city 6 million people. knocking doors ensure residents following strict stay-at-home measures, Australian broadcaster ABC reported.  No, they‚Äôre not. They‚Äôre saying vaccinated person gets sick Delta variant, may similar level virus non-vaccinated (or least high enough get others sick).

The likelihood vaccinated person getting sick still less unvaccinated person, even pessimistic efficacy numbers.  work‚Ä¶ *also* might encountered unmasked person happened infectious. way really know exposed not. 

If unvaccinated person took trip outcome, probably wouldn‚Äôt agree said proved safe/had amazing immune system, etc. 

The fact haven‚Äôt contracted covid awesome exposed, vaccine would surely helped. doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean won‚Äôt get breakthrough case go unknowingly-infected person‚Äôs birthday party next week something. (It course mean odds good get symptoms they‚Äôll likely mild). Hey agree you. question is, realistic? not, need cut bait make best plans make given circumstances. get best outcome despite unvaxxed people? He's right everything throughout entire pandemic. he's right here. There's reason behind this. military gave anthrax vaccine approved FDA made bunch people sick long term. VA paying disability anthrax vaccine decades come. way Jamaica. Israel date blasted sub proof need lockdowns etc.

That Israel gone back indoor masking acting everything needs shut clue, people prefer panic. Let know goes. sister lives able see long, I'm curious situation like terms traveling there. used troops think. That's consistent study: shows viral load similar first 5 days symptom onset, declines MUCH rapidly afterwards.

Certainly good news vaccines, crazy delta. shows people contagious month. comparison, latest CT score &lt;= 15 vaccinated people &lt;5 days symptom onset. argument preparation useless fans. useful ones. True. adult also understand nasal swab fun, ventilator tube jammed throat even less fun. No, thinking making booster shots shots offer additional protection variants. He‚Äôs right. never said anything vaccinated people dying. Deaths unvaccinated people count too. activities like going restaurant event requires get tested vaccinated. That‚Äôs authoritarian style military enforced lockdown vaccines arent covid-related medical bills covered? data I've seen seems slightly effective, expert. Comparably healthy friends also worse side effects Moderna Pfizer. believe appetite restrictions. Biden may talk consider within power. This

I understand many people lost work due COVID-19, also think many others took advantage government assistance, diverting rent payment things like cars/entertainment choices.
They probably felt like would forever, assistance would end plans squirrel money away.
I really feel them, feel people struggle due income loss disability death family members due covid ailments. hope people real need find additional resources. obviously case everything fine vaccinated. 

That's never case, one ever claimed vaccinations would prevent every single infection. People got excited seeing cases drop prior Delta vaccinations stalled, allowed Delta sneak take hold cases shot right back up. supposed number herd immunity 70%, reach that? No, CDC lost sense urgency that's somehow fault people actually went got vaccinated. 

Did vaccinations help prevent spread earlier strains? Yes! need vaccinations help prevent transmissible Delta strain? Also, yes! CDC lead fact instead releasing information makes appear vaccinations practically useless? government concerned presenting information‚Äîthe good bad‚Äîin measured fashion came out, rather choosing whatever angle seemed likely appeal vaccine hesitant, wild swings opinion.

The media responsible wild swings government, more. Look often Dr. Fauci's statements gotten misconstrued altered someone needed good headline.

Additionally, presenting information measured fashion takes time giving information quickly leads situations like we're experiencing currently.  side note, watching 28 days later, opinion scariest zombie movie. brave dad got infected drop blood crow dropped eye looked it. sad.

In early break Wuhan virus unknown yet many health professionals got infected eyes.   China now. 

What's next? Arresting people saying masks, vaccines lockdowns? Smell? smell?

/s company located one liberal cities mean culture liberal. 

Also, forget there's Covid liability shield companies. get Covid result bad policy, means sue oblivion. Extroverts ones shut up. happens every year Lolla... actually remake exact premise scarier monsters. would thought studio would learned lesson s***** first one was, no. Yeah don‚Äôt worry that. awesome wedding Getting married August 21st freaking right would extremely helpful CDC moved towards greater transparency, explaining decisions, sharing data openly freely. case by-and-large.  Pointing out, example, vaccinated people died study tells us NOTHING efficacy unvaccinated people died either. 

The study isn‚Äôt trying speak efficacy, it‚Äôs looking spread amongst highly vaccinated population. shows vaccinated people shed enough infect vaccinated people degree happen particular extreme social behavioral conditions. 

But doesn‚Äôt also show 30k+ attendee event likely high vaccination percentage bit 700 cases? don‚Äôt remember exact figures. Where? Haven‚Äôt seen deaths rising vaccinated people wouldn‚Äôt call original approach failure, vaccine securing rollout is. I‚Äôd call partial failure Ah yeah. US shitshow regarding cases lol ate absolutely packed restaurant absolutely packed street D√ºsseldorf. weeks ago I've Frankfurt show vaccination paper airport McDonalds though. Confusing stuff, keep mask stash vaccination proof times traveling abroad. I'm sure month ago full posts mask enthusiasts. list absolutely ridiculous inaccurate information. US number 2 5? Seems inaccurate  Getting real tired NYT‚Äôs paywall self-centered makes danger others. Even us vaccinated catch covid pass around.

I get people want get back pre-covid life, safe yet. tired mean shit.  studies immunity exposure vaccine different? long contagious vaccinated already it? vaccine better testing positive beating it?

I understand exposure spike proteins vaccine would provide better immunity actual virus. see lot people upset health care workers refusing get jab. positive covid test past 6 months vaccinated? different every virus planet? Even smallpox common share blanket kid survived it. saying right route curious differs. 

I recently exposed covid 3 weeks ago. got Jansen ""j&amp;j"" vaccine thought nothing still mild symptoms. Slight fever, sneezing, feeling sick, honestly mild vaccine side effects. long contagious causing virus able infect even immune system recognizes it? one 4 individuals exposed vaccinated symptoms.

What would booster catching actual virus would done? exposure inert virus differ live version? Man, CDC promoted vaccines havent taken instead promoting masks ones already vaccinated, maybe that'd make things better idk wedding early September. already postponed year. much. Yup. Monday, counties state high (about 5%). moderate two low. Today exactly 5% high. 

A complete flip flop five days. unbelievable, tbh. Ah typical underestimation algorithms, guess paid Billions dollars develop reason. sure wonder social media platforms use algorithms since according work all. Source? Oslo accords Palestinian Authority responsible vaccinating West Bank. Palestinian Authority turned offer swap vaccine shipments South Korea agreed to. low uptake vaccinations Israel Arab ultra Orthodox community. News media needs develop habit posting direct link studies cites.

It's impossible understand data, even show us data. Parents can't work schools closed... must business related study... civil servant supposed about.  It‚Äôs scam hustle dedicating life help country/humanity.  certain political party could understand that.

True civil service patriotism.  It‚Äôs gun. knowledge care.  want ‚Äúpatriot‚Äù get damn FREE vaccine.  Safe life. 100% this. 

and sure op cares breakthrough infections infections hospitalize kill you. 

The end game Australia widespread mrna uptake point, that. They'll get pandmic probably lowest rates death hospitalization world.

Not sure anyone would see failure.  sure understand context strokes asymptotic infection. 

Would way prevent strokes knew asymptotic covid? Flemish government website: PCR-test en standaard antigeentest: Indien een PCR-test een standaard antigeentest niet beantwoordt aan de vergoedingsvoorwaarden, kan u deze aanrekenen aan de geteste persoon, aan maximaal 55 EUR (inclusief staalafname en andere kosten). Voor een snelle PCR-test waarbij het resultaat gekend binnen de 3 uur het maximumtarief 120 EUR, inclusief alle kosten.
Source (also available french): cost 55 euro want get tested travel events qualify free test (had 2 free tests already refused vaccine). Tests medical reasons always free. 

The antigen test get pharmacy (which gets covid-safe certificate) costs 25 30 euro. Source: VRT tests cheaper, accepted proof.

Whether either PCR antigen test required, validity, depend test required for. travel destination country specify requirements. countries may accept antigen test. bosses truly care health outcomes much claim, they'll promptly agree worker demands. Everybody wins! eligible population people responsible actions, social media algorithms first place. people choose consume social media choose follow scientifically unbased opinion spread via social media rather following sciencetific consensus (approximately) also spread via social media traditional media renowned experts, decision. exponential growth virus though, difference % vaccinated overcome pretty quickly time.

Makes much bigger difference # hospitalizations deaths time peak think.   Gee dunno, didn‚Äôt go testing process vaccines normally go through. That's part it, substantial subset country give shit anyone else convinced pandemic real. fact Florida pandemic hotspot matter--what matters party is. people still think US Trumpistan single Covid death Texas since lifting mask mandates (I saw commenter say Reddit recently week ago). major social media companies. need held accountable spreading medical misinformation. People live actually work (not retired asshats ducking taxes) Florida get dividend check mouse like AK residents oil companies. Love it! Godot coming today. Godot coming tomorrow. Godot never coming. Brain Rattle: Everyone didn‚Äôt know P-Town known gay vacation spot Bears must never understood ‚Äúfuck bears Provincetown‚Äù lyric Vampire Weekend‚Äôs ‚ÄúWalcott,‚Äù huh? surprising 1000 total cases today 1050, would mean cases increased 5%, right? 1050/1000 - 1 = 0.05.

If 123 total cases today 456, would mean cases increased 271%, right? 456/123 - 1 = (about) 2.71.

Now here's kicker. *0* cases today 1? number? case increase incalculatable would involve zero division? let Fauci Fauci Doubt that, total costs certainly interesting, lots study afterwards don‚Äôt believe confirmed cases count since complicated incentives testings."" 

I quite understand. positive test positive test. would incentives make difference? True. beholden mouse. don‚Äôt be. Disney FL going pull stakes move TX ?  likely not.  Disney annoyed moving 2.000 highly paid workers Lake Nona (SE metro adjacent airport) state giving huge sum 500-800 million tax credits them.  Wtf.  Floridians capable voting self interest.  Well. interest retired persons already got pull ladder behind them. idea you‚Äôre talking about. want people free voluntarily take vaccine forced. Paywall get vaccine then? estimated R values delta correct, kids get it. Everyone will. *peace, sorry Agreed, headline seems pretty rich considering CDC went DEFCON 3 report single outbreak. Alberta much higher vaccination rate southern states. must also aware even fully vaccinated people spread virus too, point moot. Somehow doubt cared vulnerable people mentioned always risk covid.
And yeah sure wife biotech engineer lmao I‚Äôd use remind bot honestly don‚Äôt give shit anymore. Get shot get cold, don‚Äôt roll dice. Either way it‚Äôs longer problem.  Ohhh okay. See get really confused evey single City different rule atm uni sent us kind confusing Email. thanks correcting me! So, Mexico City (and Mexico), age group opens (this one 18-29), everyone-elegible-can-sign-up-now. Mexico City split 16 municipalities boroughs, handful municipalities selected inhabitants vaccinated. Per municipality, one, two three mega vaccine sites, usually large schools, convention centers entertainment/sports venues. whole borough assigned one vaccine brand.

When show vaccine, prove live municipality vaccinating week. main national ID address it, renting updated it, show ""proof address"" (a power/water/service bill). usually pretty flexible that, everyone seems borrowing renting people's bills get vaccine different municipality jump line. 

Part thinks unfair people actually live boroughs, order vaccination random, things looking bleak, can't really blame wanting protected. I'm happy young people eager get vaccinated. bother read article ""spread"" conext basically means ""to family"". full class children could contract covid school, even get school give parents - context article - ""spread"" it. makes sense.

It mean ""kids can't get covid school"" ""kids can't get covid"". means ""kids rarely passed infection on, caught (pre delta) infection"".

With delta variant different spread properties could different risk children, result obviously \*useful\* terms policy. mean study is, example, \*garbage\*. 

Publishing headline, now, might bad. that's fault people performing study. Like said chance mutation makes necessity examples present. comparison doesn‚Äôt really translate. second card now. point might see get doctor pharmacist write new one combine one, big deal me. Already breaking people's homes arrest posting anti-lockdown stuff attitude always ""if need test it, maybe worth it"". gone done stuff tests required (meaning low incidence) sparingly really needed mental health (get drunk friend empty beer garden, etc.)

I understand idea ""allowing people stuff tested"" necessary encourage normality time proven worst idea, people get vaccinated demand, see subsidize covid tests people refuse vaccinated.

There still level /an amount tests covered free avoid people reckless, vaccinated rightfully exempt. frustratingly disappointing. Yep ADF assisting enforcing lockdown Sydney: I‚Äôm teacher Austin, Texas metro area. Teachers start August 9, students two weeks later 23rd. can‚Äôt mandate masks offer virtual learning option, thanks governor. Welcome sh!tshow. It‚Äôs ridiculous. mom double masked ended getting super bad asthma attach wearing crap 8+ hours. Arresting people punching horses mostly mean kids already dying. types care kids, *maybe* really see changing. Vaccinated still spread Delta  valedictorian Christian school? isn‚Äôt Biden anything limit Desatis‚Äôs damaging behavior l?!  legitimate business restrictions, though, also think part people mean say ""lockdowns.""

I think comment likely also referring those. FWIW, [Ashish think necessary (and neither I--but he's expert). stop watching fox News 816,000 new shots, 517,000 first shots.

WH Covid Tracker: ""Since week July 5, steady increase number people getting vaccinated US."" Especially due r value delta need something like 80 90 percent fully vaccinated herd immunity Lots reasons. 

Basically, everything mitigate covid, effective vs flu sanitizing practices (which little impact covid) made flu difficult spread. Masks, staying 6' apart, less public gatherings, made huge difference. 

Less travel hemispheres probably made difference. Usually, flu prevalent winter spread southern hemisphere northern hemisphere fall (and back south spring); less travel impacted spread. 

There also theory interference. common highly transmissible virus shut less transmissible virus environment. 

All probably played role. much contributed debate. I‚Äôm Caregiver I‚Äôm lovely wave panic attacks depression. I‚Äôm done, done.  science offers new data, scientists pivot explain understand new data. expect? words trouble little fella? welcome opportunity distract screaming people wearing goggles way 100% protected get virus. hospitals stop overflowing new wave? 
I know man, pretty fucked situation. wearing mask slows down, it. easy way pandora box like opened. Next week"" ""people protesting outside hospital hospital""... hard believe numbers place usa me. cannot see poor countries lower covid numbers us. Normal people? Nothing normal injecting experimental cocktail designed trick NATURAL immune system. hope u learn live fear day hope u stop looking people like they're lepers. What's even worse this,. so,.they're prolonging things. (and making situation worse). (and get,. that's part strategy,. ""perpetuating bad thing"" exactly want disingenuously point finger ""at side"" claim ""they're nothing !"")

Thankfully.. we've seen politicians wise start correct thing.. realize continuation pandemic killing constituents. (kinda hard get re-elected primary voting-block decimated disease). Normal working large portion people oh shit that's actually super fucked Lol ok don‚Äôt understand probability. doubling that. Noted. Ya that's lines basically. Me: *holds Truth Machine Malthouse‚Äôs ‚Äúso-called pandemic‚Äù statement*

Truth Machine: 9000 Completely false. death rate higher people long term complications, including organ damage, vascular damage, brain damage, difficulty breathing, etc. amputations organ transplants.  typically justification declining vaccine? Like [delta variant?]  doesnt though, stop virus doesnt mutate fast flu, stop good.  Yeah guess since start covid, everyone saying ok gotta wait vaccine, it‚Äôs heat goal post forever moving forward. Practicers r/StreetEpistemology like disagree. Instead using trying convince anything instead put beliefs, biases, judgements aside best ask calm friendly questions get root causing believe believe. ask questions reliable way reach conclusion. basically guided critical thinking works really well trying lead anywhere work thus feel idea. wife planning dinner friends tomorrow night. Two households, four people total, outdoors entire time patio. four people vaccinated three four work home. much outside house, sure friends to. current delta situation, would call go it? significant risk here? don‚Äôt know wards DC would guess East Anacostia River probably lowly vaccinated. Northwest well vaccinated. Good. Would rather coerced armed guards doctor showing door forcing body support get it, go hell say ""I wish virus politicized explained dangers us"" vaxxed yet? bankrupt hospitals. Better pass law allowing hospitals right refusal unvaccinated. Let stay home die. media I‚Äôll accept downvotes awful take. 

Collateral damage. 

Those people susceptible reasons beyond control need take care stay away crazy people. 

 Children real innocent victims, generally ones can‚Äôt control surroundings. I'm saying denying treatment? Everyone treated possible.

 there's limited resources major pressure always prioritise someone misses out. 

Transplants prioritised people without addictions. addicts miss out. 

Critical care beds prioritised unvaccinated people cancer patients missing out. 

Is fair?  Exactly, we‚Äôre human beings, regardless choices beliefs. Sadly seems always polarizing get voices heard ends spectrum.  article june 18. Cases didnt increase point. 2 3 weeks actually began increasing. claim cases would never go up, going time.

Do get tired shoving foot throat?  Since we're prevaccinated levels infection think vaccinated also need realize can't whatever fuck cause shots cause there's plenty data suggesting vaxxed getting infected high rates too. sub needs stop deflecting blame antivaxxers. CDC gov official acting like cool reopening encouraging masklessness vaccines new strain real information smart not. CDC straight said even know vaxxed could spread disease opened anyway. realize (we already saw breakthroughs sports ignored that) also blaming people concerned getting life profits back normal instead looking public health. numbers much worse testing little harder find CDC tracking vaxxed mildly infected. 

Since bad man gone we've assumed polticians national level make public health great they're also dragging feet making sense urgency even lower taking thing seriously. reality response EVERY Us gov level complete trash seemed center health profit health citizens. Dumb. would gladly use privilege ignore happening. CDC's perspective, paper gives credence Delta increasing viral loads fully vaxed ppl test positive. real question viral load truly Asymptomatic carriers who're vaxxed up? vast vast majority festival goers Cape Cod displaying symptoms got tested. may double triple number exposed &amp; could potentially test positive, display symptoms. contagious? public health standpoint that's important find out.  vaccine rushed, (obviously) breakthrough cases happening large scale. morbidity purely unvaccinated, cares, lift restrictions let Darwin take who's turn is. Pretty double jabbed, double masker. People really need protection point, we'd ban fast food, guns, cigarettes, automobiles alcohol. ask school counselor state, thanks! Also, lol. You‚Äôre king bad takes. quickly scrolled history saw one. you‚Äôre running around calling people wrong? government let die instead trying protect them, one anti-vaxxer life worth time takes real person put mask. definitely sound like mean well objectively incorrect, still frustrating see people boil nuanced reality short comments like this.

the vaccine *does* reduce environmental viral load, transmission, severity symptoms, that. simple logic (fewer sneezes = less airborne virus) also new data comes regular basis. totally true vaccinated people still infected get sick, also true *if 100% people got vaccinated could beat covid* (obviously that's never going happen, could theory)

the real way forward drop ""well, X case setting Z complications vaccine perfect"" disclaimers. No, vaccine perfect, everybody immunocompromised needs fucking get get one honestly great bodes well rest western world reopening. 2 weeks ago tomorrow night clubs reopened, masks social distancing dropped yet there‚Äôs still decline cases, hospitalisations PCR positivity. Amazing! vaccines new mutations rolled annual flu shots. Poetic.  Online homeschooling real teacher option. 

You could also move. ancestors moved moved country even get boat. ancestors slaves, indentured servants, refugees, added bonus easily available food. 
 
I right kid online school nothing state fed. even teach STEM classes. still take state tests. It‚Äôs little directed seems. British case study essentially got watch process Alpha evolved  like getting mad potential rape victims creating ""defense resistant"" rapists carrying self-defense weapons instead covering entire bodies up. Shame blaming victims CDC admitted bioweapons rather used deployed them. Yeah, worry this. don‚Äôt think Darwinism works, sadly. People interdependent - need other. forgot interview :( well, here's platform dude. teach us. might stuck covid forever, least lose another year lives, requiring bare minimum fellow man apparently bridge far. We‚Äôve let anti-vax movement fester decades bills come due. TAKE NOTES EVERYONE. DIVIDE CONQUER. currently CDC track them. specific, track got hospitalized. say family's case, political. believe vaccine scam help all, hospitals paid give many people possible order kill them. honestly believe vaccine made kill people. got day opened age group. made fun told ""see? right"" got sick hours after. puked felt completely fine, better fine actually cause gotta worry covid more. I'm gonna resist urge return favor catch again.  Since leaving, ask fuck microchip work?

Let us know stupid things says  Well FatFuckinLenny, I‚Äôm lonley af connecting Leakybhole via thread literally salvation atm I'm thankful live country vaccine uptake relatively strong. 70% Great Britain first dose [a] vaccine, whilst 60% doses [a] vaccine. really struggled vaccine hesitancy much (a little 18 - 24). one cares much mental gymnastics would guys realise general population it. DeSantis popularity increasing reddit represent populations priority, rather skewed view. People it. Reddit not. Welcome reality. No, would rightly convicted murder it.  conversation around divisive posts/articles always groups unvaccinated people one dumb ass, non mask wearing group malcontents.

What people genuinely fear long-term effects vaccine, especially one first kind?

 angry people believing *misinformation* constant flow contradictions WH? 

Every year new flu shot new variant, would Corona virus different? New variant, New vax? seeing reality. There's still variants spread, always people can't get vaccinated even want to. wear mask, really hard. funny saying created Chinese weapon, still wear mask follow protocols. protect weapon, choose to? Huh?! It‚Äôs I‚Äôm done caring well-being people. care. done *going way* protect livelihood absolutely regard mine. vaccinated sister isn‚Äôt scare shitless gonna get horrible side effect, narcolepsy always afraid something making worse. tried tried tell important nothing bad gonna happen. don‚Äôt know else do. ***Elon Musk entered chat*** Ah, okay, sorry that!

Thanks reply, peace ‚úåÔ∏è state don‚Äôt need ID insurance get vaccinated, want pursue go online call around find vaccine non health care facility (like CVS, grocery pharmacy, vaccination drive) won‚Äôt need ID insurance like healthcare system (because they‚Äôd need create medical record system you). get there, go get it. need mention parents. It‚Äôs body choice May 20, 2020

A couple months pandemic US. article COVID equivalent bush jr's ""Mission Accomplished"". Based what? Also, field Ph.D. In? kids 12 kids bad health. bad parent keep kid social situations irrational fears. flu worse kids 12. Sleeping together camps sending kids school masks distancing small class sizes. 

My cities public schools closed year. 41 percent gpa less 1.0 year. I'm high risk immune compromised. basically lived 2020 hiding. age primary factor determine could get vaccine. people good shape major underlying conditions got 2nd shot weeks got first, 20 years older me.

I understand high threat elderly, nobody bothered set aside doses high risk patients young. make much sense me. Yessss üòé

Give billions Pfizer yessss easier force us wear masks. pay price ignorant people chose vaccinate. Best take seen this. turbulence landing. way acceleration past week continue much longer. models putting way proportion. 

IHME saying around mid august peak daily cases United States. think reasonable. stop go back normal then, like they‚Äôve entire time March-April 2020,. spent 38 days Hospital (16 days ICU ventilator). months Heart-stabilizer blood thinner medications physical Rehab. last Lung Xray back June 2020 (picture below) still residual ""pneumonia scarring"" bottom Lungs still sure would ever totally heal 100%. ;(... Thankfully past year I've bounced back fairly amazingly. Lots physical exercise. I'm currently averaging 10 miles walked per day, 121 minutes exercise day, 1,500 Active Calories burned day (typically around 4,000 total calories burned day). 

Not tired angry.. past year I've constantly deal daily replies trolls accusing ""liar"" (or manufactured ""crisis-actor"").. usual nonsense ""covid fake"" ""the pandemic exist, go touch grass"" (or variations that). seriously infuriating. 

What's even worse,. pay attention various conspiracy subreddits,. totally see co-opting using pretty traditional conspiracy-tactics (that around decades decades) perpetuate misinformation. honestly really matter things unfold go near future,. trolls disinformation-spreaders spin things however need perpetuate whatever narrative want spout. agree nomenclature better; think likely referring both.

Jha explicit today thinks masks ought need. Everytime person gets vaccinated dead anti-vaxxer gets wings. vast majority people actively wishing death unvaccinated people. lot us aren‚Äôt going pretend like we‚Äôre broken die. someone going let stubbornness willful ignorance get killed, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm going lose sleep it. would YouTube bar YouTube pushes recommendations music videos daily basis?

I report  again.   YouTube one pushing misinformation.  even know Sky News exists. Look CBD isolate. get high relaxing helps sleep. 5. Everyone planet I'm annoyed live country stupidity constantly gets handled velvet gloves.

Make pay choices, swiftly harshly. vaccine, normal public life you. Easy that. 

Except cases cant medical reasons obviously. USA never lockdown.

Lockdowns curfews, military patrols streets, roundups trial punishments offenders. Don‚Äôt say you‚Äôre traveling?

Hear out..... want shot? Get shot. 
You ‚Äúvaccinated ‚Äú, can‚Äôt get virus. 

Don‚Äôt want shot, don‚Äôt get shot, ‚Äú unvaccinated ‚Äú get virus. 

Why vaccinated people give shit unvaccinated people get corona unvaccinated people don‚Äôt care?
Absolutely insane. 
Let person decide themselves, what‚Äôs problem? AFAIK China count asymptomatic cases, country world count them. 75 means something different would countries.  Church? god protect them, think? they're unvaccinated, I'd inclined put end line care given. Like sure, they'll seen/treated, everyone else. long-term safety data accompanies non-EUA drug. would nice.

If accepted governments they, manufacturer, accept full liability. Well note, wear chin convenience stores mass transportation still require mask NYC becomes pain take time. fully vaccinated however. I've said elsewhere today--the vaccinated need get angry. Really angry.

And need direct rage cowardly politicians making *choice* allow anti-vax population ruin things rest us, afraid reaction.

You right unless that, things get better. inconvenienced government.
And government blames unvaccinated.
Therefore, people become mad unvaccinated instead government.   /r/jesuschristreddit Frankly part, fact effecting children much greater degree, absolutely sad. However fucks give. maybe good time change jobs find safer position? know, that‚Äôs wear masks again, cannot let people don‚Äôt understand science selfish care rest society ruin rest us. making everyone wear masks regardless still normalcy mean immunity longevity prior infection? Presumably cells also activated cases. Bad news. CDC says vaccinated people apparently become infected spread Delta variant readily unvaccinated people. words, even everyone vaccinated would return ""normalcy"".

Full disclosure: everyone household fully vaccinated. happy latest developments, either. Insurance billed $600 private PCR test network company 6 months ago. 

They‚Äôre still disputing charge it‚Äôs absurd. Saying get actual bill around 18 months. Probably $0. School, police, firemen, medical services include antivaxxers though. They're everyone everywhere important distinction made annoyed people wilfully getting vaccine, annoyed shots already life back normal vaccine rollout still ongoing.

For last months, people aged 60+ years old get personal space supermarket (in UK) reach something shelves. tell back please, I've told vaccinated problem. infuriating. anyone thinks numbers going yesterday's high, test less weekends. numbers always lower report Sunday Monday.

The rolling seven-day average daily new cases stood 3,105, increase 113.6 percent week ago. common misconception Florida explains believe get shot, likely hospitalized. 80% unlikely get hospitalized. booster cycle probably begin November two weeks Thanksgiving like flu shots. I've actually seen people simultaneously praising Trump getting vaccines done quickly also saying quick devlopment take them.

I honestly think Trump election would seen far less vaccine hesitancy right; although knows, may seen left. level amount covid cases, currently. Covid widespread infection levels high far opportunities mutations variation original virus. 

Plus, vaccinate kids measles, polio, mumps ‚Äî nips virus bud chance spread. Right unvaccinated kids worldwide, maybe high risk disease death, provide opportunities spread change virus. and? severity effects Delta vaccinated people lessened. care unvaccinated people anymore.  really grinds gears nonstop disinformation see seen spewed Facebook since day one. really ""algorithm""?

The vaccine still dramatically decreases chance dying, much mutated. give children flu shot yet risk profile even shot covid. minimizing flu, even say reasonable things like give vaccine like flu. fact matter dangerous flu them.  read situation vaccinated people's nasal passages wondered vaccinated allergy sufferer safer. Seems like nose either stuffed dripping like faucet hopefully good place virus set camp. zero sympathy get sick. company stopped paying nonvacinated people quarantine exposure. trying fermi it‚Äôs legal remove insurance discounts next year. stupid people.  Sebago! also lake house there! think there‚Äôs difference saying ‚Äúunvaccinated people need live consequences I‚Äôm gonna go way keep safe‚Äù ‚Äúunvaccinated people deserve die‚Äù Lol pansy ass understand sentiment, unless get sterilizing vaccine end even everyone US vaccinated. CDC said vaccinated get spread it. unfortunately puts us flu shot scenario eradication scenario like smallpox polio vaccine. agree people same. morons apparently can‚Äôt handle responsibility living amongst others. Symptomatic breakthrough cases ripping workplace anyone else run across article morning LA Times re-opening?

[For parents unvaccinated kids, worsening Delta variant brings alarm, article bold claim made one researcher expects 40% school kids infected first 3 months even *all* schools implement masking. seems crazy high honestly can't find modeling data estimates much spread actually expected schools. think CDC would projections already they're making research also shows even masking required schools, still expects 40% elementary school students infected within three months. bright side problem eventually take care itself. Let trash take out.  Ask lawyer probably stay safe please mean, disagree you, like want discourage type mentality seem apply humanity, plenty things worry care anti-vax Karens spent entire pre-vaccine covid era making retail workers' lives living hell. death means little me.

When said minority, clear, referring opinion. Nope, isn't. Already reported you. live? Depending answer I‚Äôd say get ready get pissed Honesty I'm glad still positive outlook. I'm far past point. CCP bots insane lol Who‚Äôs still dying Covid? Fat people, disproportionate numbers. one talking this. Covid never decimating population local gym. one including left seems recall this. ones know refuse got covid first wave mild. So, fear it.

Evidently, understanding statistics, either. plural anecdote data.  FDA expecting emergency use approval mid-winter. January we're lucky. No, still retain immunity (not confused immune). think they're saying compounds vaccine gone body within 2 months. Getting vaccinated also incredibly easy thing (at least U.S.). Yet millions elected to. 

If business requests patrons wear mask you‚Äôll hear zero protest me, mask up. far people suggesting vaccinated people default wearing masks protect willingly unvaccinated ‚Äòthey‚Äôre still people‚Äô‚Ä¶ no, that‚Äôs argument buy into. don‚Äôt wish death anyone die result foolish decisions, could care less. I'm done caring refuse care others first place. anti-vax idiot catches delta dies, longer care. Good riddance.  try downvote think someone trolling and/or contributing discussion healthily. Downvoting simply disagree something worth effort. 

Too many people hard time masks, many people quick call anti-maskers. Sometimes can't get past initial difficulty breathing think can't breathe enough. 

Besides, kind person responds (genuine) question vitriol? much negative energy already ask me. good day internet stranger! :) needs easier people access things like unemployment, kind social distancing go hand-in-hand sensible policies. link every time look says health care professionals . can‚Äôt get second Pfizer dose due anaphylaxis first. still get first, though, also Covid 2020, first dose acted second. good chunk allergic crowd partially vaccinated, combined natural/vaccine-induced immunity. Came downvote you! :) Well good news! Keep mind positive tests infections 1-2 weeks ago. 4 days future really week ago (unless case growth changed back reason). agree sentiment news article Masks distancing still big compromise make (longterm, starting wear part time now). vaccine it/booster shots need proven effective variants count it, that‚Äôs I‚Äôm giving another year data. meantime I‚Äôm balancing risk / going things based information available‚Ä¶  fly Florida issue Florida? got authoritarian let others make choices? Get N95s protect damn self Led Zeppelin fucking rules work hospital taking care COVID-19 patients since start ICU. literally hell us day work. 

 Cases dropped hospital relatively normal weeks vaccine came out.

Now ICU hospital floors filling like first started, almost unvaccinated. preventable people want risk lives lives others misinformation. finally believe deathly ill late then.

The antibodies people got vaccine early dropping need booster shot soon. insight changing minds why? 

I think need widespread public information campaigns encouraging vaccines. I‚Äôve seen commercials New York announcing vaccines safe effective free. need that, times 1000. every state.  Maybe Biden actually fuckinf something Abott Desatis vaccine protects 98% hospitalized dying . I'd call achievement, something sneered at. hoped got vaccinated would beginning end virus. immunized, vaccination rates going up, seemed like things would finally return normal.

But allowed stay extant long time mutate. I'm likely going get multiple booster shots stay immune fuckers insistent letting run rampant. There's many virologists Reddit, weird.  Unvaxxed children. kid‚Äôs 8. Can‚Äôt get vaccine. Plenty innocent people suffer this. live small rural town thousand people. town never went lockdown I‚Äôve rarely seen anyone wear mask past year half. community tight knit, tell we‚Äôve single covid death here. feels like rest world going crazy we‚Äôve living working always have. Maybe it‚Äôs don‚Äôt live city us work outside virus never affected us, man it‚Äôs wild outside pandemic looking in. think it‚Äôs like birth control basically. 100%. like flu still kills people even believe real now. like Trump changed near election Dem hoax ""mysteriously disappear"" elections, would immediately open everything act like never existed, since made win elections Trump.

They keep completely changing views grounds reality, yet think ""free thinkers"" smarter ""stupid educated people"". Yes absolutely. today feel slightly surprised time reminded last year preceding four. MGTOW - maladies going way ""[hey, uh, come closer mind wearing a, uh, chin matter. Variants escaped vaccine immunity yet, doubt will. Might make contagious vaccinated get sniffles. sorry situation. wish solutions horrible circumstance we've placed in. change .

Damn kids 12! false Yup. They‚Äôve managed make far without losing anything, start losing relationship children. job requires person gatherings, father won‚Äôt pay income get vaccinated, obviously doesn‚Äôt give shit me.  vaccine hesitant find excuse get gets full approval. need approve businesses feel empowered mandate employees.  please point leading Republican said lies are? Republicans pro-vaccine far know, believe comment fact misinformation. know many breakthrough? First mRNA vaccine ever long term side effects. He‚Äôs far stupid realize he‚Äôs hurting himself

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going hit head board acknowledge I‚Äôm right!‚Äù Vaccinated outdoors good. Lol, really thinking things who's one getting mad? Explain what's wrong reasoning done thing.

1. people are, example, immunocompromised, cannot get vaccine higher risk becoming seriously ill even likely dying get Covid. 

2. Covid spreads easily higher chance creating variants among people unvaccinated.

3. refusing get vaccinated allows Covid spread easily also provides higher chance creating deadly variants.

4. Therefore, putting people cannot protect risk.

I can't wait explanation shown everyone quite sharp. hard data back 90% claim? 

80% hospitalized (4/5) CDC-investigated Barnstable Co, outbreak fully vaccinated. I've never seen hard data back multiple claims 88%, 90%, 99% hospitalized unvaxxed. I'd love see data, it. This. oldest (now 20) 8th grade, pulled school 6 weeks. garbage school. enrolled public charter school. tuition anything. on-campus lessons, social life, like 75% homeschool. first year rough, learn manage himself, easy. learned needed, necessary work, got skip pointless lectures bullshit busywork. Yes, is. received first dose 2 days approved age group, second 3 weeks after, according recommended schedule. we, parents, got January. got soon possible could protect much able. also go restaurants, curbside groceries, visited family friends since Christmas 2019, etc etc. Everything prevent exposure. Well two:

1-AIDS started 1981. 

2-The Seventh Cholera Pandemic began 1961 still going. Yeah, it‚Äôs likely happen. People liberal cities don‚Äôt get pissed moderates conservatives post vaccination restrictions like masks. high vaccination states arent rate. No, lost 4 grandparents virus. Fuck selfish pricks. Yeah, kind thing concerns me. confusing situation. think it‚Äôs best buckle long haul wear masks advised experts Moderna Novavax did, Pfizer not. seems entirely unclear role previous administration played (versus congress actually funded it) whether would vaccines sooner later different administration. demographics cases likely reflect attendees public gatherings, events marketed adult male participants

That's one way putting it. Here's another: subjects study rapidly exchanging bodily fluids throughout [Bear vaccination status emboldened promiscuity.

It's media contributing misinformation. Even CDC report contains zero details makes transmission event extremely unusual oblique mention ""adult male participants"". seems everyone afraid appearing homophobic point infectivity virus among extremely self-selected segment gay population week-long orgy may typical general population. what? Delta variant spiraling control lambda might able resist vaccine.  Look using simple logic make decision best suits health. reason downvoted. vaccinated people still worry safety there‚Äôs reason worry since that‚Äôs vaccination for‚Ä¶ protect yourself. boken thumb odd choice illustrate point. Due boss saying wanted work I‚Äôd pretend COVID wasn‚Äôt thing. Aka, masks. Yeah. No. Disagree. Like said, afraid many many aren‚Äôt. don‚Äôt middle finger government telling believe misinformation covid fake etc. Case point? family wife‚Äôs side refuse vaccinate. aren‚Äôt afraid it, think it‚Äôs ploy democrats nonsense.  Unironcally asking, happen? I'm it, would possible? felt way you. I‚Äôm home covid fully vaccinated April. wonder would‚Äôve never gotten people gotten vaccine.    stupidity endangers us.

We angry them.  good secular homeschooling resources. used _Build Library_ past year 5 y/o instead sending school.

We good fortune wife stay-at-home mother, though. 

Looking schooling requirements year, he's ahead class outcomes, recommend it. Uber gives vaccine rides free.

Maybe see PCP give phone consultation, don‚Äôt find way get person?

Just ideas! best friend children's freedoms superior OP's either though. resistant, Delta spreads quicker, infects people quicker, therefore may appear people vaccine resistant, that's case except maybe percent.

Approx. 0.07% vaccinated Americans gotten Covid (including Delta). Yes that's lot people (approx. 125,000 Americans), **lot less** unvaccinated huge amount.

As today: 95% - 98% covid cases (including Delta) amongst unvaccinated people. Doesn‚Äôt help, thanks do. You‚Äôre fucking rockstar! Obviously variants huge issue. US, we‚Äôre definitely hard time getting good majority population vaccinated due antivaxxers, vaccine approved children 12 many immunocompromised persons (though vaccination numbers increasing lot awesome). need vaccinate many people possible decrease speed mutations keep COVID manageable levels.

But personally believe ‚Äúantivaxxers ruining everything, it‚Äôs fault‚Äù sentiment isn‚Äôt totally accurate. Let‚Äôs forget many parts world aren‚Äôt even close fully vaccinated vaccinating slow rates. means virus continue mutate, mutation eventually make way around globe (re: Delta started India Gamma started Brazil). antivaxxers huge problem? doubt it. vaccination numbers steady around world, mutations keep happening new variants (whether less transmissible/deadly) spread. wish scientists public health officials took consideration make decisions recommendations. LMAO AYAAAA AAAAA FREE SAID ü§ë

This salt mine d√©licieuse üòé Well beyond help, hope thinking come back bite ass one day. KN95s filter rate buy good manufacturer. difference really seal. concern trolling noted. I‚Äôm New Smyrna Beach, FL (between Daytona Cocoa you‚Äôre familiar area), run Publix today. counted 3 people masks besides employees. packed.

I‚Äôm sure people vaccinated damn. cannot wait vaccine approved kids 12. We‚Äôll first line.

I‚Äôd love describe sort counter point, rather spouting nonsense. disagreeing CDC fan, think they‚Äôre slow react made serious mistakes. it‚Äôs job approve vaccines boosters. lies FDA.

Yeah, find cleaning kinda' therapeutic. something life control over. ([I'm fully aware similar Office talking didn‚Äôt downvote downvoted due cautiousness. guys vaccinated fine. need overthink this. sympathetic. Yeah I'm realistic cautious new variants, media needs realize virus Thanos.

HIV much scarier SARS-CoV-2 basically kills immune system, HIV longer death sentence used be. treatable many HIV+ people live relatively normal lives 70s. all. unvaccinated bearing ability live free lifestyle. govt actively keeping using excuse. could stop infringing freedom point. could like take back. we're clear here, argument ""clearly virus-generated antibodies enough keep getting covid, keep getting covid again"" know vaccinated people still get spread virus

Sorry, fact day one. Vaccinated people strive kind normalcy, COVID going anywhere. People seem forgetting vaccines never designed keep people mild illness, stopping severe disease death. vaccinated people went back normal today, still would see kind spread possible unvaccinated.

Furthermore, taking steps COVID new cold illness; Chinese first noticed COVID, called new kind pneumonia cold/flu. one right mind would call pneumonia cold, somehow line became popular States. Well Fox far worst offender Again, share sources I'll consider hearing out. Find expert agrees lockdowns ever everyone vaccinated. We've countless celebrities get vaccinated camera yet still helped. Problem we've got social media help anti vaxxers hit back say actually get vaccinated staged. Plus times changed. People used worship Elvis almost. days got people trusting fox news like Tucker Carlson dude Sounds simple incompetent leaders like Tx make things can‚Äôt even happen. Back school happens next two weeks schools legally bound requiring masks completely unvaccinated student population. 1 4 parents vaccinated many many counties here. sounds like could worked around except Tx leadership also made schools cannot provide distance learning. Obviously open anything, source said wrong. see millions religious exemptions  Shoot virus, duh.  It‚Äôs weird. Never claimed one. explaining understand people know things. Mandates, changing minds. got fully vaccinated 4 months ago Pfizer. impression still fully protected girlfriend family saying get booster shot ""Pfizer's immunity wanes 4 months."" want get moderna one better? sources this?

They're also worried delta variant even though mainly unvaccinated people hospitalized. girlfriend want play basketball indoors group vaccinated friends unless wear mask. reasonable precaution? I'm getting really tired this.

I'm mid-20's healthy. Right, live folks late 60's. We've Pfizers, I'll damned I'm gonna bring home give breakthrough case *I'm* protected. tons reports talking vaccinated still spreading thing ignore cause thing. Juts like anti vaxxers stop getting infected. I'm tired seems like matter what, antivaxers always win punished ones people vaccinated cautious, meanwhile antivaxers living life nothing happens, discouraging. 


Plus lot news articles seem everything power make seem like vaccinated people still lot danger, ""300 vaccinated people get infected!!"" fail mention 300 people like 0.6% total vaccinated people exposed never got sick, I'm back scared thanks media fuels antivax agenda ""Vaccines useless"". per capita basis, North Dakota South Dakota posted [some worst COVID stats they're well terms current case loads, given populations, two states suffered worst COVID. Sturgis year might land territory come winter. everyone problem. Fox.   Statistically unvaxxinated spreading more. bear majority blame here. leave home part problem. Never leave house! left local Walmart. saw noticeable uptick voluntary mask wearing customers.

Last night also got alerted ""outbreak"" occurring (mostly outside) county fair. Chin diaper mean, maybe *these* brains.   Uk CFR vaccinated people 50 0.03%. Vaccines also prevent 60-90% infections. Unless 50 there's safety issues vaccinated; issue spread. Stop fear mongering nonsense. suspect light end tunnel oncoming train point. No. Spread unvaccinated people may result mutation vaccine protect against, unlike delta variant. Yup. breathe chin..? Yeah friend like kinda frustrating TBH. like ""I'm sure vaccine, want see effects first. really need anyway. stay rooms time anyway.""

And I'm like ""bro, goal anymore, keep hiding rooms indefinite period time.""

And said takes plenty precautions like wearing gloves goes told care. XD actually surprises media gone route. suspect admit wrong course last year.  I‚Äôm vaccinated. son vaccinated. 99% folks dying right unvaccinated. choice, choices consequences. completely apathetic. thing could make concerned situation ICUs start filling non covid patients aren‚Äôt able get care need. I‚Äôll pissed again. note, experience majority people still wearing masks part bars like etc... great. mutations waiting happen.  They‚Äôre probably right still get WSJ always locks partisan piece behind paywall (they really lock anything everything behind paywall).

Whatever FDA does, make huge impact. confirm. colleague, 59 years, afraid vaccine thought healthy careful enough get corona. ended hospital, ICU couple days happy survived. also infected four people office.  understand, probably go back thirty years. It‚Äôs power media programming people‚Äôs thought process it. still remember jaw hitting floor first verbal attack made Fauci radio host RL. day shit hit fan things started cancelling closing March 2020. couldn‚Äôt believe audacity attack, going be. Soon message across channels fell lockstep Fauci attacks became daily part programming. feel doesn‚Äôt apply everywhere. countries adequate supply vaccine, even eligible people atm.   think frustration comes beginning, appeared everyone part masked up, could contain virus. What‚Äôs become abundantly clear never big enough percentage population buy mindset. 

If actions don‚Äôt matter many others won‚Äôt pitch help out, bother? personal low risk, aren‚Äôt protecting ask-risk populations. person willing co-operate, conditional basis. Unfortunately condition can‚Äôt met many others won‚Äôt help too. u sound crazy  Yeah, like kind articles, stoke fear.

So, hypothetically, could happen. might even happen, what's consequences? far tell, unlikely variant could emerge would defeat existing *and* future vaccines. 

With mRNA platform, create vaccines new strains short time, point, virus would exhausted space viable adaptations. nope, can't yell fire theatre, skynews australia that.

stop pretending ""greater good"" individual freedom important everything anything else. That's necessarily true unfortunately. Recent data shows fully vaccinated individuals may shed equal amount virus (delta) unvaccinated. caused CDC change mask guidance recently. could actually colds many/most cases. number cases colds flu drastically decreased average almost everyone masking isolating. got used colds.

And could covid, even breakthrough mild cases vaccinated. It‚Äôs mind numbing. Like fuck spends much time energy rallying potentially saving lives mask. don‚Äôt like masks keep kids home. kids know aren‚Äôt complete fucking idiots don‚Äôt give shit masks quackadoo parents do. thing is, even circulate images, antivaxxers say propoganda something else. Unless smacks loved ones right face, ""fear-mongering"".  wonder, really need make numbers drive people get vaccine?

No, need make numbers deceive people believing schools workplaces safer are. common thread throughout messaging around pandemic US.  Yeah.. going ""legitimize"" viewership's beliefs...

Youre much stronger/different me. Never would allowed crazy person without vaccine see child infected child, youre shit list people sure hell seeing child long time. It‚Äôs exactly secret population stupid. average IQ pretty low. Ignorance bliss guess Thoughtcrime death. Yet Reddit thinks lock lol  anybody else worried fact didn‚Äôt even specify misinformation actually ?? slippery slope I‚Äôve ever seen one confirm I‚Äôm unvaccinated fucks. I‚Äôm also Reddit circle jerking wanting lockdowns cant again. maddening. point. always going people get vaccine, number incredibly increased politicians religious leaders playing games peoples ability trust scientists health care experts. 

Worse yet, sheer number people unvaccinated chances deadly transmissible variants able infect vaccinated keeps increasing. love less year old Reddit accounts spread FUD vaccines. guys obvious lol. Oh yeah see that. Stress really number us. Including cycle. Hopefully end boosters less stressed it. 

Thank responding good luck everything. like love man lies allot tells want hear.   get third dose? Since can‚Äôt, stop creating narrative people aren‚Äôt safe, promote version fear porn.  Doubt point maybe he's far gone, anyway. Right get it.

r/covidatemyface people vaccinated show wearing two masks dumb ones? Delta. Mask 2020 us buy time create tools (vaccines) would bring us normalcy. waiting something tangible specific.

Since Covid never going away, we‚Äôve run tangible goals wait for. could say full FDA approval 12s get vaccinated, isn‚Äôt even conversation centered. doubt already vaccinated kids 12 conversation would different. offer immunity (vaccines) we‚Äôre satisfied number people took it? Mask indefinitely? Mask stall spread offer immunity, unvaccinated vulnerable still next mask mandate ends on. wait for?

Part adult making plan, that‚Äôs notion mask ‚Äúuntil things better‚Äù. counts better?  I‚Äôm boat, thing I‚Äôd point vaccination ticked substantially last week so. tells unvaccinated persuaded, lot least. I‚Äôd avoid harsh messaging even feels good since might harden position. I‚Äôm glad public health workers persistent refining messaging! doesn‚Äôt mean nothing it‚Äôs insignificant stress parent dies Yet origin show. It‚Äôs brought countless times sub people always baffled it, like people swear Fruit Loom logo used cornucopia never one. percentage die COVID normally?  surprise tbf. recent statistics back this.  age group cant even get vaccine country yet pretty bloody frustrating slight difference. One willing work greater good, enough people willing chip well. it‚Äôs conditional co-operation.

The person isn‚Äôt willing help matter what.

Both different describing, unconditional co-operation. same. Yeah anywhere people gather require vaccination like clubs, bars, religious worship facilities sporting events. employees large corporations like wal mart, like them.

I totally agree, lets stop fearing reprisals take real action now. lol, cable.  hope I'm wrong, far i've pretty spot covid related predictions. Distancing huge sacrifice (depending mean), though.

I intention another Zoom thanksgiving even seeing friends infrequently outside.  willing let vaccine work there. (I also mask things).

I wear mask public, big sacrifice. know efficacy drops 50% 18 months vaccine even around 12 months? problem China lacks long term solution delta/other variant. Sinovac doesn‚Äôt provide great efficacy versus delta.

China need solve opens travellers without mandatory 14 day quarantine heart broken guys age grouping. look own, younger, kids makes angry selfish stupid people ruining everything all. people sub insane. want perpetual lockdown thier risk zero..in real life people saying this..only reddit they'll swallow anti-vax shit, they'll swallow anything. sad part makes lucky states terminated benefits earlier think everyone get vaxed vaxed. said, new communication/mandates going make people don‚Äôt vax want more. definition success acceptable risk communicated us. end game people stop playing, especially people charge condescending.

Why would get booster shot disease isn‚Äôt going kill (33, healthy, 2 doses pizer) we‚Äôre going back restrictions? Nature .. uh ‚Ä¶ finds way  Interestingly enough, study seems back original alone stop spread variants, fact vaccination without mask mandates likely encourage development vaccine-escaping variants.

Hope wrong. weeks ago looked like wrong, least regarding US. I‚Äôm really sure. COVID whole (up said), Delta Variant.  Could ww. Maybe we're lucky? Agreed. vaccinated, part risk serious health condition mitigated. Censorship forms ethically wrong, make current problems much, much worse... Exact thought lives matter‚Ä¶ pointless get angry unvaccinated unless get kicks anger.

The older get, annoyed become things people do. annoyance leads anger good physical mental health.

Speeders, tailgaters, reckless drivers, slobs, liars, cheats. etc. I'll admit I've one time another I'm habitual - least think that's true.

I'm fully vaccinated (Pfizer bioNTech). since April. gotten sick Covid-19 virus cold since outbreak began. makes asymptomatic best.

Now, whether wear mask. wearing one currently. Outbreak delta variant area low increasing. start wearing one outbreak level moderate. time, I'm sure unvaccinated people wear mask unless mandated enforced. Again, pointless get angry them. avoid making bad situation worse part. Holy fuck. sheer numbers tourists year, man. they're fucking demanding bc first vacation year....like guys, get fuck yourselves. Yes, we're bunch product. yes, fucks come order ten pounds meat cheese ‚ÄúI‚Äôm strong fit healthy young person‚Äù - 300lb American gets breath going stairs thinks beat COVID lives first world country even though won‚Äôt take advantage first world science medicine Either get rid draft mandate vaccine. Can't both. yeah, theyre dumb. need data prove it. dont know it‚Äôs entire corporation, Fox News mandates vaccines studio workers.  drugs clinical trials 6 years still safe human use. Covid vaccines complete clinical trials rushed emergency use. definition even vaccine research come conclusion. Unfortunately covid ""vaccine"" even work provide immunity anyone. 

Since media government ones pushing misinformation. censor civil discussion questioning anything pandemic. look top deleted posts sub... Something wrong. 

Not saying pandemic suck real. however saying need able discussions without demonizing people wondering putting body. 

We act like vaccine magic bullet fix clearly work. Better start buying toilet paper hand sanitizer then. get anger frustration, really do, get way get children yelling it‚Äôs unfair another kid got something kid didn‚Äôt. 

At point, you‚Äôve got admit fairness isn‚Äôt real thing real world, you‚Äôve got start working workable solutions. somebody gets hundred bucks taking shots didn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôd like hundred bucks, obviously, didn‚Äôt need make good choice somebody else does, give guy. wear mask spread asymptomatic case moron never wear mask keeps dying, fine. Fairness isn‚Äôt real, better outcomes be. seem ver excited 100k‚Ä¶. Sad reality. insecure, would conform people demanding them? driving vehicle recommended. I'm dumb baby ignores PPE SoP procedures. glossing ‚Äúif get delta variant.‚Äù still relatively harder vaccinated person. LOL !RemindMe 6 months FDA needs give final authorization vaccines employers start making mandatory condition employment objection vaccinations, lockdowns, masks. I'm favor whatever takes save lives. objection post beginning was:

1. assume people Reddit able decide public policy.

2. writing support ideas, employ language syntax makes people less receptive ideas because: 

a. *do* make personal attacks (then deny it), 

b. condescend believe know everyone else thinking, 

c. someone calls bad manners play victim card, even one engendered hostility first place.

If changed tone, people would receptive. either accept fact continue people reject you--not wrong, act like ass.

The two doses received effective. idea got started not. Delta escape variant. CDC‚Äôs reports confirm this, data various sources around world. 

Some older immunological deficient people may get booster somewhat soon, everyone may eligible booster longer period (year two plus). absolutely ‚Äúwe need wait another dose‚Äù situation. 

Effective vaccines make possible vaccinated people return normal activities. claiming Covid vaccine work. Fauci said. 

Interesting, would Fauci make comparison polio vaccine? Surely vaccines work misinformation say right? Anybody knows Novavax getting late approvals? trial results months. dislike vaccine third doses case considered ""better"" mRNA youngs Mart, Disney, Delta, United Airlines, various business already made move.

And conclued mass vaccination makes unlikely thanks reduction true, reason happened rapidly diseases like measels, mupmd, diphtheria etc nber cases worldwide much much lower covid. 

Because vaccines, masks lockdowns. 

(disclaimer: I'm saying masks lockdowns useless, simply impractical long term prefer bury head sand pretend over?

No, I'd prefer take logical approach instead effectively lock (mask wearing cases become high...blah blah, since alone useful) avoid lock future.

We already vaccinating. need vaccinate more. Claiming vaccines alone enough like saying vaccines work.  Yes indeed! Viruses continue mutate hosts‚Äîthey cannot live outside body. globally billions unvaccinated people vaccination unfortunately concentrated wealthier countries. Therefore, think it‚Äôs possible COVID continue mutate whether mutate point fully (100%) evades vaccine protection unlikely feel like whoever refused take vaccine don‚Äôt wear masks deserves die. Don‚Äôt get wrong, know people can‚Äôt get vaccine least they‚Äôre acknowledging danger wearing masks.

If haven‚Äôt gotten shot still refuse wear mask outdoors, wish worst upon you. Israel, unfortunately, seems outlier - I've seen rational explanation high level breakthrough cases. (the majority; all) Singapore's infected migrant labour, Malaysia (which highest cases per million SEA now). 

Migrant labourers tend work live close contact, would expect virus gets in, viral load communities shared fairly equally rise quickly, vaccinated unvaccinated. Well, Missouri clinic inside Walgreens seemed quite busy vaccinations yesterday. Besides, don‚Äôt know who‚Äôd want get vaccinated riding rides, eating, drinking county fair. hope too, can't really trust data came India grasp situation facet see UK current best case scenario really comparable significantly higher vaccination rate adhered health measures. way curve Florida think hoping they're peak today. kind growth continuing another week two would crazy. Wtf? sucks.

No, that's roughly line studies say. subreddit become bit circle-jerk around amazing vaccines are, sorry say. Yep. here. Agreed. think smokers, drinkers, obese people, drug addicts, well. Sick footing bill irresponsible heathens Couldn‚Äôt agree more, feel sub really full grocery‚Äôs afraid go back normalcy!

What children antivaxxers fill hospital beds, get involved traffic accident available beds? Exactly. understand thinking went ""let's get vaccinated good whole"" ""I'm safe stop caring everyone else"" many vaccinated people. Best response mask vaccination. lot grief deal it. It‚Äôs problem everywhere feel like there‚Äôs 50% false information 50% correct information (or 60-40) currently circulating.

What newspapers read? news channel watch? Apparently, knows mistake feels really bad it. still hasn‚Äôt come back office still recovering‚Ä¶ Redditors feel like vaccinated fix situation working harder spreading rare instances breakthrough infection. That‚Äôs simply answer. real solution unvaccinated get vaccinated requires French level vaccine passport requirements. would go. wouldn‚Äôt get second shot returning home though unless required re-entry. wouldn‚Äôt want potential side effects second shot visiting family. far getting stuck here, think won‚Äôt seeing closed borders. vaccine widely available can‚Äôt see people tolerating massive lockdowns point. issue viruses/vaccinations?

What vaccines allow host body transmit virus, easily non-vaccinated bodies... allowing rapid mutation. 95% attendees vaccinated 75% infected were, would big success

Well, would minor success. üòâ. agree point coverage whole situation leaves lot desired, nuances details really matter. think reporters understandably depth, others particular agenda driving encourages certain slant. 

At point time, think best case scenario populations half people vaccinated include kids 12. Sometimes specialized groups like doctors (though US, nurses appear surprisingly vaccine hesitant), frequently less much less, especially outside first world settings. think lot hypotheticals would seeing high vaccination rates anything except hypotheticals point.

The important point coming right vaccinated people apparently becoming ""covid cases"" rates greatly different unvaccinated. severities appear much less, vital important big step forward. much triumphalist reporting last months (the pandemic vaccinated!"") starting look pretty overblown perhaps dangerously touch reality.

Hopefully get clarity next weeks. everyone probably gonna put hands ears act like isn‚Äôt concern. 

That said U still get vaccinated Yeah, get me, especially sub. first joined March/April 2020 bc work hospital wanted keep updated going on. sub always full assholes, hyperbolic statements create fear, stupid opinions ideas always prevailed. 

I got massively downvoted telling someone comment bodies would rotting streets NYC ""late summer"" last year stupid comment basis reality. 

Just like ridiculous claim anyone get vaccine sociopath. ppl probably even know clinical definition sociopath. sub is, always be, full self righteous asshats concerned feeling superior actual concern fellow humans. Yeah, part makes mad. think anti-vaxxers idiots, least understand it. anti-vaxxers ones breaking containment strategies creating superspreader situations though, demanding government nothing, allowed get control. true fuck wear masks again. Nobody expect us wear forever. That‚Äôs happening. medical science concept Vaccine Hybridization? article Germany, needless say statement Germany. Preach. first covid patient months last night dragging walking hall put plastic crap again. survived Pakistan years. surprise surprise, random unqualified mullahs going around saying makes weak. uneducated underprivleged people end suffering them.

mark words, spread misinformation nothing short murderers family members. afraid getting covid think immune system protect themselves. Let's say say: stops another variant developing India UK wherever? US 5% world population. I'm going keep living pre-vaccine life reduce chance mutation mere 5%. fact less way anti-vaxxer states going close Covid anyway. wonder, really need make numbers drive people get vaccine? cause justify means here?

I mean, post's title well. Usually numbers exactly made up, phrased confusing misleading way sound much better much worse really is.

The protection Delta mRNA seems somewhere around ""7 8 cases prevented"" me, look real-world news studies. good-enough result, nobody expected vaccination 99.997% protect you. understand thinking went ""let's get vaccinated good whole"" ""I'm safe stop caring everyone else"" many vaccinated people. antivax cult tries make seem like every third person issue. Goes fair fun

Gets vaccinated

Feels bad fair

I know expecting happen.. handing vaccines fair.. us lost patience?! know anyone who's vaccinated tired delusional donuts. point stupid profit US insurance companies cover get Covid. going vaccinate animals they‚Äôre finding well? numbers CFR generally 1.7% US. CFR breakthrough cases 20%. 

That‚Äôs pretty mind blowing. test positive COVID post vaccination, bad sign. Leads believe people susceptible dying COVID also likely unprotected vaccine. 

Obviously important stat number symptomatic infections avoided altogether vaccination. agree. thing I'm hearing people refuse get vaccinated mask they've already COVID. can't get again. 

My rant: Ever since CDC lifted recommendations masking vaccinated people, people like masks refused together likely ones masking now. frustrated CDC made determination vaccinated people need masks. knew Delta variant rampage. watched India Israel. changed back ""everyone, vaccinated not, please wear mask!"" took less two months! that's confusing people giving people refuse vaccinate mask fuel misinformation fires. respect CDC efforts make, inconsistency making things perilous. masks come vaxx-hesitant anti-vaxx, they're never going put back on. someone's anti-mask, likely refusing vaccine (in personal experience).  Luckily understanding, starting square one, remember read b that. Since seem Germany, provided link get vaccination without permission.

Sorry, English speaking community, German specific law might apply country. give translation since specifically Germany/German laws.

[Keine Einverst√§ndniserkl√§rung der Eltern Ya'll might stalking child. sayin. :)  vaccinated much less likely infected.

If become infected despite vaccinated, end spreading virus similar someone unvaccinated. 

Enough vaccinations still essentially end delta variant. high enough unvaccinated population end spreading occasional vaccinated person end carrying another pocket unvaccinated people really needs change. portion non-Covid related healthcare protected cancer patients etc get treated rest Covid. triage vaccinated people get priority. people who've done right thing get treatment withdrawn due anti-vaxxers? Unfortunately you‚Äôre right. listening medical expert NPR talking concern vaccinated people catching Delta variant giving opportunity morph vaccine resistant variant. logic, reference Israel's third dose means third dose useful coverage 90% needed anymore (if) coverage reaches 90%. is...an interesting claim. Serenity now, insanity later Ah yes agree misinformation problem. Unfortunately it‚Äôs problem France though - got lucky Raoult guess üòÖ Anyway best luck mother, must frustrating see remain unvaccinated! one would forced pay higher premiums. would three choices: insurance, higher premiums, vaccination. Again, going pay EVERY SINGLE unvaccinated person going get covid. Significant numbers accrue hundreds thousands preventable medical expenses. think increased expenditures paid unvaccinated. ones accruing expenses. I'm really scared 'cause leave house like month,and unlikely I'd exposed covid. Yet got vaccine,I'd submit possible death dangerous side effects. I'm scared I'm scared vaccine,even though know safe all.  recently unsubscribed subreddits made feel angry. Im lot happier now. 


Honestly, still fence one r/Brexit. 


Never Facebook thankfully Honestly point, want ostracize anyone who's unvaccinated without good reason society. Prevent working us, going events us, travelling, etc. live bubble, get covid, deal it. choose protect yourself, get suffer consequences. make suffer lack belief social contract. won't. article nonsense, ""scientists"" fear mongers want attention.

The virus going able evade current vaccine strategy. still able get it, primed defeat it.

Source, PhD employment designing drugs pharma. absolutely make difference. Again, regrets 2020 beginning 2021 temporary emergency measure. even extended family interactions noticeable improvement felt comfortable taking mask month ago.  I'm pretty sure one point theory day vaccines make magnetic something. Unbelievable.

I've never understood ""freedoms"" argument regard this. thousand rules already place society prevent hurting people and/or yourself. can't whatever want whoever want. speed limits. Building codes. Business licenses. Health codes. Traffic laws. many things put place prevent people harming unsuspecting people. Civilization literally built concept. mean shit, consent laws? can't stick dick girl want there. morons allowed nose-fuck unvaccinated covid spray? Serious question, see conceptual difference.

Me!

I would get vaccine, mom says no. likely, eradicate it, like never eradicated chickenpox. Eradication would require internationally mandatory vaccination.

Learn live it, end world. Germany fines unvaccinated. 

Just idea. Somebody who's vaccinated still catches covid shed much, much less much less time expose far fewer people. Well can't something convince even antivax mom get it. decision affects it, nothing it, already part. three vaccines given EUA elicit T-cell response. i‚Äôm sure. Arkansas throwing away 80,000 expired vaccines. US criminally privileged. You‚Äôll okay.  you‚Äôre living one places.

Judgemental attitudes like condemning everyone vaccinated helpful all. 

I friend work (in hospital) worked courage get vaccinated last week bc intense, mean, intense anxiety fear bc bad reaction vaccine prior covid. set appointments cancelled multiple times she'd panic freak out. 

Most ppl refuse get probably selfish petty, calling sociopaths *beyond* fucking ridiculous hyperbolic talk people divided. coping making excuses, thanks.** Distancing good masks still critical tools. getting exposed first place clean 100% plan getting sick. get exposed, n95 work you. lines defense fail, that‚Äôs vaccine shines, bats cleanup little deal first place. 

There‚Äôs reason redundant safety features everything power plants cars, everything fails another thing behind keeps people alive. Swearing never wear mask like tearing airbags texting driving you‚Äôve got seatbelt.   Yes, fuck fam. Wow. Get drink dude. people truly medical complications vaccines general WEAR freaking masks. WORE waaaay covid. ounce sympathy self-entitled assholes. anyone else seeing lot people sneezing cold like symptoms really fun exact conversations 1.5 years later. 

""Ooh cases spiking, deaths spiked??""

They're delayed 4 weeks. New cases peak Florida Jan 8. New deaths peaked Feb 8. coping making excuses, thanks.**  part shitty statistic, sound scientific research, see mean. definitely need humble-cookie arrogant attitude IMO best staying right now. make similar decision past winter (Ecuador, mother died US). return US early May, infection rate could get jab 10 days quarantine. 

We held zoom memorial family mostly scattered parts US. far risky otherwise then. IMO we're moving another highly risky situation. 

The knowledge delta variant continues grow daily look great. Plus huge percentage US population still vaccinated chance new variants continuing appear extremely high. Leakybhole, anecdote terrifying‚Ä¶
(Ps: hope friends ok recovering swiftly)   problem. 

The vaccines work good think family friends still refuse get vaccinated selfish ridiculous. I'm annoyed them.

I still wish death them. mean, seriously, hell, people? We've got better demonizing wishing pain suffering ppl. Literally acceptable case. Calm down. okay. much sensational news everyone stressed out. guys asking measures authoritarian inevitably lead widespread violence I‚Äôll even madder leads new vaxx resistant variant exhausting think 33% around fellow citizen... still thinking person know greater goal here. celebrities people look to. everyone admired Elvis heyday, we've fragmented point need Trump/Tucker Carlson/etc endorse vaccine devotees consider getting en masse. current variant came India get lot comforting believe anti-vaxxers you.  That‚Äôs probably 70% 65+ vaccinated Missouri anti-vaxx demographic. White, conservative, Christian. Hopefully natural selection thing.

I‚Äôm South Carolina I‚Äôm basically surrounded see dumbest things posted social media . hometown 33% vaccinated. I‚Äôve run empathy. get fucking deserve test positive COVID sound fun That‚Äôs true didn‚Äôt work far many examples (Singapore, Australia, NZ, Taiwan name countries 0-1 daily cases May 2021). makes feel better, sure. I‚Äôm gonna treat. (Eye roll) several layers defense antibodies infantry cells like reqruitment offices (that help instruct create fast lot infantry).

In case invasion, might enough infantry hold invasion requirement offices would help create infantry defened you.

To safe side, might get booster shot like new batch highly trained fed special forces arrive soon. 

In Israel started booster shoots, booster shoots unique covid exist vaccines too. National Review may conservative, it‚Äôs generally sound journalism well-written. tried last year work. weaker variant. Eradication option.

Unfortunately way die lower levels spread enough population immunity. large portion people get vaccinated, way happens infected, whether later. really hate put way seems situation. 

I hope people decide get vaccinated, Delta need 90% immunized going happen vaccines alone, least US. result making pandemic partisan issue. death toll reach one million said done? think seems possible now. Yep, country struggling due lack supply. believe Australia basically bottom OECD vaccination rates. goal post become dying??

I wanted state frustration. fear me! :) others, thousands models.

The CDC report clearly states breakthrough cases easily pass virus Unvaccinated. CDC still maintains breakthrough cases rare. 

Besides, reality situation is, actual real world application masks little affect let‚Äôs face it, social gathering situation, humans take masks. example, entering bar, club, restaurant, movie theater. 

Anyone find latest model supports opinion. let‚Äôs start really looking reality situation. Stop giving Singapore example. lot people fuming high restrictions even though vaccination numbers quite high. Mental health/morale city time low, politicians praise setting rules 1) disliked young population 2) hypocrites.

Go take look r/Singapore see sentiment I'm sorry, bud. That's rough. nurses extra tired. bitter, hurting. true. FULLY vaccinated people, requirement baiscally means would needed get first shot somehwere June.

I German wanted get vaccinated found appointement area July. (Kreisimpfzentrum, also used service websites find doctor's offices available vaccines).

NOW tons vaccines available everywhere look, definitely wasnt case back June. logical explanation. country become divided know still functional. sure wish historical examples vaccines effectively managing reducing spread disease...like even one ! /s difference vaccines measures like mask vaccines give immunity, mask physical barrier nothing take off. tool actually gives us immunity ‚Äúisn‚Äôt enough‚Äù, we‚Äôll, I‚Äôm going give up. whole point mask 2020 buy time.  street venders start selling body bags. shots jobs ,,wear mask ,, show proof shots ,, cant travel passport . busses ,planes trains. lock every one . protect kids dumb ass. child still young vaccinated.

1. ""my"" obesity affect Jeff's health way? think liking heavy someone actually affects people's physical health.

2. several people said, effort thing. several factors contribute person healthy weight/health general. Medical conditions, medications general, genetics, yes, even valid point people lazy. means everyone overweight lazy.

As examples points:

Medical conditions:

Hypothyroidism causes weight gain. Sometimes thyroid want work right. amount increased walking outside without forks going fix that. fix thyroid going medical specialist.

Aging general contribute weight gain. Unless access fountain youth, can't go walkies reverse that.

Stress causes weight gain. going pretend past 2-5 years stressful general population, I'm surprised internet rock live under.

Medications:

Antidepressants. Antidiabetic meds. Allergy meds. Epilepsy meds. cause weight gain.

Genetics:

I feel self explanatory, can't really change genetics. people genetically heavy set. Simple that. eat exercise everything right, body literally designed going override that. 

Let's return main argument, laziness food choices. Poor food choices contribute overweight. choices always choices people. Healthy food expensive. Unhealthy food give body adequate energy. energy lowers likelihood exercising, especially healthy effective way. combination likely afford unhealthy, premade food filled much sugar sodium, physical energy exercise enough work extra calories macronutrients leads unhealthy lifestyle. really going pretend eat own, home grown produce farmed proteins without anything doctor up? assume go grocery store like rest us. Look food label see much quality food takes go daily recommendation. 

To hone specific issue obesity: yes, agree, healthy obese. 2 classes obesity I'm aware of, obese morbidly obese. United States falls former, latter usually sensationalized TLC. know else falls latter category, based BMI, also I'm assuming going of? Body builders. look obese, yet numbers are. Wouldn‚Äôt better cut unnecessary bits vaccines ever developed?

Getting Delta apparently booster shot. Weird strategy, hope works. don‚Äôt know Democrats ones harming children - duhhh  think lockdowns happen august? Probably not. anything try reduce spread certain group people would claim rights infringed upon. one 4.6k chance winning lottery, call great odds.

But this, somehow nothing. boss went Florida weekend, that's great. can't wait sit four feet eachother two days. Advent hospitalized COVID right time goverment learned lesson. also enact draft time around soldiers deploy multiple times. states applied Feds funds, Feds given some. great news. 2 people ended hospital nobody died.  Covid test free US Spread vaccinated individuals? get sick too? keep spreading it, allowing continue mutate spread more? Great idea. 

Vaccines mandatory, yes. stop spread, pandemic end, vaccines alone accomplish that.   Good them! Sad ""loved ones"" though. would amazing, going hold breath. :P Completely agree crappy CDC messaging. 

Re first statement, always exact MO anti-vaxxers. depend majority population vaccinated protect (and course children) preventable diseases. idiots greater numbers would regular outbreaks measles, whooping cough, rubella, mumps, polio, chickenpox, diphtheria. eventually going need new vaccine prevents people spreading virus? (for can't get vaccinated due health concerns)? thinking somehow herd immunity? Masking end world obviously can't expected wear forever I'm assuming. already belonged damn nursing home. phrasing makes sound like sent random sick old people nursing homes. else supposed go? Hotels? street? hospitals space people desperate need hospital care. someone nursing home probably going dead within year two anyway

Yeah, sure sounds like care them. government program help rent, ERAP, effective all, one reasons many people need even know it!  see lot political happen now. However, get 200k cases day rising death toll? knows. going much higher barrier lock due fatigue politics out. Ran bunch errands dined today liberal city 70% vaccination rate, also new CDC infection threshold recommends masks. 

Mostly everyone wearing masks inside fine. really dreading it, good. Looking UK numbers vs USA numbers I'm hoping we're month behind we'll see peak strong decline end August. 

Unfortunately, school starts September mass majority kids can't get shots yet. 

Going interesting fall semester. feel bad kids parents. you‚Äôre vaccinated lying bolster credibility, you‚Äôre lying yourself, me. 

Plus, comparison invalide simply differences two things compared. think it‚Äôs largely internet. Back then, anyone anti-vaxx would small isolated group. social media, disinformation websites like InfoWars posturing news, 4Chan dark web, Reddit, Facebook. People got info newspapers, radio doctors. couldn‚Äôt tag friends links conspiracy videos instantly, write call explain. bots.

Makes think Welcome Internet Bo Burnham. are. life ends freedom begins, that's phrase goes, right? Oh see comment first commented basically thing. Yes thank pointing bad math. incredibly prevalent days. Ugh. one thing ""mask mandate"" complaining ""overreach"" overreach different way... Canada already 80% population aged 12 years ( 18 like uk ) one dose reach 70% two climbing fast time finite people lost year half normal life. They‚Äôll never get back. would large benefits less severe policy choice. 

It‚Äôs genuinely debatable point whether would better accept level cases deaths. think that‚Äôs shown many countries didn‚Äôt take zero Covid approach. Singapore, example, 76% population received least one dose 57% received two doses mRNA vaccines. However, masks mandates still HEAVILY enforced restaurants remain closed exactly well known SARS-Cov-2 spread among vaccinated. 
 
This Biden's ""mission accomplished"" moment. 
 
It seems Americans, lacking good understanding vaccines work, locked two equality bad extremes: One side thinks vaccines contains tracking chips alter one's DNA. side thinks vaccines sort anti-COVID personal forcefield receive two doses, invulnerable virus, masks mandates social distancing immediately discarded, even less 90% total population fully vaccinated yet. uncle got polio shortly vaccine became available country. He's done well enough it, always first beg nephews neises child vaccinated suffer way did. got covid shot second eligible. Color. sides mid nostril. Self administered. sure PCR Hawaii accepts entrance. Well, know say broken clocks‚Ä¶. blame grant money Sigh I'm fixing beat shit best friend BC keeps pissing career field spouting random pseudoscientific bullshit.
If listen assholes one time, gonna need new countertops. pfizer moderna made current variant specific vaccination begin testing month chance version covid come around makes current vaccines useless realistic possibilty, according SAGE part UK gov consults (see: Scenario two: variant evades current vaccines 

&amp;#x200B;

Right though vaccines allowed used US show robust protection. long enough timeline, especially COVID becomes endemic happens yearly, yes would need new formulations vaccine. that's far consideration. US never likely never lockdowns.   Nope.

You don‚Äôt like facts don‚Äôt go way.

You understanding vaccines work and, based false understanding, come false conclusions.

Vaccines don‚Äôt prevent catching diseases never have.

They lower contagiousness keep symptoms mild. think narrative vaccines work, 25% global population vaccinated, country 70-80% needed herd immunity, vaccine children pretending pandemic fantasy. 100% correct. People lost year half semblance normal life. think it‚Äôs debatable whether best way versus accepting level cases deaths. really think eliminate COVID planet point? It‚Äôs endemic - vaccines extremely effective preventing severe illness.

What end game you‚Äôre suggesting everyone 2 vaccinated? needed read right go bed‚Ä¶ probably 2024 republican front runner instead. base won‚Äôt care. going contact Prairie North find out. I'm already vaccinated. think comparison bad faith overblown. percentage people vaccinated UK though. It‚Äôs going kill many people higher vaccinated states US, could awful states like Mississippi, Idaho Alabama. know unintended consequences preventing ever getting coronavirus? role overall good health? always kind thought important catch colds every give immune system something (I know sounds dumb way off?) vaccines all, one might think twice on. mean sarcastic dickhead want actually start feeling results type thing, tone suddenly change. Yes 3. regardless, jobs employment. quit let go reason race war take last summer, they're trying new approach. That‚Äôs weird months ago, also could predicted wouldn‚Äôt spikes anymore since readily available vaccine that‚Äôs free public. Instead, yeah, going go spikes. Yeah, I‚Äôm angry, people ‚Äúlearnt‚Äù nothing, dear chap, people seem care keeps happening it‚Äôs fully preventable. Yes, yes, completely strawman said. Maybe need divide two countries? beliefs divided. would love opportunity. don‚Äôt, seems civil war inevitable given many want tell many others do. don‚Äôt want pushed around push back point. part inevitable. production/manufacturing part approval process. also evaluated. vaccinations keeping people hospitals. Smallpox polio endemic whole world causing many deaths successful vaccination program. don‚Äôt know exactly commentor is. please fill in? MSM seems like pretty common term use team blue, team red, everyone else too. yep, annual Sturgis event coming soon covid super spreader event like last year.  completely new pandemic moment! Best everyone stays home forever doesn‚Äôt happen! testing gone way we're really seeing hospitalization data.

Massachusetts massive cluster like 75% people vaccinated.

The vaccine really effective stopping spread delta variant, good preventing need hospitalization.

You still easily get get it, mutate body.

People need masking still. Still getting it.  :-) Yes, type people give shit fellow man. fully vaccinated, still wear mask public children even know. concept! Due pandemic attendant risk infection. Japan pre-pandemic, people wearing masks around everywhere simply they're Japan. Honestly either way fine. wanted make sure reading right :)  anything happen, 17 thus particularly susceptible catching Covid-19. According CDC, twice likely die pneumonia, comparison. fret it. never recommended total isolation, sure got projected from. still go frequently socialize would encourage others same. Nah. red stickers Zionists. Like look response Ben &amp; Jerry's thing. Team Red getting bent shape trying punish company. Dems Republicans definitely worse. really understand politicians damned eager fellate Israel.  bound turn vaccines point - always turn scientific movements greater good set motion government. don‚Äôt Israel data. analysis released data. analysis Israel inconsistent DATA 4 countries. Yes, vaccine less effective catching delta variant covid 19 it‚Äôs bad (likely) p-hacking subgroup analysis Israel. Endemic means localized FYI. Delta pandemic. India Brazil seeing higher daily cases UK, seeing numbers decrease steadily. Texas seeing higher rate spread currently Florida, means currently less cases, trends continue Texas see cases Florida soon.

The whole point you‚Äôre missing there‚Äôs almost 0 way say variant concern \*likely\* develop here. Imagine thinking information team trump haters trying tie Russia 3 years. friend whose father can't get vaccine due health condition gets vaccine kill according doctors. stage 4 cancer chemo treatment. Lol find amusing thread. Vaccinated people scrape goat unvaccinated people problems having, know vaccinated people still get spread virus, vaccinated people aren‚Äôt cautious. Obviously would great everyone fully vaccinated, people see vaccinated acting even irresponsibly lot times unvaccinated people I‚Äôve seen. Can‚Äôt imagine thinking ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù return day soon sides acting like idiots. need wear mask? Furthermore, wearing mask back normal. able see facial expressions hear people properly severely stints conversation. enjoy normal conversations people I‚Äôm antisocial like people sub. also find incredibly uncomfortable especially summer. need masks people die COVID free (not vaxxed). Nobody wore masks regular flu season, people die flu. fact matter peak January 3,000 people day dying. 7 day rolling average US 350, vast majority unvaccinated. gladly wore one January someone vaccinated unnecessary. Also, pretending wearing mask somehow completely stop transmission plain silly. It‚Äôs theater point, especially walk restaurant mask take eat hour. Like really think anything??? Fair enough.

But I‚Äôm democratic socialist; don‚Äôt belong here, lol. children cite god illegals woes potential salvation? son 11, gladly wears mask like supposed to, ready get vaccine turns 12.

Sure terrifying children young get risk. terrifying people willing infect ignorance. literally reason lockdowns/mask mandates. beginning! 

I've accepted even ""good"" people fucking idiots. forget already? mostly use account jokes pandemics lasted generations though. Go read papers vaccines. meant prevent serious illness. virus spreads causes ‚Äúcold like symptoms‚Äù among vaccinated people, CDC saying now, absolutely effective vaccine resistant.

If want ‚Äòfollow science‚Äô, *actually* follow science. keep telling unvaccinated die? will.  really. youre vaccinated free want. like, go wherever want freely vs cant so... really.. Normalcy word!! normality. hate that. Sure, could admit made mistake. 

OR could edit post make look like crazy person...  problem solved good people getting vaccinated trash getting delta dying 

If wearing mask helps us achieve goal, I‚Äôll part early 2000's checking guy gonna destroy many families, what? stupid job do? 

Sorry negativity studies suggest this. sure getting downvotes really. need data...  Imagine thinking Trump actually won. LOL  Ok either wrote absolute bullshit consigning kid death sentence like ""oh well, nothing do"". fuck wrong you? show us generations holding us back reaching Herd Immunity(and say fully vaccinated Millennial). excuse Gen Z degree(since many still minors, legal guardians let get it), generation unfortunately falling fear vaccines(and I've known even COVID-19). I'm still pretty fucking angry, myself. Approve vaccine safe child usage (7-12 years old), implement punishments unvaccinated, let rest sort out. Mississippi  man doesn‚Äôt want continue disrupting life prevent bunch idiots contracting disease actively want contract. He‚Äôs sociopath!

Get fucking grip.   He's reddit power-user, course problem sharing confident opinion zero understanding.  KN95 Chinese. go N95 (American standard) FFP2/FFP3 (European standard) Variants don‚Äôt make covid deadly dude lol, they‚Äôre going full Greek alphabet them. 

I note didn‚Äôt provide number deaths 0-17 population concerned confidently stating wrong. also takes lot less energy fucking moron run train brakes... Damn right am! I‚Äôm nurse I‚Äôm pregnant I‚Äôm angry fuck. latest ISS report Italy shows 85% reduction hospitalizations 12-39 age bracket, 93% 40-59 bracket 93-95 brackets above

The reduction ICU admissions 97-98%, there's enough data points menaningful 40+ brackets.  I‚Äôm angry. Normalcy sucks! start going back work person. means daily commute reintroduced stressor. It‚Äôs shown people deal heavy traffic stress daily basis generally shorter life expectancy. fuck read 3%? Lol. could seen coming done something it.

Elections consequences. understand feeling unvaccinated people contract virus, likely mutate. KN95 Chinese approved version US approved N95. also means higher chance fake/less efficient masks (at least according studies Europe)

Perhaps mistaking N95s simple surgical masks? don‚Äôt get ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù. Smoking addiction. It‚Äôs rational. It‚Äôs coping mechanism. surprising end lung cancer due smoking, say someone deserves gross. India probably vastly counting actual number cases    scared shot lazy. Either way excuses part problem  think lot unvaccinated people sub, data could little skewed. Making look like breakthrough rate higher is.  vaccines became available, got vaccinated soon could others refused, playing politics believing misinformation, angry.

I angry classified ""critical manufacturing"" go work every day since June 2020, get vax list April, people working home wrangling vax appointments early February.

The idea somebody could get vaccinated chose infuriating. states smokers can‚Äôt charged more

Again, can't say raises price cannot reality. 

As stated, comparing oranges apples fall-out argument. 

Trying defend fake account know topic help you. Thriller2112 fake account spreading false information like topic vaccines covid. trying deflect anything excuse lack understanding compute him. 

Strawman fallacies good argument points. That‚Äôs awful. Yeah, standard care slips hospitalizations spike like this. That‚Äôs real story here. party ‚Äúpersonal responsibility‚Äù doesn‚Äôt want talk happens shared resources become scarce. Unvaccinated people willingly taking risk getting infected. vaccine works vaccinated people worried unvaccinated infecting them?  Trauma... 

Lol ask able eat classroom friend? document medical history school willing provide accommodations.  people living fear masks shots ones staying home? like anything help anyways  inaccurate claim one kill people.

 Firstly pfizer 68% 74% effective preventing infected Delta (depending study), can't spread disease catch objectively completely false claim spread rate whether vaccinated not.

Secondly yet know vaccination reduces transmisbility Delta catch it, early CDC analysis looks pessimistic clear cannot used analysis designed hospital burden also harms others another reason vaccination helps others well yourself. I‚Äôm sorry trash. propaganda machine never real lifetime. polarising, almost like people rather divided talk things through.  bots zombies downvote I‚Äôm ‚Äúselfish‚Äù

If gotten vaccinated complied restrictions last 1.5 years, selfish longer caring whether might become source infection returning ordinary life. people going sacrifice years lives benefit people know. people who'll castigate probably get much lose little continuing live indoors time. exact sentiment. people don‚Äôt give flying fuck care enough basic duty citizen get vaccinated. wear mask protect them? Life cruel mistress it‚Äôs unfair. little time earth people actually care us, I‚Äôm going way protect imbecile strangers don‚Äôt deserve it. *shitshow* must go on

FTFY  breeding ground mutations, I'd honestly say let antivaxxers die. course fucking Florida way. Tell terrible podcast listened fell asleep. real? There‚Äôs good info stickied post, regarding COVID infection anti bodies vs vaccine anti New virus new strain already known virus, make difference treating it? first need collect information learn both.  think virus chooses mutate? That's real interesting world view have, see anti-vaxx. think called people use occasional cheap entertainment like you, people think investment, expecting make money spend it. buck little bit excitement unreasonable long get hooked. hate even suggest this. get covid vaccinated. hook medical bills, go back line emergency beds. know children others might able get vaccine exempt. lost good friend early pandemic. getting bonkers crazy anti-vaxxers. know doctor can't believe dumb people getting vaccine. get vaccine death beds, ask untested plasma treatments worried bill gates fauci putting microchips DNA. LOL WTF Insurance companies already health rebates. Charge everyone (to discriminate unvaccinated) provide rebates getting vaccine. Works okay. know what's really fucked up? want another lockdown stimulus money. They're willing die it. almost certainly level protection us. 

Sort like old folks spared H1N1 due random ass strain 50s

And large extent that‚Äôs matters most. leave homes. Let loved ones watch helplessly gasp air realize depth mistake.

Or not. people nuts.

Either way deserve good taste medicine told ""not problem"" ignored medical advice selfishness. vaccinated people mad? Speak yourself. I'm pissed people selfish ignorant comes protecting people. point virus could mutate vaccines pointless. what, fight shit own? LMFAO y'all would died modern medicine. 

I coworker isnt vaccinated, take trip across country towards florida. mentality that, havent gotten virus yet, then, probably wont end getting all. 

How selfish would contract covid, come back, shut us down, miss work pay? wanted go trip? make enough get bills paid, can't afford that. 

There going back normalcy. Shit hit fan us united states. need stop selfish deal issues covid amplified uncovered country take responsibility grow become stronger, unified nation. 12k died vaccine US alone. new cases already fully dosed people. Masks work like fauci said. said trump would face surprise pandemic, literally look shit up, hey let's keep pretending amirite?.... Get ready lockdown 2.0 fall forget get new booster we'll get back normal lol.  huge # 18 &amp; people. assholes let eligible kids get vaccinated sure let get covid. I‚Äôm angry I‚Äôm forced wear mask again. didn‚Äôt want get vaccinated life could go back normal. feels like things never go back normal milked politically till next election.  I'm bit bitter asshole, honestly I'd check vaccine cards door. proof poke? Tough shit, go home.
If got covid shot need immediate care, never made effort protect yourself, worth anyone's time effort. I'm angry non vaccinated. I'm angry cheaters, know vaccinated enter events stores without mask, pretending ""fully vaccinated"". know spreading virus, care. now, variant-D much aggressive! need masked again. could unite show world great America truly is. first eradicate disease times got tough put differences aside listened world-class experts. sister spent 18 hours waiting get seen Tampa something one able figure debilitating her. She‚Äôs ended hospital twice last two weeks. 

She‚Äôs getting answers. basic blood tests test ‚Äúother things‚Äù comes back negative sent home. 

It‚Äôs scary. really mad vaccine work Delta It‚Äôs left trapped house, stuck thoughts time, can‚Äôt get help problems I‚Äôve thought about. Good points, important point coming right vaccinated people apparently becoming ""covid cases"" rates greatly different unvaccinated. 

I'm sure case (but may be). Variants lack data make difficult tell. 

In UK, around 75% adults least one dose, around half infections people least one dose. would suggest half cases coming 75% least one dose, half 25% none (i.e. three times infection rate). 

It interesting see happens get second dose time take effect. would expect (hope!) difference infection rate becomes even wider. performer. livelihood dependent able live shows. refusal vaccinate affecting me, friends, entire industry. I‚Äôm selfish point angry, yes, fucking selfish angry. Fuck people don‚Äôt give shit others. ‚Äúchoice get vaccine‚Äù affects everyone differently, us go back working home masking grocery store like that‚Äôs biggest inconvenience. I‚Äôll wear mask me, clearly don‚Äôt care live, die, make rent, starve. human, empathy endless well. I‚Äôll save people might show towards me. cant embrace natural selection? I'm mad, excited actually, population withstand culling slower thinkers.  Covid death rate 3% US population reasonable say Covid's death rate 1.5% given half population vaccinated? (let's pretend age matter Covid death rate much less given vaccinated people older folks likely risk).   

So care get vaccinated not? slight chance dying effect you. can't go back normal, insist wanting everyone vaccinated safe?  

Are going ban fast food? High fructose? High sugar? Opioids? eating? killers well much larger scale. care I'm morbidly obese risk death care get infected Covid?   

I know obvious answer ""you create new variant"" think it. variants world. Meaning unless 100% world population vaccinated vaccine effective 100%, variants always thing.  

So vaccinated choose unvaccinated, stopping us going back normal?  would suggest encouraging go hospital. Politics getting everyone‚Äôs way.  Ditto. used to. Never get angry, people treat covid livid 24/7.

I used belief gave people needed survive, humanity natural thrive natural goodness shine through. Everyone great potential good times strife band together. 

Now see privileged among us, nothing mitigate damage, trauma deaths focus me. Me. Me.

They take lives last year, took entire spiritual system.  didn‚Äôt fall it. letting people hook someone blatantly lied them? know better. downvote I'm fucking done. Cutting ties idiots refuse vaccine cause iMmUnE sYsTeM. Fuck conversations idiots. Condoms good analogy, though I'm sure agree going.

I would make point N95 masks like latex condoms. 

Surgical cloth masks like sheepskin condoms, old technology gradually discredited provide good protection microorganisms.

Thanks giving us another useful tool debate! üòÄ Worth noting experts dead wrong UK (by like factor 10x) COVID took expected nosedive

It could ripping unvaccinated far faster think.  Research shows vaxxed transmit Delta asymptomatically. unvaccinated. 

We need everyone getting vaxxed also using masks distancing possible. regulations consistently across board. thing evolve faster approve vaccines it. Thanks, reported tweet @WHO

‚ÄúPreliminary investigations conducted Chinese authorities found clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel #coronavirus (2019-nCoV) identified #Wuhan, work industry may able shed little light this. 

When company submits full approval (in case Biologics License Application, BLA) submit rough equivalent UPS truck full data (clinical trial data, investigations, manufacturing, etc.). Every single piece data thoroughly reviewed fine-toothed-comb FDA. FDA send back response pharmaceutical company asking clarity, additional data, additional batches, etc. whole process normally takes couple years!! Luckily, FDA working Pfizer whole time concomitantly reviewing data comes through; wouldn‚Äôt surprised FDA little trailer set outside Pfizer right purpose. slippery slope peoples. trying open eyes stuff like ends up. kind evil way thinking. one hell cold Christmas year, outside, glass family. mom got infected days Christmas quarantined. moved garage house. already ""waiting vaccine"" flair. means getting again, shots remain effective.

If push past 70% mark, hopefully get closer putting rest.

Wishful thinking know. agree mostly. Half people won‚Äôt change mind loved ones vents. tech support world, patience idiot users wearing thin, common saying ""remember - people job security"". Maybe it'll help you. Thanos could snap half existence! Make pre-requisite travel, school government services/programs watch fast people get vaccinated. article read said done part protect sick people covid patients. Even you‚Äôre vaccinated, imagine fighting covid infection dealing heart attack something isn‚Äôt ideal. I‚Äôm sure. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôd like know about. public building since last Thursday sucks, try protect kids. Everything delivered Amazon takeout. country fucked. divide us gets wider wider year politicians nothing except undo previous regime's policies. even like pure north-south divide; suburban-rural divide. shit runs deep never improve world partisan two-party politics, internet disinformation. US return lockdown neither support public support financially federal government. Basically would happen even states tried order lockdown Wasnt point vaccin keep people hospital, prevent people getting covid? long people end hospital anymore consider vaccin success. Wow smart. CEO losing patience I'm pretty sure ""get vaccine fired"" weeks away. I'm it. might short staffed fuck I'd rather short staffed dead. talking MD sister, depends call asymptomatic. symptoms whatsoever? Probably not. runny nose slight cough? Yes. hope refuse medical care.

Why, hope best? Careful may blessed. Idk agree. would think best way deal things head tiptoe around protect feelings overly sensitive scared GQPers. don‚Äôt right thing appease them, weakening position even giving people opportunity question serious you‚Äôre taking precautions required. really think you‚Äôre one backwards. science based approach optimal public health take that. Rather bending everything work better people comply anything anyways. happened, CNBC. Accept Yeah, it‚Äôs damn fault can‚Äôt nice things, go wade around sea stupid need try limit viral load I‚Äôm exposed. It‚Äôs rare hospitalized Covid, vaccinated person, I‚Äôve read. However, family member works ED Connecticut intubate 2 vaccinated people. One 70 yrs old alcoholic.  That‚Äôs conservative behavior it? Thing is, many states already surpassed number new cases per day back winter, still rising.  

And peak hospitalization death rates lag peak new cases ***by three four weeks***. So, strap in, folks. Thank you. I‚Äôm tired excuse made ignores a) people choosing seek bad information b) people fallen victim it. We‚Äôre fucking adults. could avoid misinformation boogeyman I‚Äôm going hold others standard don‚Äôt impacts me. Vaccination rates increased 30% since July 20. think high school level biology completely necessary though, nobody understand science impacts lives; climate, viruses, asteroids etc. Critical interpretation good information Vs bad information important. People beleive everything read Facebook huge problem. flip side people, like many here, refuse read beleive anything media 'scare mongering' even simply reporting findings legitimate experts. 

I think media literacy something desperately needs introduced schools. Distinguising good sources bas sources, legitimate experts frauds, idea scientific consensus Vs lone voices, even good science bad science. much information fingertips decades ago, lot people know that. want ""right"". want lockdowns, want say ""I told so"". want celebrated never leaving room. want think superior. want kids go school since crappy experiences school young. 

They want fear, comfortable them. country needs reckoning sides: care throughout entire pandemic, trapped caring way much, without way also pool, statistically likely kill kid. fill in, too? live UK barely explain UK. People ain't caring much anymore. yes, vaccinated incredibly unlikely develop severe symptoms even infected.  covid never particularly dangerous kids.   tiny amount immunosuppressed always existed world.  shut society forced restrictions everyone solely benefit before. now? know, RN maybe pointing help. Microchips size grain rice, maybe encouraging look syringe help realize there's microchips there. masks aren‚Äôt molded like N95, also try bracket brace fits underneath mask helps keep mouth. ones I‚Äôve tried helpful. talk breathe lot easier. soft food grade silicone plastic lightweight affordable. even wash lot dishwasher. Check around inter web. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Delta variant means getting heard immunity, closer.

I also hard time imagining thinks vaccine hoax government insert chips citizen keep believing moon landing fake change mind delta variant. Science also showing previous infection gives good immunity protection/antibodies (the covid19 sub numerous papers posted), many people choosing wait awhile infection getting vaccinated. Yet they‚Äôre also vilified ‚Äúnut job anti vaxxers.‚Äù 

It‚Äôs fucking tiring. fair, Delta emerged multiple times places vaccine. claim reasonable calling correct title example fear mongering. yeah here's equivalence: united states vaccines widely available adults 4 months, 80% Australia's population currently living lockdown That's horrific. way change that? Well said. variants COVID around forever need update expectations around get back life. 

Some people seem think long COVID risk wear masks, distance, etc. That‚Äôs viable long term plan because, say, keep happening. 

Masks need done. mandate vaccine. evolves spike protein, coronavirus  always correct get things wrong. delete comment either. way, article found 2019, proposing fine anto-vax parents wh9 vaccinate kids measles. point masking *won‚Äôt* save lives. best slightly *delay* loss life. Whatever mitigations temporarily put place, lifted virus spread unbounded among don‚Äôt immunity. endgame herd immunity endemic presence (we likely heading latter), mitigations *not* change trajectory *not* reduce fraction population ultimately gets COVID. solution vaccination, U.S. bottleneck front time. Nobody getting way besides government. Live life normally vaccinated. fear mongering needs stop. Going lockdown mask mandates point ridiculous deaths dramatically. Deaths hitting 3,000 day January, 7 day rolling average deaths US hovering around 350. people unvaccinated. vaccinated, die COVID likelihood. Stop letting media government control lives longer. misunderstand, I'm talking reinfections, I'm talking number cases hence likelihood encountering Delta. Prevalence nothing whether vaccinated not, that's effectiveness deals with. say half protection gone, talking personal protection vaccine offers, vaccines still work, least talking protection death. Rather, mean decrease prevalence caused vaccines protected us (and even unvaccinated) similar amount vaccines do, part protection erased. 

I'm also talking US specifically. Around April 15th, 70,000 cases daily US. June 20th, 11,000 cases, would argue decrease beginning hit herd immunity Alpha, though epidemiologist personal belief. Today back 70,000 cases. words, COVID prevalent today started vaccinating, benefits gained herd immunity gone. still needed? vaccinated, body antibodies protect infection. already recovered Covid, body also antibodies protect subsequent infection. What's difference?

Is suggestion vaccine induced antibodies somehow superior produced body response infection? many damaged long term?  Oh no. fully vaccinated issues vaccine believe corrupt, witholding facts forthcoming seriousness start, knowing full well certain..

He also professionally affliated/funding exact lab allegations state entire thing originated from.. think position power trust man.

Also sidenote, read news aggregation sites understand importance sourcing unbiased media mate. also Australian care less Fox news propaganda outlets there, ya toss bag. like conservative politicians (Aiwanger) Germany mandatory vaccinations, state say body. exact politicians reintroduction mandatory military service... No, 330 billion... 

But, would much less that... Remove kids, anti vaxxers, people qualify income limitations. fully vaccinated rate 59%. call high number Delta, likely requires minimum 85% reach herd immunity. Baseball, football, basketball stadiums full capacity, plus gatherings. week feeling there's going big wake-up call, especially rate numbers going now. Fauci also told us 2020 didn‚Äôt need wear masks yet pretty much erased decreases prevalence gained herd immunity, half protection vaccines already gone prevalence back high.

What evidence that? percentage Delta infections reinfections? whta percentage reinfections serious original infections? Except many conservatives want money ""government handout""  anti-vaxx/anti-mask GOP safe thier health insurance ACA

""Ironic""-Palpatine Worst case scenario nothing, least ain't gonna buy toilet paper grocery store while. Jesus Christ fucking moron think like fucking plague. Holy fucking hell dude. Brought letter R nothing wrong, everyone responding using form worldview. see replies. unvaccinated people ""give.way"" variants?
The vaccine prevent transmission. would nonvaccinated people create vaccine resistant strains? viruses encountering vaccine resist. anything vaccinated create vaccine resistant variants vaccines fucking prevent transmission virus

So please explain me.how anyone else getting getting would.effect way Get N95 can. frustrated airlines aren‚Äôt banning unvaccinated flying, taking public transportation. That‚Äôs one policy needs implemented immediately opinion. ship sailed long ago üö¢ USFL documentary couple years it, fresh mind masking well.

Covid seems fit wide geographic area (such multiple countries continents) typically affecting significant proportion I'm anxious ""open economy!"" I'm anxious everyone right thing sustained period time earn - there's big difference. Articles like fully motivated around ""we need get purchasing gasoline, seeing movies theaters drinking Starbucks everyday again!!!"" angle.

We keep anti-vaxx cowards much safety bubble. can't see harsh reality insulate worst impacts COVID. Unfortunately little developed sense empathy anything touched lives specifically (a.k.a. modern registered republican voter - show nancy regan meme).

There 24 hour news feed, every town, showing local hospital's ICU. sound infection, hospitalization death screen days, every person know ""death gurgle"" sounds someone chocking death inside lungs. Instead commercials, small breaks list local vaccine availability list suspected long term COVID impacts. Might hard sell advertising coke products around programming though huh?

*as runs mouth he's getting vaccine*

You people need way much attention. protecting them. Even vaccinated, still get disease (lower odds, far lower odds symptomatic die), could pass vaccinated people (low odds again, symptomatic deaths), odds that, even low, zero, specially Delta variant. 

But low odds significant wide circulation virus everyone got vaccinated, US countries people US travel to. priority try make vaccines freely available countries soon possible. hate feel way torn masking public work - like wearing mask, actually mind often forgot on. dreading confrontations, anti-maskers anti-vaxxers sneer mock, conversations clients coworkers think hoax. thing mask worn them, protect families can't/won't get damn shots.

A year ago, potential tool coming (vaccines) get us situation lots precautions made sense. now, people won‚Äôt get vaccinated, what‚Äôs end game? pandemic ever end? see 3 possibilities:

1) French style vaccine passports. best idea keeps unvaccinated away us gives huge reason get vaccinated. America unlikely it. 

2) vaccine mutates less dangerous form. cannot certain happen reasonable time frame. 

3) achieve reasonable level herd immunity based people already vaccinated covid, plus small number additional people get vaccinated, plus big number people catch covid. 

3 seems like likely outcome. Since people getting vaccinated, seems we‚Äôre going get decent level herd immunity unvaccinated catching covid. sad many people unnecessarily die. wearing mask isn‚Äôt going make much difference. We‚Äôre far less likely spread covid isn‚Äôt much way pandemic besides folks catching covid anyway. 

Now, 4th possibility finding effective treatment covid. seemed like brink that, I‚Äôd much ok putting restrictions place. 

There light end tunnel comes restrictions. 6 months year ago, light vaccines. What‚Äôs light now? people aren‚Äôt ok signing semi-permanent restrictions chunk population bozos won‚Äôt protect others. Selection pressure. virus enters immune system vaccinated partially vaccinated individuals learns fittest varities passed on. would ecological niche high transmissability virus infect vaxxed unvaxxed alike could run free little competition. immune escape variant would extremely fit evolutionary sense. excuse vax, excuse make sure countries vaccinate well return distancing masking requirements stop spread try get many people possible vaccinated. Turns study bad. Twitter thread one authors explaining error made statistical true, saying ""Democratic"" much easier saying admixture political affiliation, wealth, education results DFW much pro-vaxx üòÖ

I lived right border Highland Park upon time I'd believe they'd get vaccinated. tech small near large grain rice examples include graphene nano chips. Look up. nano tech small enough, saying vax, technology already. number cases among vaccinated wouldn‚Äôt shit rest get vaccinated should. mention ALWAYS going breakthrough cases. It‚Äôs hundred percent effective even original strain. shouldn‚Äôt story media focusing on. large ravaging unvaccinated spilling, bit, vaccinated. needs story. mention even breakthrough cases vaccine absolutely job keeping cases large mild. That‚Äôs huge win. ...I job working education can't give half income literally need live. Please, then, would suggest do? child old enough stay home alone work quit job keep home can't pay rent I'm homeless. What's solution?? really natural selection though... fine continue damage. fully vaccinated. I'm also odd introverted extroverted. 

I definitely miss aspects normalcy like visiting theme parks eating out. 

I definitely miss parties like weddings, 15s, baby showers whatnot, get togethers semi obscure extended family 

Pros cons isolating - Michael Scott Probably caused huuuuuge backlash public day.

I swear government may shit many ways back day least understood sometimes necessary thing let dumbasses cry exhaustion like idiot brats are. Thats issue masks. terribly sensitive gag reflex I‚Äôm literal mouth breather inhale suck mask inhale gag. Found reusable masks seam right place resists mask sucked mouth inhale I‚Äôve golden ever since. may simply afraid, vast majority arrogant selfish people buy misinformation manipulate information see validate refusal help others. I‚Äôm numb. Let fucking spread unvaccinated want play chicken virus. don‚Äôt care anymore. Never said anecdote trusted scientific studies. telling personal story.  That‚Äôs weird months ago, also could predicted wouldn‚Äôt spikes anymore since readily available vaccine that‚Äôs free public. 

No one informed would made prediction, sure effects would be. I'm sure uninformed people like made lots fantastic predictions come anywhere close true. Much like post.

Aren't tired wrong make new enemies scapegoat bizarre theories explain all?  constantly import them, so-called tourists Maybe selection bias, hits family hard, multiple people die. times eventually recover. Feels like there's genetic component explains severe one reacts covid? I‚Äôm sarcastic. I‚Äôm really sorry trash. corona king attention, one retired viruses. think truth Yes covid end. One 3 things happen. 

1. virus mutates less severe still endemic longer concern.

2. Enough people die become seriously ill either antivaxxers start willingly vaxxing government mandates it.

3. Stupid gonna stupid. Eventually vaccines available worldwide want either die end level natural immunity.


In meantime move towards one scenarios, people world going continue dying large numbers due unavailability vaccines unwillingness take available vaccines.  I'm mistaken, full phase 'safety' trial only..... too. Fox News wonder oldest still young school - least Ohio don‚Äôt send kids school notify homeschool 6. kid turns 6 mid year don‚Äôt tell state send school year. was. proved false, based best understanding disease‚Äôs spread time. don‚Äôt expert experts infallible. expect revise recommendations understanding improves, done. vaccines cause blood.clots, enlarged hearts deaths everyone seems keen mandating even though prevent transmission all, reasoning completely fucked.
So maybe concerns misaligned.  One theory read UK, substantiated hasten stress, people deleting NHS app get pings, reporting positive test results, want jeopardize summer travel plans!

Hopefully turn explanation.

It seem strange UK would suddenly start going everyone else going up.  Labeling everyone doesn‚Äôt agree feature circlejerk  You‚Äôre better person I. started masking again, piiiiiiiiiiissed. Yeah fucking hate people actually clueless this, meant actually puzzle. Egg. answer egg, never anything else. It‚Äôs game chance yes? statistically better chance getting last year did, lot people loose w covid didn‚Äôt get cause previous variants, infectious, wasn‚Äôt bad delta. comment seems pretty dismissive. Thanks going out! Musicians need people attitude. Last year brutal industry. feels way good back playing lock back down. far tell, unlikely variant could emerge would defeat existing future vaccines. 

The problem, yet solved, getting enough vaccines manufactured, getting people vaxxed.

I using dashboard numbers total 3,839,816,037 vaccine doses administered

If assume, 1/3 first dose only, 2/3 doses, suggests ~2,559,877,358 individuals least one dose. roughly speaking, including 12 y/o, ~32.4% global population. long way go reach point vaccines shielding us COVID-19. Even win war, battles would lost. It‚Äôs perplexing allying virus fight war humans first place. Yeah, already vaccine-resistant strain - Delta. Anyone following Israeli data CDC data like Massachusetts outbreak seen coming. 

The good news least still almost certainly keep hospital (particularly you‚Äôre younger).

The bad news given Delta‚Äôs high rate spread lowered efficacy vaccine symptomatic infection (particularly six month mark defence changes antibodies memory cells), there‚Äôs good chance full vaxxed people still get COVID point go back normal. comes time consequences actions fall you. vaccine, get like millions us did, following best society. made choice let suffer it. empathy refuse give it. situation right ‚Äòguns‚Äô vaccines yes everyone needs one Perfectly said.
COVID quickly transmitted, visible, care race/age/gender etc victims-so easier focus virus rather society. RESPONSE ro different anything else: white supremacy, unchecked capitalism, patriarchy running show. Nah. People make decisions. Nobodies mad anyone. Everyone's trying make mentally physically. Stop trying stir pot. know Social Security benefits inheritable right? they'll get $250 death benefit cover ambulance ride dead body. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è state locked down, income would risk too.

That's tough part Florida. needs lot tourists. spreading evenly bar shutdown months got financially hammered. thought possibly shut *again* selfish fucks going make absolutely rage. mad? stop transmission, personal prophylactic personally vaccinated personally protected nothing upset old one home depot. around years. buy brand new K(N)95 try again. read, mask protect normal (cloth/medical disposable) mask. Went grocery store today. Big sign said, ‚ÄúMasks optional all.‚Äù Yet cashier chin mask on. Dude! take mask off! can‚Äôt comfortable it‚Äôs literally anything! Crossfire? Maybe, maybe, better person show respect, even deserve it. 

By asshole back perpetuating cycle animosity hatred. mean guy lost money running casinos? put charge economy? Cool fuck em Yes, data added retroactively. note state dashboard explains need look post several weeks see trend.

MO death counts based death certificates, prepared funeral directors. added death counts *date death*. means numbers people died yesterday could keep going couple weeks death certificates trickle in.

This disappointing lot people watch numbers deaths without understanding lag, I've seen lot people saying hospitals lying.

Incidentally, MO case numbers similar lag results come labs, usually numbers stabilize four days so.

Upshot is, look state numbers focus last days, things look lot better reality.  justify killing people something else kills people. shit makes absolutely sense, ever tell feel justified huge bag. effect since vax can't prevent transmission? Please explain Empathy two-way street. empathy people empathize others. Anti-vaxxers demonstrate fundamental lack empathy others. Honestly there's know way know sure happens. scientists believe bc vaccine targets spike protein. virus mutates spike protein mutates much, may able infect us. eventually beats current vaccines, may happen awhile. I'd stock n95s get p100 half face respirator. Whish well! I'm sorry kid old enough, understand gotta 12 (at least area southern USA). tested vaccine younger kids? Hopefully bring anything back. Unverified anecdotes person Reddit scientific studies making sense. vaccine protect anyone besides one taking can't prevent transmission Yes. Parents FIRST teacher. Cause it‚Äôs KID!  think big cities figured budget distance learning high risk kiddos, might something look city address use (like grandma, aunt/uncle, etc) Keep eye Israel. They've begun dose 3 qualify.... long covid still thing, even mild infections 15% death claim slide 4 CDC's slide deck linked.

70% till herd immunity
Oops, meant 80%
My bad, say 80%, meant 90%.

(Got first shot Friday mulling long) 
Still disagree half ‚Äúvaccinated‚Äù saying.  still political pressure, though? good thing sucks live decline. know outlier data? 

Certainly jive data coming places like Virginia (which would support assertion), concentration people?   sent reply also Twitter stuff, sending articles got direct answer true.I send articles read send direct answer, language clear experts experts make way accurate comments ask mutations send lot articles contain direct answer like ""we observed biggest drop E484 mutations"" sometimes better hear experts know background Keep scrolling reading nailed it. wife healthcare professional I‚Äôm scientist runs research lab university, still failed convince MIL get vaccine. even offered pay her. effectiveness anti-vaccine propaganda stunning. anything, justifies people‚Äôs bloodlust comment thread. they‚Äôre going selfish least clock taking precious hospital beds people actually deserve them. wouldn‚Äôt wish death upon anyone it‚Äôs someone needs cancer treatment? Byeeeee That's going happen. Biology work like that.  Cuz fuckers refusing free vaccine people get inoculated go elementary middle high school college went college. Susceptible people believing lies great impact rest us even pass new laws forcibly vaccinate people done. saying certain regions ‚Äúhigher chance‚Äù due higher spread, ‚Äúhigher chance‚Äù mean regions ‚Äúmore likely.‚Äù

Give head shake admit trying save face. don‚Äôt. case - wrote idiocy. mortality rate, high hospitalization rate certain age weight group. You‚Äôre using new thriving job market desperate employees potentially increasing pay benefits means fill roles negative? looks like Pfizer BioNTech developing booster shot specifically meant target Delta strain. know much actually Afraid microchip tracking, yet probably carries smart phone everywhere.

Too many RNs thinking they‚Äôre medical experts. Look, RNs absolutely vital. However, comparing microbiologists like Jiffy Lube technician talking automotive engineering. surprised vaccinated people getting cases? Even delta, there‚Äôs still 5-7 percent people would breakthrough. That‚Äôs lot fucking people. media narrative focusing instead ravaging unvaccinated telling wrong story bolstering vaccine resistance instead needs happening. Vaccinated cases mean vaccines working. all. vaccines much work hoped would. part almost year half. done social distancing living life pause. 

TIL ""doing part"" time limit, apparently 18 months, free sociopath consequences.

Cool! keeping home option, would highly suggest ordering KN95s wear class. They're comfortable N95 better rate blocking particles medical mask. find anymore difficult breath cloth mask double medical mask. god damn right It‚Äôs pretty much split middle point. one side, Anti-Vaxxers refusing vaccine purpose make Joe Biden look bad. side, Anti-Vaxxers that‚Äôs going ‚ÄúI already got Covid, I‚Äôll let Antibodies take care rest,‚Äù knowing that‚Äôs bullshit antibodies mostly nothing.

Simply put, we‚Äôre fucked. problem isn‚Äôt vaccinated people getting too, it‚Äôs actually spread - potentially without knowing. Without additional precautions social distancing masking spread could disproportionately impact people weak immune systems can‚Äôt get vaccinate (like kids) think safe around vaccinated people. bounced around chances gets mutate something worse. Sounds like mad wrong people. Maybe wondering government support unprecedented pandemic? wrong. Coronaviruses around literally years. lot rodents cats infected, typically harmless them.

COVID-19 coronavirus jumped humans. deadly.

Please google it. I'm not. know why? There's vaccine. 

I took it, they. I'm spreading Covid vaccinated person, unvaccinated persons responsible theur immune response it. they'd like good one, recommend get vaccinated. spent year protecting health idiots gotten vaccinated even idiots, vaccine. 

Now time put immune systems mouth is.

They get fucking jabbed get fucked, idc sucks, man. I've vaccines, stuck flat COVID.

People need understand still dangerous. People need stop fucking around, get vaccinated, follow guidelines.

We need part fighting fucker.    like last sentence. Personally I‚Äôm starting think hospitals refusing treat unvaccinated people covid might necessary.

I understand that‚Äôs pretty much hospitals healthcare workers stand for, point filled idiots killing innocent people part community. 

At point people need face consequences actions, can‚Äôt drag everyone else them.  paper referring July 26 paper like note science paper -- paper documenting scenarios scientists believe likely possible, prevent them. 

The TL;DR is...  
1. Vaccinate.  
2. Boosters. 
3. Variant specific vaccines. 
4. Better vaccines. 
5. Decrease transmission.  
6. Monitor variants people animals.  tune well 90% hospitalizations deaths among unvaccinated. 

The amount breakthrough cases still within expected margins vaccine efficacy. Due lockdowns? pandemic? 3%, get sick even die. whole thing really let people see friends family really are. 

I big problem people personal beliefs. think dangerous, end body. People take risks health time. problem anti-vaxx shit someone take care lazy unhealthy contagious. virus is. 

But I'm going tell others body. HOWEVER, can't stand see ""fReEdOmS"" people trying tell others body trying convince get vaccinated shaming so. keep small circle actual friends, cut couple people extended friends nonsense whole thing.  taking like virus 100% mortality rate. people psychopaths. Yes, that‚Äôs true. feel disappointed angry too. telling wife morning I‚Äôd almost support people loading tranq guns JJ vaccinating everyone bars, restaurants, truck rallies whatever like big safari. They‚Äôd whine complain, would vaccine blood. Problem solved. üòÇ characterizes every single republican seen. care affects directly. empathy organ, would gaping hole be. what's worse, proud it. supposed trust journalists news outlets, say lying think making vaccinated people wear masks bad call, public health perspective social one. proves anti-Vaxxers right, minds, vaccines don‚Äôt work government trying control them. also makes us vaccinated people feel like work nothing. don‚Äôt want see fighting. 

I‚Äôm mad people don‚Äôt want vaccinated totally understand they‚Äôre coming from. They‚Äôre scared, plain simple. CDC moving goalposts lot doesn‚Äôt give much faith either. want join side though, get vaccinated, think sort fair way get make places vaccine passports, you‚Äôre allowed you‚Äôre vaccinated turn whatever want.

I also think forcing vaccinations would bad call well, much hard approach could potentially lead bad stuff happening. need softer approach, keeping incentivized freedoms us vaccinated Nobody surprised antivaxxers love make others seethe. It‚Äôs part profile. curiosity, went St. Charles County Fair website, (www.stcharlescofair.org) there‚Äôs mention it. even rules wearing mask (or not). frustrated governors banning people flying Florida thing you‚Äôre demonstrating need therapy. pretty scary, friend tell anyone unvaccinated starve death, wrong people?? painfully obvious sad care. truly hope choice care impact life loved ones all. Take care. pointless. enough people get pissed pressure leadership could lead mandates instituted.

Just look responsible shit bunch idiotic assholes would get mad. 54 year old otherwise healthy aunt died this. daughter six months pregnant first grandchild. funny, sweet person talked like grownup teen helped get shit. went Disney world 17 days filled laughter great memories. 

My aunt worked pharmacy, wore mask ton people came mask around chins nose hanging out. got sick December, quickly hit stage trouble breathing. went hospital, sent text. said tested positive wants extra careful, hospital. daughter (my cousin) called tears hospital would let visit. got texts day aunt. told jokes never complained said things going well. died two weeks admitted hospital - Christmas. couldn‚Äôt fucking funeral her. granddaughter beautiful wish got meet her. 

So, thank everyone right thing. Don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre fighting nothing. one arguing that. person initially responded straight said makes immune, factually inaccurate. Small favors. thought I'd never find soulmate, now.. Oh course, I'm furious well. comparing two vaccines like same. polio vaccine actually stops spread polio, covid vaccine all.  Yeah hate idea homeschooling would one exceptions fully support it, although don‚Äôt know whether parent means stay home educate child money hire private teacher. guess don‚Äôt would considered it, least would considered moving different state. entire article posted. oH bRo 99% young unvaccinated people really gonna care got flu-like symptoms week. keep dooming though. I'm sure dum-dums claim victory somehow though, UnKnOwN LoNg TeRm EfFeCTs like ones experienced elite athletes caused to...play full seasons perfect form drop-off relative players get covid. enough stop us reaching decent level herd immunity everyone else would vaccinate. Refusing wear safety glasses. Ah, yes, using good ol Safety Squints instead.  would enough consider moving. obviously it‚Äôs simple going somewhere else. 

I hope things work family, least school staff understand protect child. That's nanochips, duh /s  Jerky‚Äôs included? I‚Äôm in! homeschool him? God feel bad you‚Äôre situation, hope goes well wife‚Äôs family bunch vegan hippies. don‚Äôt want anything ‚Äúunnatural‚Äù ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù entering body. won‚Äôt believe hard get wife take vaccine learned use horseshoe crab blood used make it. link data? think you‚Äôre likely die together car way school? I'm Tampa tell you, worse imagine. level stupidity stubbornness astounding. 
I Florida I'm it. feel like alien I'm scared shitless leave damn house. worried moment eased masking restrictions said testing asymptomatic exposures vaccinated people. mean, still *will* wear one, absolutely hate attitude saying folks can‚Äôt gripe them, particularly objectively low risk environment (for others)  running covid tests stage pandemic? We‚Äôve year half. smash cut half smiles decomposed. Sure, except consequence 'winning' bunch die take us them. Hard call win anyone, even them. True telling husband yesterday going need sort anger management therapy this. work healthcare, specifically urgent care testing patients covid, constant boiling anger inside really taking toll. co-worker sits cubicle next mine wants engage debate vaccine - unvaccinated. started get angry told would longer discuss - brought up.

Right pursue freedom. get Covid store someone less 5 minutes wearing mask. Come on. I'm even furious vaccine rest. 

These antivaxxers die pain, drowning shit give fuck anymore. Covid terrible way die, great let suffer.

In country, covidiots hospitals cancelling chirurgical operations people cancer time heal ones got delta variant. 99% vaccinated. 

They die. told vaccinate others, laughed say ""why get vaccinated?"". put people cancers risk fuckers. deserve healthcare. even deserve painkillers. Let know much fucked egoism they'll face death painful existence artificial lungs, I'll crack beer laugh despair. 

They want immune system work, good, let darwinism work. Yes - infection post vaccination leads strongest immune response possible. You‚Äôll super antibodies. Delta less deadly..

Get everyone vaxed. Trust vax. Live happy.

Covid took 2 dozen family. still chose happy. sure! Spoke vet student got scholarship USDA amount viruses check interesting. Never even heard new castle virus that. Thanks looking it! point I‚Äôm gonna sad unvaccinated die Somehow subreddit showed start page. came across post. like could explain want get vaccine.  don‚Äôt need worry. percentage 0.08% breakthrough based data. I‚Äôve posted twice above. title fine, don‚Äôt get long covid unless get Covid first place

Common sense talking CDC. CNN finds 2 scientists, quotes context... Sitting airport bathroom glasses fogged mask. Please let end, antivaxxers :( I've followed guidance far, getting really hard keep giving shit people choose get vaccinated.  Probably skirts around it. mandatory show card, could tests. Theoretically could vacc'd, want show card, go tests.

Biden also said Supreme Court found illegal require masks/tests anyways federally legal. Overall death rate certainly higher, although solid CFR numbers misleading CDC estimates 4x higher actual fatality rate, somewhere 0.5%-2%.

But majority elderly population vaccinated 99.9% remaining unvaxxed population would move fine. ideal maybe post viral complications, rates unconfirmed ""most"" heavy stretch keep remind sub filled Americans think world begins ends US Disney vacation Florida scheduled next week. We‚Äôve planned since mid 2019, cancelled last year, rescheduled year hoping things would better. thought clear weeks ago welp, evidently not, especially Florida. don‚Äôt think cancel would huge money loss family. We‚Äôre fully vaccinated I‚Äôm nervous delta :/ I‚Äôm sick shit man. want normal life back don‚Äôt antivax morons. means everyone went already vaccinated, right? 

Anakin: üòè

That means everyone went already vaccinated, right? understand saying, do, appreciate optimism. reality shitty tiny town 20k people county 60k university kids come flooding back schools starting couple weeks. numbers sky rocketed last year year. It‚Äôs nice states rates going up, bumfuck nowhere still live function realize completely surrounded garbage human beings. much data infectiousness delta variant, know vaccinated less likely symptomatic disease =/= less virus particles 

so moment unknown % vaccinated people viral load high enough create perfect breeding ground new vax resistant variants

blaming unvax people everything bad plain stupid substantiated enough hard data I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre also super pissed indecent exposure laws America prevent running around naked. God forbid need put piece cloth! protect average citizen state better US average absolutely beyond parody.

The numbers show Texas approached US average. Given current numbers, going exceed average. point Texas poorly?

Also, who's justifying deaths states 2020? point, seem intent ignoring, happening 2021 without gross incompetence selfishness.  Somehow don‚Äôt think fair Missouri‚Äôs low vaccine rate issue. mean get maybe awkward location, absolutely nobody? states fire. Really? Nobody, like zero? Good luck. Lol. virus becomes endemic literally longer pandemic. vaccines make endemic. isn‚Äôt completely accurate. data available states tracking. It‚Äôs minuscule 125,682 ""breakthrough"" cases 38 states represent less .08 percent 164.2 million-plus people fully vaccinated since January.

From [NBC breakthrough cases (same linked defining part cord cutting part, often either believe media lies, can't afford cable therefore watch it.

The defining part social media primary source news see anything wrong it. like SA example anybody. likely ~~slaves~~ guest workers received single jab. moved month ago tested positive late last week. Fully vaccinated since May. Symptomatic well. unvaccinated also putting vaccinated danger. pass around variants it‚Äôll create. efficacy already dropping delta  Silence. feel bad sometimes he's always pretty active guy even retirement. got caught political mess things made stupid decision. gets flu shot every year refused vaccine baffling. smallpox quickly killed 30% infected covered infected fluid filled bumps. Polio death rate similar. COVID 30% death rate feel like everyone would beg vaccinated. 


Also, smallpox polio naturally occuring viruses. 100% sure origins covid, investigating Chinese labratories China rejected investigations.  Man feel bad kids :/ especially school mask mandate ban exactly this. would run vaccine. happens elect internet troll made internet conspiracies go mainstream. That‚Äôs bit extreme bud noticed people wear mask chin pull see mask on. So, assume don‚Äôt really want wear mask polite pulling interact people wearing masks. Obviously would prefer keep mask times, think partial mask better completely refusing. You‚Äôre psycho. looked state situation report small increase lows weeks ago cases still far far peak.   report breakthroughs. Narrator: *They didn‚Äôt listen.* point, vaccines adapted new variants quickly. Riiiggghhttt let‚Äôs let children compromised immune systems die much consolation, COVID-19 bag, probably bound become endemic, least certain countries. catastrophic death toll could avoided covid-free already table February 2019.

Now vaccines available, though, future *could* brighter. That‚Äôs discrimination. something I've asking myself. seen articles compares immunity people covid recovered vs people took vaccine. I'm headline like it. hope DeSantis held account Title describes feel perfectly. I'm sick tired held back weakest links society, let reap rewards. hope resistant strains come about, feel worse health care workers. data 38 states tracking breakthrough infections. It‚Äôs hidden away secret[NBC- breakthrough covid cases least 125,000 spread 38 125,682 ""breakthrough"" cases 38 states represent less .08 percent 164.2 million-plus people fully vaccinated since January. one person blame anger. Mother Nature: Send Coronavirus freedom loving patriots. They're begging giving freedom culled extinction. Send particles Now! Probably though one punishing you‚Äôre treated like second class citizen. You‚Äôre asshole big mouth internet. Stop acting like victim.  point, anyone comes home ‚Äúround anyone doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated put camps‚Äù shot sight. sign says trespassing. mind blowing me. live region Canada population roughly 1 million. currently 9 active cases. town 30,000 live hasn‚Äôt case since May believe less 100 since beginning pandemic. vaccination rate 70% still steadily climbing. Despite this, virtually 100% people indoor public settings wear masks. actually really jarring see someone without mask on. one pissed it. know we‚Äôre protect other. can‚Äôt fathom living somewhere majority selfish stupid.  covid around 2 years. worst that's still 70k VS 600k  idea irrational unvaccinated people getting.
Because vaccines reduce symptoms new strain(thank spaghetti monster) still transmissible, they've started talking mandatory vaccine passports vaccinated allowed public spaces. studies recommendations many times that? (leave reuse)?

Are talking 2-4 times? 10 times still okay still provides filtration? honestly idea long filter lasts effective. point, returning normalcy pipe dream. I‚Äôm even angry anymore, I‚Äôm sad. Vaccine booster internet, everyone male proven otherwise. Yes, much so. I'm pretty much anything going anywhere work, grocery store parks forever, now. government mandated lockdown. Many non-essential businesses closed. Local law enforcement chose enforce curfews mask mandates, state local governments enforcing rules put place. police arresting people street fining people outside wearing mask mean form lockdown. hard definition lockdown Australia did, no, lockdown police enforce rules issued state local governments.  getting closer infects mass amount unvaccinated?

We need 10% infections / vaccinations original covid, 10% made amongst unvaccinated quickly?

Not ideal chance mutations, there's avoiding getting unvaccinated intentionally, lack care first place almost guaranteed put path infection. MIT bunch testing various kn95 OK moment according every story like we've read since Feb2020 Easy: Force Florida Texas lockdown. governments refuse (and obviously), send Guard shut down.

It‚Äôs totalitarian, but... We‚Äôre running options. Jacksonville pretty conservative city well (purple district despite size). surprised vaccine rates low  Benny say that.  realize someone living Munich German sea farther Adriatic, right? I'd wager Germans go vacation car. replied another post. recommend reusing masks they're meant single use. waste also safest. outer shell masks break protect well. see nuanced discussion hobby empathy left people won‚Äôt part. wear mask eternity won‚Äôt make difference many people refuse get vaccinated, keep continuing till run natural course. Well minorities vaccine hesitant ‚Äúwait see‚Äù camp. Nothing convince spreadnecks get vaccinated.

If LeBron got vaccinated live TV. anyone care cases? delta variant deadly deaths/hospitalizations going cares way people dismiss unvaccinated children sub

Any reasonable person would.

The amount child deaths whole pandemic *nationwide* hundreds. nation tens millions children. vast majority kids fine. kid medical condition, take extra precautions. ""Protect kid"" literally new ""won't think children"" new wording. Im still angry I‚Äôm tired angry. get 20K Florida, per day, \~50%+ public vaccinated. Pakistan nation 2.9% vaccinated. Either Pakistan testing much states US are, things blow pretty big there. Well can't risk hurting precious feelings incompetent assholes failed remedial science high school remember people threads saying ""wow 200-300 comments that's great covid getting done"".... :'v don‚Äôt enough vaccine get everyone planet vaccinated quickly would require. somewhat separate problem vaccine refusers self-centered shitheels. even entire population US gets vaccinated tomorrow there‚Äôs still going lot evolution places like India can‚Äôt that. said, CDC‚Äôs words, ‚ÄúCOVID-19 vaccines safe effective preventing COVID-19 disease, especially severe illness death.‚Äù entirely true. Statistically, vaccinated person, unlikely contract DISEASE, especially severe case. contract virus, it‚Äôs asymptomatic mild case. 

Also, it‚Äôs unlikely mutate something deadly. That‚Äôs viruses mutate. It‚Äôs best interest kill host. example, Ebola outbreaks deadly relatively isolated it‚Äôs hard catch. delta variant far transmissible deadly predecessors. Yes, means people contract people die sheer numbers, far almost exclusively unvaccinated people. 

So wouldn‚Äôt necessarily say ‚Äúscrewed again‚Äù likely need booster shot distant future. True, people eventually accepted measures pointed out. get feeling divisive climate, would go blow buildings protest. Yes another person Florida, honestly don‚Äôt care hospitalized COVID, thought wasn‚Äôt big deal? Cool get low priority don‚Äôt give fuck anymore, vaccine readily available anywhere everywhere. prioritizing break cases, well unable get vaccinated medical reasons. 99.9% pull nothing changes? understand strains virus work? Eventually antibodies gonna useless keeps mutating unvaccinated people like you. Actually, yeah, dumbasses care people die. care trolling lead disinformation death. hope young realize soon regret rest long, unhappy life. I‚Äôm protect family. kids young vaccinated don‚Äôt want bring home anything harm them.

Also don‚Äôt want mistaken one anti vax people. US killed President Haiti? administer vaccine country think needed it. died US happily announced sending vaccines country needs. summed perfectly‚ÄîI tired state things‚Äîbasic commonsense decency more. mRNA fantastic early variants seems Delta potentially Gamma pushing limits. probably need reformulation point annual boosters. Better antivirals come time especially get critical waves. Right containment harm reduction key. vaccine helps keep people hospital alive. know sure. need every adult teen vaccinated contain waves. need emergency approval children. need everyone wearing masks distancing especially around vulnerable people. need social safety nets vulnerable people. It‚Äôs going get better tech improving. need slow virus long enjoy advancement catch expecting fall winter tough get there. Concession accepted. agree point entire time areas there‚Äôs high absolute numbers covid cases likely develop variant.

Was hard little boy? Glad came around. really happen think would start making educators invoke critical thinking skills. number educators operate principal obviously critical thinker agree nuts. personally. outer shell slowly breaks that's whole point masks, keep strong effective. matter? way device works emitting light detecting absorption. amount light goes would obviously differ based skin color. want accurate measurement oxygenation get arterial blood gas. pulse oximeters never going entirely accurate It‚Äôs called triage; already queue fatties smokers.

The race ethnicity stuff brought complete straw man argument

Get vaccine, kill spare us burden paying medical care. cannot drag kicking screaming 21st century N95, KN95 subpar standard

No need replace daily but, yes, use mask daily, keep 2, 3 masks swap every day  ""The newly resurgent coronavirus could spark 140,000 300,000 cases day United States come August, fueled highly transmissible delta variant widespread resumption normal activities, disease trackers predict.

The nation already reporting 70,000 cases day, according Washington Post‚Äôs rolling seven-day average ‚Äî increase nearly 60,000 daily average less six weeks. Cases, measured rolling average, risen levels last seen February.

Justin Lessler, University North Carolina epidemiology professor assisted coordinating pandemic forecasts COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, said ‚Äúquite concerned. ‚Ä¶ worries may optimistic‚Äù projecting lower caseloads fall.

The seven-day average cases nationwide risen 60 percent past week alone. Daily hospitalizations rose roughly 40 percent deaths rose almost 30 percent, averaging 300 day.

‚ÄúIt getting worse, least right now, really slowing U.S.,‚Äù said David W. Dowdy, associate professor epidemiology Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health.

If silver lining, this: Experts expect hospitalizations deaths rise levels experienced winter. ‚ÄúThe people getting sick younger healthier,‚Äù Dowdy said.

...

Shaman said team‚Äôs recent model showed peak cases four five weeks, point would ‚Äúa little million cases whole week‚Äù across U.S. population, averages 140,000 cases daily.

Modelers University Washington‚Äôs Institute Health Metrics Evaluation predict rise mid-August, leveling 300,000 cases daily. scenario, deaths rise September high 1,500 daily. everyone wear mask ‚Äî unlikely prospect, institute epidemiologist Ali Mokdad acknowledged ‚Äî caseload could 10 times smaller.

One measure hastening pace resurgence: Earlier July, COVID-19 Scenario Modeling Hub, consortium combines input multiple academic teams, issued consensus projection cases would rise 60,000 per day October, based data July 4. case count passed week."" Texas maskless (I‚Äôm opposed luckily kids 12 vaxxed) Don‚Äôt presume know I‚Äôm thinking. would answer 340 unnecessary deaths. Fewer children die nut allergies, still treat nut allergies. fact, probably many illnesses result 340 deaths children still take seriously. noted, one variant away children susceptible. long virus circulating mutating. Okay exactly need wear mask? saying shouldn‚Äôt able choose, really don‚Äôt see point dislike wearing them. Also, Asian countries seeing much worse spike US due poor vaccine rollouts like said wear masks. Masks really tool January somewhat made sense. everyone wants vaccinated, point wearing mask significantly less effective? Yes, exactly. 

Maybe chip this. see lot people saying ""oh, safety measure X, abandon safety measure Y."" approach, new safety measure X good serves keep us before.

The FAA new approach radar system installed US airports. allowed closer spacing takeoffs landings radar system provided greater safety. extra safety squandered favor increased profits.

We also seeing people say ""I'm vaccinated, stop wearing mask public.""

The goal use new safety features actually increase safety. That's going get ahead pandemic. look acceleration number cases, seven-day average gone substantially. know really need do, Jon, say truth -- 100 million people country eligible vaccinated getting vaccinated. seeing outbreak unvaccinated,"" added. least im GAY still hosts virus, eventually mutate enough vaccine effective. need study more, certainly overstating (PDF warning) preprint topic, suggesting vaccines still work lambda variant. Black death enters room know? Someone tried telling third medical workers vaccinated using excuse get shots. googled it... 23% time. 

These people make sound like 23% doctors getting survey showed 96% doctors vaccinated. less education person medical field likely vaccinated. people loud amazes others believe entry level nurse doctors. little bit knowledge dangerous thing  entire life complete hold year now. Please take vaccine opportunity so. Let reap they've sown 

yeah, fuck immunocompromised!  Same, I‚Äôm it. can‚Äôt anything good half population pouting obstinate toddlers anything might way remotely inconvenience them. eventually like Flu people sick enough need medical care sick get tested/reported/admitted. Yup.

There‚Äôs really nothing else say. I‚Äôm tired idiots screwing everyone else. false anyway. first dose back signed June set August 12.

I able get earlier one ""open days"" could skip queue, limited number slots. Lots people still waiting despite registered weeks ago. worries! That's put disclaimer lol Calm grandpa, nobody asked shit take. üòÇ Lol, crock shit. Normalcy? never Normalcy get data though? hospitals tracking it, show end Yeah, went school like highschool. ended playing months worth mahjong.

Not everyone I'm understanding correctly, that's study looked at, right? 

Yes, that's exactly is.

It's one 300 one 100 breakthrough cases according charts. Vaccinated hosts likely spread it. Jesus. you‚Äôre vaccinated care someone isn‚Äôt? Also, 75% infections fully vaccinated.  Well antibodies job. memory cells provide long term protection. Delaying infrastructure proper response... Maybe saw infections whole Japan? Numbers show kids less likely bad cases, protected. still long term effects.. variants change even more. Ignoring problems doesn‚Äôt make go away Methany way even get close predicting seasonal flu hits China first. We're still even good predicting like that.

Source? able work fast enough stop viruses mutate faster? 

Again, stopping viruses goal. Minimizing impact is. Stopping virus already spread across world fools errand. point money make vaccines force virus mutate spread again

If looking perfect vaccine 100% resistance going sorely disappointed. that's biology works, nothing perfect. Covid going continue mutate, slowing mutation predicting strains impact best things minimize impact. basic 4 year degree biology would learn vaccines foolproof viruses adapt.

Anyone brain that's middle school knows that. need degree that. Hospitals start turning away un-vaccinated treatment Covid. waste resources people stupid deserve them. might sound harsh, consequences stupid.They petri dish effect get vaccine really don‚Äôt want family get sick. getting back normalcy means chained desk 45 hours week barely seeing kids. I‚Äôm sure everyone anxious go back normal. We‚Äôll drag victory, screaming kicking. agree part. However, think it‚Äôs important wear masks take precautions order protect chosen vaccinated well. can‚Äôt neglect entire subset human population. already classism, racism, on, look problems it‚Äôs caused. know people unvaccinated choice aren‚Äôt discriminated basis racism classism, I‚Äôm calling ‚Äúisms‚Äù tangible examples times we‚Äôve neglected whole swathes people. point forget unvaccinated choice also deserve cared for, we‚Äôll setting greater social problems. Emotional maturity way, dude! Delta variant affected sometimes even killed people already vaccinated ?! curious know doctors know patient sick corona?

Because symptoms influenza viruses exactly same. Angry isn‚Äôt nearly strong enough word. tried Sweden last year. work. there's much community spread, immune compromised protected well enough. Many cannot completely isolate, need contact medical professionals etc. Israel data showed something bit different came Delta variant already issueing third shot.

What mean clear.  Yea thats really environment at. Maybe flea market, fair breaking news.... water, wet. common sense title, course pissed ignorant ones refuse get simple prick arm. change view, never. point let morons die straight refuse get ignorance. far can‚Äôt get due medical issue, problem someone legit issue can‚Äôt get. far people taking wait see approach, you‚Äôre idiot, sorry facts facts, millions put bodies point fucking baby it. irrational fear needles sucked got vaccinated.... Ehh I‚Äôm venting/ranting point, yes mad..... change anything, nope.... best, paper supports finding *symptomatic* vaccinated unvaccinated people appear transmit similarly.

But vaccinated less likely become symptomatic, also reports clear virus 

so peak magnitude may same, area curve lower. always case outlier risk statistics. sucks unusual life governments mostly work large population statistics.  Worst part variants coming bodies unvaccinated people go critical care. Allowing live ventilator gives virus perfect environment mutate endlessly. 

I listened podcast man UK sick covid weeks given vaccine. problem already like 10 different mutations covid created body sick. gave vaccine mutations quickly took killed him. What‚Äôs really crazy sequenced strains body found independently created variants found parts world became wide spread. 

The fact strains mutating independently different people different parts world scares shit me. fuck selfish awful people won‚Äôt get vaccinated stop pandemic. getting way?  It‚Äôs terrible policy leaders brought us this. Yeah cause one percent infection rate definitely guarantee kid catch Covid.  regardless, afford homeschool, please do.  one wants deal kid it‚Äôs snobby entitled parent. Hahahaha cope. Correct.

1. Vax incentives (didn't work)
2. Vax bullying (didn't work)
3. let's try pit vaxxed vs. unvaxxed. rightfully so. Last year technician working try explain employer violating state OSHA guidelines regularly testing blood oxygen ensure suffering mask-induced hypoxia. told full shit, responded spending next *20 minutes* phone trying find whatever Facebook post told that, even pulled actual regulations straight state OSHA right next him. Eventually reminded needed get task hand done next hour put phone down, shut conspiracies rest time working him. prepared get medical services hospitals can‚Äôt handle load? way. feel bad 12 others unable take acquire it. Everyone else go ahead die already. Please come here, we're tired tourists anyway. ones want hotels Disney/Universal. completely correct, though. People heal bullshit time Washington post owned jeff bezos Probably healthiest outlet anger /r/HermanCainAward paying attention? delta variant already infects spreads vaccinated people. Even fauci said viral loads similar vaccinated unvaccanated delta need reach full herd immunity naturally, half USA population fully vaccinated already.  risk it? selfish got backward. Freedom tell others live life still freedom   fully vaccinated take proof vaccination good. rules either get tested (tests valid 48h here), fully vaccinated (14 days second shot) recovered (I think rule goes 6 months, I'm sure) us immune competent, think we'll Covid infections lives post vaccination infection, moderate symptoms lasting effects.

There's [whole Covid-19 reinfection. Vaccination effective prior infection preventing reinfection (\~90+% vs \~78%), prior infection, reinfection generally milder. main concern would appear elderly otherwise immunocompromised, there's much lower efficacy protection reinfection (47% elderly, recall paper came across yesterday correctly).

Already, one fortunate enough live one's 80s longer, infection (usually influenza pneumonia) becomes leading cause death. SARS CoV-2 may added another infectious disease succumb to, chronic diseases affluence get us first. kind animal doesn‚Äôt use dark mode? Not‚Ä¶that Best thing is, sizable chance also think immigrants coming US following US laws. young people spend every day summer clubbing every single night packed bars, hooking multiple people, sex multiple partners throughout given week.

Can‚Äôt believe even attempting compare Spring Break normal day summer vacation. literally thought obvious. There's lot free money going on. one tenant paid dime since May...but zero balance. That's May **2020,** mind you. 

The maddening thing outside couple months beginning pandemic, they've (married couple) working full time. One even told he's making pandemic since finished master's.

But, agree, tough.

SUCKS. may sort true one time, cases Delta, [it emphatically isn‚Äôt that, too, responsibility. said another way 0.5% total covid deaths June fully vaccinated, right? 900 breakthrough infections knows many, mild, testament efficacy vaccines. Similar viral load, similar spreading ability. 

Define sick. Hospitalized? getting covid general? Actually feeling bad? sure sarcastic not. Florida bane United States. point went tested viral load vaccinated unvaccinated value Delta variant. spike area high vaccination rate attracted attention researchers. never heard people asymptotic covid prescribed aspirin prevent strokes. please roll delta vaccine already Glad help! I‚Äôm PA well actually. think shit hit fan soon enough. good amount vaccinated work one bigger systems EHR tells use everyone‚Äôs vaccination status sooooo many vaccinated got one dose (our EHR reports ‚Äúoverdue second dose‚Äù liars sage gotten it). troubling. Generally, yes. looking reported deaths period time, like month June, determining percentage fully vaccinated That‚Äôs necessarily true though wrong. Mostly close contact someone tested positive. also plenty people required travel/work longer needed tests, vaccinated time meant likely spread contracted. Thank wonderdog Statistical significance equatable statistical analysis. results indicate stat significance different coping mechanisms per country yet results reported report. Gottlieb said thought near peak would another 2-3 weeks get it. knows he‚Äôs right. big wildcard going kids start school next 2-3 weeks none &lt;12 crowd vaccinated. Wait people vaccinated? Fair enough, statistically though still prefer situation people vaccinated - probably makes difference macro level run PCR? Definitely takes hours machine, including prep (and transport case) I'm pretty sure intentional get clicks. think young people summer???  Like you, bubble algorithms dont work Im bubble do. live Florida. commenting Michigan. family member mine died today.. chose get vaccine .. 62.. pre existing conditions. PLEASE get vaccinated .. death senseless!! Cigarettes taxed pay higher insurance premiums get caught speeding, mention fine. I‚Äôm sure whether obesity makes health insurance expensive. VACCINATED PEOPLE COULD SPREAD VARIANTS WELL, LESS LIKELY, BEHAVIOR UNIQUE DELTA. STILL LESS LIKELY VACCINATED PEOPLE SPREAD DELTA VARIANT VACCINES STILL PROTECT REDUCE INFECTION MASS LEVEL, EVERY VACCINATION COUNTS! forget work possibility crazy medical bills! kind adverse reaction?

He's re-election 2022. Technically, he's campaigning think it. know lot supporters within state he's pandering right now, things turn around, going lot ""I wish I'd gotten vaccine"" stories coming Florida like hearing states surges right now.  Then, perhaps supporters realize they're misled lied to.  Maybe enough evidence prove Covid real. scares schools starting weeks, in-person learning. expect first week, DeSantis take normal victory lap say ""I told so"", fear things go downhill that.  know understand children underlying conditions too. children 100% healthy many underlying conditions.

Nah /u/Some_Silver right, site PCR test take something 2-10 minutes site tests take longer logistics involved get sampel lab. cover moving cost much else riots nothing compared gun violence happening now. make get FDA approved again. cause whole wave uncertainty. see kinda things worried people disabilities makes unable get vaccinated. Yup, it‚Äôs political entire world effected. ZERSTORRENNN! Awesome, right? that's one like 5 pokers right? FUCKING sucks. baby January 2020 one met. mom works healthcare gets cursed at, masks thrown her, shes call security covid deniers.

Really want live riots  downvote, matter whether believe not. Personally experience massive city wide testing track trace efforts think probably accurate numbers around, now. Well first realize bubble first place Yes! Trauma service area, looking data way PA, trying find hospital group county luck. 

It's pain, trying find right words search find need, helpful! site PCR tests take ~3-5 minutes... yepp... since sequencing equipment always site logistics lab load make site tests take ~8-12h. depends mask. N95s great. single person hospitalized, definitely not. Truly prolife core. keeps up, end like Angry Pumpkin. Thank quoting article. It's... illuminating horrible. Hospitalization numbers key. high amount vaccinated individuals end hospital, means vaccines longer working back lockdowns Delta booster released. 

Current data indicates fully vaccinated breakthrough cases either asymptomatic cold symptoms. thanks reply! Seriously need update. sorry bother sorry loss. many hugs aunt. sorry go this. Everything racist. Even comment reading dark mode. dad got polio year vaccine came out‚Ä¶ sadly, passed 8 years ago never would questioned getting vaccine. university though, facing fall :( bring religion this. Make happen vote don‚Äôt understand Fox News it‚Äôs pundits. They‚Äôve obviously vaccinated themselves, seem going kill audience. reason? Objectively you‚Äôre one wrong. 

I‚Äôve never Australia yet believe exists. don‚Äôt know anyone healthy who‚Äôs died don‚Äôt exist. See stupid sounds?  need mandate vaccines. would never let unvaccinated person die really pushing need realize many doctors killing.  again? Even ""lockdowns"" small businesses forced close. big businesses - car manufacturers, meat packing plants, etc. - kept going. Again, like news sources include this, risk child dying covid less dying car. Hospitalizations similarly low. exist horrible, people endure something mean voluntarily should. good news fully vaccinated people incredible protection severe illness hospitalization. 

It‚Äôs ‚Äúmay‚Äù get hospitalized like people say, it‚Äôs extremely unlikely to. 

I don‚Äôt see encourage others get vaccinated doubting full effectiveness. feel like I'm going wearing mask help protect people want protected. I'll fucking it, stupid annoying thick headed people can't get head ass. I'd say passed ""tired &amp; angry phase"". F them, let get sick &amp; die. 

Let catch covid sacrify themself reach herd immunity People like helping problem. antivaxer told actually vaccinated people spreaders cause new mutations still infected contagious, symptoms therefore quarantine continue infect others. anyone know this? vaxx make up. Social distancing thing past lockdowns never return get head. going deal awhile let down. supposed bring people like Desantis line, instead he‚Äôs turned blind eye. right heels Trump debacle. I'll never look people again. First, nice handle. loved Invader Zim kid.

Second, yes, increasingly hard ‚Äúoverdose‚Äù anger. helps best putting music chores. helps get in-tune meat space lol I'm not... Normalcy means going back office. Means traffic crowds... 

I've thankful extended, laid back version society.  - Wayne Gretzky feel lot rage. I‚Äôm immunocompromised antibody production issues. Normally I‚Äôm fine things like cold flu season extra precautions it‚Äôs spread isn‚Äôt comparable Delta. I‚Äôm enraged people think they‚Äôre ones sacrificed sacrifice ongoing. pretending can‚Äôt handle masks puts much danger antivaxxers. despite people‚Äôs beliefs, mutations aren‚Äôt occurring unvaccinated, they‚Äôre occurring immunocompromised. infect us, keep letting nightmare go on. Protect us save yourself. That‚Äôs purpose vaccine never intended sole ticket freedom, ok. 

Vaccines prevent serious illness, grant immunity infection. Vaccinated spread covid. That‚Äôs problematic. Asymptomatic vaccinated people wearing masks could potentially contribute increases severe infections vaccinated people. rare? Sure, think so, small chance zero. don‚Äôt actually know big small chance is. ""Lots die"" Everyone die, question how. real problem take many innocents them. That's needs dealt with. anything, general pro-Israel stance would make following Israel's lead even likely. Breeding dumb people like threat world.

T,FTFY Perhaps I've misunderstood original point. stressing ICUs filling up? vaccinated people ICU?

I assumed latter, upon re-reading think may referring first. consume it, smoke anymore I‚Äôm tired sometimes forget Trump President. think there‚Äôs part brain trying protect trauma years. waking every day zero idea would happen next. keeps forgetting. remember, confused shocked again. brain effective job. Don‚Äôt understand that‚Äôs funny link 3 times row? Thanks making point. amount scolding, anger, vitriol, blaming subject vaccinated people really eye-popping. one intolerant subs Reddit opinion.

The establishment media certainly feeding this, daily stories like one ""angry"" vaccinated people deplorables.

I think helping situation leading anywhere good.  point I‚Äôm hoping ONE ‚Äúnormal‚Äù year college virus spread world. virus could always mutate somewhere abroad (ie Delta variant) come back vaccine resistant. going eradicate this, learn live it. right virus killing vaccinated people (other extremely rare occasion), let's punish vaccinated making wear masks.  Definitely not. variants come take place too. Sadly like Coronavirus (not covid) different flavors affect population different. Covid possibility fizzling becoming head cold - that's what's happening .

 I'll agree anti-vax media blows stories puts people want vaccine fire. makes people want get it. Though mean think nessasry - hey that's side country. want . 

Though solution get vaccine things go back ? 
Hell could even forgive skeptical ones want vaccine 2.0 come out. ones flat deny science think we're injecting nanobots crazy. Americans - birth assigned number. Everything documented- always paper trail. kids fine. Let kids

You fine. Find happiness. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

The term covid derived covid-19 came Coronavirus virus disease 2019.

Bovine Coronavirus thing. Bovine covid not. People covid following SARS-1 MERS  it‚Äôs COVID. It‚Äôs environment. It‚Äôs information system. It‚Äôs war.

China, Russia, etc. know easy manipulate so-called ‚Äúfree world‚Äù. Yes. Yes, are. masks helped slow spread among vaccinated even evidence reach higher vaccination rate masking find 3 weeks late people passing around new dangerous variant?

Sadly maybe public anyway. Well, they're technically really winning. 

If re-open without everyone vaccinated, natural selection take course. don‚Äôt blame anti vaxxers, inevitable minority refuse get vaccine. need get live rather stop wait everyone‚Äôs vaccinated. 6 months ago neeed meal drink inside , need vaccine? ffs They're making work opportunities pharmaceutical companies hate. get wrong, companies corrupt also would leaving house without vaccine right now. exception valid medical reason, reason get vaccinated. Anyone says unvaccinated blame next wave trying pretend 'the divide'. divide literally belief disbelief medical science. fair, far world vaccination countries unable obtain yet really whole ‚Äúbreeding ground‚Äù good point.

Hope Serena gets cancer! didn‚Äôt follow Israeli mask guidance antisemitism? Yes, that‚Äôs absolutely batshit claim. Gamma assholes.   Let take ""personal responsibility"" die care.  feels like repeat India coming Florida. Low vaccination rates + everyone (mistakenly) thinking already immune + much contagious variant = tragic body count. flu strep throat time years ago. Thankfully I‚Äôd gotten flu shot wasn‚Äôt completely miserable didn‚Äôt get terribly sick. really hate think could happened hadn‚Äôt gotten flu shot. ""But Florida handled Covid better California!""- Every Covidit exactly works. don‚Äôt force people stay home diseases. Make decisions want get vaccine. don‚Äôt get determine people forced stay home not. total deaths people 0-17 beginning ~300. people aren‚Äôt able vaccinated (which rare)should taking precautions, probably already given diseases existed corona didn‚Äôt lock people it.

No, wrong. That's exactly works times emergency emergency. Look history. Would like small pox? polio? 

Don't give ""people unvaccinated rare"" bullshit. many children 12 US alone? millions. They're unvaccinated. statement alone utter bullshit. 

Your answer lazy selfidh, ""it's care anyone else"" attitude. American attitude. people need understand bad now, going far worse November.  Captialists never lockdowns happen again. I'm point hate shit care selfish delusional people. binders virus could use? lot people also define old ""10 years older me."" thing pre-existing conditions weight. ""I'm healthy, little overweight, mild hypertension nothing like people dying covid."" Would masks helped slow spread among vaccinated even more? evidence reach higher vaccination rate masking find 3 weeks late people passing around new dangerous variant? sad thing lot energy motivation it‚Äôs much easier literally nothing Yeah vaccinated people 25fold reduction serious disease hospitalisation, meaning burden hospitals far less unvaccinated fearing it. think fake, told last night Delta variant exist plot get everyone vaccinated controlled Stop posting misinfo. things exist can‚Äòt even find article idea political discourse. 

Though say much support idea. Make pay higher insurance fees tests use hospital capacity steal. already man. I‚Äôve emotionally drained since November 9th, 2016 That's false comparison know it, deaths covid extremely rare children. 


That's classic pearl clutching absolutely reason.  point punish Florida this? Sanctions? Breeding variants like threat world. happened country high rate vaccinated. mutate vaccinated unvaccinated populations. Treatments come help due availability acceptance. gonna suck. countries vaccines regulated changes need made.

For insurance based like US, policies discriminate vaccination status, increasing cost getting greater risk needing service.

For public healthcare systems, needs kind taxation. UK heavily tax tobacco alcohol indirectly goes towards paying healthcare likely need. Something similar occur unvaccinated hospitalised covid. I‚Äôm angry. It‚Äôs could lead worst variant, could put everyone risk again. 

Our world going get much needed lesson Darwinism. vaccine still 80-90% efficacious Provincetown outbreak. population almost entirely vaccinated (like 90-95%). similar breakout unvaccinated community would thousands cases. high vaccination rate Provincetown overall resulted case counts positivity rates drop rapidly following outbreak. many communities would resulted uncontrolled spread.   Angry exactly? vaccinated people inconvenienced, indoor mask policy brought effect nobody actually follows nothing changed post June 15th. Everything still open, restrictions, social distancing colored tiers. overreaction vaxxed people. Live life. Antisemitism US? Really? That‚Äôs wild claim? swimmer anti-vax nothing. I‚Äôm sorry friend.

I, sometimes envy people died recently. good friend mine died recently, know it‚Äôs fucked tragedy envy fact doesn‚Äôt around bullshit. started living life freely again, know would super annoyed everything happening now. know!

Bovine COVID = Coronavirus

It‚Äôs different  I‚Äôd like think covid affected children way polio did, things would different. again, social media hell drug. Part older remember people polio. high school, BF‚Äôs mom walked cane kid it.

I fortunate kid, mom took us eat sugar cube local polio vaccination drive.

If tried today, anti-vaxxers people losing shit sugar, we‚Äôd dead. Last checked could order packages per day NHS. potentially 49 tests week one person.

Not sure home LFT tests count testing stats, though, report results (which people mostly negative). complete false equivalence can't believe people actually believe this. Polio 15% fatality rate adults compared something less 1%. True, completely understand outrage. pisses too. wish many people getting angry we‚Äôre fucked capitalism. Normally it‚Äôs passive conversation. Would nice get Reddit see headlines like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know needed study tell us this, majority Americans fed living paycheck paycheck evicted Jeff Bezos takes day trip space‚Äù create unions strike turn rage real revolution. Chances lot people (your area) vacationing Florida Floridians visiting (your area).

What really need prevent travel *to* Florida. see happening. Let's stop screwing around takes get control.

I say number 1 give everyone take vaccine $250.

The time screwing around over, Krispy cream chance lottery working.

Heck France doing.
You want go restaurant theater? Better recent neg test proof vaccination.  Check local public health department rules masking healthcare facilities, would one report  think we‚Äôre punished different ways. I‚Äôm still nursing, still trying help people. I‚Äôve always loved emergency medicine, burned pandemic. Primary care physicians send anyone sniffles ED get entire families coming who‚Äôve ignored vaccine guidance, suddenly believe science they‚Äôre feeling ill. I‚Äôm it. Florida (and Texas) putting hard making difficult put mask mandates. cases continue go up, going look bad. 2024 hopefuls show know handle crisis like break promise put mask mandates place. Desantis playing politics everyone's life.

In addition, way know someone tested positive COVID-19 track back caught it? Florida big vacation spot. shocking cases Northeast caught Florida.  Yes, sanitised pump wipes time. Im genuinely confused youre trying toget me. Im hoping vaccines forced theres nothing else thats going fix I'm SW Missouri living Delta couple months still peaked out.

My kids getting ready go back school. Wife immunocompromised

I actually thought wave could break America. stupidity involved lead really bad things.

You can't stupid expect things turn good. Nature much organized us One vaccine bring all... That‚Äôs 100x worse.  New Hampshire flies windshield enter chat. state require (unless minor). comforting, break delta, none close contacts got it, including vaccinated unvaccinated parents. Okay think people color want military patrolling around? thats gonna end well happened masks? option vaccinate not? I'm talking N99 masks.. 70% new cases vaccinated obesity contagious airborne. Worse bubonic plague. like auto accidents. /s  know actor running California governor? made President. worry, another state laud ""the America's success story.""  covid deadly children would feared. polio effected mostly old people one would really care Ty much! Yeah it‚Äôs devastating take many steps back. love you.  link report? I've trying find shut friend up. opposed abortion care fetuses. oppose abortion see unwanted pregnancies punishment promiscuity. completely separate opposition anti Covid measure. instead related anti intellectualism. fits overall theme also denying climate change evolution. religion, science nothing ""believe in"". Masks help prevent spread disease full stop, still definitely get infected still spread it. like believing seat belts. correct kids good chance severely affected, 100%. kids get sever symptoms, 1 20 develop neurological disorder. Youre piss poor job protecting people care about.
I'm sick dealing people like smart enough think know talking stupid know not. 29 last valuable year life dude GET FUCKING COVID SHOTS IDIOTS!!!! care anything anyone themselves. us may die sacrifice they're willing make think it'll put White House. parents literally protected covid one be. said form income. generous possible viewpoint:

They ""Pro quality life"". Argument forcing people use masks reduces everybody's quality life enough worth life's saves. we're better masks. 

I find argument kind dubious. 42k actually come contact covid patients.  highly doubt hope feel better soon, internet stranger. pandemic awful depression starting feel like again. wish affects mainly poor people. rich people leave country guess works good. It‚Äôs unvaxxed gonna tax hospitals though Florida man withhold funding schools mandate masks unvaccinated children crowded schools global deadly pneumonia pandemic. nightly news nine. think one reasons anti-vax movement seems concentrated developed countries people forgotten never seen horrors diseases. I'm 25 year old india college buddy age handicapped leg polio. Imagine mad must feel looking anti-vax news.  Whoosh hope y'all get well soon! Let go Also autoimmune boat. excited vaxxed jury effective vaccine immunocompromised folks. I‚Äôm double masking avoiding indoor public stuff much feasible.

With said end day, really matter one anything, case, gets vaccine?

When UK spiking simultaneously pull *all* restrictions sub predicting apocalypse. government considered crazy even genocidal. Informed people instead predicting peak would happen within days re-opening. happened.

This magic. called science, people shriek day ""following science"" bizarre one actually does.

I looked every single state I've seen Missouri, Kansas, Nevada Alabama probably going peak within week so. Florida probably within 2-3 weeks. I'd assume North East large spike end year early next year, along Midwest. There's chance might spike that's something I'd confidently predict. see NY cases already rising might blip   Maybe didnt express well enough. issues sometimes lead miscommunication misunderstandings. that, apologize.

I think page. need using every tool disposal simultaneously. Giving people choice matter things went rails. I'm absolutely support mandating vaccines, regardless religious objections. allow people engage bigamy, avoid personal taxes, sacrifice humans, whole host things may claim religious exemption. needs apply community health. Obviously, medical exemptions this, real physicsl danger.

It‚Äôs definitely Florida grew in. feels like slovenly trailer park. üò¢ vaccine isn‚Äôt fully FDA approved ever mandated anything though? Probably optional staff.  financial considerations back burner (for now).

IMHO, part problem financial consideration legitimately front burner. messaging needs way service economy gets working high vaccination levels. really, would still imply 50%+ efficacy. get high vaccination rates, every percentage point matters (93% vax / 80% cases vaxxed gets 70% efficacy).

We're used high vaccination rates looks really weird. anyone know percent resistance us vaccinated have?

Is going likely need 3rd shot? Georgia resident there's way we'd able close southern border even wanted to. really wish would... according google we're 10% behind Florida's vaccination rate anyway... 4. Virus mutates able better infect vaccinated people start whole mess again. 

I think underestimate damage unvaccinated people could cause. Chin maskers probably also go get vax, get like polio instead.

However, month interesting, Brazil slowly lifting restrictions increasing occupation capacity 60% 80% establishments (although expectations lift mask mandates yet, soo yeah, gonna deal mask while) schools also reopening tomorrow. However, i'll continue online classes while, preexisting conditions :/

The good thing least there's chance Brazil vaccinate people 18 starting august 18th euro effect upside downside. probably natural rate decline.

Summary
What already known topic?

Variants SARS-CoV-2 continue emerge. B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant highly transmissible.

What added report?

In July 2021, following multiple large public events Barnstable County, Massachusetts, town, 469 COVID-19 cases identified among Massachusetts residents traveled town July 3‚Äì17; 346 (74%) occurred fully vaccinated persons. Testing identified Delta variant 90% specimens 133 patients. Cycle threshold values similar among specimens patients fully vaccinated not.

What implications public health practice?

Jurisdictions might consider expanded prevention strategies, including universal masking indoor public settings, particularly large public gatherings include travelers many areas differing levels SARS-CoV-2 transmission. talking Angry Pumpkin? still things masked, plenty open countries switched kind policy. Americans way obsessed all-or-nothing mentality mitigation, really depressing. people obit capable empathy extends close family friends. Fun fact: 0.5% people infected polio muscle weakness paralysis. 0.5%, 2-5% children 15-30% adults died. 

So it‚Äôs *guaranteed* people whining Covid isn‚Äôt big deal 1% infected people die wouldn‚Äôt care polio rate exponentially less.  New York state immunization registry (NYSIIS) entries required age 19 adult vaccinations may get added.

Tbh I've never ever considered long term effect VS immediate season 

Never huge fan shot always effective HATE needles (don't worry got covid jabs) alone reason enough consider law Israel forbids forced medical treatment. What's username acronym for? trying figure out. MC Hammer reference? could find look up. man, took forever become eligible shots day appointment J&amp;J put hold, took another week get ahold pfizer Dude turn tv get reddit week. You‚Äôll see improvements day day life Well maybe bring vaccine actually works ü§†üëç Cool, parents bad job raising you. Manufacture start vaccines approved. could done simultaneously months earlier, economic it. would hope people soon start realize end pandemic US.

I would hope would learn something, youre still making bad posts every day explain countries single payer systems see increase flu either?  it‚Äôs true vaccinated people carry viral load transmit it; think it‚Äôs always important also caveat fact breakthrough infections still infrequent spread vaccinated people almost entirely due unvaccinated vaccinated unvaccinated transfer. Thus even emphasizing vaccines best way fight thing.  worst one friends ""Look I've never vaccinated even worn mask I'm ok""! 

&amp;#x200B;

Yes fucking idiot that's majority country supposed thus limiting spread helping ignorant fuckin ass. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm Nurse UK NHS worst fuckin 18 months, goddamn tired. too. I'm pretty sure we've see tip iceberg relating long-term health effects COVID-19. already see ""long-covid"" people able smell 12mo post infection. I've keeping neurological effects, since research neurodegeneration, information unsettling. UK published case reports recently diagnosed alzheimers (and mild symptoms pre-covid) rapidly declined showing acute disease symptoms SARS-CoV2 infection. looked like virus exacerbated disease progression. bad feeling might see significant uptick neurological diagnoses like AD 5-10yrs post pandemic directly connected previous infection status.  Yes. models. think CDC director SAGE making stuff without data? journal article discusses how, people, Gamma already shows immune escape properties. journal article discusses genetic mutation COVID-19. 

""Recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 variants show several mutations receptor binding domain spike (S) glycoprotein contribute immune escape enhanced binding angiotensin 1-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) play important roles SARS-CoV-2 entry cell, genetic variation host entry-related proteins may driving force positive selection SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein""

&amp;#x200B;

Notice states immune escape already thing occuring, far probability.

 antibody immune escape variants SARS-CoV-2 documented literature. availability SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences enabled us investigate occurrence genetic epidemiology variants globally. analysis suggests number genetic variants associated immune escape emerged global suggests N501Y mutation may diminish binding antibodies RBD also interfere production weakening cooperation B cells, facilitating immune escape.""

&amp;#x200B;

I could go on, small sampling literature. dangerous: Delta enough you? Check Gammas effect Brazil, B.1.621 Columbian variant also showing immune escape properties. first sighted late January. Go ahead click link check daily cases deaths around time til now: Hint, huge upward trend. 

The virus could change spike protein lose characteristics. also stay gain them. one knows. fast moving virus. shown above, virus already mutating. asking social distancing + masks + higher vaccine rates =/= basement forever crusade. equals solid health policy respiratory pandemic. CDC disagrees



From website maximize protection Delta variant prevent possibly spreading others, wear mask indoors public area substantial high transmission.


I live area substantial high transmission according website. mask important weakened immune system if, age underlying medical condition, increased risk severe disease, someone household weakened immune system, increased risk severe disease, unvaccinated. applies household, might choose wear mask regardless level transmission area.


I weakened immune system live household someone does. 


Can show science says should? And, send random fauci article.  Don‚Äôt Fauci Florida, right? Proof? Thanks :) someone take gotten back traveling internationally work, additional sterilizing immunity small benefit. huge relief knowing less likely get stuck overseas unexpectedly two weeks (or can't make trip due foreign inbound testing requirements). fully vaccinated early April, based Israel data, infection immunity going start strongly wane Delta next month two. 

Assuming antibodies wane rate original dose, 5X higher starting point third dose would keep protected year instead 5-6 months. 

There's bioethics question around giving boosters much world received first dose, we're let millions upon millions doses expire next 1-2 months anyways.  best health without medicine, don‚Äôt deny medicine works. essential oils anything. discussions family. successfully convince wife, immediate family fully vaccinated. side issue. sister parents though though, don‚Äôt think going convince them. fair, LOT people scrub chin regularly soap water ‚Äî people shave, people acne, on. 

(Obligatory note always wear two layer mask inside establishments California, always want fiddle damn thing onto ears anew.) immune compromised top list regardless age. Someone health department steered wrong direction misinformed you. lot going around. 

You currently see hospitals visitation rights etc. hope so. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll quite simple though.  fearmongers claiming would see massive increase cases CDC removed mask mandate? almost like CDC doctors know pandemic do.

Remember stupid post? tried say pandemic end. I‚Äôm angry. live free country. I‚Äôm vaccinated safe. choice, don‚Äôt give fuck whether stranger vaccinated not. got vaccinated soon available protections offers, I‚Äôm comfortable risking exposure. people don‚Äôt take advantage that‚Äôs them‚Ä¶. wish they‚Äôd open kids 12, that‚Äôs really last good reason continue precautions point. multiple people work stupid get it, gotten either bad time bad regret mild case justifies getting it.

So saying got better ended natural immunity anyway? numbers vaccinated people testing positive 20% LA county. Number hospitalizations vaccinated lot lower unvaccinated people though. thought Germany already required full vaccination, recovery negative tests enter? simply remove exceptions countries low spread? vaccine stats today: We've hit 90% 65+ one dose.

And tomorrow day hit 70% 18+ one dose.  overly accurate

Most people still wearing masks socially distancing high-risk, vaccinated partner getting symptomatic COVID-19 week absolutely enraged me. frustrated livid now. solutions these. solutions death. Action (or lack of) meets consequence. want twist arms, there's simple way. vax? hospital you. own. Either live die, problem.Exceptions young otherwise ineligible. Jesus sound weak. Ye, left politics framework aside. unnecessary stress system due politics misinformation. Sorry condition. Prompt complete recovery. Jesus Christ politics becoming divided polarized Blue lives matter? Support troops? prepared disavow things? people would coming. might shoot one two, shoot back. worth it? get vaccination big baby. isolation since March 5th, 2020. 1100 people, 4 tested positive. Less 1 percent. Whoa, I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm thoroughly confused. I‚Äôm really trying jerk here. want understand perspective bit better. it‚Äôs worth, I‚Äôm full support ongoing masks lockdowns we‚Äôve studied situation arrived sustainable solution, could take years. 

I‚Äôm wondering formulation here. would purpose imprisoning people? And, please expand formulation bit people Florida? I‚Äôm quite clear reasoning yet large countries United States travel restrictions? rhetorical question, genuinely curious I'm familiar policies outside U.S. Asia.

I know Asia travel restrictions place since start COVID vast majority lifted even now. I'm you. Except I'm tired. I'm indifferent. Let people dig graves. 

With world still unvaccinated, I'm sure matter time truly devastating mutation starts circulating. I'm convinced Delta it. 

So take care you, keep need to. Shit, lot probably still believe even exists. How‚Äôs criminal?  think they're pointing unless get large percentage world vaccinated point ""new yearly flu"" happen anyway end USA We're smart According research done, especially places like Israel population 60 80% vaccinated February data showing vaccine effectiveness fading quick dramatically. vaccinated January find best walking around effectiveness nearly 20% compared someone vaccinated June around 80%.

If unvaccinated people ones getting sick concern seeing wouldnt there. would protected vaccination would little worry about. truth see variants boosters available ones made quickly new variants take hold continue see spikes regardless previous vaccinations.

Instead seeing vaccinated people spreading virus knowingly. know first hand someone currently infected vaccinated april continues work job since symptoms arent bad according vaccinated. anti vaxxers problem they're distraction real issue vaccine provide much protection ticket whatever want. vaccine worked effectively current delta variant would problem. Kind like driving car seatbelt. direct impact individual.

I still continue wear two masks including n95 well limit public interactions. isnt hard wear mask, hard use common sense even vaccinated. Weve hospital metropolitan area 20% admitted covid patients fully vaccinated. depends state started vaccines long ago since got yours. see lot called ""breakthrough"" cases regardless vaccination rates. government officials warned already this, CDC discussed internally lot people concerned effectiveness vaccines.

The mask mandate never removed local governments also failed constituents. vaccinated wishing ill unvaccinated need take step back understand majority unvaccinated people color. coming place privilege condemning unvaccinated, educate government lied people color practiced medical warfare throughout history. Understand spreading hatred towards unvaccinated, simply spreading white supremacist hatred racist rhetoric.

To wish ill unvaccinated literally wish ill minorities, plain simple. FACT CANNOT disputed. Get racist shit. Fuck encouraging downplaying covid cases vaccinated people. Vaccinated people getting tested contact positive case, mild symptoms. sound like want people bury heads sand go ‚Äòno testing cases‚Äô strategy. first graduating class virtual charter schools South Carolina (2010). loved meant could finish work rest day (usually gaming part time job). 

On hand, younger brother tried well...and failed miserably. actually dropped HS (more due chronic health issues missing like four years person schooling) self discipline actually work attend lessons, even mom pestering working him. serious- sometimes take goofy tone sub cuz things getting ridiculous lately lol. 

There studies r/COVID19 sub recently. I‚Äôd go look ! anything said?  Let draw whatever heck want long they're offices, schools, indoor public spaces endanger people. not. countries managed much better countries. Countries like south korea, taiwan, new zealand handled amazingly. Florida. expect?  Self-Interest ... natural ""normalcy"" covid. Normalcy basically flipping planet people get rich leave earth demonstrating write.

At point hope fucking die nobody see real problem. come far time, throw away people thinking clever, really need wisdom. 

We capable logical us consciously primitive. 
Wished stated percent ICU vaccinated. 

In case: vaccinated still they‚Äôre getting hit. Delta joke. Yep advent health system 1000+ hospitalized covid cases central Florida. There‚Äôs ICU room catch delta variant still vaccinated means even 100% population vaccinated we'd still dealing still. I'm vaccinated come man, news trying rile vaccinated vs unvaccinated battle ridiculous Right, like know live.  Also I've reported two subs following shitposting anything say. Get life leave alone. areas substantial high transmission, CDC recommends fully  
vaccinated people wear masks public, indoor settings help prevent  
the spread delta variant, protect others. includes  
schools,‚Äù Walensky said

That way different recommending wearing home. Yes public places recommended wear mask. bad.

I mistakenly thought comment ran along path tweet [Tomi Laren]( decided risks changed vaccination. chooses understand *relative risks* efficacy numbers about.

If math correct: efficacy hospitalization delta variant 88% hospitalizations avoided. vaccinated experience 12% hospitalizations unvaccinated experience. words, unvaccinated 8.3x likely hospitalized. post says so? Exactly seen photos people crammed next wearing masks? feeling going trust link I'd put front thigh.

Hundreds millions cases, millions deaths worldwide think body evidence captured? Sounds like go get delta variant haven‚Äôt already. Gotta bolster immune system! [Vegan duh! nephew knows wears mask go play best friend across street. encouragement needed complained once. blows away adults act childish does. would find out? take bandaid arm. keep vaccination card anywhere could ever find it. Or, throw card away, card that's important, vaccine body. reaction afterwards, say headache stressful day.  sincerely apologize getting vaccine reason can‚Äôt get mom won‚Äôt let me. stop spread retransmission. please tell asshole I'm angry them, apathetic. Unpopular opinion. I'm tempted refused vaccine get sick covid sent home without treatment. Pretty obvious considering barely complied Month time everyone scared imagine trying think we‚Äôre starting misunderstand other. Could please expand bit mean say attempt equate attitudes quite poor?

I think may misunderstood point intended make there, want make sure understand you‚Äôre coming first. could try explain clarify point, feel concerned feel sure understand you‚Äôre coming lead us away understanding one another issue better mindset dealing pandemic. desire vaccinated would also likely mean better containment behaviors mask wearing social distancing. also means increased likelihood people would get new vaccinations need. 

And said, COVID vaccine works delta variant. Going ""how vaccine help something vaccine work on?"" ridiculous question. know happens, happened yet. think see countries lesser efficacy vaccines higher efficacy ones (if others done already) replicating approach.

(I think episode NYT daily can't search easily 1. vaccines sterilization immunity lasted pretty much entire lifetime. People vaccinated rarely caught either disease.

2. population natural immunity. Polio smallpox mostly childhood diseases. Adults level protection. didn‚Äôt need vaccinate entire population, kids.

I thought handled pandemic badly Trump.

But Trump gone still act like idiots even California. fucking open schools too.  Alternate Yeah. Also, really understanding means, I'd like number age. information ""15% vaccinated hospitalized people die"", could 93-year-old almost-dead people vaccinated bad state health-wise they'd die anything. (Not claiming case, certainly something affects numbers extent) put perspective some, Maryland one best vaccination rates. Florida 3x population currently 50x number people hospital. So, I'm vaccinated, wear mask required, voted Biden. initial criticism sub agree with. thinking monolithic. agree said mean agree everything. nothing. Yeah, shit! one wants wear mask, that‚Äôs fucking point headline, go get vaccinated fucking stop! kid fucking play kids! get it!  put kids online school. available workable everyone recommend it. learn happy little conformists later. like child school trying skirt around dress code

You know assume people continue mature leave school? people never do. feed it, never go away.

Guns kill people, people kill guns? got 70%. Turns carrot fake we're going back mask mandates another cold emerged.  Yes, wipes faster vaccines questioned results problems overall, leads sensationalized stories shit media companies spew out, thus profits. surprise they're trying manufacture profit chaos much possible. might callous, last part needs happen sooner rather later opinion. point, people choosing remain vaccinated (not folks able get vaccinated) bringing man determined define legacy shame. Every decision makes puts clearly category ‚Äúhistory judge poorly.‚Äù 

Fucking idiot. may wrong, didnt Elvis get polio vaccine tv lot Americans convinced get it? Fair point. Feels like we're held hostage people.  ‚ÄúEverybody book them, cases that's stay.‚Äù

\- Christopher Hitchens really sick. entirely sure yes via flight. 
I know, feel way thought glimpse hope it‚Äôs back wearing mask safe. false. Testing among vaccinated exceedingly uncommon. Look rates White House among olympians regularly tested. I‚Äôm seeing thing now. swing Petsmart would say solid 75-80% customers masked. saw vaccinations slightly well. virus transmitting easily chickenpox now. 

Someone White House COVID-19 response team currently screaming NYT overblowing infection PEOPLE TRANSMIT VIRUS RATE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE FAIL INCLUDE CONTEXT Wakana Response Team. Deputy Director Strategic Communications &amp; Engagement

Unless one articles mentions actual R0 number vaccinated people comparable chicken pox legitimate data back up, hesitant believe news media‚Äôs claim.

Also, article White House angry news media misleading  greatly reduces severity. That‚Äôs indisputable sister chickenpox kids (in 80's), slightly harder time did. case barely noticeable (I remember like one two blisters, that's it), I'm surprised people might know. many days 18 months lockdown?  Uh, what?  way misinformation presented using absolute numbers often fudging them.

""99.994% Americans died COVID since June 1."" true statement, instance. follow ""So bothering vaccinate?""

The correct way way honest makes obvious vaccines really work control age compare vaccinated versus unvaccinated deaths. ""The chance people 30s X times higher unvaccinated"" number could easily found. X would very, large. miss. Go off, Dr. F! Yes, ahead New Zealand China. convinced me. Let's get rid seat belts let's give everyone gun. collect ""I'm batshit nuts"" libertarian badge? Yeah, math used headline wonky. actuality, think, 20% hospitalized breakthrough cases died. Right still spread know right? Like bodies immune system fighting chance mean everyone lucky. Mask regardless vaccine status. yourself, country. Letting old folk die don‚Äôt want wear mask crazy.

The emotional damage caused family‚Äôs communities enormous. Emotional damage leads economic damage well.

Never mind ongoing costs long Covid possibly side effects show coming years.

If happy death rates due Covid country fine.

I would rather stay home, limit movements get vaccinated limit spread deaths. findings like used targeting advertising like increase compliance public health measures.

Findings like what? Going back obvious one ""water wet"" self-centered men comply? Also, main method 30-40 min online survey conducted among participants recruited snowball sampling (which makes sure study biased af). claim survey somehow got estimate decision making skills cognitive ability participants. Absolute rubbish. Unless Florida. covid pit, apparently. Uber &amp; Lyft. Good call. think problem many people asked last time. dunno gonna tell. Tbf dipshits thought Florida hailed model response. dipshits still defend matter many people kills. one base left üôÅ COVID hospitalizations 10,000. record last summer 12,000.

What's crazy week ago 6700, two weeks ago 4100. whined include delta. read article could avoided embarrassing yourself. pay higher auto insurance, health ins. health insurance since creates higher health risk? Taxing thing impacting health premiums suggested here. 

""The estimated annual health care costs obesity-related illness staggering $190.2 billion nearly 21% annual medical spending United Delta worse, creates high viral load causing disease young populations original variant could not. still fully shit, longer runs rampant, faster new mutations arise. This, coupled constant exposure vaccinated individuals surely lead immune escape mechanisms problematic variants. Lost jobs due pandemic. I‚Äôm tired depressed.   frustrates every day. I‚Äôm seeing bunch vaccinated people don‚Äôt need masks, wearing them, bunch unvaccinated people wearing them. makes blood boil. It‚Äôll surprise mask mandates holidays again. already imagine ‚Äúwe‚Äôre together!‚Äù tv advertisements now.     Yup. We‚Äôve got vaccines dramatically mitigate individual risk. Combined low cost NPIs, especially surges, we‚Äôve got path public health crisis, even Covid us forever.  Damn... stupid reasoning. Since obese people infect others around kill them? Obesity choice, genetics. hard understand difference?   Vaccinated, stressed seeing people wearing masks public. assume vaxxed, makes bit paranoid. gone without mask times, mainly eat, time, mask on. 

I'm tired, man...    whole saga eroded faith society. assholes whining wearing masks, evading rules, spreading misinformation, finally getting vaccines.

Other generations endured more, came sense togetherness shaped them. I'm left feeling like critical mass stupid assholes, transformative political decision could make -- I'm sure fuck changing them-- move.  Yes no. lot science background happening one either cares wants know. dynamic pandemic people need stop getting hopes going disappear day. vaccines work! one died, 2 needed go hospital. headline trash, stop fucking scaring people! anecdotal, antivaxers know, also cord cutters, got news Facebook YouTube.       feel like timed vacations well COVID.

I cruise early February 2020 things shut down. get COVID. Enjoyed one last vacation Times.

Then vacation early month Delta beginning pick steam masks needed even vaccinated.    Wow I‚Äôm sorry - hope alright. know taking precautions beyond vaccinating? method transport (flying)? 

Crazy hearing transmissible delta variant is. hoping travel soon‚Ä¶fml haha Ya, DC fairly well vaccinated rates vary wildly section coverage)

Best ward 4 57.9% fully vaccinated. Worst 8 31.7%, improvement.

Just like anywhere, also seemed similar mask compliance.

And take guess continue outbreaks cases gone most.

That's even within city overall % help much.     Obesity contagious.  Wow I‚Äôm sorry - hope alright. know taking precautions beyond vaccinating? method transport (flying?). 

Crazy hearing transmissible delta variant is. hoping travel soon‚Ä¶fml haha     feel bad teachers. can't enforce masks gotta deal higher percentage parents asshole ones.      think failed put caveat would face mountain lawsuits congressional hearings. They‚Äôd create much ill might actually create enough public pressure nationalize healthcare.     Basically countries give ""democracy"", still quite ironic.     misery lives company guess.

I don‚Äôt think state‚Äôs approach pandemic failure terms number deaths vs number lock days. 

We minimal lockdowns right life back normal us. Everything open mask wearing needed.

The vaccine roll failure Federal Government along lack suitable quarantine facilities built allow overseas citizens home.

The lack oversea works means jobs state Western Australians.
People due age ie:over 50 able get work.   problem people back high risk behaviors summer long. CDC basically gave vaccinated folks green light frolick summer. message get vaccinated enjoy summer. get vaccinated stay basement playing video games. US removed social distancing capacity limits high risk venues breakthroughs continue increase. unvaccinated cases go even higher Delta burns next weeks. 

And 3 weeks schools going back little social distancing, believe CDC recommends 3 feet distance now? virus transmitting easily chickenpox now. Yeah good‚Ä¶  St. Charles County thing ever. understand frustration, everything done stop spread useless. invented vaccine, lots people got it. us masked beginning, stores put measures place, work home etc. I‚Äôm discounting frustrations, I‚Äôm mightily pissed myself, things could much worse. Remember tents set outside hospitals PPE last year? I‚Äôm side, saying stuff makes feel bit less hopeless, effort push back despair. confirm seeing ER‚Äôs work at. children 10 fever first test RSV ( helps us save covid tests too, running places). RSV, odd it‚Äôs usually winter virus. never saw last winter fuck quotes around ‚Äúfalse information‚Äù it‚Äôs not?  Ask order. Yeah mentioned RSV back, saying unrelated Covid, think is. Especially since Winter  I‚Äôm guessing drivers license, smart phone location services üòÇ Normalcy?! Fire tornadoes, drought, floods, heatwaves, crop failures, micro plastics fetuses, melting ice.... yup misleading fuck. unvaccinated getting way.  government.  unvaccinated want die, let them.  vaccinated, longer anything fear covid. simple‚Ä¶stop giving Covid breeding ground getting vaccine, masking up, social distancing. Covidots get board, constantly problem People really keep forgetting lot actions (going bars, dining, etc) luxuries rights. Also vaccines school travel mandated long covid. fucking shit? kind stupid, subs many testing sites use exact antigen tests buy shop. We're 17 months ffs. didn‚Äôt realize anti vaxxer. aren‚Äôt typical one could care less trying convince you. 

I speaking people region anti vaxx. Vaccination.  Eric Idle calls ‚ÄúLib tears‚Äù would probably work faster That‚Äôs exactly works. don‚Äôt force people stay home diseases. Make decisions want get vaccine. don‚Äôt get determine people forced stay home not. 

The total deaths people 0-17 beginning ~300. people aren‚Äôt able vaccinated (which rare)should taking precautions, probably already given diseases existed corona didn‚Äôt lock people it. non answer üëçüèª  Analogies tend work willfully ignorant Look Australia‚Äôs contact tracing this. states would lock states need to. Dude, wrote escape mutant means escape infections yes may see huge drops yes may variants, secret said even see huge drops infection sides means may need new booster however even infections fully evading impossible. example mRNA vaccines, target spike sars cov 2 right? virus wants fully escape vaccines, needs change spike's shape. Consider spike key like home's key. Mutations equals color changes little shape changes.But still end day still home's key. change lock,still remain similar open it. fully changes can't open door house can't enter. want it? Ofc lol virus still Sars Cov-2 spike still Sars Cov-2's spike still mRNA vaccines hit targets. infection side said preventing severe cases cards too. sum up, see huge drops preventing infections side may need boosters (that's following lineages) fully evading impossible still Sars Cov-2 hope refuse vaccinated know 97% hospitalized covid cases unvaccinated 99% deaths covid unvaccinated. matters aren‚Äôt. Reasons don‚Äôt matter virus. Adding extra reply noted participation subs like MGTOW such. 

Your issues far beyond pay grade lmao. good day. Maybe try stop feeling sorry yourself. KN95 Chinese standard. could made China, Kambodia, Kanada. work masks following CDC guidance, said unvaccinated needed continue masking 

I know several people anti vaxxers stopped masking time people actually took time get vaccinated. can't nice things. shit‚Ä¶ analogy also doesn‚Äôt work. 

People wear masks public go hangout privately don‚Äôt wear them, wearing mask doesn‚Äôt stop spread them, slows inevitable Well mind end game here? 1. ""Unlikely"" mean can't

2. die, mean suffer unnecessary suffer long-term health effects.

3. Delta future variants could change moment.

I'd prefer kids get sick hospitalized *at all*, hearing ""they unlikely die"" makes furious. reasoning actually accurate, current dine-in restrictions would enacted Airport clusters, weren't. 

Furthermore, vaccinated spread biggest concern, Singapore would shifting endemic plan, stated repeatedly. Every country high vaccination rates except likelihood spread, scientists saying long Delta emerged. Yes agree Changes definitely needed. least, term limits across political spectrum, booted office sooner Well take pet dewormer, that's idiot coworkers talk about. Fuck science medicine help humans, they're gonna take fucking dog meds. eradicate smallpox, though.

Not entirely. one bad accident lab smallpox pandemic. Unfortunately US, Russia probably China plus knows else decided keep smallpox viruses potential bioweapons. Love humans make stupid decisions like this. Hey opportunity completely eliminate something causes untold human suffering, let's keep hand case... Breaking news: sun sets gets dark out. Yes, think people need lot stick carrot now. Financial ruin via medical debt, job loss, etc. number innocent vaccinated deaths shouldn‚Äôt tolerated. everyone remember Israeli study people convinced vaccines longer effective, couple weeks back? Yeah scientist saying got media ran ‚Äú39 percent effective‚Äù headline without waiting giving proper context. CDC states vaccines 75-85 percent effective infection well. Ok, got it.

And someone want go camps? would handle them?

Also, curiosity, would transport people camps? example, train cars? would march there? something else?

If someone escaped camps without vaccine, would happen them? would handled?

Are available models history could employ base camps on? is, terms questions above. feel like entering new, uncharted territory? Majority world can‚Äôt get vaccines. isn‚Äôt understood yet???? someone North Carolina treated cancer Jacksonville nine years ago, feeling angry read comment thread. I'm pissed now. awful see little unvaccinated care anyone themselves. covid around years

No hasn't. Covid =! Coronavirus. it‚Äôs rights violations. don‚Äôt want government tell do. Even though there‚Äôs many things government already tells everyday life. don‚Äôt realize comprehend that. peanut brains can‚Äôt. 

And thanks we‚Äôre mess now. Imagine different things would competent president last year would actually get country right direction slow spread then. Instead dumb ass office governors following foot steps see outdo other. Look mess Texas now. Abbott making illegal schools make rules mask wearing, threaten halt funding attempt virtual threatening go individual business requiring masks. wife works small office 5 employees. boss currently chemo masks 100% required clients coming turned away don‚Äôt wear one vaxxed vaxxed. Abbott wants fine business like this? don‚Äôt know happened county. Seems we‚Äôre spiraling closer drain. may already tbh delta variant whatever heck happening Provincetown  article? one post state fine?

Measures people unwilling get vaccinated currently discussed, personally recall fines mentioned, like ""less rights"" visiting restaurants, bars, museums etc. Also, might face harsher quarantine returning holidays etc.

But currently fines Germany non-vaccinated people, we're done vaccinating people available yet. vaccine came became longer responsibility protect thought God already eliminated Covid Tanzania?? stating that, people saying vaccine CAUSED variant (which fucking bullshit) forgive lack education past high school. feel though education level fuck falling victim conspiracy theories. bearing moral compass. 

I forgive them, however, general stupidity/harmful behavior. 

Jesus h.

Please cite sources yea shit. can‚Äôt spread aren‚Äôt infected thats common sense. small minority unvaccinated people infected right WTF?  need tetanus booster every 10 years. zero sympathy COVID patients thats wait rushed experiments Experiencing symptoms hours vaccination sound likely. Except opinion already happening. Who‚Äôs filling hospitals right now? Who‚Äôs still dying covid? Treatment virus killing anti-vaxxers. bc filling hospitals people dying result too. 3% mortality sounds low would millions millions people dead cycles global population likely will. It‚Äôs effective vs delta it‚Äôs choose violence. backfire. Moderate Republicans independents leave ranks. did, I'll never vote Republican again.  Ask 30 year old personal trainer hometown, oh wait‚Ä¶he gone. 26 year old mom 4 great health, oh wait‚Ä¶she gone. 34 year old police officer pretty decent shape, right‚Ä¶he gone too. Florida brief look post history. Yeah - situation changed due transmissibility Delta variant. posts suggest CDC wrong dropping masks (fair point) prevalence breakthrough infections (fair point). you‚Äôre also suggesting CDC lying fully vaccinated people protected hospitalized getting sick - false. extremely extremely effective still despite 100%. Another post wrote situation ‚Äúworse ever‚Äù - it‚Äôs actually way tools fight pandemic beginning.

Also infer fully vaccinated people specifically avoid maskless around without taking account unvaccinated? please point study says that? creep. case anyone wondering, compiled vaccination rates generation United States America(USA). know generation spans exact social science, used general range birth years generation. percentages fully vaccinated, 07/31/21.

Generation Z: **37.5%**

Millennials: **47.45%**

Generation X: **57.80%**

Baby Boomers: **74.55%**

Silent Generation: **77.80%** It‚Äôs pretty clear what‚Äôs happening here. feel similarly. reason fatigue. seems limit amount calculated reason one muster surrounded sea incalculable stupidity. limits. sucks point. 

However, learned one thing reading Michael Lewis‚Äô new book one coming save us. reasoned continue make reasoned choices. Republican lawmakers voters certainly won‚Äôt. Democrats continue pool noodling every knife fight face.

This dynamic applies climate change well. point give up? say tragedy commons defining characteristic humanity? It‚Äôs fine point, it‚Äôs certainly understandable, argument en masse means end human experiment. sucks always adult sea stupidity least alternative sucks even more. vaccinated don‚Äôt spread virus easily unvaccinated. That‚Äôs misinformation. You‚Äôre taking headline spinning truth would like you‚Äôre either a.) fan virus lifestyle b.) paid spread misinformation internet.

All media outlets update stories. White House even mad using language, it‚Äôs manipulative I‚Äôll also add plenty infectious disease docs admit, it‚Äôs possible virus could mutate avoid current vaccine something along lines changing spike protein, mRNA vaccines flexible, wouldn‚Äôt take much alter vaccine fit new virus. optimism good, however there‚Äôs evolutionary pressure describing. long incubation period presymptomatic shedding, Covid become deadly without risk breaking change transmission. 

The original SARS (SARS-CoV), made people much ill much quickly survival rate 60%. 

This truly go either way point. Vaccines surveillance important keys reducing impacts, you‚Äôre literally making things point. thousand years now, Opening good book crystal digital archive thereof one sees

Ah see. impression cape cod incident cause concern terms infection rates among vaccinated.

Yes, every pandemic history come end, one - one way another. small percentage Anti vaxxers covid nothing compared hospital bills. problem argument never ends. always chance mutation. basically saying need keep distancing forever don't, might mutation forces us go back distancing. solution problem problem itself.

And anyway, country 5% world's population bad variants far come countries. wrote ""killing kids"", complete nonsense Let's start calling antivaxxers crippled :o
which are, atleast mentally Blame idiot Jenny McCarthy! don‚Äôt know queen anti vax gets pass brainwashing millions morons. called thought experiment science, simulation computer science. guessing lawyer lawyers would call speculating. thought experiment read based real life observation bacteria viruses mutate acquire new traits overtime, especially evolutionary pressure - drug resistant bacteria evolved PS4 n cases. yes firm evidence: 5 variants corona spreading little resistance planet. vaccines, means opportunities vaccine resistant one evolve, especially vaccinated folks throw caution wind use vaccine indulgence whatever want. I‚Äôm worried covid slightest. 

I‚Äôm worried amount misinformation coming angles people getting shot. reason I‚Äôm worried getting shot unvaccinated have, longer debate masks restrictions. Anti-vaxxers taking away hospital beds, doctors, nurses resources could focus non-COVID life threatening injuries. People getting attention need due selfishness/arrogance people needlessly dying. get idea countries successful programmes keeping COVID (for now), struggled vaccination. odds look pretty good Agreed. it‚Äôs something worked deal new threats similar flu vaccines. current vaccine efficiency holds reducing covid symptoms severity, end state might universal vaccines letting virus run wild, UK now. We‚Äôll see goes. function linear, though. Getting ‚Öî way herd immunity doesn‚Äôt mean virus spreads third rate; spreads almost rate vaccination, every target can‚Äôt reach, enough alternatives can. approach threshold rate transmission start choke. Cdc release yesterday data Some?! made personal choice get vaccinated, longer needed wear mask

Our risk level right listed ""severe"", ""high"".  Yet tourists stream in. leave ""coming soon community near you""....they bring home w/them. .

I never want around anti-masker, covid deniers, anti vaxxers even (which thanks may high alert much much longer necessary). .  seen think learned something kind people want around going forward. weird hear people responsible popularizing vaccine solve covid issue people try impose totalitarian rules instead free speech. topics important rarely hear would thought connecting billions people world giving voice everyone hear/read could bad thing I'm rewarding people principle, fear next time need people something common good, people hold back waiting incentives  Time bring back leper colonies. seen  know need? debilitating virus! don‚Äôt live idiocracy, though. idiocracy, idiots owned idiocy turned smart guy fix problems. reality, idiots think they‚Äôre smart guy. big difference. much worse off. Personally, want infect others, know risk happening higher expected ... ... know much higher. Frustrating, can't helped. hope serious research underway. I'm masked distancing. people Trumpsters/QAnoners bullies school. Shittiness pretty enduring character trait many. Death wish. anti-vaxxers would start shooting vaccination sites compelled.

It's also obvious *don't know* virus spreads, precautionary thing wear mask. Experts east Asia recommending masking, clue going on, masking widespread China/South Korea/Taiwan/Singapore/etc, helped shut virus early. one group experts wrong, lying. 

The argument someone change opinion relation new evidence, fact sufficient rationale ALREADY begin with, blindly followed experts, wrong. know theres anger somewhere im exhausted dont feel much anything anymore go.

Run along now. way data includes delta. start surge Austin something like 12 ICU beds available.  multi-county area Austin proper serves around 2 million people. click link says sexy asians near me. would cough cover fart, fart cover cough. truck stop. I'm surprised choose something related lifestyle biometrics. Smokers drug users might begin hide fact smoke use drugs healthcare providers afraid factor whether get lifesaving treatment not.

Not saying make sense. must abstain alcohol Six months eligable liver transplant too. Oh may also require space x suit go shopping. üõí rhetoric I've seen Reddit last couple weeks sure makes seem way. another sub, repeated list disgusting things I'd heard Redditors regarding manner hoped people refused vaccine would die, time one dies, that's one 74 million go, etc. I'm going repeat full ugliness here, sub banned repeating sentiments (which guess reasonable, given awful are, although expressing thoughts), thoroughly horrified misanthropic was. situation really brought dark feelings part fellow Redditors, despite 40% US yet fully vaccinated.

Anyway, agree, getting dark around here. Fuck, like you. Ah, mountain view? I'm extrovwet self centered, would love go back things like music festivals result massive outbreaks disease. tackling elephant room, let's tackle whale room: medical history regarding BIPOC sterling length. experiments Puerto Rico[Puerto [many targeted minorities. 

Then there's weaponization people power prosecute minorities, like [making doctors mandatory reporters immigration increases distrust authority. 

Make actual progress address past, whale elephant leave room themselves. spread easily unvaccinated, far less likely suffer serious illness die. GA starts Monday. think cases going explode that. hope I‚Äôm wrong. kids get shots, agree I'm surprised talk teachers strikes anti-mask shit going on. Yeah love automatic assumption they're spending drugs like Jesus man Even without official pause, patient, think would pause right now. would worry staff would stretched thin. also degree biochemistry *thought* family trusted opinion. Unfortunately mom many extended family still refuse get vaccinated.

Yes I'm unreasonable one insist continuing social distance them. I'm immunocompromised initial data suggest vaccine work well people like (for old variant. data yet delta).

I'm sick it. People Florida get jabbing ok ! He's wrong. wonder false information refers though. think important draw difference fact outright fiction. first dose already get second one I've taken aback lately fact people state vaccine may long term implications (although unlikely) shut marked ""anti-vax"". likelihood long term effects present slim impossibility never understand conversation often shut down. 

I get people make outlandish claims vaccine clearly ridiculous fact nobody knows long term effect vaccine, leaving fact open discussion important. learn improve experience others. fact vaccine long term studies one never shut conversation regard. 

I take vaccine knowing emergency find also understand potential risk. Anyone says risk must time machine. know many symptoms? many serious symptoms? many hospitalized? many died?

Wish able get info. problem us getting Covid it‚Äôs mild. Square one may oversimplification, setting numbers like vaccinated population, things bad. start getting bad, get worse.

Hospitals may improved treatment, think also going start seeing burn attrition frontline workers. We're sitting year half right now, know hospital staff interest going again, especially self inflicted. 1.79 per day. Literally every single person house sick. thought really nasty cold 3/6 us vaccinated. even fever, symptoms progressed really weirdly cold (or even covid), decided get tested yesterday.

Got positive result back today, expecting.

My kids got SIL. got *mega*\-dosed kids. Honestly bit relieved way though.

So yeah, definitely still worth wearing masks even vaccinated. Yes. Doucheholes aware still get Covid spread virus fully vaxxed... right? Whats funny money withheld FL federally. wonder realized making dumb decisions... anywho... feds may step soon anyways want case know 5+ people personally gotten sick past 2 weeks. Puritanical values work. seen numbers recently though. much lower 99+% unvaccinated. you‚Äôre vaccinated point literally step outside get shot it‚Äôs Health insurance companies need say cover people refuse vaccines. Unfortunately CAREs act mandates coverage. countries raising rates like smokers 0.5% lazy math track hospital capacity

This misses point. Hospitals can't add beds coordinate capacity snap finger. 

If know X cases demographics behind it, expect intake patients case load 1-2 weeks, least strategize, prepare, manage. But, without *some* idea epidemiological metrics, hospitals flying blind constantly caught flat-footed. 

Over million half people province still single dose. Meanwhile, one transmissible viruses ever discovered (that according CDC) base unprecedented exponential growth curve. 

This going end very, *very* badly ultimately fuck entire country. Countries free healthcare treat free hospitals still buy meds. We'll see tough brave-boy delta starts sending little-ones hospital, parents start screaming. We'll see tough brave-boy then. Eight sick get DNR?

Hmm sounds feasible!

Good morning sir, options customs today are:

1. free vaccine

More testing shows leadership failed, can't that. numbers sound good, BUT...what's timeframe study? mainly cover last month half so, delta became dominant? go back way January, (a) far fewer people vaccinated, (b) dominant variants (alpha beta) ones vaccine extremely effective against?

Article say, should. delta variant deadly (for unvaccinated) original virus, alpha variant?

If is, seeing higher death rate among (unvaccinated) infected saw January peak, alpha variant?  MSM sleeping delta variant. sudden... ü§®üßêü§î #think #wakeup guess may dissenting viewpoint here, family members close friends either fully vaccinated yet begun. political vitriol cause stop loving caring whether live die.

University California, San Francisco Medical Center said statement issued Friday 153 183 infected staff members fully members hospitals continued wear personal protective equipment, Dr. Day said. number staff infections reported July many peak winter surge. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nervous could potentially exceed it,‚Äù Dr. Day said.

These original cases CDC tither, additional data. media always cover complete fucking idiots?

'Both sides' journalism mean giving morons free megaphone. I'd wager one people medical researcher infectious disease specialist. many could coherently explain even basic aspects infectious disease? Quite even alive without vaccines parents grandparents. sucker good‚Ä¶ hell bad zombie movie/show. Everytime watched, still never believed zombie apocalypse could happen.

Now‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre fucked!!! pass. preventable passed long time ago. som rely herd immunity survive since either can‚Äôt take vaccine array health reasons would effet them.

Also unvaccinated spread virus quicker vaccination reduces contagiousness, meaning unvaccinated, likely new lethal contagious variants spawn.

Because hospital saturation, led fiasco first place. Certain weirdos believe certain person resign office king weirdo reinstated former position somebody other. hope safe well. also hope little kids get chance shots soon able. live New England imagine much stressed I'd elsewhere States üò¨ know bad breakthrough infections are? people getting sick enough hospitalized? we‚Äôre midst another surge, COVID-19 endemic we‚Äôre stuck live idiocracy, I‚Äôm angry. **I‚Äôm tired.**

Leading feeling am. Absolutely nobody reinstated masking policy time amount people masks barely bumped despite county that's good 40% Democrat. 

There's unspoken agreement we're done accommodating anti-vaxxers reap they've sowed think changed entire dynamic people reacting last wave Question:
Why vast majority vaccinated go back lockdown, start wearing masks etc? It‚Äôs pipe dream we‚Äôll ever get rest country vaccinated, best hope herd immunity breakthrough cases really ‚Äújust flu bro,‚Äù least vaccinated. rip band-aid off?  True  Florida Texas currently make 50% new cases US. either genetic simply soup exposed life quite similar. anecdotes, people reactions along family lines receiving vaccine. Remember 60 Minutes show General charge gung-ho confident give us word we'll get out, whatever happened bravado? ITT, got right, 90 100 vaccinated get covid stupid probably die (and pay everything pocket go out). 90 100 fully vaccinated people get covid shows vaccines working predicted probably [smart reason vaccinated allowed get sick spread around here].  cancelled fucking wedding (or it) safety children involved, shit makes little crazy I‚Äôm talking percentage vaccinated. I‚Äôd like know hospitalization rate unvaccinated compare 7 / 900 college football game getting cancelled would encourage vaccination seeing news footage overflowing hospitals refrigerated morgue trucks. ‚ÄúEvery‚Äù key word here. unfortunately split. 

As much want precautions safe others don‚Äôt want precautions. local news rant section play, masks re-mandated course one guy went complaining governor 'wasn't following science' requiring vaxxed unvaxxed wear masks. 

I could practically guarantee lifted mandate vaxxed ditched mask, complaining new mandate despite still getting shot. accurate numbers? remember accusations Florida fudging numbers? You‚Äôre right, never will, even hell (Florida) vaccine rates trending up. getting scared. May ask exactly causing much mental distress? Thank you!! AIDS spread exhaled breath. Covid does. Big difference. Think natural immunity now. Much better vaccines breakthrough cases. /s think reactions consistent, though. depends many factors.   Apple know what's good public. DeSantis PAY THIS. Well, care all. That's got vaccinated, wearing mask around people. protecting ME. 100% this. It‚Äôs CYA bureaucracy incentives go slow carefully possible matter many die waiting. guys remember couple people committee actually voted giving Pfizer EUA? exactly too. take much heartbreak exhaustion malignant narcissism fundamentally alters empathy. We're 11 days sharp infection drop-off delta wave moment. We're also right around time seeing sharp increase following full restriction removal 19th July. current thinking Delta burnt whole population helped accelerate herd immunity thanks high vaccination rate. Next days confirm throw theory. Correct N95 mask really protects you.

The ones 'better nothing' little seems. No. left is-pissed apathetic help Governemnt giving us premature ending government programs. 

It makes stuff 18 months seem pointless. Things starting surge begin letting programs end? elect again? run Trump playbook ignoring covid?  pig, farm. 

I'm vaccinated everyone around except wee ones. makes 95% protected 5% chance getting mild symptoms. Kids even less risk vaccinated me. 

I'm good, get jab made bed. I'm going normal life. Mr. Pfizer, I'm ready booster. hell vacations Florida? Lmao stay mad idiot, haven‚Äôt ever anything said lmao. Good. saying, lose new job love unvaccinated morons, I‚Äôm going let god take care it, do, I‚Äôm going jail. 

I won‚Äôt mentally financially survive another lockdown. There‚Äôs reason they‚Äôre passing extreme voting laws. It‚Äôs absolutely sickening. know they‚Äôre killing base genuinely don‚Äôt care.

I know statistically speaking, likely catch point. Heck, felt like garbage whole week recently wondered had, somehow, caught it- nothing fatigue allergy-like symptoms gone anywhere except store (with KN95) outdoor picnic table partner vaccinated people. Would go get tested antibodies money. Well good news passed voter oppression laws earlier That's great link. work industry vaccines, usually duration efficacy need boosters unknown time initial approval.( Except booster built clinical trials like pediatric vaccines. ) that's needed initial proof efficacy 6 months safety follow up. right, there's short cut follow requirements.

The reality COVID vaccines MUCH evidence now, normal vaccine. 

I would also like let people know FDA telling us (or pharma) leave alone focus full approval. Yes tired people make decisions help *other* people. programmer, that's *definitely* accurate. absolutely create problems solve time. still get COVID even vaccine. common knowledge. appreciate response. great able expose ages via socially distanced camping! would commend you, also note likely exception. 

I also entirely agree various ages good, peer group exposure development. Adult exposure fine, make exposure going similar life experiences. covid. daughters 3 years old 4 months old. letting one one (or two one) education experienced teacher. social interaction church extra curriculars. looking home connect programs go school 2 3 days week still social school experience.

I mean, even one time genuinely altruistic intent, happen get Trump 2024, knows kind insanity he'd pull kinda power. 

Personally, say give every pro-vax person anti-vax states shot free uhaul $4,000 get fuck state. Turn Disney World modern day leper colony something. Honestly (hopefully) self solving problem. kids vaccinated we're left small group people legitimately cannot vaccinated (from understanding small group) anti vax dumbasses.

I'm sorry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! know.... UGH know.....

It's I'm gonna get all

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA Sources!!!
/s   times hops new host, chances mutate something vaccines can't protect against. we'll really back square one.   wish wanted help hospitals, get vaccine there.

Need ventilator, hospital bed? getting vaxed. message needing test vaccinated people hands one worst missteps entire pandemic. gave wrong message can't spread virus vaccinated thus endangered people working living immunocompromised people, hindered data collection effects Delta. really needs accountability messaging around pandemic media public health sources closely aligned political agendas like economic growth.  wrong all; they're meant reduce danger virus overall. prevent infections, also prevent severity others. overall viral load extremely important comes whether person actually *infected* they're *exposed*

to clear, I'm disagreeing one bit, providing little nuanced explanation works. there's binary on/off switch comes infection, instead layers. vaccine reduce layers slightly, overall highly effective.

right we're seeing highly effective vaccine that's degraded (sadly, sometimes politically motivated) fear tactics completely ignore logic constantly moving goalposts News channels make profit hate son went private school last year, total one week quarantine due *one* teacher getting Covid. Shutting schools stupid. China didn‚Äôt even long. China shut schools short periods time. know educating kids everything. Americans cater teachers unions instead contemplating lost year(s) would future country. No, desantis [has already let billions public education. intention work federal government, especially Biden office. getting vaccinated affect anyone else myself? likely spread COVID vaccinated not. hahaha..i blame you...again Govt want us panic people positive (as always creates even bigger problem). single conclusive study says Delta lower death rate. Deaths always follow spike, wait days. Delta one variant..with billion hosts wait 10x 1000x Delta soon. need put masks &amp; stop spread stopping international flights vaccinations. requested Dr denied. sounds fake heard MANY PEOPLE  people seem think long COVID risk wear masks, distance, etc. That‚Äôs viable long term plan because, say, keep happening.

You're right, not. countries high vaccination rates we'll probably see continued use masking public transport, grocery stores etc. Otherwise people accept slightly higher risk illness/death compared pre-2020, otherwise live life normal. booster shots, antiviral development etc, even restrictions may go coming decade. already explained original comment.  made stock price [go Friday. topic side note, normalcy right word here, shouldn‚Äôt normality? angry year ago.

Wearing mask inside strangers common sense Whoah, cool anti-semitic remarks nice it, once.

But longer. firm opinion, vaccinate deserve basic human rights.

They dragged hospital forcefully given vaccine. children too.

Additionally, children taken away. It‚Äôs neglect point.

There comes point excuse stupidity. mother hyper-conservative, extremely christian woman vaccine. got soon came out. love her. may opinions disagree she‚Äôs supportive parent like nothing else, ultimately makes good choices.

The reason get vaccine simply contrarian. That‚Äôs all. reason.

Do research, less Reddit brigading. 
It may save life.  agree there‚Äôs lot crappy news, it‚Äôs person interacts it.

I usually scan study they‚Äôre citing read critically evaluate numbers they‚Äôre pushing. Well, aware ‚Äúdisease characteristics‚Äù covid prior spewing nonsense that‚Äôll changed every 5 months? sounds like used make vaccine.

I think mean blood ingredient vaccine.

Like, hammer used make house, part resulting house. get sick, we'll still take care :) one remembers said shit last year masks. exact rhetoric. Reddit buys hook, line, sinker goes tribalistic. 

‚ÄúAnti-maskers holding us back beating thing! fault!‚Äù

Except it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs leaders‚Äô fault hard bungled initial continued response. let us take masks even though vaccinated unvaccinated alike still spreading thing. 

I also find incredibly convenient *super scary* variant showed exactly time began pushing vaccine. I'm also immune compromised ability stay home let go work daily go first, did. Only, many people could get shot safe go idiocy kicked variants shot may cover.

I'm furious. America: refusing adhere federal state mask mandates seen patriotic putting mask protect fellow citizens. truly bizarre times. Oh wish. Vaccinated people attention whores living sad little crisis doesn‚Äôt affect anyway, setting delusional subreddits devoted silly virus cult ushering lockdowns, mask mandates, vaccine passports etc. Thanks Washington Compost useless shite. plasma work? giving convalescent plasma earlier year shut project impression research bust.

The day Govt becomes truthful &amp; honestly let people know, that's pretty fucking bold coming biggest un-elected liar country. angry something higher chain events want know children can't vaccinated yet? pretty simple explanation. 

The data shows worth risk authorizing emergency use vaccine children risk vaccine greater risk covid children.  I‚Äôd love feel optimistic sound. optimists wrong nearly every turn past 18 months. Vaccinated people spread it, less likely large ones winding hospitals morgues. public health crisis, think we‚Äôre blaming right people. Someone work went crock shit chiropractor wrote doctor‚Äôs note saying can‚Äôt vaccinated. frustrating people actually can‚Äôt vaccinated I'm saying. nowhere deposit impotent childish rage, I'm available. buddy whose two kids recently tested positive one week another. wife vaccinated tested negative twice. week child tested negative county called said didn‚Äôt symptoms cleared go back work regular life again.

Well, friends mine Im getting pulled this, providing source reference Herd immunity levels vary disease characteristics media terms splashed around 7 months ago that: *media terms*, eternal nuanced scientific truth.

But you‚Äôre standing shoulder shoulder inside around chin, yea there‚Äôs point. Adding fact already mutated transmissible variant ppl's top excuse skip vaccine ""freedoms"".

Coronavirus virus army soldiers armed guns shield, basic antibodies shield sword. virus gets better dealing antibodies virus able reproduce fast enough learn new tactics. New variants gets created.

The vaccine gives bulletproof vest gun basic antibodies, virus tries kill army antibodies either unable get shield get killed another one. 

This happens millions time, point, virus might able mutate variant bullet piercing gun bulletproof vest, both, happens jump others, screwed.

If many vaccinated people get virus, chance virus mutating counter virus get exponential. surprised hasn‚Äôt happened assumed would option Oh, no! Anyways, ham pizza coke supper. thinking having? Yeah fuck economy right? literally everything Reddit wants.  100% agree.

Sadly, dying easier option kind person. It‚Äôs ego believed survival fittest would anti vax. agree mandates never happen Florida. governor trying kill many people possible. I‚Äôm talking COVID itself. I‚Äôm referring recent trend I‚Äôve seen online news towards wishing death choosing vaccinated, well general anger we‚Äôre seeing here, towards people half-mask  WONDER Hard say - specific conditions would directly disallow taking (I'm going EU's Pfizer documentation think vaccines jurisdictions), rather list conditions discuss doctors (serious illnesses affect immune system mostly). could find statistics many people active cancer AIDS know doctors decide individuals.

Allergies course possible, rare - think estimate clearly 0.1%, hard find difference 5 million 10 million, even millions millions vaccines given, confidence intervals pretty wide level.  black annoyance days I'm fine misinformation crowd getting sick, worry spread elderly immunocompromised people cause harm Okay locking indoors would definitely reduce transmission I‚Äôm going that. know advocating chances dying covid giving someone dying incredibly low without masks. Eventually people going asses risk move lives. don‚Äôt think government forcing wear mask eternity slight chance might give someone disease slight chance killing makes sense. apply logic, masks mandatory forever could give someone flu pneumonia cold, kill people actually kill children much higher rate COVID. rate, people die per day heart disease, don‚Äôt see CDC forcing McDonalds implement 1 BigMac per customer policy. CDC also recommends drink 2 beers max sitting, eat steaks well done, don‚Äôt eat raw cookie dough. recommendations become law?? doubt you‚Äôd agree. realistic fact people able asses risk act accordingly without government forcing us do/not things. disease already become one many coronavirus‚Äô affected humans entire existence, likelihood never go away. media scares people thinking going die despite odds incredibly low, make personal choice go better yet buy n95 readily available actually protect person wearing much better popular cloth masks don‚Äôt really much. vaccinated people still catching transmitting covid? reading many controversial posts got mine may despite never symptoms anyone cares think open back go back 100% normal.

But go hospital due Covid vaccinated, required pay $2,000 pocket per visit regardless insurance must pay admitted double going pay after.

Call staffing fee, emergency fee whatever gotta call sticks.

That way pay it, fucks credit lives much fucking vaccinated lives. issue they're taking hospital beds people deserve more. Like vaccinated person broken thumb. forcefully quarantined homes left suffocate. They're even taking beds people need surgery areas now. Agree. view huge gatherings unvaccinated folks similar mass vax site point Big brain software development here.

I wish way help you. Yep. Pretty much right get flu shot every single year. random strain big deal back 1999 used flu shot could single mutation away making COVID look tame. Honestly, shocking happened yet.

We lucky far. wearing mouth nose means you‚Äôve gotten first shot far.

/s Put booth near entrance: ‚ÄúTake Free Covid shot, sit FREE BEER thank public service. take wristband gives half food rides night. Enjoy fair, thank you‚Äù. Costs less stimulus check, it‚Äôs instant gratification. Italy.

We even [fancy per region! Worth it.  certainly can. unlikely sure, entirely possible  study Singapore came yesterday showing viral loads breakthrough hospitalizations dropped significantly days, much quicker unvaccinated patients. reasonable conclusion (and studies) average virus less opportunities replicate, therefore mutate, vaccinated individual.

There also case study last year showed one case Covid immunocompromised patient spawned MANY mutations, body struggled fight virus. 

You‚Äôre right selection pressure, side coin opportunities replication/mutation, vaccines almost certainly decrease significantly. you‚Äôre right worldwide effort.

One thing want see study re: vaccinations/mutations asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic spread. What‚Äôs likelihood vaccinated person contracting COVID, mutate transmitting even get sniffles? vaccinated likely asymptomatic spreaders (because don‚Äôt develop symptoms warn isolate), could problematic. wish US hadn‚Äôt completely idea widespread asymptomatic testing contact tracing. could still highly effective tool. Even spent billions it, would pay increased economic activity.  Well, nothing can‚Äôt prevent death. doesn‚Äôt stop us everything *delay* it. would buy argument continued follow model removing mitigations soon begin see even slightest relief. That‚Äôs problem mitigation‚Äôs removed soon. doesn‚Äôt mean need give them, especially light fact government won‚Äôt mandate vaccines top approach. won‚Äôt even military absolutely ability to. 

You correct lack vaccine bottleneck. get everyone vaccinated, propose? can‚Äôt let burn world unabated.that accelerate rate mutation we‚Äôre going bigger problem hands.

Edit clarification  idiotic thinking here, issue already seeing break infections keeps strong possibility virus mutate enough current vaccinated people longer safe back started. Definitely desperate measure. Rush fast possible jab everyone vaccines, fails enough, keep jabbing again. Can't criticise plan though means ""anti-vax""! mean, least get way worse case rona aren‚Äôt vaccinated. That‚Äôs good enough me. fact appreciate irony condemning state affairs resulted Texas able protect average citizen state better US average absolutely beyond parody. 

And no, worse deaths per million rate *much worse* Yes, like flu shot. 

I got influenza years back, years double lung transplant. mild symptoms one else household symptoms also get flu shot. 

The flu shot didn‚Äôt stop getting flu turned flu mild inconvenience instead something almost certainly would landed hospital. hasn‚Äôt done shit bring states line. however help get Cuomo hook handling nursing home infections early days. 60% Adults vaccinated fine. Unvaxxed made choice going back. Read lips new shutdown occur anywhere regardless Delta impact. afraid vaccine covid. Statistically, that's irrational, anecdotal evidence counts math people. older adults remember early polio vaccine tragedy infected, crippled killed thousands people. told repeatedly friends favored source news covid worse bad bout flu, fear new vaccine easily outweigh fear illness. I'm sure rare well-publicized casualties J&amp;J vaccine serve ease fears all. Hot take: certain flyover states holding back progress certain functional states, made make progress

How one force drivers update license every required timeframe? One, everyone despite mechanisms place, two, there's nothing constitution vehicle operation unalienable right.

As things stand quite literally easy way forward.  Yes. I'm angry. I‚Äôm kinda happy redshirting kid he‚Äôs still going going Pre-K year bit worried him, too. 

My boss recommended Flomask since it‚Äôs supposedly comfortable tough kids take idk would could even hear talk he‚Äôs wearing it‚Ä¶it seems intense.  choose unvaccinated, shall right suffer consequences decisions.

Stop locking vaccinated people. Vaccines reason reopening.  talk CDC recommending masks everyone touting dangerous Delta is. administration actually something like making unvaccinated lives hell give special privileges stimulus vaccinated people? Yes,

No. effective mandate people still refuse vax. vaccine mandate refused allergic otherwise can't get vaccine effective way deal it.

Send armed guards doctors southern areas likely someone violently resist vaccine needed Meh lived would honestly consider death covid welcome release!  Thanks do! I‚Äôm visiting family, insurance covers ER visits I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôve go twice week. I‚Äôm upset idiots!!!!! kid wait ER waiting room 6 hours puking little guts out, unvaxx Joe Shomo wife clogging services!! went back morning, hospital set new system testing entering waiting room sending home immediately upon positive result COVID ‚Äúpack‚Äù‚Ä¶ Bravo hospital!!! friend leukemia shots. Three months later, tested antibodies. 

Her immune system shut down.  point time vaccinated one highest vaccinated areas USA, I‚Äôm tired wearing mask start wearing one replace Fauci replacement advises it. I‚Äôm listening charlatan. Looks like 2018, state local tourist taxes generated $12billion. would easily made ways, like states do. ($560/citizen state).

The impact would jobs industry, without tourist industry local state government would pay way less infrastructure support tourist traffic occupation. pay much state fund infrastructure tourists tourists come (huge airports, roads, utilities, etc). expenses would go way down, loss industry (91.3 billion) would definitely hurt, wreck tax system entirely. Texas state income tax either, seem making do. property taxes fairly low here, could certainly raised replace tourist tax loss. numbers released breakthrough infections?  common would discourage vaccinations? rare want vaccinated people unmasked would allow unvaccinated unmasked also? choice duress choice. think remember said Contact tracing alberta wasnt working tho. half cases unknown origin. 

They also werent enforcing quarantine rules nothing really changing. drive 2.5 hours get mine. Low income areas affected heavily able easy access vaccine. people shit us able literally get vaccine. We‚Äôve people waiting well two months accessible vaccine locations, one listening.

Consider communities like go waving self righteous little fingers people. predictively naive. I'd also add tourism Florida, especially summer, largely states low rates vaccination. People northeast west coast tend stick areas domestic summer vacation, along mountain west. Well got covid ,never really hit hard all. told Dr. natural antibodies body developed better anything get big pharmas vaccine. own.    bet he'd drink full pitcher coolant DeSantis mandated it.    Whatever happened word ""normality""?   thanks sharing this! ‚Äî think. member Trumps cabinet literally said didn‚Äôt grant emergency use, could find jobs. Yet still took it. isn‚Äôt political pressure, it‚Äôs ending pandemic. riddle this. dealing virus survival rate becomes severe 75+ years old, vaccine readily available everyone, free, age twelve places (at least us). return full normalcy. Sure fualt placed unvaccinated literally nothing stopping people going back aside governments making rules according cdc changes mind literally everything say ""covid still bad. Keep things said didnt work notice"" playing virus hurting healthy people risk. precautions, know treat it. Nothing stopping people living lives Alberta‚Äôs current government cheap keeps cutting spending health care wherever (including nurses‚Äô salaries, middle pandemic). They‚Äôre closing public testing locations making get tested doctor‚Äôs office/clinic/hospital. don‚Äôt pay testing clinic staff contact tracers, way. 

They also seem figure ‚Äúno testing, tracing, problem‚Äù way go, don‚Äôt close schools harm precious economy. Unfortunately, may decrease transmissibility, even among asymptomatic breakthrough cases, impact number positive cases potential hospitalizations.

We really tracking breakthrough cases, particularly among different vaccines different population risk groups. Masks needed right now, long term solution.

We need vaccine mandates vaccine passports.

IMO strange view ""personal freedom"" believe government force us jobs ban us seeing loved ones holidays, cannot mandate shot might give us fever headache day. it‚Äôs actually pretty bad vaccine lessen symptoms. anecdotal evidence check covid29positive sub US fully vaccinated still big deal. one place statistical significant number people close proximity large (enough) populations unvaxed allow continued virus replication ones nothing worry getting mad ones do? it‚Äôs animal, vegan. animal products, including byproducts like honey. Vaccine disinformation needs felony.  long want England keep wearing masks for? We're pushing 90% adults vaccinated, cases falling, everything open... Except Germany Loophole , design. also get contraception free see doctor. tell parents.  ? working dead end job, got hired agency tracks insurance banks pandemic happened. work small office that's closed public got work entire time, never wear mask, life change one bit me. [As shown - clear effect vaccines hospitalisations deaths also selective magnet program specific branch science LOVES, pull homeschool year, loses spot.

I'm sure situation Texas, Washington State homeschooled children attend one two class periods school want homeschooled rest day. school gets allocated tax dollars based student headcount, kid 1 6 classes school gets 1/6th headcount allocation type attendance. homeschooled kids use way play local team sport.

If particular science class reasonable teacher make accommodations, maybe done safely one period? hour exposure day?

Another thing consider emergency approval Pfizer vaccine children 12 years old may happen early September? even make work 45 days situation might getting better soon children. time shit.   Same. qualified shot sooner got never appointments, spent months fearing lot. deal better I‚Äôm kinda back early pandemic fears despite fully vaxxed variants getting worse here, I‚Äôve told docs don‚Äôt know severe could catch it. That‚Äôs misinformation lost argument want project another statement fallacy failed you? 

Good luck helping spread false information science painful. 


If think care anecdote someone's statement, perhaps thriller2112 get together share notes. Probably adjusts correctly *a Chinese lookin* person comes line.

I frankly done. Especially country anyone get vaccinated time Oh gosh, I'm sorry happening. pro-choice party really testing patience. mean said. preferential treatment masked, social distanced, quantitatively, gotten vaccine. 

I understand people afraid shot, yes came quickly, strong heart shouldn‚Äôt burdened weak-minded. don‚Äôt stalk people‚Äôs post history either I‚Äôm taking face value.

I don‚Äôt believe health care cost anything, actually. don‚Äôt think anti-vaxxers allowed take treatment resources vaxxed. Let die Paid tax dollars too. moron class costing rest us money safety. tracked getting sick without getting hospitalized consider serious breakthrough. makes feel better, could still right, people could still intrinsically good, brought society brought selfish. bro US ! shouldn‚Äôt to, also 80% adults fully vaccinate now. Less half us fully vaccinated

I agree you, hate way mix-and-matched adult/total population numbers here. 60% adults fully vaccinated ~70% one dose (hopefully people, obviously willing get jab, follow get second shots ASAP, one shot little delta).

Less half total population fully vaccinated, said.

We need mandates, ASAP. shows [effect vaccines hospitalisations deaths I‚Äôm much ‚Äújust force people get vaccinated‚Äù train point. People‚Äôs selfish individualism costing people lives. polio pandemic going anywhere, crippled killed children human history. ever last person got vaccinated it. polio thing past. Mm, people same. people, virtue early formative experiences, susceptible sort thing. reach conspiracy theories could also counterphobic. ask everyday anyone would think good idea elect reality tv star president. People masters houses, guy. We‚Äôre little brainwashed hijacked. need hate someone due programming little different Yes, left important part context diseases associated children, COVID-19 causes deaths hospitalizations several viral diseases deemed severe enough prompt development vaccines (such chickenpox), **and appears surpassing flu.** Children‚Äôs hospitalization rates COVID-19 ‚Äúare range ‚Ä¶ see influenza given season,‚Äù Evan Anderson, MD, associate professor pediatrics Emory University School Medicine Atlanta, reported recent webinar hosted American College Medical Toxicology.
The flu typically kills 100 children year, totals ranging 39 199 recent years, according CDC. current rates, child deaths related COVID-19 stand 200 year.
**Evidence also emerging long-term effects COVID-19 young people, including fatigue, headaches, loss sense taste smell months, well long-term brain loss.** study United Kingdom found **‚Äúit becoming increasingly apparent large number children symptomatic asymptomatic COVID-19 experiencing long-term effects, many months initial infection.‚Äù**

One also avoid minimizing severity flu. Also, give children 6 months flu shot. Kids cannot yet get covid vaccinations sure know.

And one time: one variant away severe children. simply know happen next virus. Welcome world medical microbiology. Sounds like discouraging people getting vaccinated.

Did get vaccinated?    Nobody calling kids anti-vaxxers. believe US numbers? counter kits, mixed messaging vaccinated get tested not, states tinkering numbers make governors look good midterms. almost trust China early response data coming US. China close economy whim, effective way stunting outbreak, keeping people home. don‚Äôt watch news everything seems pretty normal. Asymptomatic mildly symptomatic breakthrough infections fairly common according data Israel, high vaccination rate continued testing tracking cases.

My guess US CDC want encourage narrative ""the vaccines work"". also tried use ability unmask ability skip quarantining known exposure big carrot get people vaccinated. since reversed course delta variant much infectious. someone claims care, sure lot angry comments offer. need hug? Cuppa tea? Tbh get people won‚Äôt get vaccinated. It‚Äôs right to, it‚Äôs unfair force won‚Äôt hurt anyone else themselves. 
However, wearing mask definitely long term side affects  Yep, fuck assholes  doesn‚Äôt happen, though know that; Conestoga decline vaccine, admitted hospitals covid treatment.

*It's smallpox*. Look, smallpox around anymore.  know there's Hippocratic oath all, healthcare workers allowed one slap per antivax patient deal with. even random, still takes time deviate deviate starting point (because stochastic process, next position dependent previous position). current vaccine covers range deviates, virus can't mutate enough time us make vaccine covers new variants. That's say impossible.

Given much takes mutate virus uncovered variant (ie: unvaccinated population size density India) there's way virus mutate fast enough within population NA least 60% population vaccinated. unvaxxed see friends family die off, number grow. I‚Äôm serious. flair would helpful! effective even asymptomatic covid, delta variant effective hospitalization death. ""denial"" rather virus mutating. worried additional mutations suggest loved ones get vaccinated people get vaccinated, less thing spread mutate. vox credible source  I'm simply thinking ROI get done. people wrong dangerous, threat pose becoming increasingly avoidable. think would cost effective (in terms effort resources, simple dollar price tag) get place endemic. Right something like 90% hospitalizations 98% deaths unvaccinated. IDGAF vast majority people sitting cars oxygen.

Put simply, we'll eventually reaching point reducing instances COVID-19 offers less bang buck completely unrelated issues, like promoting safe driving, behooves us discuss line drawn, rather insist quite frankly impossible solutions completely eradicate it.

And necessarily rush assume mutations going result severe illness death. myriad evolutionary pressures play, favor deadly strains, less so. Except there‚Äôs simple lab test determines whether specimen positive many pathogens, including influenza, RSV, strep. There‚Äôs incentive Covid vs flu, Covid typically costly treat, higher rate mortality. 

There‚Äôs benefit patient Covid vs influenza, difference hospitalized patients treated. Health insurance companies certainly don‚Äôt want pay more, effective treatments include dexamethasone, generic decades. fine. Even get Covid won‚Äôt serious issues since vaccinated mild case. person realize normal left Delta? Vaccinated people getting sick spreading it. We‚Äôre heading straight another lockdown.

REMEMBER KIDS 12 unvaxxed. Yet even President like ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs go person learning‚Äù even though every teacher already set virtual, parents working home‚Ä¶been year, more.  Haven‚Äôt vaccinated kind played hand though? 

By following prompts get vaccinated ASAP, you‚Äôve shown you‚Äôre willing go along government directives response pandemic. 

If CDC came tomorrow said mandates passport weren‚Äôt necessary wouldn‚Äôt vaccinated population go lives stop worrying this? latest track record would indicate yes.

So there‚Äôs less consideration towards backlash among group don‚Äôt predisposition noncompliance past requests. K12? whiner lol guy one dumbest governers time. understand seventh grade biology unlike you, doesn‚Äôt understand mutations completely random, means saying variant come x based nothing speculation LOL nope, people took seriously first months, it. say part issue psychological. hard adapt something body thinks interprets badly. 

My mother wore N95 mask ended passing out, swore masks, ended telling doctor appointment. show wore mask, right. started complaining breathe, started hyperventilating, got dizzy. 

He took off, got O2 monitor, watch oxygen levels. hardly dipped (and well within acceptable normal parameters). thought breathe mask made harder, body interpreted worse was. learned calm down, slow breathing, pay attention it, realized actually problem. 

After days said notice nearly badly first time. swears, however, sure breathe first time. Turns *idea* breathe scared much brain interpreted literally breathe. (Like someone panic attack feels like can't breathe. absolutely can, psychological situation problem body.) know sometimes think it‚Äôs willing comply irritates people like stopped actually thought fact actually matter changed mind wore mask, wouldn‚Äôt make difference millions upon millions unvaccinated. already one, came India (delta). Others surely come, likely nothing people U.S. get vaccine, likely millions unvaccinated around world Asia Latin America. ever, reason, anything anyone, reason, ever, matter get that. It‚Äôs matter semantics, I‚Äôd call business restrictions shutdowns, opposed lockdowns hardcore stay home order. me, anyway.  even anti-vaxxers point? Genuinely. *I* do? Yeah, it‚Äôs difference foreclosed identity achieved identity. meme statement would essentially claim achieved identity doesn‚Äôt exist. 

It‚Äôs much reasoning-by-bumper-sticker-message see Republicans, immune evidence. 

Look person replied me, effectively agreeing statement, even realizing it. Ah ok. dumb ass. There's also links cognitive decline.

I've seen headline/claim.. (yet) found good reliable sources read it,.. know ? Yeah. basically read obits living. obits details. already seen family says person got shots soon could, masked beginning, either got covid doses 'less protected,' category. anti-vaxxers going die. 

Also parent, hate kid... would concerned idea catching novel virus wven kill them. barely beginning catch serious EBV long run, implicated lot serious conditions. 

People think unvaccinated hurting wrong. They're fucking masses. freedom go maskless *and* refuse vaccine *and* go crowded spaces infringement freedom others. Honestly, could pick 2 3. pick 3 fucking dangerous everyone. Freedom choice job properly. Ah course. consistently wrong me, you. known. impotent rage makes sound informed I'm hoping we'll see companies jump ""if want work vaccinated"" bandwagon FDA approval happens (I've heard within next couple months). encourage (but all) get vaccine.

I wish could get 3 year old vaccinated. fuck polarizing titles lately?  you‚Äôre vaccinated, care? It‚Äôs herd immunity since mRNA vaccines aren‚Äôt kind people allergic to. justification hating anti vaxxers before. it? tired, exhausted. Iv read delta variant 1000 times transmissible original strains

I'd love read lmfao, mind sharing? matters enormously people accuse government political pressure FDA. Schools businesses waiting results make decisions same. Ron Howard: didn't. wait sigma!  Boo hoo lol.. nobody anything Choice, right? exactly happened father. Everyone around got vaccinated, including wife, refused. Got covid pastor, got miracle infusion, started telling people bad. 5 weeks still cannot mow small yard without feeling like ran marathon. gets winded walking stairs. I'm happy stupid ass still alive everytime starts yapping bad ask run upstairs grab something real quick. Yes, set beliefs, open new information, unlike you. Please respond comment. done discussing you. worried additional mutations suggest loved ones get vaccinated people get vaccinated, less thing spread mutate.

This denial I'm talking about. Since vaccinated also spread mutations occur naturally people infected spread virus, saying vaccinating stop mutations naive, dare saw wrong. I'm vaxxed one stop shop fight thing. We'll need masks lockdowns way we've seen thing stop spreading causing mutations that. However vaxxed teflon affair going simply smart. contribute possibility mutations rhinking that's thing need do. part solution need nore ensure less mutations. hosts virus naturally, opportunities mutate. one dragging anyone echo chamber dumb lol. getting shots, cure. flu shot point Among unvaccinated left part correct, concerns quickly developed never early adopter anything unsure (in avenues life). believe chances vaccine safe effective.

However, disconnect I've already COVID. (?) common knowledge get virus body capable providing natural defense future infection. shroud panic polarization willfully thrown away concept pushing vaccinations already COVID. 

This makes sense, limited argument ""better safe sorry"" ""experts believe vaccination may assist natural immunity"" simply convincing enough arguments feel akin peer pressure anything substance. stupid one. think pretty rational argument. follow logic, obvious would masking forever always chance spread diseases could kill someone. case human history. Furthermore locking indoors comparable wearing masks, know this. example crazy people become obsess many cases covid even vaccines broken link Covid deaths. look evidence, cases skyrocketing deaths remained extremely low weeks. Also wearing masks forever fake argument. legitimately seen people reddit saying masks mandatory winter months forever. hope it‚Äôs insane people skewed front page reddit, seen several people argue permanent. also genuinely believe masked distanced learning kids able talk friends hasn‚Äôt negative effect children‚Äôs mental health learning? n95s vaccines widely available people protect themselves. job protect people proven ways protect refuse use?? I‚Äôm saying I‚Äôm 100% favor personal risk assessment personal choice isn‚Äôt forced government, apparently that‚Äôs vile disgusting resort hurling insults.

And way, things life, precisely don‚Äôt want government forcing restrictions reason evidence back up. variant around vaccine. research instead believing actors TV screen. That‚Äôs way Seattle metro area March-May 2020. winter different. ski resorts packed restaurant offered covered outdoor seating patio heaters slammed, even weather wa bad.  Insurers already payment structures pay obese smoking. sky-high premium refusing COVID vaccination? Indians? made laugh. 

That said, think Florida counts tourists. Honestly, antivaxxers political motivations. ones know refuse got covid first wave mild. So, fear it. 

I question getting vaccine took 15 minutes day little know side effects. would simply valid reason get beyond politics  force people either take experimental medical procedure still trials forego medical assistance rest lives?

Can honestly see wrong? figured Herd Immunity well known &amp; research topic. mean, that‚Äôs media made think splashed shit around 7 months ago. like ‚Äútwo weeks flatten curve‚Äù. Someone Fauci‚Äôed Florida. Hospital workers coerced treat covid patients refused vaccination. misunderstanding evolution. Yes people infected covid billions virus particles course infection. Yes replications chance mutation. However, unvaccinated person, vaccine resistant mutation offers advantage non-vaccine resistant mutation. likely even mutation occur, would outcompeted die off. vaccinated person, vaccine resistant mutation would significant advantage strains would likely come dominate person‚Äôs body. 

If see vaccine resistant strain overwhelmingly likely came vaccinated person‚Äôs covid infection. 

This problem type vaccine use, non sterilizing, rollout vaccine, took place months. Lockdowns aren‚Äôt never considered long term solutions. Masks, distancing, proper hygiene importantly vaccines ways keep virus surging. initial lockdowns supposed stopgap figured else keep hospitals collapsing. flatten curve. 

In US, unlikely we‚Äôll sort widespread lockdown, ever really did. always half measures many people ignored. 

Vaccines answer. lockdowns. Perfectly stated. current reproductive rates (~1.35 based 4-day serial interval 70% weekly case growth nationwide) we'd expect 40% susceptible population catch delta school year starts, though highly regional. Nobody possibly predict actually happen though. not? wish someone would talking predictions delta kids school starting. I‚Äôm supposed start work preschool end August I‚Äôm bit anxious it. can‚Äôt really socially distance preschoolers although expected wear masks. did. problem   People responsible police government enforced lockdown will. knows he's high risk, understands potential consequences removing it. lucked incredibly responsible preteen, expect kids show mask, any, continue wear throughout day. We're sending KN95 every day long there. Working hard rearrange life accommodate homeschooling. saw someone talk potentially charging extra like smokers insurance. liability. kind makes sense. France, America. shows ppl know nothing literal point vaccinations are.. soooo stupid hurts heart say there's significant risk! vaccinated, outdoors, small group act layers protection. risk comes close contact extended period time eating. weight costs (small chance covid exposure) benefits (seeing friends!) keeping mind layers protection /do/ see reason call whole thing off! best track record here. China, country hid pandemic beginning destroyed evidence reporting cases, imagine it‚Äôs significantly ‚Äú75 cases‚Äù

Now wait CCP bot downvotes yep, whole family waiting it.  fully vaccinated (I'm still eligible live) I'd go whatever wanted without worries, especially outdoors 4 people lol Yeah, thinking, ‚ÄúWhat use inhumane insurance system *good* once?‚Äù Bill shit people COVID-related expenses.

Let unvaccinated people chose. want choice. Stop 24/7 news coverage nagging. conspiracy theorist, shit smells like ""agenda"". two things, people denying two things causing problem. PROBLEM. 

Again. mad non-vaccinated persons. mad sketchy, red blue, suspicious, vote me, passively-accusatory handling whole thing. you‚Äôre making things up. It‚Äôs okay wrong, don‚Äôt put words peoples mouths don‚Äôt fear virus‚Ä¶the virus doesn‚Äôt give shit

Keep kids home deny ability gain/develop social skills peers, might get Covid, despite evidence showing barely affects kids common cold.

Makes sense!

Just people underreact don‚Äôt bother vaccinate idiots, doesn‚Äôt mean overreacting less stupid.

The decision homeschool otherwise healthy kids minor risk catching Covid poorly thought decision. 

Kids‚Äô social development already stunted unable interact person and/or unable see others‚Äô facial expressions keeping home another year blows mind. 

I wonder also keep playground it‚Äôs theoretically possible break necks falling monkey bars. One way another unfortunately. happens August 13? vaccination 89% effective delta variant. It‚Äôs still one effective vaccines time. 

The issue is, unvaccinated assholes there, higher transmission rates be, vaccinated people catch spread virus. 

There‚Äôs clear end sight this: get fucking vaccine. Wait you‚Äôre saying anti maskers problem now? We‚Äôll we‚Äôre fucked since barely anyone wearing masks now, even solid blue California Bay Area. though. people need understand ones chosen I‚Äôm angry.

Since mRNA vaccines target spike protein, mean new variants won‚Äôt spike shape? thought trait coronaviruses. 

What potential mutations would make vaccines ineffective? 

This might require scientific answer absorb. Vaccinated hosts spread it, likely spread it.

You missed point unvaccinated hosts probably home sick bed, vaccinated hosts likely community contacting infecting people, vaccinated hosts mild symptoms may aware Delta infection.

So course right 'all things equal' vaccinated hosts contagious, they're likely close contacts they're infectious. side effects, micro chips, 5g, Biden's fault, but. done? lost sad brother family's stupidity. News flash people like reading story, using confirmation bias used , ignoring it. fit B.S. want believe. talking African-American community like that?

They have, far, lowest vaccination rate. They're stupid, different value system. lot people believe world. Bad things happen bad people reason kind deal. rooted religion well - I'm good [insert religion here], God protect family me. 

Some plain logical selfishness - I'm low risk population, risk vaccine could end damaging protect people? 

Assuming anyone agree stupid counter productive. Pay attention reasoning, core values line thinking. understand position, can't change mind. reason using ruleset convince them, call stupid follow different ruleset you.

My family managed convince mom get vaccine, berating assuming dull understand, understanding addressing fears. Also living proof vaccine really bad. Peer pressure works pretty well. (?) common knowledge get virus body capable providing natural defense future infection (of near similar variant). 

The virus provide much immunity vaccine, whether virus not. provide sources Johns Hopkins corroborate would like read them. Oh man dumb enough think anything free world. What, 15? Tax dollars, tax dollars paying this, Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J, AZ making holy fucktons money.

How dense? Draconian Australian policies? least we‚Äôre free living normal lives apart short lockdowns. It‚Äôs nice worrying getting Covid wear masks worry family friends dying. draconian. big countries (edit: Russia US) still locked research labs, could come back someone messes bad. I‚Äôm vaccinated.

Honestly, something legislature needs sink collective teeth into. fail take correct measures ... that's really uncharted territory. governor, staff, know full well stake. held accountable.  stopped talking covid election day promised.

/s suggesting testing people hospitalized dying? Cause would certainly bold claim way around, ways, masks protected well. would much simpler selfish people effect health compromised am. Pretty ignorant statement. Sarcasm? Hopefully whether mutate point fully (100%) evades vaccine protection unlikely

Are scientist field giving layman's opinion? Angry people angry wonder many people imploring lost loved ones? listen, work? No. now. I'm vaxxed one stop shop fight thing. We'll need masks lockdowns way we've seen thing stop spreading

Wait saying we'll need stay locked even everyone vaccinated? WTF? Yeah, no. way. Definitely not.

I proved wrong, you‚Äôre scrambling. Case closed. wonderful day live Florida. new Covid 19 epicenter. I'm fully vaccinated still wear masks whenever go indoors (either grocery shopping, running errands, even hanging friends' house). 

Nothing pisses walking around grocery store seeing 3 4 people wearing mask. Everyone else walking around pandemic longer exists. Nobody can't get mRNA vaccines. people can't get second dose allergic reaction first. truly vulnerable still higher risk vaccination young healthy vaccination. seen multiple scientists trust suspicious claim infected vaccinated people spread COVID-19 well infected unvaccinated people. example, Derek Lowe quotetweeted [this thread retweeted [this showing Singapore (so different vaccines), vaccinated people initially showed viral load, viral load decreased much faster.

I'm US, example, smokers pay higher health insurance premiums non-smokers they're engaging high-risk behavior likely need expensive healthcare services. feel like choose get vaccinated (barring legitimate health concern, documented doctor) you, too, pay more.

However, *reality* would happen is, they'd get hit higher premiums; complain Big Government reason can't afford healthcareüôÑ Keep blaming unvaccinated Western people yet governments completely ignore BILLIONS people never vaccinated live within governments can't afford give shit enough provide vaccination. Check Figure 2 short, % population regard vaccine rate Hispanics worst, followed slightly Africans, Caucasian finally Asians best overall.

Which groups likely vote D? R? know answer.

Tying vaccines politics serves make us jump hoops pin politics. really preconceived notions individual, CULTURE. race, politics. people feel sorry young get vaccine, already immunocompromised still living like hermits want die coronavirus, medical staff deal unvaccinated idiots filling emergency rooms.

Agreed, empathy willfully unvaccinated ran ago. Healthy, vaccinated people really lot worry about, except possible cold-like symptoms possibility spreading others. I'm saying wrong problem, solution. Let put another way: implement strict ""vaccinate isolate"" would require government apparatus expensive quite frankly terrifying. decide draw line say ""good enough."" feel like saying people locked away contributes discussion (a) socially politically possible get done, we're realistic, (b) gives constant bitching ""oppression"" modicum legitimacy. know it‚Äôs vaccinated people causing variant? Vaccinated people still transmit disease stands reason mutating stronger version overcome vaccine. Many scientists warned us silenced socials. need data. think recommendation appropriate mask shortage conditions option, otherwise washed mask inferior alternative.

[This explains issue. Washing mask degrades electrostatically-charged layer responsible major factor contributing filtration efficiency N95 masks presence intermediate layer charged polypropylene electret fibers trap particles electrostatic electrophoretic effects. charge degrade mask used. Moreover, simple decontamination procedures (e.g., use alcohol) degrade remaining charge polypropylene, thus severely impacting filtration efficiency post-decontamination.

Secondly yet know vaccination reduces transmisbility Delta catch it, early CDC analysis looks pessimistic clear cannot used analysis designed  No, guidance messaging. headings mean nothing first post big rant totally disagreeing slip completely messed rollout,

If country 2 people living coronavirus, country 100% infected. variants concern less likely develop country 1% country 60 million people get infected.

The problem political messaging running ruining shit rest us nearly badly themselves. unvaccinated getting crushed, rest us are... frustrated, worried, understanding badly could still spiral, they're largely ones *dying*. 

As result, usual propaganda cycle work. Vaccine refusers enablers clearly stupid assholes blame *can't blame anyone else way ever take hold outside cult. DeSantis pushing Vaccination hard could stay open collect money could get paid.

There preliminary evidence hit preprint servers viral load vaccinated cases diminishes faster unvaccinated cases.

There evidence risk death vaccinated increased substantially Delta. Except opinion. antivaxxers dying COVID, paper plate. actually surviving, they‚Äôre hospitalized often. dying rate claim/wish. infected/hospitalized. Vaxxed people dying too, rate. However, you‚Äôre misinterpreting results make seem like vaxx = death case, never case look pandemic vaxx came out. 

3% mortality still low considered globally cannot justify authoritarianism. I‚Äôm angry government reach. people aren‚Äôt comfortable getting it. another issue divide people on. grandfather 78 bought feed store months ago. reasoning since cures covid, people even saying cancer, price going sky rocket cost much. best get enough friends/family members whilst cheap 'just case'. can't man.

That still ignores effects kids breakthrough cases.

Way cherry pick way comment. hope refuse medical care. can‚Äôt careful knows what‚Äôs really tongue depressor. sad, Delta gotten good spread vaccinated people well. (That said, chance illness quite low vaccinated, chance serious illness even lower. zero, though. vaccinated folks go hospital, presumably Delta.)

I think vaccinated folks might willing move stop masking/distancing rare. reason Delta going around get virus control fast enough. nowhere near limiting Delta, fact keeps growing, partly unvaccinated spreading much.

With Delta spreading even vaccinated (mostly asymptomatic, 100%), feels like options, ""mask distance forever"" contain CoViD.

And 15% you‚Äôre quoting per link isn‚Äôt hospital deaths, it‚Äôs severe illness nursing homes.

A 15% nursing home severe illness figure average going map directly general population death figure. even close. Yes. 

But lots die virus claimed fear. may sound crazy think extent cdc guidelines made create resentment among vaccinated unvaccinated caregivers. Parents, grandparents, etc?

All access free effective vaccine. opting take society whole anymore. locking never solution except insofar bought time time vaccines developed, hospital capacity increase, masks (espicially n95s also 3 ply surgical style masks) produced. lockdowns extremely effective place, sustainable, cost human life (delayed organ transplants etc), cases always spiked afterwards.

I much pro-lockdown subreddit, zero reason lock now. masks, vaccines, lockdown nothing get people use - anything, would also make people less willing listen government recommendations around issues like vaccination. Someone please tell full approval still pending?? anyone believe approve them??

The CDC fumbled ball first quarter insisted developing test rather use one already proved effective. test found defective tried again. resulted month delay testing absolute critical time.

Bovine coronavirus corona(CO)virus(VI) disease(D), use acronym. really silly argument. It‚Äôs likely covid patients need oxygen it‚Äôs easiest use lines running walls. expert, guess. directly top head statistics ever breakthrough infection rate is. I've read maybe lower closer 85% protection 15% breakthrough statistics would still hold. 

But still even lower protection quickly trend zero vaccinated population (0.0125%-0.1% chance using example last comment one extra step). breakthrough rate higher still trend zero slower, much. (using 15% 3 infections would 0.3375%)

The issue holds vaccinated individuals, unvaccinated individuals seen resetting chain starting back 5-10% breakthrough. That's allowed variant get foothold. virus establish immune population. China mrna vaccine trails Mexico, failling biontech deal still used. Cansino equivalent adenovirus vaccine iirc. Thanks updating comment. think mark beat revelations.

In countries, like US, anti-mask sentiment strong cultural background political absurdity.

Epidemiologists saying COVID-19 likely become endemic year. I‚Äôm sure draw particular line, see news, seems like we‚Äôre U.S Show I‚Äôm wrong you‚Äôll make day. antibody test take? normal covid antibody tests really show antibodies mRNA vaccines different. use specialized test designed vaccine antibodies. wrote song lyrics encouraged exactly that... recorded bc fear backlash like got. Fr though 35, fully vaxxed &amp; healthy, basically got nothing worry about. point view situation green light openly kill idiots refuse get board society, well older generations fucked planet made life incredibly hard us. Time wipe make real progress happen.  Meanwhile vulnerable people vaccine doesn‚Äôt work catch COVID spoiled brats won‚Äôt a) wear mask others (BOTH SIDES) and/or b) get vaccinated.

WASH DAMN HANDS, TAKE SHOES TROMP HOUSE, WEAR MASK GET VACCINATED.

For feel immediate need downvote:


Go find much dependent get one die. tell already can‚Äôt afford hospital bill. people make crazy. Either wear right don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs like child school trying skirt around dress code. False. They're less likely infected, less likely serious infection, less likely spread develop new variants. Swap statement  Uneducated, rural, hicks standing way what? pride? lost respect people second made clear they'd rather insurrection attempt. Even though Republicans unvaccinated, ere's alarming amount Democrats quietly wanting get vaccine either Many. bigger worry recombines body someone may also infected another coronavirus COVID-19 pick partial change amino acids Subunit 1 receptor binding domain entirely new spike protein from, say, coronavirus would clasisfied common cold flu strain. Pro liberal university professor scared leave ivory tower share germs peasants. Oh üò´And special little offspring. Can‚Äôt going daycare dirty Florida children. ever make through? sorry!  Oh, apologies. thought normal person engaging good faith discussion, COVID hoaxer plague rat trying jerk.

My mistake. Yeah, I‚Äôm fucking angry. I‚Äôm tired shit. slightly change US-centric mentality, well good push vaccine passport, variants come US. came countries people vaccinated. goal prevent new variant emerging, would better target billions people can't get vaccine rather unwilling privileged citizens 1st world countries. both, folks refused take precautions spread new, contagious variants everywhere. can't future-proof vaccine possible mutations. care enough wear mask. Wearing wrong makes idiots.  coercion freedom. Freedom treat stupid ass preventable diseases. anti-vaxxers using wide spread contagion created proof vaccine doesn‚Äôt work.

Standard GOP bullshit. Break something, point broken thing proof work, complain it. protecting tho  hardest cope ever.  One thing heard viruses evolve get deadlier start burn hosts die quickly pass virus. COVID seems contagious. Since mix vaccinated unvaccinated, could virus evolve use vaccinated hosts become deadlier unvaccinated? Oh no‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry parents won‚Äôt listen this. son also asking get vaccine, he‚Äôs ten isn‚Äôt able yet. he‚Äôs going back school person fall, second child year ago Tuesday, worried bringing anything back home baby sister. tourism. vacationing Florida place super packed. restaurants beaches crowded. Everyone wants gangsta (or anti vaxx) time gangsta (way contagious version disease starts spreading like wildfire) According BNO: [COVID-19 hospitalizations Florida reached highest level since July 2020. current rate reach all-time high within 4 Insurance refuse cover hospitalizations unvaccinated. Hospitals turn away ER. Yup. I‚Äôm upset putting kids unnecessary risk. point couldn‚Äôt give flying fuck intentionally unvaccinated reap sow. one way find out‚Ä¶ seen data, understand virus. did, making statement ""I'm good"". Delta going burn US vaxxed not, didn‚Äôt originate within vaxxed community, luckily vaccine stopping death Thank sharing experience. hope stories like help make situation ""real"" people lucky enough personally affected. One problem pandemic see effect actions lack action others. personally, workplace strict rules masking distancing, able see firsthand stopped virus tracks everyone benefit seeing effects easy get frustrated fatigued measures, able see save lives except abstract hypothetical way. aggravating. want enjoy life without fearing health family myself.  don‚Äôt make covid deadly dude lol, they‚Äôre going full Greek alphabet them. 

Shows know science. 

Viruses care letters, note didn‚Äôt provide number deaths 0-17 population concerned confidently stating wrong.

I noticed make comment point. Rare deaths not, virus continue mutate kill. ""rare deaths"" excellent chance common without enough vaccinated. That's point thats difference one person getting high praying Jesus bunch people saying ""mah fweedoms"" people getting sick dying around lifting finger help.

Individual freedoms affect individual only. Getting vaccinated affects everyone.

Learn difference, dude. I‚Äôm honestly suspecting swinging. It‚Äôs lot late night hot tub parties.  them. us. fact regarded 'indivudual choice' rather airborne pandemic us us sych shit show. Hahahahahaha need get information proper authority! Immediately!  Funny thing that.. Look UK, recent report 60/40 Non vax / Vaxed . would also recommend finding ""unfiltered"" NSW-Australia report earlier week. 141 hospitalized. 140 Vaccinated. Seems US 90% unvaxed. I‚Äôm selfish, got vaccine. it. What‚Äôs selfish able comprehend people different perspectives you. tools everyone keep safe. won‚Äôt community problem anymore. way fight war changed. Ya percentage stuff still implies pretty good efficacy high vaccination rates among staff (93% one hospital), that's bad news.

Well, 80% cases among vaccinated staff, 90% staff vaccinated, means getting cases rate everyone else. vaccines appear anything case rate, read this, Delta here. seems like huge difference expecting thinking vaccinated. 

I remember authorities last six months saying ""vaccines make difference case rates."" seems pretty profound me. guess would like triage. Who's likely survive live fulfilling life treatment? ones refuse free preventative care, proving trust science medicine need later on? people actively participate well being?

Another redditor compared transplant list, apt parallel think. Who's gonna get liver lungs, sedentary alcoholic smoker?

When healthcare resources capacity, need prioritize treating take seriously. No. put enough pressure feckless politicians mandate vaccine. means unvaccinated adults die (because let‚Äôs face it‚Äôs almost unvaccinated adults) it. Vaccines way out, mostly improperly worn masks.  California  mean large point contention Elvis ""bad boy"" establishment like. celebrities politicians tone deaf people's problems course people would remain skeptical.

The CDC remained consistent lot information surrounding vaccine rushed mass near amount clinical trials. took polio 100 years universally accepted. vaccine nearly 9 months. I'm fairly sure I'm mistaken, could difference labeling. N95 rather firm fitted face make sure there's gapping. surgical mask three ply fits loosely face. KN95s sold basically hybrid two. husband cardiologist wear N95 mask every day year. vaccinated wore KN95 teach day could speak easily fitted N95. vaccinated January switched surgical mask think I'm back KN95 school year. Thank Data coming Florida considered political. incident governor sent armed cops seize computers someone sharing covid data made clear.

I honestly know good bad things push stop safety measures enforced assuming worst.  yet they'll claim people wearing masks ""pussies"" ""afraid."" Believe me, care. live? Due level sequencing perform U.K. relative rest world, it‚Äôd probably advantage emerge we‚Äôd amongst first countries detect variant started spreading. hope so. Oh help saying something truly awful Don‚Äôt wanna mask, don‚Äôt wanna social distance, don‚Äôt want vaccine. exactly numb nuts want?! wanting shit, none us shit.  numbers table linked above. long enough. want money back. I've working paying trash system decades. want back. Yeah feel way‚Ä¶can move florida‚Ä¶it‚Äôs it‚Ä¶.take Texas bbq Missouri masochist. I'm you: absolutely fucking exhausted.

Where live (Nova Scotia), *almost* COVID free. locked early hard, vax rate 76% now, pretty strict quarantine enter province.

Unfortunately, joined local provinces create 'Atlantic bubble,' allow free travel Atlantic provinces. one them--New Brunswick, Conservatives power--is relaxing restrictions long woods. almost certainly means expecting fall surge, likely Delta, we're fucked. He's financed Russians 30 years. specifically explicitly called help Russia candidate. repeatedly took word Russian president US Global intelligence communities. softballed sanctions effectively surrendered military base Russians. 'try tie Russia', Trump Russian asset entire time. point, don‚Äôt want people think I‚Äôm one idiots. unvaccinated aren‚Äôt issuing new mandates lockdowns. never asked protected government true, lasted centuries. too, also vaccines going bad US cause people won‚Äôt take infuriating Engineer, EMT, Doctor.

You quite career! One differences year last year last year large cities mask mandates. vast majority people live wore masks. never ‚ÄúWild West‚Äù governor made be. now. hardly anyone masks. 

Half state vaccinated, though you‚Äôd hardly know infected numbers. Still, wear self-protective mask inside businesses don‚Äôt become breakthrough. last thing want help virus figure punch vaccines better. 

If vaccines stop working, Florida keeps masks (as started mass big cities CDC gave clear), think shit show life time. Well, step one would wearing mask, stem tide, won‚Äôt hear that. someone who‚Äôs self reported angry are, sure seem letting anger get way common sense health practices. I‚Äôm mask beginning/vaxxed soon possible guy too. I‚Äôm understanding position/frustration...carrying water anti mask/ anti vax idiots almost bear...but alternative becoming one them. can‚Äôt do. Well, daughter group 4- unvaccinated young mask up. She‚Äôs almost 10 months old. also congenital lung disorder don‚Äôt feel like playing odds with. although husband group 1, really, can‚Äôt enjoy life daughter group 1. Lots people aren‚Äôt dying though. 7 day average deaths US around 350. January 3,000. Live life. *In today‚Äôs episode ‚ÄúNo shit, Sherlock!* Delta main strain Europe, increased infections, things hospitalisations deaths increased rate.

Vaccination works. Home schooling possibility you? camp incredibly frustrated refusing get vaccinated, I‚Äôm also frustrated media grabbing onto narrative running it. vaccine hostile reading WaPo, CNN, MSNBC, NYT, etc headlines articles continue make us feel justified anger. justified? Perhaps, also leads us thinking EVERYONE yet receive vaccine ‚Äúvaccine hostile‚Äù camp. type confirmation bias productive , certainly won‚Äôt help vaccine hesitant roll sleeves. I‚Äôm saying know media encourage folks, saying fanning flames anger frustration definitely going make things better. Yeah, I‚Äôve emotionally drained bs democrats pulling quite bit too.  health insurance companies allowed charge smokers 50% premiums states, ‚Äúsmoker-friendly‚Äù carriers not. smoke, may able find one companies shop hard enough.‚Äù

Smoking basically behavior it‚Äôs legal states charge health insurance. stupid annoying. keep telling myself, really I'm (though may benefit), cousins' kids young get vaxxed, people like one discord pals medical conditions can't get vaxxed, elderly aunt who's vaxxed still may susceptible age. 

And me, I've dodged damn virus long, matter principle. intend catch possibly avoid, even worse bad cold I'm vaxxed. lol  I've heard credible sources August 13th day! /s link above. case afraid click it, California lower number Florida. New York/New Jersey hell last year, they're ok.

But discuss current numbers trends. Florida moment really bad compared US state seems, actively works becoming even worse. Yep. Well 90% hospital patients deaths COVID latest wave unvaccinated people. 

Which bit ticked headlines read tested positive vaccinated. That's great, actually symptomatic suffering disease? No? news? 

Public health experts, date, repeatedly stated breakthrough cases still within expected margins. Nobody said getting vaccine prevent getting COVID. unlikely make seriously ill less threat public health. entirely point.  lot people irrationally devoted idea personal freedom irresponsibly risk people's lives.

If lives risking I'd okay this. take life hands, that's you. fact put everyone around risk makes believe mandates necessary. Worked beautifully polio like back day. Natural selection creates variants avoid vaccines. 

The TVA slipping. work considering 98% dead unvaxxed sadly medical professionals give anti-vaxxers validation ignorant beliefs. one thing facebook keto mommies touting anti-vaxx nonsense, someone medical training says it, already think way ""medical professional"" backing up.  beautiful post. saw someone whose videos I've watched time time youtube today. agree lot says makes think. find line. 
However, today upset fact mother elderly took vaccine ill (not ill really, much sounds aged related). attributes mother's decline vaccine convinced whole thing way government rid certain segment population. 

&amp;#x200B;

She angry. low levels trust government (and would say good reason unrelated vaccine). struck pain anger displaying stupid thought people could get vaccine. America before, look Jacobson vs. Massachusetts. Supreme Court said ‚Äúreal liberty could exist operation principle recognizes right individual person use [liberty], whether respect person property, regardless injury may done others.‚Äù childhood neighbors Florida. They‚Äôve going around past two years like it‚Äôs nothing. mother (my parents‚Äô neighbor,) afraid visit them, wonder that‚Äôs also part plan.  Agreed, think diseases still good vaccine yet, RSV, EBV, malaria three I'd really like see sooner rather later. life didn‚Äôt matter them. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre going way treat differently. You‚Äôre treating exactly treated vaccinated choose wear mask reason. You‚Äôre fucking insane. Aside apparent benefit vaccine lessen Long Covid symptoms, lose re-introducing something body you‚Äôre certain already protection from?

I‚Äôm one people. got Covid time signed vaccine (December 2020) time actually eligible receive (April 2021). still got vaccine. 

The way look it, body got fought Vanilla virus antibodies said ‚Äúok know shows again‚Äù, getting vaccine way reinforce information:

Phase 1- got Covid, body‚Äôs like ‚Äúok, know‚Äù
Phase 2- first vaccine shot, body‚Äôs like ‚Äúok, got it, know.‚Äù
Phase 3- second vaccine shot, body‚Äôs ‚ÄúBRUH. KNOW THANKS‚Äù

I would rather skipped first part, tbh. Desantis idiot know common knowledge cant keep getting away this. I‚Äôll still wear mask.

But Christ, can‚Äôt vent? Months ago actually predicted sub would descend hysteria Florida (and south general) predictable summer spike. want know else? Florida spike peak within around two weeks post, *with added measures place*.

After Rockies likely start spike, suddenly every post South Dakota's lack measures (despite par neighbours, rising falling roughly time).

And favourite time year - December. suddenly states peaking inconvenient mention name. rage directed broader groups instead

I'm sure what's worse - guys following year half learnt nothing, angry people predictable. CDC said ‚Ä¶. /s Again, mutations completely random. Yes, may higher chance randomly occurring specific location higher population, there‚Äôs way say ‚Äúlikely‚Äú come anywhere. case, US lead new deadly variant height second wave December. submission linking businessinsider.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* You‚Äôre damn right we‚Äôre frustrated really issue. trying call people stupid problem CDC leading scientists biggest mouthpieces. Even idol sub Dr. Fauci saying 2-3 months ago fully vaccinated people return living life normal, without masks.

I'm sure point people received vaccine took green light, began living life normal again, stopped checking COVID news told fine.

It's easy call everyone stupid, reality stupid people rash decision making know better led this.  I'm right neighbor! much matter (in terms US people vaccinated), LOT rest world unvaccinated due lack supply/infrastructure, likely next variant emerge. migrate here. This. Also, major insurance payers need band together refuse cover COVID related services unvaccinated. Yeah that's side sword. Big angry around. Can't wait full approval assholes shock employers require get shots. Soft coercion literally way getting 80%. majority county vaccinated now. 97% effective still 3% 150,000,000+ people get virus. vaccine working outbreaks mostly happen crowded events fizzle people go back mostly vaccinated communities.

Events unvaccinated states different story. Republicans done getting Americans killed thing yet.  Burdening hospital hurts others. expect reward, feel like wasted 2020. Sorry false. Everyone wearing masks going around general. people don‚Äôt wear restaurants places likely get infected. kinda wish could keep work home, social distancing, even masks, long could travel easily wasn‚Äôt constant threat covid. Basically keep lot good changes get rid bad create new normal. really don‚Äôt want go back precovid ‚Äúnormal,‚Äù whatever might mean, instead use lessons last couple years improve conditions people.   RSV fever? kid started coughing last Friday tested negative COVID still coughing last night. symptoms. People could've received vaccination finished fun. Especially consider default wearing masks last year prevented lot people getting sick flu viruses. much potential overwhelm Healthcare system. Npr comparing vaxed delta unvaxxed original still gonna dangerous unvaccinated people don‚Äôt really care that. viruses generally evolve less deadly time, didn‚Äôt see polio chicken pox evolve cause serious illness among vaccinated people Thank you. helps determine what's going on. remember days subreddit tried delete everything politics, seeing virus even political. Every statement virus political somehow sad. I'm unique situation WANT get vaccine, parents would kick did. 

Ain't conservative cult worship best?  One little careful kind mask talking about, general, masks filter incoming outgoing air. protect others you, protect others.

That said, different kinds masks. 

* So-called ""surgical masks"" hundred-year-old technology originally designed protect surgical field surgeons' expirated droplets. terribly good job filtering virus particles, designed to. studies shown substantially better nothing.

* Cloth masks kind crapshoot, obviously, depending kind cloth involved tightly fit. general statement probably worse surgical masks perhaps better.

* N95 masks specifically designed filter small particles, including ones carry viruses air. designed seal tightly face, obviously best thing wear pandemic. N95 masks valves allow expired air vented directly outside without going filter way out. obviously protect you, others viruses may breathe out.

FWIW! nursing require much critical thinking. Thanks! ""If get shot, missed."" many vaccines require boosters varying intervals including HepA, HepB, MenB, etc, it‚Äôs unusual concerning shouldn‚Äôt mystery, skepticism involved. third vaccination raises immune system parent virus, 95% so, questionable? slows spread, less people contract it. Frankly I‚Äôm skeptical there‚Äôs hesitation amongst officials, it‚Äôs safe, raises immunity 5-11 fold despite articles proclaiming breakthrough cases ‚Äòrare‚Äô, there‚Äôs metric ton breakthrough cases, quite serious, good amount getting ill. Meme person riding bike, shoves rod spokes, crashes, blames rod. True that. like one kid messes everything whole class, half class dialed 11! can't yell fire theatre

You actually can. case used fire analogy partially overturned. Fauci: ‚ÄúGet vaccinated‚Äù

Florida Man: *dies* You‚Äôre better person am. wish could empathetic towards types. really do. Maybe keep working that‚Äôll happen, right shit.. mom aunt died people refused wear mask inside home.. I‚Äôm tired care them. Pretty astounding many convinced avoid vaccine like plague.

Oh well. (not if) highly lethal variant shows up, it'll sort problem one way another. I've already done stave scenario. saving idiots, preventing variants now. put Nepal. ‚Ä¶which said near immunity. enough data show comes hospitalization death, vaccines incredibly effective even Delta. it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs likely come places spread control thus, mutations occurring people. Mine denied us right mandate masks public schools. I'm fucking pissed  one saying Plague. Read actual comments. Black Plague still around, said. term ""plague"" lowercase ""p"" generic term folks used; mirrored language comments fluidity sake. Considering experience homeschooling (non-religious) cant believe recommending it, states opt kid going public school long pass test end year. Look states requirements homeschooling, considering Texas southern state, tend lax rules. fastest way get people vaccinate refuse hospital treatment unvaccinated people covid.

Fear understand. Remember shut world polio epidemic polio vaccines actually protect person got it, cause that's vaccine works. respect situation Florida ... happening, intersection Epidemiology + Politics + Economics, + toss State Finances.

For part, tourism oversized impact state finances. due fact Florida state income tax. Tourism, combined sales tax revenue, primary cash flows Tallahassee.

When went lockdown last year, tourism collapsed. Sales tax revenue reduced, unprepared food taxed here, people cooking home instead eating out. state Consensus Estimating Conferences posted *Long Term Financial Outlook* predicted would take 10 years state recover pre COVID levels. Combine Florida constitutional requirement balanced annual budget, caused alarm bells sound loudly Tallahassee. almost exactly Governor reversed course, began everything could re-open Florida (and consequences be-damned).

That Delta variant would kick cart, one's radar. Based one metric (positive cases) pre-vaccination levels (again). real problem messaging, political financial landscapes, changed radically 18 months ago. percentage people one two jabs arms, obviously, near enough. getting messaging Tallahassee needs coming forth. Governor DeSantis could take lessons Governor Ivey Alabama. Put politics aside, focus getting people vaccinated. Put financial considerations back burner (for now). Encourage, mandate, people wear masks, least get level vaccinations suppresses transmission un-vaxxed. county live is, last check, 32.5% (ages 12+, least one dose). That's pitiful. people covid would like access medical care. antivaxxers either take vaccine dead close dying every months

lol think death rate virus? see doom‚Ä¶with much solid evidence sars cov 2 running time mutate way around vaccine will. chose optimism. fake account making bunch posts coin forums 2 years ago? Don‚Äôt think so. 

Also address question what‚Äôs ‚Äúare ok‚Äù thing. even mean context? thing economics issues! rule can't get treatment unless get vaccinated think they‚Äôre starting see illness badge honor. Look out! Flaming cheese! aveerage. doesn‚Äôt require smart listen advice experts.   worst thing get another mutation, vaccine becomes possibly less effective becomes pointless. mandatory vaccines new estimates 80-85% delta think everyone else feels? first told masks nothing. mandated. vaccines would fix everything. it‚Äôs vaccinated spreading virus. virus kills major preexisting conditions. new scary delta variant less deadly flu. 

This control nothing else. 'literally not' anything. even clear true say anything useful. Famous last words. Where's remindmebot? There's limit good spat back you. Let die home. Let families see they‚Äôve caused, instead hidden away hospitals don‚Äôt visit. agree, Florida Balanced Budget amendment (in likelihood) written LEPF party. says Florida cannot borrow, stay within revenue coming in, shortfall occur, reduce services. Tourism cash cow kept Florida implement state income tax (thus far). sudden reduce services, primarily residents, mostly card carrying members LEPF party. whoops. Can't print money can't tax people's income. part Texas in? Austin, get choice year, nice. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre deal crazy thing is, lot elected officials right side isle won‚Äôt admit whether they‚Äôve vaccinated not. get it‚Äôs personal information, would help others see it‚Äôs ok take it, fuck privacy. letting people know! love I‚Äôm sociopath literally sacrificing last years 20s really done protecting people probably hate existing‚Ä¶ Nope, messing up. Link fixed. don‚Äôt get! Many people afraid get vaccine ones thought hydroxychloroquine, drug neither pronounce explain does, answer curing COVID. I'm sorry hear that. rest assured one. mental health taken beating point I've started get occasional anxiety issues. That's new thing me. likely considered something would cause much pain, economic personal, long term. reason one's talking distancing now, lot businesses restaurants survive it. sad state affairs complex horrible choices around. Define large risk. adults die, fewer children die. adults children health issues die. It‚Äôs good child one ‚Äúunusual‚Äù statistics. Yes. However point want prevent variant makes vax ineffective. race. Vax much fast can.

Also still point still overwhelm hospitals. bad. Stores even signs half time. almost infuriating chin mask. Nobody pussies voted Trump.

Literally thing competence piss competent adults, nobody pussies think that‚Äôs worthwhile goal. Today asshats would demanding ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù buy unpasteurized milk.

""would""? already NY 5 deaths yesterday despite 3000 cases. Why? vaccines work lower CFR. Guess wear masks next 30 years Proof Send fucking island die ignominy, let country tomb pathetic ridiculous.

as Canadian ""socialist healthcare"", get vaccinated eligible, allowed utilize healthcare. got vaccinated month saying pandemic me. recently COVID started ripping vaccinated coworkers. I‚Äôm back treating like March 2020. CDC data like Massachusetts outbreak seen coming

The Massachusetts outbreak basically count. Yes, sex someone covid, sex includes large amount kissing thus sticking tongue mouth someone Covid, probably gonna get covid, vaccine not. 

The P-town outbreak happened Bear Week. trip SC got hit something, day 3 feeling off- 2 neg covid tests thankfully. hell summer cold That's covered comparison. Check Virginia‚Äôs dashboard lets set dates see covid deaths vaccination status. July, 1 19 covid deaths vaccinated. look June today, 5 79 deaths (6%) among vaccinated. page says 'attributed' - strictly, course: source (including page number), dice. even think FL reporting accurate numbers though?  Well fair vaccine also developed partial funding China approved CDC Fauci, spread misinformation, helped China develop virus cover origin! trust it?

In seriousness need fully investigate hold accountable anyone contributed getting spreading. people fall small obfuscation, can't trusted even heard info. unvaxed person, would give shit vaxxed person thinks? Y'all got shots. shut live lives. I'm angry government. force everyone get vaccinated least force vaccine passport go anywhere public? Encouragement recommendations clearly working. Lots reasons. start, there's lot people can't take vaccine non-antivax reasons, need protect them. Also protecting vaccinated people breakthrough infection.

Don't become antimasker dipshits mad. vacation three years. Got vaccinated ASAP March, booked expensive trip Greece mid September. points thing keeping going. might lose selfish, childish assholes. can't find words fully express rage right now. selfish ones people expect everyone cater extremely small percentage population. learn meaning phrase ""no good deed goes unpunished"".  work US government agency given sick leave specific vaccine negative reaction needed take time off. meant time come usual sick days. School starts TOMORROW, letter (email) came one principals saying parents allowed walk kids class COVID, yet requiring masks, despite ""multiple students currently quarantining testing positive"". elementary school. Another problem anti-vaxxers/COVID deniers positions power ordering people take masks off. happened jury duty last week, surprised hear happening classrooms tomorrow. surprised, absolutely infuriated. Vaccine dont work, mad bro? bp taken nurse last year,she nose poking top mer mask. properely masked somehow managed keep big mough shut,but easy. thought vaccinated good go? Thats told got vaccinated. something change Taking kids play area. Like crazy person. Here‚Äôs idea. Stop complaining take responsibility fact wanted children. want work university professor. want get PhD. Don‚Äôt come complaining like someone Reddit made things. Get get work. don‚Äôt. don‚Äôt care. year wasted. measures place protect well others. allowed scientists time develop amazing vaccine. matter think case, wearing chin mask, objectively makes idiot. Especially plenty excuse wear mask, even excuses objectively malicious (pretending Vaccinated) anyone know exactly Sky News said got banned? (The article say) Wasnt point vaccin keep people hospital, prevent people getting covid?

It's both. vaccine largely prevented catching covid, nearly contagious. Delta variant aggressive though. We're fucked. Fuck anti-vaxers, we've missed window get shit control.  Show said likelihood precisely equal. one audacious enough say variant likely Florida UK. That‚Äôs incredibly specific definitive statement requires evidence prove! you‚Äôve proven point, countless places world large COVID numbers uncontrolled spread variant concern could develop from. Thank proving point No, masks protect spreading others. give much protection person wearing unfortunately Years months spent documents transit, paperwork sits desk weekend vacations, lot dead space years they're looking documents years rerunning clinical trials? going interesting see fast time probably direct line communication 20x many people working vaccine.  lot different research releases natural immunity - one Cleveland study showed natural immunity appeared (nearly) effective vaccines also done months ago prior delta variant. 

I haven‚Äôt seen big splash articles delta variant mass reinfecting people - though anecdotally appear happen some. 

I think getting vaccine either way best path forward regardless previous covid status especially light recent debacle ‚Äúno masks vaccinated individuals‚Äù taken Americans ‚Äúno masks anyone.‚Äù

Considering personal life many people *think* covid unable get tested (early last year) assumed got sniffles covid (it‚Äôs flu, bro) providing official guidance gives anyone inch excuse get vaccinated really wrong path forward. 

Unless personal care doctor (who isn‚Äôt anti-vaccine geezer hopefully) advises specifically get vaccinated everyone getting jabs. 

If didn‚Äôt bunch ignorance floating US would ‚Äúdone‚Äù covid vaccines actually ineffective preventing death severe disease. don‚Äôt public health measures flu every year solid nationwide vaccination rate (85%+) wouldn‚Äôt considering need lockdown fall/winter summer ignorance spreading extremely infectious (apparently) severe delta variant. [CDC study shows 74% people infected Massachusetts Covid outbreak fully - Published Fri, Jul 30 20212:34 PM EDT

It appears fully vaccinated longer prevents covid. Good news is, fully vaccinated appears prevent death/hospitalization (for part). state government beyond idiocy. Legit, DeSantis pull funding school requires masks!  Right, like said... people legitimately stumped. I've explain adults. CDC, Canada, UK say vaccine causes 75-88% reduction infections vaccinated? little town held fucking rally yesterday.

He wasn‚Äôt anything, pedophile fan club kinda met middle town started waving flags signs shit. They‚Äôre cheaper think need government stop covering hospitalization costs unvaccinated individuals watch insurance premiums soar. would far effective way handle situation, would likely cause lot people get vaccine. could well might happen eventually still reach end point. might take 2 years. might take 10 years. might take 100 years get there. Say what? thing? feel like mods create Florida Outbreak mega thread. seems like every post restating thing. vaccine could help bring end pandemic cost millions lives, leave millions disabled horrible symptoms life, cost trillions dollars cost millions lives more, occurred history? No. 

The vaccines gone safety trials injected nearly 3 billion people already. It‚Äôs safe. It‚Äôs battle tested vaccine history.  Considering portion unvaccinated partially allergic vaccines told doctor get vaccinated, fully vaccinated person angry? 

Unvaccinated people way normalcy. Mostly, vaccinated people think control people's way normalcy. problem this: first shot, waiting appt second one. But.... reading people vaccinated contracting COVID. I'm favor vaccines - - still get disease vaccinated against, mean bullet-proof vaccinated. 

I guess matter percentages avoiding getting really sick get virus vaccination. 

Here's weird thing: I've reading people who've COVID immune getting again. read, antibodies last long - like months least, show tests. vaccine different?

It's confusing. ""Normalcy?"" see happening long time. WTF! alright? Ok fucko, 81% much larger proportion LA vaccinated. means 100% new covid cases, 75% new cases coming 19% unvaccinated. time explain proportions sample sizes anyone else reading, dumb fucking point say peddlers claim says. here. Anger uses much energy. vaccinated mean going right back way things pretty covid safe idea. Sure, get infected it'll probably mild case, still know vaccines effective potential long-term damage. never said that... lie age like ww1...Recruiters used like, need go outside birthday. Tho highly doubt would work Yes, government wants people annoyed them.

Also, ever heard little thing called ""id card""? virtually every country earth except US has? 
You could almost call *domestic passport.* least Israel started get giving boosters, plan vaccinate 1.2 million eight days. data suggest vaccine good six months still sure information. way even get close predicting seasonal flu hits China first. We're still even good predicting like that.

How able work fast enough stop viruses mutate faster? like problem we're starting run antibiotics, except actually helped case people would finish treatment. 

My point money make vaccines force virus mutate spread again, keep making vaccines keep making money reaches breaking point. Even basic 4 year degree biology would learn vaccines foolproof viruses adapt. definitely aware make money. Show evidence one five _vaccinated_ people end long hall symptoms. Chances significantly lower vaccinated people though. That's main point. keep masses divided eachother. let unvaccinated die instead soaking hospital resources, is

I'm kinda point honest. Unless something changed missed it, Biden still saying interest second term, right?

Shit could change there, tho. group trying help large part problem bad pandemic US, take advice demonize trying help sorry butts yeah, funnily enough folk empathy that. 

At certain point made bed, lot people unvaccinated reached threshold. course, enforcers truth machine lets know exactly misinformation. LOL. article June 21st, cases low South.

The thing that's ""Dumb"" commenting old news. Don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôm sure pivot think things different March/April 2020 (aka square one)? Alright kiddo, back school you.  given vaccine immediately upon admission hospital 

How public health concern? need start framing people threat national security Thank much. Damn solid history wrong this... would encourage let experts job, stop giving bad advice others! I'm hoping research risk long covid experience breakthrough infections fully vaccinated. I'm understanding correctly, that's study looked at, right? 


Anyone know research done look whether there's reduction long covid breakthrough cases? 


Anecdotally I've seen reports fully vaccinated experience long covid symptoms (e.g. fatigue brain fog), studies yet. I'm hoping vaccines protect want assume behave accordingly without information first. Something twisted logic hitting wrong way. I'm sorry deal this.

Nothing like staying home months trying everything right looking window watching people go lives nothing interesting noteworthy happening all. look it, nothing interesting noteworthy happened personally look *me* think I'm sort gullible moron stayed indoors upended many aspects life nothing. can't help feeling might right, literally nobody know died this, nobody hospitalized, even know anyone tested positive, zero. 

Like war movie main character, spending years going training drills stationed overseas waiting call action ends home realizes never fired weapon saw single moment action. start wonder war even happening all.

UGH know.... I'm sorry!!!!!! I'm getting all.  That's I'm worried about. Israel showing limited effectiveness 6 months regarding delta. states everyone's like ""breakthroughs rare vaccines amazing"" Thank u. really need positive news today. vaccinated running world like back normal stupid getting vaccine. never ending loop stupidity finger pointing. right, changing new facts presented. better worse take approach ensure enough data place adjust guidance. time, delta prevalent conflict guidance. 

Like year ago still changing - let's hope get worse. wonder link isn‚Äôt quite right Reddit messing up. reading article morning it‚Äôs focused immune escape long Covid.

This link takes  Trust I've done everything can. meet school counselor weeks ima bring really want vaccine. live southern USA laws kinda wack sometimes ngl :/ don‚Äôt need insurance vaccines states let minors get shot without parents permission. It‚Äôs infuriating know could prevented. 1. reactive treatment. We're reacting change nature way predict changes occur next way get front it. 
2. Viruses mutate matter days takes us weeks months least formulate new vaccine. Let alone making sure safe. 
3. Perhaps look much money made vaccines. Yes. answer what's point wearing mask around anyone? preventing infected? realize ghosts can't catch right? ""Smooth like butter, unlike antivax cover."" point, reason vaccinated people following laws family member risk cannot vaccinated. 


The unvaccinated people aren‚Äôt following laws they‚Äôre going get vaccine. There‚Äôs nothing else do. It‚Äôs self righting problem. It‚Äôs time open up. ""we want everything go back normal"" ""we want get jab"" hopefully is. One way another, need immunity, need herd immunity.
It‚Äôs damn shame consequences choices literally deaths many them, made decision that‚Äôs them. longer large percentage people stay unvaccinated better odds getting horrible super strain. really sucks got word we‚Äôre back mandatory masks work, vaccinated not. say I‚Äôm great mood right understatement.

Like others, socially distanced isolated (live alone) year, masked out, got vaccine soon got chance. 

Now I‚Äôm waiting lockdowns travel restrictions brother law would hero  It‚Äôs possible homeless shelters transmission rate similar higher schools, mention losing health insurance able afford medical treatment chronically ill child. don‚Äôt know answer either, don‚Äôt think way approaching helping. Yea never proper ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù. Even peak pandemic wasn‚Äôt enforced strict punishment advisory/guidance.  seems much question. two different things.

It seem like hospitalizations deaths much lower among vaccinated. That's terrific thing, excellent reason everyone get vaccinated.

Recent studies last week, suggest actual case rates vaccinated unvaccinated different comes Delta virus, vaccinated people propensity spread virus unvaccinated people. quite different hearing last 6 months vaccines. Hopefully information firm next couple weeks.  Lol totally!!! Lets hide away forever Time capitalize crazies resell markup :) people refuse wear mask think wearing mask sign weakness. Thats one component overall stupidity. remembered reading last year wash sun could keep cycling use bit longer. Yep sounds like me. I‚Äôve come couple conclusions point pandemic fellow adult Americans:

1. It‚Äôs 100% un-American refuse shot unless medical reason can‚Äôt. 

2. American anti-vaxxers take offense #1 extremely selfish ignorant reasons. claim stand America actually refusing help part greater good. 

3. end killing fellow Republican voters next election, Democrats (now vaccinated) less concerns confidence going polls. 

4. employer allows work home love it. longer plays longer get work home.  Get back State Executives tell ""duty die."" -- Texas economy cannot handle another lockdown

Sure can! Stock market all-time high's. Stop prioritizing economy people. one's making money hand fist 1%. 

Ironic US thinks real lockdown states pretty much open June 2020. cares anyway. Feels like surviving war die right ends. literally conceded point. could arise India, UK, anywhere high numbers. It‚Äôs likely one other. 

Thank Agreed vaccines there, horses already left barn! world gave fight vaccine became politicize profit model. kind hate fellow man, mostly prevalence people like these.  Well Delta variant nothing play even vaccine, assume Epsilon Zeta get worse. Maybe Z virus ü§î anti-vaxxers already brain dead‚Ä¶is zombie apocalypse we‚Äôve foreseeing? I'm glad virus rarely fatal young people means kids going super spreaders. lot cases they're going pass asymptomatic system flights except one time coughed Grandma think personal anecdotes hit home ""face"" speak. Scientitic studies anonymous easier dismiss, mentally. yes, science trusted personal stories. sure parental permission requirements? Check State Department Health website information. states minor need parent permission get vaccine. frustrated governor Florida everything make sure people die. MIL telling us new political tactic get ppl vaccinated she‚Äôs reading vaccinated ones getting sick spreading delta variant. *face palm* surprised said covid ‚Äúscare‚Äù, got family panic, completely lost shit testing negative.  angry hot minute.

 I'm stay home mom. know families luxury parent dedicate time this, flexibility please look local options.  Honestly, care anymore. can't get vaccinated still options avoiding people (curbside, etc).

Let see mandates preventing.   OK total moron don‚Äôt want admit don‚Äôt understand probability. agree Brazil India large number total cases absolute numbers variants also likely arise there. look absolute numbers said. Florida, UK, India, high absolute numbers.

Canada high absolute numbers variant less likely arise there.

Looking forward follow post fail gauge grade 6 probability yet again. ooops! wrong.  commend you‚Äôre seeing horrors upfront again, must exhausting. doesn‚Äôt make sense I‚Äôm NYC everyone vaccinated 50. Bars, clubs, parks packed. COVID fatigue real nonce Alabama isn‚Äôt going change way people want live. I'm part team company handles annual health insurance renewal. I'm totally going ask adopt 2022 policy. coverage unvaccinated people needing covid treatment. love it. Ooops, dumb post!   literally feel fear wrong. love it. Low tier bait right here. NY 2,200 cases yesterday, highest 17,636 positive cases, \*seven\* months ago. wrong there. governor blocking mask mandates. terrible look. can't worry unvaccinated. one-year-old home, healthy. spouse vaccinated. saying worry child unvaccinated? people refuse vaccine masks (who able get it) family higher risk COVID. I'm gonna worry family vulnerable better protected.

My whole deal pandemic this: yes, live life, cautiously. COVID taken seriously. want ready told please use masks...while walking around maskless.

I firmly believe decade they'll include brave individuals constantly wore mask protected others afraid, weren‚Äôt would get simple Assuming referring vaxxed people callous point, that's correct disregard this.

Vaxxed folks one's still majority compassion. shared wilfully ignorant folks hateful rest pandemic. 3/4 family tested positive including (fully vaxed Moderna, second shot April). kids 7 10 tested positive, 7yo asymptomatic far 10yo worst time cold symptoms digestive issues. husband also fully moderna‚Äôd tested negative. feel like bad cold. Like wasn‚Äôt pandemic probably would gone work sick leave accrues hour week don‚Äôt due kids. 

Luckily, work WFH next two weeks won‚Äôt allowed back without negative test. Ooops, dumb post! understand primarily Hispanics Blacks refusing vaccine? think vote? lived it, apparently unharmed. seems pretty good, start. Many didn't, obviously.

Glass half full! work you? get tired wrong?  person thinks time nothing think except thoughts. So, loses touch reality lives world illusions. thoughts mean specifically ‚Äúchatter skull‚Äù... perpetual compulsive repetition words... reckoning calculating. saying thinking bad. Like everything else, it‚Äôs useful moderation. good servant, bad master - called civilized peoples increasingly become crazy self-destructive. excessive thinking, lost touch reality. 

Alan Watts true. lot survive covid gain survivorship bias. Maybe work anger issues forget best part: become petri dishes new variants.

They genuine threat everybody. also gave aid Taliban.

We give Israel Iran. need adjust edit? look good you? Sure, would happen without anti-vaxxers, rates mutation would much much lower everyone vaccinated. occurs you‚Äôre vaccinated contract virus, body able clear incredibly quickly without symptoms, doesn‚Äôt give virus much time mutate become dominant virus population. without vaccinations, however, high virus levels much longer (because don‚Äôt anything help body fight virus), giving virus much time mutate creating harmful variants. basically anti-vaxxers making variant issue worse, pretending like ‚ÄúO h  h  W U l  j U  h p P e N  N W Y‚Äù.

I'm curious comes from? There's disease I'm aware wiped waiting out, smallpox eradicated polio close eradicated vaccines contact tracing. trying say??

Lockdowns work. They've worked every state aus messed like Sydney.

Aussies anti vaccine, enough right states need lockdown won‚Äôt. Fuck hate everything. Yes, vaccinate enough people minimize amount potential hosts slow mutation thus evolution viruses. clear technology faster steamrolled billion different viruses like middle ages. kids, naturally better protected even vaccine. Completely agree. need US FEDERAL mandates. free movement states. federal government's responsibility ensure safety all. fine. I'm sorry too. I'm exhaustrd all. help lot friends getting vaccinated moved on. gonna rough fall. Stay safe there! family actually wants move Canada one day ever possible. I‚Äôd honestly quit. It‚Äôll matter two weeks you‚Äôre infected class. crazy talk! precious children need protected. means quarantine policies change. 

The genie going back bottle; CDC continued push vaccinations try reach herd immunity instead getting complacent worrying much masks. Initially, saw like oh that's bad. Yes record, report week. saw one week, 110k went oh shit. Perhaps google lake Ozarks COVID hotspot summer long. Imagine actually promote life-saving vaccine people dumb take even though free easily available. **75 80 percent 50 staff members infected Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital fully vaccinated**, Dr. Lukejohn Day, hospital‚Äôs chief medical officer, said interview Saturday. University California, San Francisco Medical Center said statement issued Friday **153 183 infected staff members fully members hospitals continued wear personal protective equipment**, Dr. Day said. **the number staff infections reported July many peak winter surge.** ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre nervous could potentially exceed it,‚Äù Dr. Day said.

None good news. Maybe next time act like adults situation. found report compiled states report vaccine breakthrough cases. seems pretty childhood best friend get vaccinated. due politics conspiracy, purely due laziness. told see gets jabbed.

The whole world upside down. know could even move to. 


The worst part **entirely preventable.** Like **exact scenario** worry back February. (Low Vaccine uptake giving time threatening, vaccine resistant variant.) taken unreasonably long time governments/businesses force vaccination mandates.

At point Delta gonna chew America right back March 2020. (Am Medical student, spoke adviser spoke epidemiologist.) gets real bad hospitals might even tell unvaccinated people respiratory distress go pound sand die. 


Delta much infectious. Nothing else except wait out. I'm wondering going happen since eviction moratorium expires tonight. Nervous societal breakdown. obese doesn‚Äôt effect Jeff. can‚Äôt ‚Äúcatch‚Äù obesity me. It‚Äôs stupid analogy. There‚Äôs also wide variety reasons people overweight, laziness. It‚Äôs someone refusing get vaccine fucking know it.        I've traveled lot 50 countries safari Africa absolute best vacation ever. (Second New Zealand, third hiking Switzerland.)   Ohio     would nice also reported vaccine individuals received.  mostly J&amp;J? Mixed? Double mRNA? information useful determining effectiveness vaccines delta variant. vaccines clearly working regardless, information would nice available. disagree this, 2 reasons: 

1. visible. Long Covid folks, people can't taste, etc., ignored. can't ignore kid iron lung.
2. attacked kids. original Covid strain attacked kids like Delta appears doing, would time. attacked elderly, apparently care them.    This. People tend forget vaccination rarely intended sterilizing measure, that‚Äôs gravy, point keep people hospital. vaccine upper tier comes that. Maybe get fda, cdc, nbc, cnn, rest tone delta going kill us even vaccinated, vaccines don‚Äôt stop infections/breakthrough common, need safety testing kids bullshit   dont need to. can't factor something beginning of. 

Thats like covid study November 2019. Data yet  ""Some""? Source?  Lockdowns quite harsh temporary. 

LOL, we've hearing 18 months now....give break.   elementary aged son could get would. 

And antivax/antimask crowds riling school boards go back mitigation remote learning. 

Yay!  Never said were‚Ä¶. Currently guidance waiting evidence idiot anti-masker/vaxxers create another variant resistant vaccine. really thanking them....     Bugssawingoffflorida.gif Americans love someone blame republicans. Nah, classic ‚ÄútHInk chILDrEN‚Äù argument works literally everything else according people like him. murder crime one time? know vaccines preventing severity symptoms? get prevents hospitalizations, unvaccinated person get Delta, likely similar symptoms? Let‚Äôs remember people got sick Massachusetts explosion Covid fully vaxxed symptomatic. Deflect lmao nephew hates needles wait finally get vaccine. tired this. people taking cattle dewormer treatment preventative covid. Vaccines many side effects. It‚Äôs ~~very difficult~~ nearly impossible get them.  doubt numbers go enough concern even variants. vaccine never 100% immunity getting us acceptable risk ratios. gave breakthrough stats delta year ago I‚Äôd ecstatic numbers. point vaccinated folks wearing masks going statistically better outcomes non vaccinated, folks massive viral loads. 

Triage going kick point health care system buckling, think unvaccinated warned ahead time inconvenient truth, might convinced selfish wanting extra level care Unless paying individually like smokers, absolutely factored everyone's insurance premiums. he's 100% right I‚Äôm retail worker worked entire pandemic. fucking burned become misanthrope. :\ isn‚Äôt individual risk, talking societal risk. tax payer want pay disability benefits next 50 years.

Then arguing mandatory vaccines last 6 months. that, would now, would next risk festival anything else, could go living normal.

Maybe arguing that. so, good. not, think arguing festival instead thing actually help us. problem willingly giving personal data large corporations like Facebook. It‚Äôs also easier NZ bc unlike Australia quarantine procedures people coming country aren‚Äôt complete dogshit. needs good slap wrist Governor Kay Ivey. issue telling people go get vaccinated. friend vaccinated came back Florida last week came back covid. Yeah napkin math makes think highly sensationalized bullshit. second article says female Disney employee makes $14.75 hour husband mechanic pull $45,000 / year. making $31,000 he's making $14,000 auto mechanic? needs new line work there's exagerrating writing news article going here.

I know people live work Disney Universal shittiest jobs none live car. definitely paid well poverty wages. apartments / mobile homes / cars etc... pay child support obligations. I'm starting sound hail corporate plenty criticisms labor practices articles trying portray accurate picture average Disney employee. 1. UCSF mandated employees vaccinated today EXTREMELY rare exception medical religious reasons, deadline today. mandate brought clinic 80 staff 90% 100%. 
2. 84% San Francisco residents 12 least one dose. Healthcare workers went first. one last employees scheduled completed set mid-February.
3. 84% breakthrough cases vaccinated. number high indicates even unvaccinated population infect. indicates that, vaccine completely useless. Pick one. Obesity genetic most. Here's couple extra tables.

Source: [CDC vaccination demographic Excludes Texas (~9% US). profitable elective surgeries happening. LOL @ downvotes legit can't understand trying says health issues reason covid. Science, right?

What? polio covid. saddens hear medical professionals believe nonsense. need wall south. government, media big problem. Information reach public large swaths humanity fed constant stream bullshit! tracking breakthrough cases hospitalized. muddles numbers even more. lot people misunderstanding CDC assuming vaccinated people spread rate unvaccinated New York Times, instance, tweeted
early Friday morning, ""The Delta variant contagious chickenpox
and may spread vaccinated people easily unvaccinated,
an internal C.D.C. report said."" Ben Wakana, member White
House's rapid response team, responded bluntly: ""VACCINATED PEOPLE DO
NOT TRANSMIT VIRUS RATE UNVACCINATED PEOPLE IF
YOU FAIL INCLUDE CONTEXT WRONG."" Times
ultimately added context tweet follow-up.

Sums pretty well. screaming rooftops beginning, almost late. People seen alarmist headlines BINGO Grabs popcorn 

*sorts controversial* Sorry, speak rerardese awful. political social issue, human health issue. using position authority put general public danger face criminal charges.  *Is terrorism. I'm 14. Stop trying convince anti-vaxxers give us teens vaccine! Maybe try something pedestrian instead. Skydiving gator wrestling? Something involve prolonged periods enclosed space masses strangers pneumonia pandemic. Swift

Maybe time eat unvaccinated? understanding analogy (or want get it) what's point adding mitigation efforts going put mitigation efforts use? point mask make safer around others. saying still around others masks pointless. 

Want disease related analogy? like wearing condoms 0 intention sex someone. Condoms 100% still spread disease. many still choose sex risk added protection condom brings. Saying mask stay away people like saying wear condom sex. 

If around people, need masks. Like sex need condom. Masks purpose around people. Fixed ty guess screwed allowing covaxin help them...dumb fucks viral loads suggest increased risk transmission raised concern that, unlike variants, vaccinated people infected Delta transmit virus,‚Äù Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC‚Äôs director, said statement Friday.

Infected, vaccinated people spread. That‚Äôs still small minority vaccinated people children smiling laughing. Or, they'll dead then

""I young kids. wife going masks kids. never have,"" said. ""I want see kids smiling. want fun."" Florida par slightly behind national average vaccinations weeks. doubt suddenly better. probably counting 12 61% number. I'm sure aware, life vests keep getting wet, help keep drowning. I've got mine, I'm worried jumping back in. Good luck you, hope strong swimmer. HAAAAA FUNNY That's fair point. 

Ok, (big assumption) *assuming sufficient supply relevant vaccines*, believe farm animals would easier vaccinate. Even though there's many them, farm animals easier deal humans. That‚Äôs vaccines work. reduce ability pick reduce severity duration symptoms. virus still replicates vaccinated individuals. Recent studies suggest viral loads vaccinated individuals similar means vaccinated may spread virus well unvaccinated person. 

The main point vaccines keep hospital. That's works. question freedom choice, reality. getting vaccinated putting danger, also people CAN'T vaccinated, people certain medical conditions, young children babies danger. Also, unvaccinated people better chances virus mutating over. Delta crept ""keeping freedom"", i.e. selfish caring fellow Americans reality situation, prolonging pandemic causing deaths.

Be true patriot get vaccine helping others instead giving inflated high horse kill you. curiosity, parents vaxxed? 

Just wondering ""Do say do"" moment. Well, someone posted twitter yesterday number people died Florida surpassed DeSantis margin victory. there's that. Thank you! I‚Äôm assuming voter base likes it? Instead stewing rage use fuel bad situation, it‚Äôs level relief amazing. Probably healthy least get things done need do, matter circumstances time. Pretty rich coming man who's actively contributed ""false information"". get case, sounds like win/win wait health insurance companies start refusing pay treatment unvaccinated patient medically able get vaccine. ‚ÄúOh, $500,000 bill hospital refused get vaccinated? Yeah, aren‚Äôt covering dumb ass.‚Äù mean, way avoid immediately demand everyone get vaccinated. Make mandatory almost anything public. 

In short term (next 5-6 weeks) need mask, that's it. think level individuals. every vaccinated person thought like infections hospitalizations surged among unvaccinated loved ones able get best standard care non COVID ailments. That's possibility, that's certainty. ‚ÄúThey already saying vaccine gave everyone variant‚Äù 

Are comprehending wrote? 

The thing apparent great run-on sentences. Biology 101 generic course. Perhaps one took similar 1301. Either way you‚Äôve made sense reply helped mine. Honestly burnishes credentials trump-death-cultist, he‚Äôs probably got inside track nom. point start criminally charging people willfully spreading disinformation?

How different point shouting fire movie theater?

People dying people (who probably vax themselves) spreading around. rate that's vaccinated US. 70s 95% vaccinated, it'll vaccinated people taking beds. r/yourjokebutworse I'm curious would better representing shot something vaccine. keep hearing like old vaccines when's last time needed booster shot vaccine. hospital this? It‚Äôs literally government‚Äôs job make sure communities protected. speed limits, rules waste disposal, billion regulations. right take vaccine ends door house. wanna public, get rest damn community what‚Äôs necessary protect us pandemic. thing, it‚Äôs us thing. 16 months bullshit due selfishness looking like maybe another year herd immunity. Crazy times :( said never self correct. get it. think I‚Äôm trying tie two points together. constantly changing nature virus information means title misinformation misleading information much eye moderator. don‚Äôt problem need open decision making process held accountable possible instances mishandle transfer information. Israel‚Äôs ahead us months.

Their data suggested masking indoors vaccinated people months ago, due antisemitism (let‚Äôs honest) US ignored it. Jewish space lasers that. Please explain actual risk life someone isn‚Äôt overweight age 40 face contract CoV2 I‚Äôm growing angrier bitter day. point, anti vax people running lives virus  never said methodology wrong. said recommendations fantasy never going achieve recommending. tired careful safe exhausted caring next person.

Yep, sums situation old US A. Vaccinated individuals literally still catching covid . Get high horse . It‚Äôs shit flu . New strains every year, vaccine helps strains. Covid never eradicated . Please , scared leave home. safe say home. Tooooo manny vaccinated getting covid pesky unvaxxed! good day :) üòÇ Thats cute. find far validation idiots used to. idiot might tell everyone knew disease actually satanic magic, hoax carried government, people would rebuff idiot leave choice shut up. 

Now idiot simply goes online finds thousands people repeating verbal diarrhoea. emboldens conditions believe correct. 

When idiots start organising en masse, end things like January 6th Insurrection. It‚Äôs good. Australian here.

A large portion media owned Murdoch. Sky News Australia much, much insane Murdoch publication.

It basically hotbed conspiracy theories little else. 

I hope banned permanently benefit humanity. Eat shit Tell five year old one year old aren‚Äôt able vaccinated. Right. know shaming doesn‚Äôt work...but neither shaming them, sooo...fuckem. create variant vaccine resistant. I‚Äôve resigned it. humans, pretty good run. Maybe dogs take wipe out.  eradicate smallpox, though. see person who's going able engage textbook ethical dilemma.

But think know full well I'm saying. Two things:

1. Two wrongs make right. Said several times now.

2. vaccinated absolve us moral responsibility regarding Covid.

That's it. heard it, understood it, like it, went 5g name-calling reach last available shred validation. says this: ‚ÄúCritical early protection many infectious diseases previously experienced mother given passive IgG antibody transferred mother transplacentally milk. fades away, young children become vulnerable infections, though better armed maturing innate adaptive immune systems. risks much reduced vaccinations, stimulate protective immune responses maturing immune system. ‚Äú

Pretty sure it‚Äôs highlighting vaccines beneficial, help stimulate maturing immune systems, protect Humans younger age previously possible vaccines became widely used. So, I‚Äôm calling total horse shit you‚Äôre ‚Äútrying‚Äù make say. would like believe this, sadly won't. doesn‚Äôt suprise all. truly lost faith humanity. protect fools, children, immunocomps, hospital workers, local businesses, etc. wearing mask. like anti vaxers. makes sick.  Lol Return lockdown unless vaccine, that‚Äôll get people get Nah, ones stuck home. rest us part got vaccinated. selfish go lockdown parts society decided contribute return life. Remember crusty news reporter show enflamed race riot. engineered it. wasn‚Äôt planned part community. That‚Äôs free speech? manage that, would mind letting get first?  thriller2112 fake account spreading misinformation. aren‚Äôt allowed even raw footage without everyone‚Äôs consent. Feeling rage normal good.

But it‚Äôs matters. Combating misinformation, calling bad policies, protesting systems politics created mess, etc etc, great ways utilize rage.

Rage quitting mandates refusing acknowledge need small personal sacrifices help prevent virus spreading? That‚Äôs immature selfish fuck. Many already. soon. Complaining internet fictional ""right"" anti-vax dummy stop society moving forward without you.  see looking bad faith arguments strawman fallacies looking argument. 

Where claim individuals no, cannot, would not, could lose weight? 

I recall making claim. 

I remember saying 90% humans genetic obesity them. Americans sick tired bullshit anti-vaxxers/anti-maskers spewing since March 2020. That's true per article... 75-80% People texass ! mask get vaxxed ! Oh get butt wipes , also go sci flow . üë®üèº‚Äçüíª much house Flathead Lake? I'll honest you, sure people naive now. Pandemic change people's minds, January 6th would done job. Yes. Actually, deaths peaked April cases peaked June (if consider moving average) But, see, *that lie ok* for.... uh.... reasons. maybe lie, *omission truth greater good*. maybe science changed. maybe *you asking questions, citizen.* county teach 46% vaccinated. I'm fucked. pandemic, thought Florida hailed model response. can't tell many times seen folks say - look Florida. opened shows lockdowns, reason masks, dont work. 

DeSantis hailed hero back May. 

Here real test now. unfortunately, think going flunk it. Correct. Despite think feel people, governor, Greg Abbot, choosing 'sacrifice' supporters donor bottom line. fellow human, hurts me. hurt enrage everyone know man power willing level wreckless abandon. us vaxxed watch happen? become us humanity United States? said plenty. implies common. 

None studies current science backs statements.  good reason NEVER go florida give money vacation again. Screw 'em like attempting screw us. Kids though ask pediatrician give off-label use vaccine. Might worth ask. predetermine ‚Äúthat overweight middle aged smoker doesn‚Äôt get ventilator unless x% available‚Äù Moderna working Dealta-specific booster. FDA move faster. It‚Äôs going really dark fall winter. think really believe could die, least real possibility. suggestion I've seen think could possibly effect would kind direct monetary incentive, thousands tax credit vaccinated something. 

Short that, time step aside let nature take course. T[his 42,000 reason NYT left piece information out. Sigh Argentina free healthcare charging tests while. requirement travelling though. I‚Äôm baffled bunch conspiracy nuts we‚Äôve become since then. Started 24/7 cable news cycle. There‚Äôs lot negative news week breakthrough infections. Combined data Israel, think we‚Äôre starting see beginning major shift messaging public health officials media this. I‚Äôm guessing message going shift ‚Äúbreakthrough infections exceptionally rare‚Äù ‚Äúbreakthrough infections pretty common, hospitalizations less so‚Äù next couple months. know what, say want anti vaxxers comes nut cutting, choice vaccinated already give shit get it? fast virus R0 9 burn population, might extra days growth states think. Maybe get counted significant definitions, I'm thinking result least percentage points increase long Covid cases, maybe .1-.2% points increase deaths. That's thousand extra deaths. sane population, current actions would look horrible he'd never chance. sarcasm. appropriate deposit yes People love say risk hospitalization death low vaccinated - forget risk hospitalization death already low unvaccinated population begin with. 
 
Data PHE says vaccine reduces chance severe symptoms **once manage contract it** half. find hard believe concerned 1% mortality rate give shit 0.5% rate. hell wrong monster. feel like dropped head many times child. ü§∑ needs vaccines though, right??? Smh Unfortunately, provision Florida law would allow voters recall governor, lieutenant governor, members governor's cabinet, Florida legislature. bill filed 2011 try allow it, failed committee. two ways remove governor Florida 1. Voting governor next general election, 2022 DeSantis, 2. legislative impeachment, would require Florida House approve impeachment two-thirds vote. trial would held Senate, two-thirds Senators would vote remove Governor. hope gets worst sort karma Sending hugs, love, safety way. Missing another summer worth means able normal next, instead restrictions couple years due delta variant 650-700 beds. Ron* though Rick scumbag same. due fully approved next month, places excuse anymore! people every state responded like Vermont, shit would over.  never said common. 

Sure, stories reoccurring quite subreddits frequent. doubt common think happens foolish live thinking vaccine magical armor make getting COVID non-miserable experience opinion dunno, seems like shitty time Leftovers indication. Thanks! remember NY's first wave, beds issue, trained staff.

Your ICU chart alarming. Look straight spike end June beginning July! Furthermore, yet go down! chart also NINE(!!!) beds available entire region.

Will Austin hospitals pause elective procedures, already done so? seen mention it, time, NYC, followed closely. Trump even run again? ruined reputation Pandemic, fiasco January 6th. Ron reap sewn. messed let go far. [42,000 employees two NYT note anywhere article. Moreover, article include percentage total employees vaccinated, critical assessing efficacy.

I'm incredibly disappointed outlets NYT -- absolutely better -- leaving critical pieces information, reliably ways seem designed scare people. I‚Äôm vaccinated actually admire people refuse it. conclusion come afraid get potentially leave family member uncared world. enjoy life much they‚Äôd willing live post apocalyptic situation vaccinated people died. That‚Äôs pretty brave. wouldn‚Äôt want live world without Air Conditioning, beer, XBox. Without mask since got vaccine. You? covid‚Ä¶? Not. A. Single. Bit. form restriction / lockdown.. tell go local CVS lie getting booster? 

No? Ok then. Keep grasping straws coward lmao think better analogy floating around recently wearing sunscreen going beach day. directly related politics whether getting good information not... probably close 90% factor survived covid also contribute herd immunity Conservatives whole zero empathy interest certain things happens someone know. really want see study done terms political leaning vs empathy/selfishness  well guess theyll never get normalcy, dont need shot never get shot No. made monthly Costco run Georgia seemed normal me. mean, yeah, people buying lot toilet paper water buy lot Costco! wouldn‚Äôt say I‚Äôm angry, would say lack empathy unvaccinated ‚Ä¶who contract COVID become ill.

They choice. Choices consequences.. BROOOO STICK SCIENCE JUICE, BAZINGA! I'M VACCINE-RICK!

is literally place full [You mean nut case liar yet provide smallest shred evidence claims.

Also, please provide source FL DoH ‚Äòcaught cooking books‚Äô. Take long need. Meh. dispense constraint. Still wea There's person work pulls mask chin talks puts back done. can't. rare minority, could easily die simple flu/other diseases well, hide social exposure govt support true, vaccinated people high viral load unvax vax people create vax resistant variants rendering vax true see point 2, vaccinated risk people lives unvaccinated, that's mask mandates starts kick Y‚Äôall ridiculous. conspiracy free zone. y‚Äôall can‚Äôt help yourselves, you. need help, people need vaccined thats it. vaccinated US , safe death variant going changes protines magically break like meadia wants believe. Apparently general consensus immunocompromised people necessary casualties since covid never go away... That's difference us. normal healthcare. normal office furniture warehousing. I'm already around lot people. think, yes without vaccine effects could cause healthcare employees would probably massive. wow that‚Äôs terrible idea Also chin maskers wear mask much uncomfortable position 

If wear pocket, wear put on

Those people put loops around ears, stretch ears get bent keep mask exactly like rest day Disney trip heart set summer get canceled people Florida refuse wear masks get vaccines yes, angry. 7 day average deaths per day drifted 25, started rising again. 59 there's reason think keep going while. 163 million adults vaccinated 209,128,094

That like 77.9 percent adults vaccinated? course. be? Last year certainly give fuck it; that's South Dakota remains one worst hit states.

Not mention last year's Sturgis basically political rally people who've made petri dish political identity. gotten worse since last year.  health issues. immune compromised, high blood pressure, glucose imbalances, 6‚Äô2 170 pounds, blood pressure always near 110/70, heart rate 75, goes doctor every 6 months he‚Äôs 50 that‚Äôs apparently way doc make money nothing ever wrong him. frustrating. delta variant originate India? think anti vaxers biggest problem there, lack enough vaccinations. even people could would get vaccinated, delta variant would still anyway. India's peak 400k cases per day though REAL numbers easily couple million per day, remember someone posted something Indian models predicting 10M+ per day. reality refusing wear mask truly shows weakness Depends. Trump runs, not. did, he'd opposition golden messiah.

If Trump run whatever reason? Hell yeah will. he'll probably win. Yeah I‚Äôm gonna need link cause sounds like major bullshit   now. Google Apple usually yank apps. 'doom' ... direct quote scientific research paper.  I've exact thoughts last month. statistics support idea though? really killing anti maskers much higher rate using get frail?  said effective? Lowest saw 64% Israel. You‚Äôll buy bit time, takes one asshole it‚Äôs pointless.

No. Someone would bring escape variant--which exist yet--in first. exists, we're trouble matter what. fully vaccinated nation, likely develop here: lower cases means fewer opportunities mutate. 

To note: case, ""in trouble"" means need boosters. recent information saying vaccinated viral tract, that‚Äôs point get now? Thanks much! apparently state 14 get vaccine without parental consent, doc (so PCP) would allow it. Problem is, permit months away getting license can't walk 20 miles local office! Two less jabronis walking around. ‚ÄúIf send damned fool St. Louis, don‚Äôt tell damned fool, never know difference.‚Äù -Mark Twain

He sure knew spot idiot distance‚Ä¶  Alright, I'm expert please downvote say something stupid incorrect. 

First all, immunity wane 4 months. study waning immunity comes Israel mostly concerns older people AFAIK, according study immunity starts wane six months, four.

Second: say Moderna 'better'? Better Pfizer? Better AZ? incredibly good vaccines, first one managed get Pfizer one damn good protection illness, like Moderna one

Third: really want say anything bad girlfriend's family, bit far fetched? supposed get third dose? live Europe (double jabbed well) know much rest world, far know country giving third doses older people Israel. single study supporting third dose young individuals least live would impossible illegal get third one government decides give third one young people. want lie something supposed right now?

Also, please notice playing basketball mean getting covid. get third dose legally allowed so. speaking way works company. YMMV. insightful. deserves best submission. probably find lots places cheap KN95 masks placed orders last year time actually received orders, demand dropped significantly, sitting boatload them. ""I heard remarked, men reasoned opinion reasoned into. case, though important, simple. Government subsist making proselytes sound reason, compromise arbitration members; power community compelling obedience individuals.""

Apropos. I‚Äôm still predicting h current surge Delta peak within 3-4 weeks. Look India UK data. fast increases peak.   current vaccines vaccinated people viral load unvaccinated people, potential create vax resistant variants within vax community even dangerous variants created unvax

We need better vaccines people naturally acquired immunity legally can‚Äôt enforce mandates full FDA approval kicks in, December believe. still might case case basis, school district individual businesses. 

Until then, need heavily try educate people choose get vaccine, eliminate impediments. I‚Äôm also living Missouri it‚Äôs pretty easy track many vaccines given out.

[Yes. Yes data shows good sized tick look % standpoint. Obviously since numbers initially low, absolute numbers super exciting, going good clip better dropping 15% 20% last 3 weeks.

And ignore drop last days. That's due reporting lag. experts talk assumptions vaccines etc...were always wrong proven wrong again.....just wait waves. assumptions wronged CORONA. People/Covid Experts/Politicians still underestimating Covid Hopefully study gain-of~function version FWIW it‚Äôs unlikely would symptoms quickly. wouldn‚Äôt worry much. numbers that. may may be. Since I'm lower density area possible despite masks worn, total transmissions/deaths may lower. 

But discussion tangential main point define ""back normal."" Even assuming deaths higher virus, mean back normal. kids idea become victims long Covid not. immunocompromised kids. Children's hospitals, glorious state Texas, full capacity Covid patients. ""oh they'll get it!"" sez you, kids need hospitalization things? room them, emergency hospitalizations them. ""Oh well, bad"" sez you, imagine.

Kids naturally protected contagious illnesses. Covid could mutate make entirely vulnerable. happened Spanish Flu, one four waves. Suddenly young dying it, old. 

Want play dice health children feel morally superior yourself? answer angry expletive. deserve benefits modern medicine. Go live desert cave somewhere. sticking fingers ears saying ‚ÄúLA LA LA‚Äù?  trouble reading lips, post video selfie? seems retail it‚Äôs frustrating. People openly anti-vaxx took masks soon able. would almost rather didn‚Äôt know. also don‚Äôt like meaningless policies. Thanks writing up. 

Though I'm still even confused. goal re-open state economically recover, 100% vaccination masks best course action? 

I understand playing political games. time, people surrounded experts provide kind data need make decision. Even dumb one could see pushing vaccination would lead easier/faster re-opening state furious every aspect life I'm considered disabled type 1 diabetic considered high risk state, qualify vaccine available everyone.  Yes, definitely. Let's spread covid world majority population vaccinated. good news people still getting g vaccinated it‚Äôs still going take 2 weeks really kicks in. It‚Äôs going roughy weeks definitely still angry  ""he ok go ventilator""

Wat. patients think Covid ""leftist hoax"" that's line they've fed year media consume. CHOOSE believe it. nothing anyone making feel guilty getting shot. know someone intentionally gained weight qualify obese purpose securing appointment find nobody vaccination center bothered check things like weight, evidence essential employment, etc. lot people flat lied get earlier appointments.   realize science definition SUPPOSED move goalposts new data emerges, right? Science worldview belief system, faith. must update based facts. science. One biggest concerns virus affect long term. 8 year old nephew got COVID mild, there‚Äôs always fear long term effects. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs enough research virus hasn‚Äôt around long. Trust me, don‚Äôt want locked up. believe there‚Äôs ways keep safe giving good childhood. go normal, complicated 

If want get sick, stay home. 

It's covid, control  makes sense religious believe answer lifetime sin. know one void sin. Says thier books. would scared average. Imo.  world police pro-vax tinder? goal getting people vaccinated? fault CDC treating vaccinations kind lackadaisical personal choice, government step point focus needs done. work grocery store pretty much (99%) employees vaccinated got shots pharmacy shifts. everyone kinda knows isn‚Äôt vaccinated‚Ä¶ said im aware couple department unvaccinated maskless. guess ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell‚Äù type thing headline misleading without context, two reasons. 

The first paper looking risk long-term symptoms vaccinated people **who get covid** (i.e. breakthrough infection). title might better phrased ""two vaccine doses halves long covid risk covid infection"" - because, course, two vaccine also **lower risk getting infected covid first place**. source paper addresses - ""Given vaccinated individuals reduced risk infection overall, suggests risk Long COVID substantially reduced individuals received double vaccination.""

In words - two vaccine doses makes much less likely catch covid - *do* catch covid anyway, vaccinated approximately half chance ongoing symptoms 28 days.

The second ""halving"" risk referring people still experiencing symptoms ""more 28 day [...] infection"". Given there's central definition long-covid, definition qualify ""long covid"" people others.  I'm legitimately point think money spent trying get rest people vaccinated better used U-Hauls. pay vaccinated people move anti-vax states, pay unvaccinated move Florida Alabama. vaccines available USA went 3 phases trials drugs need go prove safety efficacy.

They process way normally economically viable. testing time, something went wrong would sent back much lose lot Efficacy BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 Vaccine

That trial 40,000 people it.




Vaccines used long time, vast majority issues coming vaccines happen within first hour. Often type allergic reaction. never seen paper shows side effects showing 6 months.

The newest ones made covid-19 initial public trials already months injection seen reputable reports long term effects, exception J&amp;J one death 7,000,000. also paused overly cautious.

We also talk biological side(not J&amp;J different type vaccine), mRNA short messenger RNA something body already creates lots every day. short life stable DNA. means system long, enough make immune system create initial defenses similar infections. US track cases may üòä massive echo chamber Wow people embracing medical freedom body autonomy, living sovereign beings ‚Ä¶.. CRAZY I'm thankful places live enforce new mask mandate vaccinated people (you show card) Thats 1960's arrogant stuff. believe places? South Korea? UK? EU? Canada?

You cannot ""see"" brain blind egos.  friend message day conspiracy quote ""with MMR vaccine get measles mumps, TB vaccine get TB flu vaccine get flu yet thr covid vaccine still catch covid"". tried explaining actually vaccine 100% effective reason measles rare days due mass vaccinations several years mention flu vaccine 40-60% effective. generally anti vaxxer like he's belief covid vaccine stop ever catching covid must hoax then. shit. explain flu practically non-existent Australia New Zealand?

If flu deaths wrongly attributed Covid, countries cases either?  don‚Äôt lie make friends Looks like changed :-(

I'll go looking elsewhere.  I'm angry vaccinated. one ‚Äúno shit Sherlock‚Äù headlines. Lol  Guidance condition switched permission appeal antibodies following confirmed exposure rather waiting positive tests. I‚Äôm going many places, want advised protocols case.  Florida best response Covid. /S want take vaccine take it. don't. simply not, anyone else make choice believe. Yes, variants. I‚Äôll make deal, win battle unvaccinated I‚Äôll start wear mask. Stop focusing easy fight start focusing tough fight. Even convinced every person like sub country, you‚Äôll still millions upon million country earth vaccinated causing variants.

Edit: I‚Äôll change up. Come plan actually win battle unvaccinated, I‚Äôll start wear mask. continue far lower case death numbers United States. pretend equivalence results astoundingly ignorant. Delta spread rates whether you‚Äôre vaxxed not. Trust science! Imagine young people smart creative, would vaccinated now. Oh, wait. /s People generally underestimate risk comes things actually pose real threats daily life (like pandemic virus cause real, longterm issues even healthy young people). worked temp job occupational safety coordinator factory year saw stuff time. wild see people actively causing harm every day care risks. Like, people refusing wear ear plugs forklifts dump metal parts metal trays feet day, noise levels regularly reaching 110 dB. refusing wear safety glasses despite metal shards flying face day. toxic 'macho' attitudes, cases people think bad things would happen, did. least examples hurting though. I‚Äôll keep wearing masks, social distancing, getting booster every 6 months. Don‚Äôt want shit! sells weed. 

Or call girl. No, new cases spread CoV2 death. Vaccinated people still catch CoV2 spread it. However, negative outcome (as death) likely.

Here's personal take:
- 2020 switched diet recommended doctors NIH (mostly plant-based almost meat). ate meat 3 meals day 30+ years prior.
- Unvaccinated wore mask prevent catching spreading CoV2.
- Vaccinated March/April 2021; never stopped wearing mask knew possibility catch spread CoV2 0%.
- far conservative health stance means endanger family. feel pain wearing mask bother me.

TL;DR 

1. let's say conservative get vaccine (with potential side effects; mine minor) wear mask never catch CoV2. harm. 0% chance death point time.
2. Let's say take chance; get vaccinated small chance dying.

IMO I'll pick option 1 every day even Sunday. could get rid Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals cannot simply turn away un-vaxxed person need medical care. would great could, going happen. Tomorrow, he'll flip flop. does. sharp rises numbers infected countries. one predict future. Honestly I‚Äôve holding one I‚Äôm pushing luck point. I‚Äôve set google alerts novavax thing that‚Äôs popping stock related nonsense. way. Work me, academic network. 

Try: 73% US adults overweight obese. guess lives matter? risk ratio 1.3 anyway obese - ""78% COVID deaths hospitalizations overweight obese"" soundbite significant sounds. normal weight like risk hospitalization reduced little. took vaccine I'm fucking idiot. Whether aren‚Äôt think reasonable people agree social media platforms like YouTube stranglehold internet media consumption could potentially abuse power held accountable.

Just Sky News Australia bad news channel doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt least conversation YouTube continuously demonitizes/bans/removes content deem troublesome not. Anyone asks proof healthy people died virus condescending manner like clearly interested actual information discussion. googling, hard find.

I'm going go back forth something obvious, sorry. Go troll someone else. WTF hate CDC now!!!!!!!!!! massive delays. look data hospitals report, we‚Äôre well 10,000 state reports 1000 fewer cases. often massive backdated surges review death certificates. still regularly find last year. local statistician charts showing actual death date versus reported death date show bad lag time is. die fucker bc get shot I'mma laugh üòÇ Florida probably ok. Still middle road far vax rates go surprised me. 

This much seasonal anything. Spike happened exact time last year, dropped dramatically winter surge. Check hospitalization charts seems clear. 

Going go assumption Florida Wild West whole time behavior isn‚Äôt leading massive spikes, drops, spikes again. 


At least time half state vaccinated probably decent chunk natural immunity too. Would imagine things plateau start dropping next week so. 

At least No, breakthrough infections happening. Try harder buddy. selfish people anti-vaxxers. Vaccines work know pretending don't. private platform obligation state reasons however much people might dislike it.

Hell, public house ban patron without disclosing public said patron banned. That's real shame. God, you. prayed ever ( I‚Äôm crazy bible thumper spiritual) donated money, tries spread word, put got vaccinated Facebook frame, tried reasonable. like many others I‚Äôm tired also scared don‚Äôt want live like rest life. Think children grow time. huge spike depression children. Children! isolation distancing. won‚Äôt least them. one way could self correct, like black plauge could kill enough people fizzle eventually. enough people die virus way travel. would optimal may way works out. shifting goalposts engaging rhetorical fuckery last paragraph. ""Objectively bad"" vis vis 51% vaxx rate example. honey, Louisiana's objectively bad. 

I'm say Texas better. Clearly can. 

I'm dispense fiction Texas done bad job. hasn't, done better average job based metric matters, amount dead compared national average. 

You time shift, pretend certain states better excuse dead (which bullshit, state governments saw Italy China yolo'd), can't change numbers. It‚Äôs me. It‚Äôs protecting others, even disagree choices get vaccine.

I‚Äôm gonna sit pretend like don‚Äôt deep dislike selfish people refuse bare minimum go get damn vaccine. don‚Äôt give fuck ‚Äútheir choice‚Äù, choice get vaccinated, you‚Äôre asshole. people legitimate medical concerns keep getting vaccinated, they‚Äôre far between.

I‚Äôm also young, vaccinated, never stopped wearing mask, even mandates around lifted. fucking are, middle death Covid cases people think getting simple vaccine much infringement freedoms.

I‚Äôm sick shit, we‚Äôre close better position, idiots country literally holding *everybody* back. Viruses political, knob. Nice try though. put words together there, buddy! virtual learning 3rd party? would try find there's options. I'm sure there's probably for-profit educational services teach remotely. likely expensive, hopefully another year so. that, feds seem completely resistant idea boosters all.

I thought systemic failure handle thing properly would come end 1/20/21, maybe optimistic. want go back normalcy think problem. Imagine still talking Trump. Move lol  live way Maryland one coworkers tested positive attending Rolling Loud, day returned work less. I've tested negative far feel fine, still really frustrating (I'm fully vaxxed), especially since county happens much community spread lately. escape Florida's awfulness. it‚Äôs still Florida, still kind impossible sympathy. much family state. could, still haven‚Äôt able roll majority human population, even countries supply good *still* struggle get enough people take it‚Ä¶ keep moving work theme parks think you‚Äôre fake account. Prove wrong! still talk Trump commissioned, made, responsible warp speed development [insert-trump-adjective] vaccines?

The ""science"" messaging taken us far go. messaging need push right capture another 10% population.

After that, try something else! leaders media truly dropping ball... Okay locking indoors would definitely reduce transmission I‚Äôm going that.

Comparing wearing mask, good hygeine social distancing locking indoors absurd. don‚Äôt think government forcing wear mask eternity slight chance might give someone disease slight chance killing makes sense

And guess what, one saying forced forever. Stop making fake arguments support opinion. 

Your entire argument 'think children' reality care, want angry something nothing life. They're damn loud tricks everyone thinking opinions held much larger group. many democrats seen hate republicans x reason, extremists hold x opinion? many republicans see hating democrats reason, extremists hold opinion?

It's bonkers...people misappropriate side believes gets mad reality they've crafted minds.  weren‚Äôt, could easily drive Nevada Arizona enjoy things way open. real lockdown like Australia France there‚Äôd police checkpoints stopping nonessential travel. Lol oh well act like raising taxes republican owned state viable. cute people generally understand nuance amount control businesses wealthy citizens policy especially since republican owned state...  Moving goal posts scientists learning disease updating things gain understanding? absolutely terrifying prospect! tracking them?  Monitoring efficacy vaccine would surely something would want know.  Surely people tested asked vaccinated.  

If shit ""we know....""  "" monitoring that"" goes much longer end converting me, fully vaccinated, stayed home pretty much year, wore mask everywhere, conspiracy guy.   

&amp;#x200B;

More thinking CDC releases information want release order manipulate behavior ""correct proper"" way.  thought mask thing beginning one deal looking like standard procedure. Correct! know people unable get vaccinated actual medical reasons, I'd like die self-centered ignorant ass? case stuff gets really crazy, Florida, everyone else guns, err protection going outside Sorry realize said that, understood always case vaccine meant importantly stop hospitalizations death. However also said led public believe vaccinated people could rarely get spread virus case original virus. Delta makes untrue everyone backpedaling social distancing measures dropped prematurely. 

When said deadly meant evaded vaccine increased transmission. actually don‚Äôt think booster help point. science journal posted months back replicates virus digital program found vaccine able mutate rate vaccine creation won‚Äôt able catch up. I‚Äôve seen lot articles scientists saying things last days. way beat strong GLOBAL vaccination program strong social distancing measures place long period time. survival rate 99% Ten year old kids shouldn‚Äôt worrying shit. wouldn‚Äôt, world actually worked together control spread. Instead virus politicized well, are. Ugh. Tom Brady? Home school always option. several siblings, including Texas home school kids. started pandemic. already it. I've disease shots. willing accept risk shot. chose shots, I'm totally ok that, accept risk goes it.   I'm longer willing wear totally f%%$%^;g useless mask government backed eyewash. means I'm ""protecting "" unvaccinated, thats risk willing take, theres do-over game. learned disease. first engaged you, didn‚Äôt realize total dumbass. would wasted time known. get flair something save us time. Lmao people tried deny vaccinated people getting infected turns lie too. Maybe better study proactive opening realizing studies hopeful reality. .002 death rate general population, going waiting long time.  1100 1300 Thursday Friday believe. Definitely lower weekends part post *over year ago* disputing exactly?

Not think says. actually says. Show big brain   antivax propaganda good, telling morons, removed. haha ok. yes latch onto justify believing doctor thats trying help die. I'm picturing episode Love Lucy translate English Spanish German French stop Lucy getting arrested Paris. Effectiveness vaccine what? Preventing hospitalization? Sure I'll grant effective that, preventing transmission (thereby ending pandemic), [not Yep!!!! Agreed. important rarely discussed Masking distancing, preventative measures. Influenza primarily spread contact surface transmission via droplets (although also spread via aerosols), Clorox wipes hand washing also helps, particularly droplet-transmitted pathogens. 

SARS-CoV-2 much contagious, particularly new variants, outcompetes respiratory viruses. Yes. Exactly. in-laws constantly speak mild cases totally dismiss deaths severe cases well probably diabetes obese. I've read heard many perfectly healthy severe fatal cases, believe it. unvaccinated course walk around without mask. know matter time get it. Thanks explanation! Doesn‚Äôt South Dakota currently lowest cases? Well, they're technically really 

But claim so. I'm sure many (some openly overtly say so).. claim ""Dying FREE better living tyranny"" (or whatever conspiracy nonsense recently heard Telegram memes)   unvaccinated person gets sick, suddenly change position getting shot die. Give time... either way, Darwinism still works.  keep hearing ‚Äúhospitalizations rising cases.‚Äù Looks like definitely are‚Ä¶ Canadian question: would need gun, could please explain? Lol mean provide fake proof hacked one's privacy issue?

If hacked data messed issue honestly particularly care someone access fact jabbed vaccine. realize theoretically mind principle reality something feel need hide - fact wish way recognize us vaccinated - maybe create restaurants vaccinated example.

Washington Post informative article able provide proof vaccination without carrying actual card. Apps currently available enable one store information supposed Like lambda variant.  Batter deep fry it. deserve normal hospital point willingly chose vaccinate themselves. Talk shit get hit morons shit. point still stands. They're probably afraid political repercussions moment, eventually greed win think. I‚Äôve seen plenty evidence shows one healthy amount vitamin body died covid Also, don‚Äôt really call booster need flu shot every year‚Ä¶ geez, years it‚Äôs barely 50% effective. normal people realize it‚Äôs still worth getting reduce risk. judged people charge vehicle safety know best not-die operating    negative consequences getting vax every six months own? Except delta variant started outside US second populace country earth breakthrough cases happening every day. let‚Äôs keep talking unvaccinated people US sole reason people still getting sick. deviled egg, it‚Äôll clear head lot media right filled liars peddling profitable lies believe in. 

Anything paycheck used watch gone wild infomercials make read support claim slightest? Well technically immune system children differs details, way details come conclusion vaccinate children based article. 

If going make extraordinary claims could affect health children, better least rudimentary understanding talking about. risk long Covid complications among vaccinated people basically nil. shown [religious demand intensive treatments near 

I wonder something some? six cases cruise last week. Keep mind others may test positive disembarking (and may never reported related cruise).

With amount breakthrough cases Delta vaccinated people, number passengers confined quarters, it‚Äôs sadly matter time. Yes I'm quite sure I'm understanding response.

If vaccination rate higher, would mostly vaccinated getting virus. That's true. risk hospitalization much less. 

I'm Louisiana, low overall vaccination facing crisis hospitals filling up. vaccination rate people 70 85%. hospitalization rates people age group much much lower peak January. mostly people aged 40-60 unvaccinated filling hospital beds now.  summed feelings well.

Individual-level decisions, whilst empowering, ineffective tackling national global-scale problems. 

We turn pandemics, climate crisis, etc. psyche-drama mass data, governmental corporate policies global infrastructure really makes difference. point agree. 

Wear mask and/or get shot (Preferably both.) 

The people right thing want return normal. stop bending backwards protect people far unwilling bare minimum. glimmer hope said thing yesterday friend. It‚Äôs hard wrap head around it. didn‚Äôt realize much population dense misinformed. don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm studies find out. They‚Äôve confirmed major drop antibodies past week blood taken cell study. means we‚Äôre likely still months away early papers population trends this. first shot back January give context timeline. health condition, check they‚Äôre studies. Nancy fucking Regan. one striking weird things going right now. One would think global pandemic would source concern everyone, apparently large number people see personal issue.

We swimming pool, whether like not. Uh... yeah. School starts 2 weeks choice send asthmatic kid scarred lungs dozens bouts bronchitis pneumonia back classroom. Texas allowing virtual learning governor signed executive order stop schools requiring masks. choice put back classroom 25 kids breathing ( never washing hands, let's real) hope vaccine mask enough, nobody else going kids wear voluntarily. could use ""angry"" appropriate descriptor. could also say terrified. children young go school. oldest born 2016 believe. Let's see hypocrite homeschools year. America defined perfectly  Terrorist Sorry loss

Every single person I‚Äôve known regardless health contracted disease lived need hospitalization - including mother smoked 20 years life

So anecdotal references outcome happens someone becomes infected

Who‚Äôs right who‚Äôs wrong two people opposing experiences? Almost two years still don‚Äôt see evidence ask question? living rock? Hahaha aaaahhh... Let them.  We‚Äôd ‚ÄúRight Crippled‚Äù movement  Virginia data adjustable date range that. Virginia around 55% fully vaccinated. Using June 1 now, 97% cases fully vaccinated, 95% hospitalizations, 93.67% death fully vaccinated. Homeschooling option right now, I'm trying rearrange life make happen. also selective magnet program specific branch science LOVES, pull homeschool year, loses spot. hate HATE might come that. Thanks, yea one sniffles lupus, expected felt pretty bad. went hospital precaution, discharged checking vitals. ok. others basically cold symptoms, test positive. I've never felt physically emotionally drained past couple years.

Take care best hope rest up, literally metaphorically.  Bring back testing NY point research. Test everyone free time. Lets see hardest hit state looks like year. people weak immune systems remain socially distanced parents protect kids keeping public. sucks people, everyone else suffer another year isolation? unvaccinated morons refuse help. Meanwhile theres still US travel ban blocking vaccinated Europeans seeing families past 19 months now, end sight.

All letting people far far riskier countries higher covid numbers...

I want see damn family.  Maybe could mandate vaccines instead enact vaccine passports? know, thought. think also depends farm animal needs second vaccine weeks apart. Take chickens imagine 10,000 chicken together. Vaccinating babies would relatively easy, corralling 10,000 chicken keeping track every single one would major chore. think wearing masks sensible.  
Vaccinated people still spread disease, tons people (kids) vaccinated choice. Force vaccinations worldwide*. Even reach herd immunity wont disappear. funny ignore huge drop cases vaccines starting masks still used. Free vaccine like test free? employer required get tested multiple times since travel work. owe money every single test. $120 per test, amount charged per test increased throughout pandemic. This.

Vaccines, people! Thanks, country, minors need parental permission get vaccinated.

WHat dumb rule.  made point freely available, highly effective vaccine first place miracle. when, if, get vaccine resistant strain. outcome seems lot grim. 

I'm seeing people panic buy aging too. I'm sure problematic last year.

I'm definitely angered. Journalism failed US. Losing trust people cost untold damage. guess turn ultimately happen capitalist society. Money else. anything happens sue school state. I'm lawyer knowingly putting people danger making precautions illegal something. seems mutate bodies people treated w/ immune dysfunction. reports this. patient unable clear virus due immune deficiency slow burn months treated w/ weapons w/ Covid. virus survives fittest, kind like cancer mutations survive chemo, radiation. Double digit mutations discovered patients. course mutations occur us fewer ones occur ""healthy"" people. Delta probably occur vaxed person India really vaxed time know. would argue Australia let vaccine roll-out, international arrivals quarantine breaches. International travel can't stopped forever (especially Australians still overseas trying return home) virus always breach quarantine eventually. vaccination rates higher Australia, breaches matter much. year charter school. self study, involvements parents (don't think supposed way lol). fill forms take exam end year. work though pretty self motivated disciplined. Literally funniest thing I‚Äôve read weeks, thank you!  Right highest rate cases Louisiana, multiple states R value equivalent higher Florida. again, Florida likely anywhere else? UK cases steadily decreasing, r value positivity rate? brain washing headline day is...... Ok. get countries board... look part life now. sucks. literally takes one plane trip vaccinated person go another country, get variant resistant vaccine, come back us back square one. Yeah shit.

And us work Healthcare beyond frustrated deal morons refuse get vaccinated taking large chunk hospital beds resources.

My hospital past weeks 8 hour ER wait getting many COVID patients coming shortness breath.

Surprise surprise find vaccinated. Fuck idiots. Eviction process takes forever dragged agreements made.

People evicted already evicted courts/rulings. it‚Äôs delayed inevitable, others chance sure.

Can‚Äôt write debt though, must paid back how. I'm confused sites show much higher number infections.  I've shielding since forever people can't arsed protecting anymore fight urge go lick lamp posts get bleeding with.

1. vaccine, tax return. 
2. Automatic audits confirmed vaccination status state, including businesses who's owners refusing. 
3. Mandatory state reporting CDC. states refuse, completely cut federal funding begin reporting two months independently verified statistics. 
4. get plane, ship, enter publicly owned building, state verified vaccine passport. 

By four things, 90%+ vaccination rates faster imagine. decline seems slowing bit, good see numbers still dropping week week ""moving on"" kind code ""ignoring reality what's happening pretending everything's okay even though isn't""?

I even understand phrase, though I've seen dozens similar posts here. ""moving on"" actually realistic option, done back January 2020 saved ton grief. Considering majority world doesn‚Äôt access best vaccines there‚Äôs pretty good chances Makes sense. still worry maintaining high standard care. 

At end day, entire thing fault unvaccinated. can‚Äôt wait bigger sticks roll them. Like businesses hospitals telling get vaccinated lose job b Past‚Ä¶ English Russian works Germans‚Ä¶ otherwise fought harder! u think republicans hypocrites u need spend less time reddit 100% this. We‚Äôre going see next weeks months breakthrough rate delta much higher expected. top anti-vaxxers anti-maskers hard work creating new variant. random mutations, directed process. certainly could mutate form covered vaccines. Uh, everyone‚Äôs breeding ground Delta. Sick kids shake virus easily can‚Äôt pass virus older weakened people. That‚Äôs fact.

/s great point South Korea little different vaccination slow motion.  checked whether may psychological? E.g. monitoring SpO2 across time. long oxygen levels optimal, think call problems breathing even may seem so. 

If zone masks required, pick mask valve. basically kill protection others you, keep protected. valve makes way easier expel air, expect comfortable surgical cloth, yet effective (for you) I‚Äôm completely okay vaccinated people whatever hell want. I‚Äôm anyone‚Äôs way. gets weirder troubling day. Yea definitely get frustration, I'd really hate see variant continue spread mutate something vaccine can't protect from.

And something someone else commented think much people want vaccine can't due age medical limitations. Yep. funny thing anti-maskers PRO lockdown everything beginning all. time democrats ones calling trump racist shutting borders, Nancy pelosi waltzing streets China town suggesting everyone go enjoy there‚Äôs nothing worry everyone fully vaccinated, would still problems. new variants easy stop original &amp; it‚Äôs effective people think. crap stay, better hope don‚Äôt get variant close SARS. I‚Äôm vaccinated, I‚Äôm realist. Serious question- delta spreading among parties pretty equally isnt chance mutation spread evenly well? may good news malaria front. Fingers crossed new vaccine tech.    mostly use account jokes want clarify wrong that. CDC's biggest fear right vaccine mutate become resistant virus spread among unvaccinated.

This whole thread relation story people fed bio-terrorist killing innocent Americans. not, fuck wrong you?  stepped bizzaro world hope vaccine helps keep symptoms mild short TIL developing countries didn‚Äôt get vaccine anti-vaxxers, they‚Äôre overpopulated. Yea sure It‚Äôs way ages. ‚ÄúOh, need understand people concerns.‚Äù side looks people disagree says ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs annihilate fuckers.‚Äù gun protect contracting covid? wont, fuck em chance. (willfully) Unvaccinated people pay treatment get sick. preventable, they're part. successfully put words I've feeling. Thank you. cost repeated testing refuse vaccine. lot family holding Novavax. able convince get mRNA/Adenovirus seem open Novavax. 

This can't get approved fast enough. 

It's double edged sword. people might convinced get vaccines, they're waiting Novavax. 

I know percent population would go this, results even 5% increase well worth fast tracking.

Btw, there's whole people holding /r/NVAX would move... know immense life turn, get away idiots (English first language) US doesn‚Äôt can‚Äôt keep track many asymptomatic cases point. It‚Äôs basically honor system. It‚Äôs sad day Trust Chinas numbers US‚Äôs thank bad political climate that.  Yea understand that. hide authoritarian tendencies behind &lt;1% population can't take vaccine stay home. Everyone see them.  Eventually worth wait, trust me. Don‚Äôt lose hope!  ‚ÄúDude, it‚Äôs *commercial*.‚Äù False. Stop hysteria learn immune system works look hospitalization rates vaccinated vs non.

Encourage people get vaccinated socially distance. fear monger. Im confused. catch spread vaccinated. people getting vaccinated affect you?! one die?!  I'm sure people would forgoe ""credit"" get people vaccinated. Unless TikTok, believe it. Yet none approved outside emergency use Protesters screaming, ""We demand body autonomy!! demand pro-choice!!"" 

Freaking hypocrits Jesus, go. pathetic. Good anyone answer? think lack social media helped time much easier convince someone vaccine safe. Issue even celebrities get vaccinated tv get conspiracy nutjobs going social media telling everyone fake really get jabbed. mean remember Fauci got jabbed started seeing posts Instagram really get jabbed trying show thr retractable syringes shows hoax. Social media made easier die hard anti vaxxers fight back whenever try show perfectly safe.  already has. vaxed April. Currently quarantined symptomatic COVID. sucks.  republican = democrat üòÇ

USA one worst political systems world. This. Everyone gets mad everything days. Man everyone sounds miserable sub. gives rats ass employee grocery store probably 15 getting paid 8 bucks hour wears mask wrong way. makes upset man would like around you. I'm sure. saw TikTok lmao. mentality almost certain thing going mutate people infected naturally causes mutations happen. continue feeling morally superior antivaxxers contributing likely inevitable future.  didn‚Äôt say anyone calling children anti-vaxxers. reminding people lot vulnerable people still cannot vaccinated. Florida's new hospitalizations reminds Dwarf Fortrress learning curve meme. go back college campus two weeks. school Austin level 4 emergency risk. could reach level 5 soon. university wants make money us. 

&amp;#x200B;

They possibly could forcing us roommates, too. Texas sucks balls.  Dicknose lying get people take vaccine? still see many people say ""I feel sorry unvaccinated people. really tragic they've misled!""

At first agreed, point, adults made decisions, decisions ruining millions people's lives. need held responsible, rather felt sorry point. Worst part last wave thats really made angry. wave, least US, purely people refusing get shot. excuse. dont want wear mask again... depends, comorbidities? deem worth risk potentially losing sense smell taste indefinite period time. part unlucky 1% vaccinated people end dying long haulers, brain fog lack energy fatigue lasts months illness passed. truly depends comfortable level risk. i've described likely happen, possibility. end accepting risks youre willing take accepting choices make ready accept outcome worst case scenario occur.

What exactly unvaxx way of?


Check findings head Frick institute UK found (and he's pro vaccine). Natural immunity reduced 5/6th.

No worries boosters coming. Canada already agreed purchase 30 million booster shots 2022, 35 million 2023, option buy 60 million 2024. Wonder country 37 mil population needs 60 million booster shots? 

I know pharma companies can't sued side effects. wonder businesses mandate vaccinations employees held liable?

Don't shoot messenger. 99.9% survival rate aren‚Äôt case numbers India. predicted numbers Alabama using India‚Äôs reported numbers model. article isn‚Äôt clear India‚Äôs actual reported peak 400K per day likely way higher that. People get covid-19 post it...it's selection bias First of, F&amp;@# people rewarded waiting long get vaccine? Second all, shouldn‚Äôt getting severely ill even dying incentive enough? Imagine world countries fuck months back covid first started spreading China. instead enact strict quarantine month two, would've quashed pretty much beginning. 

What dream, bad people greedy incompetent thing. *Research Office National Statistics found ‚Äúin age groups odds experiencing symptoms 28 days post-vaccination infection approximately halved two vaccinations‚Äù* photos I'm seeing Lollapalooza anything go by, yep 

I hear Sturgis year, too. start ruling anti vaxxers attempted homicidal maniacs? They're surely gonna cause lot death definitely purpose public data provided cdc organisations. look numbers. sign said staff customers. employees mask on. fully vaxxed since May. Still wearing goddamn mask inadvertently spread disease. Yesterday sat opposite antimasker watching Katie Hopkins conspiracy video tube. Legions people blaming governments... people blame. know are. relax man u upset. Vaccine always personal choice.  FDA pressured God, Albert Einstein, Pope. Wow turned really stupid post! LOL.  idiom, so, really meant taken literally.  here. Went Target many people without masks. didn‚Äôt one store didn‚Äôt provide stayed far away others could got quickly. I‚Äôll make sure couple masks car on. It‚Äôs scary.  I‚Äôve read last couple days, seems Israeli study showing 39% efficacy faulty, vaccinated people don‚Äôt actually transmit virus rate unvaccinated people, Provincetown outbreak fiasco completely overblown county highest vaccination rates country (so naturally cases breakthrough cases).

It‚Äôs late, however, damage done. seems like we‚Äôve set back another 5 months ordeal people legitimately believe it‚Äôs April 2020 again. Thank answer think people sub Reddit general need realize people follow pretty much news. do, it‚Äôs one biased believe. get feel need tell people taking vaccine bad actor part misinformation campaign spread fear vaccines. 7 month old Reddit account, screams something foul. seethe harder lmfao Source? fortunately children seem strong covid, long major underlying health issues worry much.

however worth shows good human being, people think like We're FL SIL critical care ARNP. entire pandemic hospital never full bc they're large rural, people went hospitals populated areas county/neighboring counties. 

For 1st time since started seriously afraid. hospital full, FL/GA hospitals trying move patients there, trying move patients out. They've cancel surgeries/other scheduled care, they're running PPE, they're workers vaxed getting breakthrough cases going quarantine they're already short staffed, complete shit show. 

All hospitals neighboring counties same, filled max sick dying unvaccinated. hospital 100% unvaxed ICU, county others sitting 95% unvaxed. said people area shes seen need hospitalized vaxed extremely old, people already serious sickness unfortunately got covid top it, extremely immune compromised like current cancer patients. 

She's hardest person I've ever met lets nothing get ICU, delta shook her. We've back isolating spike gone.  Ignore them. 

My daughter spot. lucky enough place could afford quit job keep home, school district still offering remote try secure funding. principal told phone last week they're find way fund it. backup approved application K12 remote learning, point say can't keep remote.

It sounds like pretty stuck ability work remote quit. principal super helpful, there's way keep kid safe, they'll know what's possible. trying get :(  Im vaccinated theory virus escaped lab seems plausible official theory. getting stats? according this, gap closing. levels region telling. heart left's plot. /s saying too? getting information from?  Israeli- best chance 3rd shot booster Like seriously, potty trained child pandemic wears mask day better ‚Äúadults.‚Äù Wow dunce. know what, point conceded. exactly likely arise Antarctica, Mars, Pluto,  bedroom touch night, arrive state Florida. probability places developing variant precisely equal.


/s I'm glad funny joke you. Hopefully one day smarten enough realize opinions based something angry make disagree feel. point condoms initiate mitigation efforts utilize them. mandate safety measures say can't participate activity mitigation used for. Hence wear condom sex. point masks add safety net around people. Oh, I'm sure assholes every generation. 

They Jim Crow. burned 'witches' etc. keep seething Paywall Remaining hopeful well. straight politics, pandemic got politicized beginning. Unless Covid variance turns Ebola start killing 90% population, getting another stimulus/lockdown  get play victim get negative attention.  nothing original statement

The fact is, delta break vaccines easily

That happens rare occasions mean happens frequently I'll take rough cold ICU, thank Vaccines ‚ù§Ô∏è Yep, I‚Äôm one people. unvaccinated choice. I‚Äôm people work telling aren‚Äôt getting shot won‚Äôt work, okay fuck around find then. Yes. upset! resort name calling. bets off.  Yeah, already started. Dumb. favorite people praise Donald Trump, operation warp speed get vaccine. vaccine risks even though tiny. person make decision want not? hate country become. know virus SARS virus right? Please, keep telling us wisdom oh village idiot. 

sars-cov-2 long vaccine effective death, things _should_ remain table. 

I'm okay introducing restrictions everyone people eligible vaccine refuse get it. Cystic fibrosis? reactive treatment. We're reacting change nature way predict changes occur next way get front it. 

Except true anything beyond short term. Specific strains disease weighted see one likely impact that's example yearly flu jab gets chosen, pick impactful strain vaccinate prevent future cases. mutate matter days takes us weeks months least formulate new vaccine. Let alone making sure safe. 

Yes, said still work fast look much money made vaccines.

How relevant? going delve covid conspiracies next? Yes, making money vaccines massively important resource globally currently. RIP dumb. Somehow every thread becoming ""ugh, knew would happen. CDC kept mask mandate 3 weeks like said have, none would happened"". ""This happening certain people America refusing get vaccinated"" ignoring Delta originated outside country, affecting vaccinated unvaccinated people, running wild countries high rates vaccination. Quoting people appear get cases readily, spread virus others.

I remember public health authorities publicizing information last 6 months, fact saying pretty much opposite. fact seems turning true alarmed US public health officials, caused CDC backtrack heavily previous advice.

I see arguing this, commenting evolving situation. Basically, yeah. Womp womp. Dumb posts. Distancing staying 1 meter away people seems quite useless point virus get walking past someone infected. Distancing staying away family much hardship 90 months isolation seems unnecessary.  think physical distancing required days isolating non-vaccinated vaccinated. Vaccinated people still less likely get infected entire family vaccinated, chances good fine. mischance, one asymptomatic carriers, family probably get sick die. trying save thankless community appreciate masks, inconvenienced wearing masks protocols, would group largely benefit efforts ALSO DEMONIZE IT. 

I can't blame folks eager help demonizing policies worries last 1.5 years. want reason that's reason. here. Angry tired. Also disgusted many people think called ‚Äúfreedom.‚Äù FREEDOM able get back normal without masks fear catching/spreading next variant?? thing is, anti vaxxer. corona vaccine new, got vaccine something else, (Germany mandating different vaccine measles checking already one, found vaccined for... shit, forget disease), mom highly sceptical Corona Vaccine.

OP coward. bloviating nonsense feel-good trite bullshit refuse put onus ones damage. Fucking horse shit. Please, no. I'm tired. :( fact make things defend poor choices says all

Thanks lockdown Global warming science probably pretty huge role development. Question one: Jesus name dinosaur 3 horns? Bonus points naming Bible Hero kept one pet. Thing though, two realistic options point. either mandate vaccines, open let anti-vaxxers learn hard way. Sitting halfway state forever waiting two brain cells multiply going get us anywhere. time shit get pot. Wow thanks. Wasn‚Äôt aware sub. known century masking slows spread respiratory diseases. whole reason every east Asian nation masking early boneheaded experts country dragging heels mask question.

I agree someone follows expert advice 100% time outcompete vast majority lay people try ""do research"", also times experts dramatically obviously wrong, they're subject group psychology like everyone else  I‚Äôm pretty pissed, I‚Äôm vaccinated one people work isn‚Äôt got sick COVID weeks go get tested, mention danger come variants even vaccination.  sucks people, everyone else suffer another year isolation?

Sounds like anti-mask folks sounded year ago. I‚Äôm teetering ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want wear mask solely it‚Äôs deadly unvaccinated people‚Äù territory resent making thoughts. Yup. Right CDC said OK go around without masks, everyone went back normal. way things going get bad enough people going get scared enough take even reasonable precautions. CDC may follow science aint talking sociologists. Gonna good percentage crazies matter side matter on. polarizing whole ordeal been, surprise we're seeing come woodwork saying 140 141 hospitalizations vaccinated? Yeah mom Hawaii Oregon. Correct wrong, read mRNA vaccines relatively ineffective lambda variant beginning emerge Peru. Lambda also deadly. I'd imagine variants continue evolve near totally evade prior immunity Ok. you‚Äôd agree mask mandate didnt make much difference. works vaccines NY 76%, whereas Florida 46%. Desantis urging people get vaccinated: dont understand policy controversial. People still wear masks want to. shouldnt force people to, especially effectiveness masks well established. effectiveness vaccines well-established, encouraging people get it. people still dont get it, risking vaccinated people going protected. certain southern States stopped reporting data. Wow life privilege must lead. That‚Äôs good point forgot tetanus boosters I‚Äôve gotten. don‚Äôt think problem much I‚Äôm clear it‚Äôs necessary Covid yet. thinking Covid boosters would like flu different year account new flu strains. think regulatory agencies really need come clear-cut approach massively accelerating approval process variant boosters. every booster go 10+ month approval process, we‚Äôll always losing race variants. Remind 2 weeks Unvaccinated üòé

So much salt, i'm loving üòé Wrong sub, go back conspiracy dude.  

We know actually real sources claims wear masks super comfortable, I‚Äôll actually order bought mine 1$ piece. Thanks link. Slickdeals awesome. exhaustion real. I'm essential worker, grocery store. part, started voluntarily wearing mask required, got vaccinated second could continued wearing mask months after. Permanently fucked face up; much acne ruined skin left permanent marks. feel disgusting finally got take mask off. turned two weeks going new job hope much better, I'm going start wearing mask again. I'll obviously I'm bitter every time look mirror. probably get worse. I'm depressed it, cry think long. sucks. feel like nothing. used belief gave people needed survive, humanity natural thrive natural goodness shine through. Everyone great potential good times strife band together. 

I, too, 20s. Since then, optimism replaced cynicism. say that? No. 


I said hypocrite core feature Republican mindset. Humans general pretty contrary kinds ways lying themselves. GOP goes extreme lengths signal virtues judge everyone set standards adhere actively violate flaunt. try control everyone want ultimate freedom. want government pay everything want contribute. bane civilization. vaccinated... okay natural selection taking wheel point kids though, naturally better protected vaccine. we‚Äôll keep seeing deaths directly tied Disney vacations Check r/Masks4all. Lots posts questions find masks, recommendations, etc. That‚Äôs really long way say vaccine mandate. Yep. feedback gets Texans asking reinstate mask mandate, harder digs heels. issued another executive order reiterating previous executive order schools local governments can't impose mask mandates. area local news radio stations saying barely getting back normal area almost covid restrictions lifted close year? r/iamverybadass don‚Äôt forget it, definitely don‚Äôt process president way processed actually president. 

Like drove fuckin crazy president. isn‚Äôt I‚Äôm somewhere relieved annoyed ever happened. Like working bad job, honestly. becomes common cold. modern coronaviruses arrived stasis.  Whoops. mobile, page scroller kind halfway pages.

It's page 10. interested 4 5 (80%) people hospitalized outbreak fully vaccinated. Essentially mimicking infection proportion. Raises question effective vaccine actually preventing severe outcomes. Military good stuff. it. Would better use words like ""good protection"". anti-vaxxer seize anything justify position. even matter it. get again. UK, woman currently two strains covid - one Delta. caught covid last year, woods. mean I'm angry them. natural selection point. want vaccinated Covid choice let deal consequences. act accordance current situation requires. can‚Äôt speculate could \*potentially\* occur future. would drive insane case. regardless, solution same: keep vaccinating people mitigate much risk can. think there‚Äôll come day longer worry COVID-19 new variants? I‚Äôd like think so, it‚Äôs getting harder remain hopeful. Why? still pass vax.. flu constantly mutating, corona virus... weird narrative alright.   buy gun shoots vaccines shoot up? mean, there's already hundreds millions people vaccinated globally. looking safe.  won‚Äôt. many people unvaccinated. spread high enough, breakthrough infections start matter. reasoning begin lol, ppl spent entire time calling anti vaxers idiots, censoring thier questions mindlessly apologizing institutions hypocrisy. People change thier mind berate them. Idk solution know life. two options i'd fucking take homelessness keep kid alive. I'd die son without second thought. sitting telling us kid suffers chronic respiratory illnesses honestly entertaining idea putting situation continually exposed infectious respiratory virus known species? act like thats even fucking option.... go ahead try spin play victim. reactions might understandable coming, say, 6 months year later. 

Like, get part wanting get back normal. Everybody does. That's *why* people put things hold wore/wear masks: make day come sooner. 

Do think like wearing mask, keeping distance, things weird? (I know, do, ignore idiocy.) think rather whole thing go away like chief corn-meal-brain promised would last April? 
 
The difference feelings actions corresponding adult ability make responsible choices recognize measures small sacrifice greater good. 
 
But like people process nothing. started acting IMMEDIATELY. Fake masks, stunts, filmed ambush confrontations people trying job. Immediately. Thus worsening problem well everyone else. 
 
I try contemptuous, people daily challenge effort.  Agreed. I‚Äôm exhausted trying look bright side. disagree. We've got point virus shell *if vaccinated,* variants evolve could become problematic, amount social political capital would required legislate enforce mandate would absolutely prohibitive. today deaths, AFAICT serve moderately good proxy moderate- severe case, started rising recent wave; granted, deaths lag behind cases weeks may change next couple weeks. point, we're approaching point vaccinated individuals, risk illness, disability due long term illness, death due covid high completely anomalous compared background risks every day life. Let doubters miserable let us get vaccinated get back life. can't wait. entire world better fewer people, especially ones stupid get FREE vaccine! come Florida

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Weak. Yes fortunate variant wasn‚Äôt around earlier. think difference unvaccinated Delta cases vs vaccinated Delta cases proof vaccines working well allowed us avoid total disaster. would horrible struck us last summer last winter. Yes, I'm aware. I'm currently break hospital work at. 

Doesn't mean *more* likely wear mask? could still infect someone whose vaccinated could spread someone cancer someone serious condition. Wearing mask *mild* inconvenience covid control really see ppl getting uppity wearing mask public again. 

I'm tired anti vaxxers man. get it. They're annoying ridiculous absurd living fantasy world. still want get sick die spread someone whose compromised. I'm actually mad Bezos going space happening using newspaper deflect that. Absolutely true last point. New vaccines could made pfizer moderna testing new version formulation mRNA vaccines starting July. issue is, would convince people vaccinated event new strain either fully partially evades current vaccine immunity? refrain would first shot work, would one? strain evade vaccine immune response would likely evade past infection immune response robust. reset clock. Yes virus would eventually reach max fitness pain timeline get would hurt greatly. important note every pandemic human history ended vaccines modern invention. end, that's question. question much pain experience get there. delta variant, chances higher delta. even amount vaccinated people get infected low, let alone transmision. He's also made law one make vaccinations mandatory. He's doubled killing everyone vaccinated probably worst possible thing anyone could right now, far worse simply vaxxed. acting incubators super virus 100% resistant vaccine. wipe unvaxxed, ensure strain produced cannot stopped vaccines. know sure - housing prices desirable states Covid wise insane right now. Vermont hardly apartments rent houses market going wayyyy they‚Äôre actually worth.  You‚Äôre part going presumably large social gathering knowing vaccinated people get spread virus... Okay... country that?  Fun fact google. type number 1 1000 add new cases behind hit enter. know quickly viruses mutate evolve? That's literally reason new virus strains issues vaccinations effective anymore. Right?! feel like I'm gaslighted guilt trips nowadays people, feel exactly zero guilt.

Science says pandemic unvaccinated. us listened science **are** vaccinated therefore protected even Delta variant, fuck else supposed do? Antivaxxers decided dumbass cultish ideology defiant ignorance important **staying alive**, let die. Maybe fear death *peculiarly* comes *these people like minds* motivate get fucking vaccine virus - ya know - thing we've fucking century prevent exactly type scenario. Fucking jackasses. think you‚Äôre right major challenge. It‚Äôs like pulling teeth get initial vaccination rates high. distribute variant boosters every six months, declining uptake iteration. 

I don‚Äôt really know solve problem short form vaccine passport, politically unpalatable U.S. Western countries present. Wait, he's expert though.. ask anything! Yes think so. US CDC even used masks kind bargaining chip encourage people get vaccinated. is, get vaccinated, need wear mask! 

This coming back haunt them, hastily walking back. love inaction lengthens amount time live bullshit virus life. Everyone get additional amount tax refund (Germany, US, wherever) they're vaccinated. largely people coming states spreading virus.  Fuck Anti Vax murderous pos. Ever time hear one dies covid angel gets it‚Äôs wings. Money, honestly. moved 7 years ago make money can't afford leave can't afford rent anywhere else moving another state costs thousands. rent gone since 2015, 60-75% homes within 20 mile radius rent for.  Incredibly coherent helpful comment. Get fucked. I'm idea homeschooling cases, might end homeschooling kids elementary mom 40 year veteran elementary teacher that's retire live us. ones really get.

I see chin maskers. Still. Like ok want wear mask, least lie like assholes pretend got shot wear it. chin mask making look extra dumb now. *Florida entered chat*  aunt nurse explained way sounds little disrespectful nurses problem. quite bluntly put nurses medically trained taught fundamental emergency procedures properly carry common tasks way reduces likely hood additional complications infection. 

They're taught give injection properly they're injecting works. 

The problem describe like sounds like shitting nurses case. simply pointing they're epidemiologists vaccine specialists. brain tumour go visit foot surgeon oncologist spent years studying specific type brain cancer? talking shit foot surgeon point area expertise ends. Much like break foot would rather see foot surgeon brain surgeon. 

The reality nurses simply educated areas. injure nasty cut nurse awesome go see exactly training skill useful. know clean wound properly bandage it, etc. reducing likely hood becoming infected. average nurse know enough say ""the vaccine dangerous"" be, imho, struck using position give medical advice qualified give. 70 yo parents get vaxxed, say might already it. suggested get antibody test confirm least little immunity, peace mind. Nope. right? numbers came directly CDC Mortality statistics, unless think they‚Äôre trustworthy. tell real number say correct? personal choice. want get vaccine it, don‚Äôt, don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs place tell others bodies. that‚Äôs selfish guess that‚Äôs it‚Äôs gotta dude. 

Read said. said unvaccinated, people 12, rare. stats looked include people people could get vaccinated refused to. checked US history. 

So yes, selfish affects everyone. Period. Getting vaccinated like getting abortion smoking pot. someone either, affect society.

Not getting vaccine affect whole society. Since checked CDC bother find there's variant? know there's mutations?

More mutations happen, die, maybe go away kind life long aliment, that's okay, dude. ""mah fweedoms important life."" CDC CEO Pfizer said similar things. Plus, Beta delta (to lesser degree) proven Covid evolve vaccine evasive. obligation stop mutating vaccines stop existing strains. they‚Äôre violent, deal them. This. get downvoted saying wearing masks makes sense prevent restrictions. hate may need antivaxers, unfortunately makes sense. Especially Schools. two young children. fine wearing masks last year. sucks, enough classmates vaccinated makes sense. Don‚Äôt give yet, /u/failed_seditionist

If enough us sow sedition, eventually succeed danger kids can‚Äôt get vaccinated, would refuse wear mask point. US, everyone chance get vaxxed, refused, fuck em. Florida admitted traded lives economy. shouldn‚Äôt surprising anyone. wouldn‚Äôt gain much foothold everyone vaccinated. Think like wall border actually works. Glad read this. moment thought Germany unusually regressive regard children consenting medical treatment.  Yes, measles vaccination mandatory kids since 2019. Seems like cdc recommending mask wearing based economy science. half people aren‚Äôt getting vaccinated would ok take masks off? guess placate got vaccinated.  money could make got yesterday anti-vaxxers social media. Projection fear onto others, misinformation regurgitated, downright ignorant attitudes toward anything challenges ideas, mind-blowing incredibly depressing. today anti-vaxxer post would anything help anyone struggling, guess ends vaccine? makes goddamned sense people ACTUALLY BELIEVE THEMSELVES. genuinely think they're right thing. Zero self awareness zero self accountability.  Test illegals crossing border Texas etc. many testing positive.  That‚Äôs problem is!  Better yet, close border. he‚Äôs child making tantrum?  definitely 61%. Statistics show 57% least one dose, somewhere 48-50% fully vaccinated. many people can't get vaccine? Due allergies immunocompromised whatever else. sort numbers actually talking about? Natural immunity people catching recovering infection, whether vaccinated not, help, too. care nothing people don‚Äôt care themselves. I‚Äôm surrounded people still wearing masks even though around 40% vaccination rate high levels COVID. Kids, adults, wearing mask. again, please tell care don‚Äôt care themselves?  

Again, argue position rather name calling? can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs sound logic. Yes, selfish. hope. like it‚Äôs approved yet me. hope comes soon work office 2/3 antivaxxers. ""lied"" management get allowed come back work getting work home last year. meanwhile got stuck pickup counter non-consentually job supposed cube! jerkoffs cant even common decency keep lie pretend gotten vaccine like they're REQUIRED order wear masks office.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Temperatures could‚Äôve problem, too. Luckily, weather mid 80s here, going several days really hot. school thought folks drinking, eating bbq, walking around families. wouldn‚Äôt want vaccine done conditions either. talking third dose shot, anything delta-specific Yep don‚Äôt know one. think people trying solve intractable problem. masks though? I‚Äôm curious state specific. 

I‚Äôm vaccinated life back normal. don‚Äôt even carry mask more. stores restaurants go back normal. Work back normal. kids schools going back normal. 

So yea, life‚Äôs back normal. don‚Äôt really care unvaxxed die. here‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hoping relatively normal senior year. amount times I‚Äôve considered dropping much fines unvaccinated.

Source? Could use truck (a proper one pickup) this, instead cart? Pay good wage I‚Äôll it. 51 Near immunity immunity. Claiming confer immunity demonstrable falsehood. Tell Joe Anti-Vax vaccines make ‚Äúimmune‚Äù first thing he‚Äôll point breakthrough deaths feel he‚Äôs lied to.

They work well, they‚Äôre perfect. There‚Äôs reason disingenuous pretend vaccines magic panacea. claim nothing help creates distrust. Exactly point. I‚Äôm done spending time conversation someone cites Twitter poor grasp topic. I'm mostly. Yeah, could get 8 billion mask vax would remove selection pressure immune escape pandemic would promptly end (excluding zoonotic reservoirs). prospect printed hopium there's way make happen. society certainly voluntary social movement. takes average 46 million confirmed cases make one variant concern, virus take billions Earth unvaccinated unmasked make number. masses people masked prevent gonna happen. selection pressure real unavoidable. We're going deal escape variants unlikely event arise, masking tailored boosters.

People put ""what if"" stuff think through. mean mask up. course should. why. Nothing going return 'normal,' world far gone. know unvaccinated ones shutting everything down.

Divide conquer finest  Ding ding ding winner


Once big money insurance companies starts getting affected, see mandated vaccines, period, amount flag waving cousin-screwing going get dumbass anti vax people it. 


If there‚Äôs anything trust, it‚Äôs big money gets affected, bought sold politicians required something this. Honestly, vaccinated worry unvaccinated anymore. They've made choice. I'm fully vaccinated, healthy willing roll dice Covid. point move on, can't let guy one leg dictate pace relay anymore (so speak). SSN?!?! 

It's tied practically EVERYTHING do. Job, cars, house loans (any loans really), school, banks/cc, cell phones, license, doctors, I'm sure I'm forgetting ton things. mind boggling. you‚Äôre also suggesting CDC lying fully vaccinated people protected hospitalized getting sick - false. extremely extremely effective still despite 100%.

I'm suggesting CDC lying. Look posts. I'm pro vax, historically trusted CDC. know vaccines work, acknowledge critical ending pandemic. However, disappointed public messaging around them, reluctance admit vaccines alone sufficient. heard ~95% effective preventing hospitalization death, also general symptomatic illness, spread, etc. months now. Clearly CDC promoted messaging without sufficient data back up. mask recommendations (fully vaxed safe _anything_) personally convinced, feel let down.

The CDC's new data says 15% in-hospital COVID deaths fully vaccinated individuals May 2021. 9% COVID hospitalizations fully vaccinated. Slide 4: 22 also Vaccines prevent severe disease, may less effective preventing infection transmission‚ÄìTherefore, breakthrough community spread despite vaccination

Again, I'm disappointed CDC's messaging topic months ago indicate anything close this. Instead basically indicated pandemic vaccinated. knew delta variant existed said fully vaccinated mask. Furthermore, knew possibility vaccine resistant strain emerging. premature public messaging muddied waters complex situation, damaging public trust across political Another post wrote situation ‚Äúworse ever‚Äù - it‚Äôs actually way tools fight pandemic beginning.

Worse ever terms daily cases. Hospitalizations deaths (yet), thank god. comment specific Florida Also infer fully vaccinated people specifically avoid maskless around without taking account unvaccinated? please point study says that?

I recall specifically inferring that, well may have, rationale would since new data indicates infected vaccinated individuals viral load comparable unvaccinated individuals, think makes sense take preventative measures around even fully vaccinated. correct though new public guidance vaccinated individuals protecting areas may unvaccinated individuals. clear yet whether asymptomatic transmission prevalent symptomatic transmission, better safe sorry? studies/reports points:

* parent vaccinated can't child stays home like done already. want that's personal risk.

Now parents vaccinated need start thinking children education. education already mean allow youth get chance. adult want vaccine put family. Time care rest class. That's guy, pasty white eyelids all. really 18 since parents 12 &amp; high level refusal vaccinate kids well, don‚Äôt want risk anything. can‚Äôt careful. Delta really gained ground SW Missouri brought ot Branson hot tourist spot. less 30% vax rate flourished going around rest country. Unvaxxed areas raging ""Preliminary investigations""
Someone can't read ü•≥ü•≥ GG  Orange freak lost, happened, CNBC. Accept read dozens comments claiming Australia zero covid countries vaccinated choice chose permanently lockdown instead attacking concept lockdowns. short, sarcastic comment seemed supporting exactly argument. lockdowns not? affiliation lol. also work Biotech :) don‚Äôt understand them. They‚Äôre acting like vaccine requirements brand new. honestly despise half country. last 10 years gone trying understanding accepting differences opinions views‚Ä¶but can‚Äôt anymore, sick tired living side side people. i'm never gonna get see BTS concert, i? fuck hate people. Yes, pay consequences pro-pandemic actions, enjoy benefits rest us getting vaccinated. Every time unvaccinated person mentions nice go movies happy concerts back want fucking scream. nature non-confronting, respectful person getting harder leave dead silence stupid tone-deaf words.  Prazosin  Yeah sorry, that's correct. *unlikely* make big jump quickly, ""impossible"".

And current environment mix vaccinated unvaccinated people coming contact perfect environment evolutionarily select vaccine resistant variants happen.

At point say fuck it. Mandate them. care whatever ""freedom"" I'm giving make unnecessary deaths stop. They're probably stupid freedoms, I'll whatever thing need stop dying.

Go door door. Vaccinate everyone. Anyone refuses, quarantine disease longer endemic, one ankle thingies make stick.

If medically unable, forced quarantine strong advisory stay put.

Masks enforced like public nudity: refuse wear one, serious charges every time forced quarantine. Make public health risk something register inform new neighbors of.

I'm tired angry people dying abstract ideal protecting right stupid. want happen. need workers blame eachother rather tell employers f stop virus/ improve working conditions/ask hazard pay.  Give Good. Endemic means widely circulating population akin regular cold flu viruses Kn95 necessarily comfortable. like n95 depends style fit. Kn95 literally means China's standard North America's. 99.9% survival rate. don‚Äôt care Yes, know. Thanks news. anti-vaxxers using wide spread contagion created proof vaccine doesn‚Äôt work.

That's pisses much. Since I'm 18 *NEED* parental permission get vaccine let me, Highschool started last week. I'm fucking scared, even people 2 vaccines need 3rd booster gotta catch up. I'm Junior now, really wanna live graduate üò≠ listening experts falsely said masks useless general public March 2020?  Haven‚Äôt seen flags recently county least. well we're going rabbit hole lets stop treating obese, smokers, alcoholics anyone else self harm. reason doesn‚Äôt work, revert coercion. 1% people die covid I'm clearly risk. 0.000001% people die vaccine way much risk! That‚Äôs apocalypse get behind 76 million people die everywhere causes lot people feel sorry clutching pearls odd disparity, especially since FL lot old people... although, perhaps this~ vaccine uptake over-65's (the highest risk people) really high USA, want say like possible death rate FL low old people really good getting shot? cofactor may under-65's already lots exposure due low levels restrictions throughout, may natural immunity? talking a$$ think least one possible explanation. Seems like big business growing sick shit (the pandemic wearing unvaxxed weight pulling us down)

 Look big companies starting mandate vaccines. stupid. full FDA approval comes, near time Delta could already making dent raging economic comeback, enough big business start mandating employment. Remember golden rule.. gold, makes rule. off-topic user name makes uncomfortable due working biotech/research lol nearly refused continue reading. decided ignore realised right. ""Blocked me"" still downvote me. childish. Oh well guess convo waste time. Atleast humilated quite amusing. fuck supposed mean? then? would nice could reason someone belief use reason arrive at, it? Ironic look usually fit dynamic end worst &amp; likely end hospitalized: obese, older, shape look like life bad them. Nice, new Delta variant what‚Äôs holding us back. trying get us pissed unvaccinated people reason. 

Since last week, DOD personnel wear masks (again) even vaccinated strictly Delta variant. 

It‚Äôs unvaccinated. mean really make sense you? can‚Äôt anything people refusing vaccinate?? Bro, please. You‚Äôre halfway realizing lib circlejerk üëç  Furthermore, report lead false findings, merely stated *proven* true. point time, found *clear evidence* (of virus jumping known person known person B, keep mind virus identified made PCR-testable less week before).

TLDR problem messenger receiver. ""Stop treating us like children!"" howled GOP, beating toddler fists floor. fact remains many concerned older weakened populations. often drain economy don‚Äôt provide much tangible benefits. It‚Äôs sad true reality -I wish could see positives vulnerable older pop.  reported 10 fold. wonder would happened seat belt laws enacted now, laws smoking public. Really ? wife (56F) spent 7 days hospital COVID several weeks second shot. I'm stoked. dumb clocks getting hospitalized. get want, within reason, I'm responsible adult social distance properly. Darwinsism. people dying hospital great loss.  Sure seems really unlikely people sick enough hospitalized unvaccinated hospitalized lack vaccination somehow keeps icu. There‚Äôs readily apparent mechanism would cause that, misprint seems seems likely. alreary vaccinated, problem? honest you, 1983-1986 fresh mind. That‚Äôs called coercion.   Honestly, fuck cares someone unvaccinated point?! want take risk let them, live life don‚Äôt worry people! next mutation? Every infection opportunity mutation. I'm glad spent many years suicidal let gun one I'd gone postal long-ass time ago.  anti-vaxxers: NEW NORMAL!

sane people: good news, get back actual normalcy get vaccinated

anti-vaxxers: WANT OLD NORMAL NEED VACCINE MASK COVID EXIST! one hate lumped unvaccinated. really wish could vaccinated, risk high. week 2019 went visit friend Europe. Instead jet lag 6 hour time difference, actually waking friend feeling fantastic happy every morning. days, realized big part I'd waking would still like 2am DC even evil people sleep, accidentally checked social media habit coffee, mornings starting with, ""What stupid shit say today? war yet? whom?"" remember hearing line went ‚Äòyou let life make harder calloused let life make softer loving‚Äô. It‚Äôs amazing see people choose ‚Äòharder calloused‚Äô Still boggles mind people bitched loudest ""wanting return normalcy"" ones actively preventing everyone returning normalcy... Wait second, want ""smuggle"" two vaccine shots inject children without approval healthcare institutions, virus that, specific case babies toddlers, death rate comparable flu? Tell joke please. reported anyway smuggling kind of... illegal. folks read history. CIA exists mind goes real bad guys like russia something. support american people 100%. Ignorance bliss. allowed speak this. young perfect health. I‚Äôve Covid twice &amp; screened antibodies. 

Sounds like propaganda‚Ä¶  97% people hospitalized unvaccinated, acceptable recourse ridicule refuse get vaccinated. fair someone followed CDC guidance since started got vaccine soon available, *still* wear mask life affected covid due never took initiative protect others first place.

I‚Äôm glad vaccine effective keeping people ICU, free charge widely available US. hope don‚Äôt collectively take steps backward stubborn ignorant society. I‚Äôm ready move on. I'm scientist field take genius realize boosters declared necessary vulnerable end year within month two. 

Science effective open collaboration. CDC insists knowledge must invented ""here"" ignore rest world; that's blew call testing continue herky-jerky conflicting guidance."
