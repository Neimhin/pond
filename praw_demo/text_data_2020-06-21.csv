Alpha defensins cross-check certain kinds bacterial activity inflammatory cytokine activity (like cytokine storms COVID-19). I‚Äôm little almost corona-free bubble San Diego. people LA driving see friends weekends Arizonans spending week-long vacation beach, it‚Äôs matter time get hit. Call skeptical doooomer want, also don‚Äôt believe numbers second. Everything trending upwards last weeks, yet I‚Äôm supposed believe deaths lowest since pandemic first hit back March? States alone likely passed 23 official death count, let alone entire country. like discipline child. Even treatment getting better, ICUs overwhelmed, people going die. Regardless treatments have. wait till hear guys throughts weed Depends are. live city, chances SD totally impratical. town barely see anyone, masks optional.

And mutually exclusive. naturally regardless. People outside more, getting sunshine. Less people stuck cold dry indoors, breathing circulated air. nothing else outdoor activities allowing careless people get much lower viral doses (therefore less severe cases). Likely social distancing mask wearing also effect keeping viral loads lower (yes even everyone it, it‚Äôs still making difference). Lastly people much quicker test outbreaks. NY 5000 cases day bet really like 50,000: shit totally control. Maybe south getting think Texas gets 3,000 new cases it‚Äôs like 5-10 thousand reality testing skewing scope problem. lastly south reckless seems, perhaps things get worse weeks again. thoughts (some speculation know) blessing. One main ways got lucky thing affect children. Lol yeah. live state (AZ) similar population (7.3mn) fully reopened month ago. past two weeks ballooned 3,000 new cases per day we're rising geometrically.

Two days ago governor finally allowed cities issue mask requirements going sued didn't, immediately every large town state mandated masks public. bad we've spent months people wearing them, getting used conspiracy theories masks worse virus (yes really, people believe that).

I really envy people live failed nations.  Ding dongs assume mean outside metro area. Suburbs taking seriously. hour outside city ugh, wish true. today somewhere signs saying ‚Äúour city requires masks indoor public spaces, escorted without mask‚Äù meanwhile half us workers happily serving wearing masks. it‚Äôs extremely frustrating someone trying hard right thing. Worldometer says 122,200 Sunday night Treatment gradually getting better hopefully number deaths remain level increase bit. Many public health experts, however, suggest time celebrate. 120,000 Americans died new virus, 2.2 million confirmed cases. real numbers believed higher. think you‚Äôre going get used virus around you. America given battle coronavirus. Cases spiking up, weeks days ahead people around virus. used oppose anyone sub said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre going get eventually‚Äù see what‚Äôs going here, I‚Äôm afraid may right.

And that‚Äôs terrible.  powerful. powerful need stop stay inside. need money. need government give us money use money buy food survive. Nobody needs go outside. sorry lupin. situation say government healthcare system? recently finished treated cancer afford go back work medical bills. emphasizes country's lack safety net prioritizes profit human life.

Funny. experiment go store. look everybody eye. Always have. people wearing masks even look me. called democratic freedom. Twice? Even best countries would struggle catch half infections.

Try 25-35x higher.

22,000 people died. know people die average three weeks getting infected, fatality rate 1%, give take 0.1s. means least 2 million infected three weeks ago. Since half Mexico's cases happened *since* then, means 4 million infected.

But real number even higher, since countries even getting death figures right. That's especially big problem Latin America.

Right now, Mexico could easily 5 6 million cases (including people recovered). think people agree want people experience prosperity, ultimately labor part market people see means end focus strengthening market.

The face touching interesting point. first time really tried seriously study cloth masks coronavirus first SARS outbreak. case, Vietnam didn‚Äôt enough PPE health workers institutions permitted homemade cloth masks fallback, others banned use cloth masks approved actual PPE. incidence infection actually considerably higher institutions **with** cloth masks. believed one main reasons increased amount workers touching faces adjust mask - would touch eyes, transmitting virus particles collected outside masks sensitive ocular mucosa.

 truth strictly preventing incoming viruses, would telling people wear masks filtration efficiency poor control they‚Äôre made, it‚Äôs likely give people false sense security it‚Äôs going good. would case way knowing infected - either disease spread people symptoms, sort universal testing protocol efficient accurate - could isolate people infected. Since neither things, frankly testing horrible point likely improve much, remaining protocol assume everybody infected everybody wear mask last ditch resort try catch coughs sneezes.

In Russia tested hospital free doctors reason think may covid (so symptoms present time) pay testing (usually private clinics) symptoms (these areas considered clean).

While Russia self isolation people reasons pay testing (some companies required testing, regions required testing entrance). course many people tested felt fine asymptomatic cases. 

Russia started way quarantine, regions stopped restrictions course people fine tested less hence number asymptomatic cases falling. Texas. Texas' 254 counties, 5 completely dry, 196 partially dry, 55 entirely wet.

Federer injured play 2020. think Nadal invited, players neighbouring countries Serbia Croatia (except Thiem Zverev) see article fiasco. Washington still popular? used live Washington Yale 2012-2013 know music fair. That's great. fact first wave much higher would imply much lower number vulnerable people (because already got died). 

It much higher. current point time US roughly 120.000 deaths selected W.-European countries have, rescale numbers US-population level, roughly 136.000 deaths (13% - factor 10-day lead drops 11%). big worry really due still high infection numbers, US daily deaths drop Isn‚Äôt way early claim US results worse?

I would agree that. Honestly, good bad country pandemic whole see second wave still far fewer deaths per person EU.

Not many fewer: (again shifted US 10 days left). One estimate US may overtake W.-Europe sometime July, especially since infection numbers much higher moment. course, deaths number also criticized problematic, since deaths counted equally across countries. Using excess deaths considered better, found good source data yet. think willful ignorance way living significant portion population. miss HEB. Specs. Things must really bad TX this! dont think worry COVID normalized like flu. forget players human would surprised least good portion let happen. might topic relate way many places denied service bicyclists encourage car situation couple times never I'm curious crovi19 Thanks trying bring reason nuance reddit.  Let google you, then.

Oxford University Vaccines varies depending germ contagious is. contagious people need vaccinated herd immunity work. example, measles contagious. use measles vaccine, every person measles would infect another 10-15 people disease would spread quickly. achieve herd immunity measles least 90-95% population need vaccinated. disease like polio less contagious, 80-85% population would need vaccinated herd immunity work. Although lower still high proportion, especially given people cannot vaccinated medical reasons.

The R0 SARS-CoV-2 per CDC zero mitigation acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 causative agent ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates early dynamics outbreak Wuhan, China, suggested doubling time number infected persons 6‚Äì7 days basic reproductive number (R0) 2.2‚Äì2.7. collected extensive individual case reports across China estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including incubation period (4.2 days). designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches infer outbreak dynamics Wuhan using high-resolution domestic travel infection data. Results show doubling time early epidemic Wuhan 2.3‚Äì3.3 days. Assuming serial interval 6‚Äì9 days, calculated **median R0 value 5.7 (95% CI 3.8‚Äì8.9).** show active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, early strong social distancing efforts needed stop transmission virus.

That means vaccination rates immunity strategies rely significant portion population become immune stop spread virus. higher R0, larger percentage population must become immune total number active infections decreases epidemic burns out. R0 5 7 require 80% 85% population become immune number infected start decrease. important clarification - 5 linked, 1 diagnosed early caught protest. 2 attend protest, close contacts did. joke, literally what's happening right now, especially weekends

The thing is, contrary think, far easier coverup death covid: 

With covid, either suppress testing suppress positive results, suppress testing tried caught, coverup positive case actively discard data

Death hand caused number things, easily attribute death pneumonia, heart failure, old age, still technically correct audited. classic likely happen next time around enough families remember cases. Hong Kong since second pandemic, listened one wore mask, whatever anyone said.

Happens everywhere world. 

You never know many people got virus unless test every one them, practically impossible. Hard explain though. Florence still part wealthier North Italy - middle less Rome.

Emilia-Romagna early hotspot close Florence.

If regional divide political, Lombardy right-leaning Florence/Tuscany pretty far left.

I'll translate popular comments

Some people blame people eating seafood ignorant. truth is, even know seafood contagious cooked, afraid eat environment. nothing ignorance not, human nature. family dashing fearless go outside usual without fear contagion. people, like me, cautious cowardly living lives, afraid food contamination, afraid cooking! chef contagion, fear waiter contagion, fear every factor could pose risk large family. nothing bravery knowledge, life.  Two separate studies CDC coronaviruses within past thirty years concluded become less lethal multiple transmissions. quickly happens many transmissions...who knows. correct, thanks! Yes.

He refused testing left Belgrade. guys lot people wearing masks? American, I‚Äôm little jealous.  president power force everyone wear mask It‚Äôs almost July people still talking wearing mask.

That‚Äôs absurd lost words  Pretty much. talks much personal responsibility, numbers go puts blame others instead better managing reopening state. world going see less developed nations going deal corona horror show. China probably best lockdown capabilities europe best infrastucture deal countries getting hit arent lucky regards. Personally... think lot people, hard traumatic lives, sitting home months time really bad. Like, would take last year year childhood day. also think people third world countries like... feel pretty fine getting grocieries delivered house watching netflix day. Americans give fuck wrong. dumb asses think RIGHT leader said hoax. Fucked situation. Sorry rest planet. We're trying better next time huge amount medical bills

Medical billing United States meaningless. insurance companies demand ever steeper discounts, hospitals post ever inflated prices. absurd point farce collapse. things fine next summer, going goddamn summer remember. It‚Äôs simple really, African nations may large populations also huge size, along this, west African nations already gone Ebola aren‚Äôt strangers Major life changing events caused disease.

Along this, African nations don‚Äôt burden extreme obesity levels like uk USA generally lot easier deal covid people shrug young. Probably rumors spread ‚Äúblack people immune covid‚Äù

Definitely true lmao TBH even worse since NYC least truly capacity. Sweden, ""ICUs overrun!!!"" became major talking point goal itself, even though *was* spare capacity *still* turning elders away maintain spare capacity. really sick sad. Er, (Australia) go see family doctor, complain breathing problems, insist chest image can‚Äôt work like this, get referral X-ray, make appointment X-ray go get done. immunity among population substantially slow spread gets around 60%. right now, highest estimate I've seen NY ~25%.  high enough prevent even really moderate much second wave. helps masks. people elsewhere hit hard yet simply wearing them. got seven day ban making fun Donald Trump said word ‚Äúcargo‚Äù Italy getting ready tourist season instead, come wherever wish, borders, racism case. We've ordered new tech! decontamination chamber helps extend use PPE. 

Just waiting come in.

Some super expensive, though. Sooo sccaaarryyyy woooo. boogey virus.  People beginning loosen (east) too. pretty good first two months, I'm complaining. people getting upset they're reminded police 5 feet rule still needs obeyed, lol sound like hoaxer idiots blamed cases hospitals saying everyone died COVID collect money. lot easier prevent spread professor lecturing 50 feet nearest person parent live got accountant get asshole looked at. irrelevant? seem versed technical terms get mean. 

I cannot explain studies, I'm going based recent articles find hearing/reading several anecdotal reports. 

Could provide challenge studies speak of? 

I'm also seeing claims reinfection might rare, possible. seems like experts ready form firm opinion often agree much learn corona. large popular bars. incorrect. Canadians fly US seemingly precautions taken upon arrival, Americans can't exactly flock here. exemption permanent residents immediate family members come here, touristic purposes. still legally required self-quarantine 14 days. discredit model, look deaths see spike. model shows fewer estimated cases today late May. Unconfirmed cases missing May, due enough tests everybody Coronavirus. cells memorize cope virus first infected muster effective protection second round infection, said. Scientists still investigating whether mechanism works new finding paper doesn‚Äôt mean sky falling,‚Äù said, also noting number patients studied small.

Antibodies aren‚Äôt means body fight infection. Yep sadly. think also important look beyond cases look hospitizations icu admissions. People always say testing oh young get sick. Comparing hospital rates negates bs. seem remember Florida publishing stats.

Happy wrong 6 - 8 weeks sadly think so. think 81 2000 early late. least formative years around turn. pre 85 would call gen x. post 96 would call gen z really enough consumption turn century culture. That‚Äôs job. hate say it, we‚Äôre fucked.

I know ... yet.

That's simply I'm vaccine becoming readily available fall. Oxford one said 2 billion units ready distribute October. believe Moderna said expect one distribution election day US (1st Tuesday November). 

Regular people get vaccinated try get back sense normalcy. going huge swath people refuse get vaccinated likely get extremely sick next winter. know got downvoted. literally small sample group proved reduce hospital stay like minimal percentage increase. raise stock price something anything else. Given response increasing disaster climate change, pretty brand.

Why deal scary problem pretend hope get lucky? Americans think thing mask prevent exercise freedom. Americans really smart apologize even trying kill us all. It‚Äôs Extroverts Legal illegal, USA, money power, probably whatever. Probably. Going court expensive all. Im talking emissions outbreaks, produce whatever ambiental damage is, rather pay 200 device made elsewhere China. want profit think sustainability Americans think spread rest country. necessarily end world. need research memory cells, would allow antibodies produced rapidly case new exposure.

Antibodies decline rapidly lots different infections. big deal body retains blueprint make more. Thats sacrifice desantis willing make think anyone suggesting virus would could spread protests. part ideal place virus spread. I'm hoping materials costs drop. :) ""wearing mask goes freedumb"" crowd suck it. it. leadership clapping back masks enabling idiots suck even harder. Go group critical Swedish healthcare workers ask then. Surely now, covid-19 provide subsequent immunity, would many reports people catching twice? Could statistician maths confirm disconfirm this? Like, imagine (for arguments sake) there's 1 200 chance catching covid-19 IMMUNITY surely means there's 1 40,000 chance catching twice, given millions people now, would mean hundreds people would reported catching twice. reports? None all? surely makes highly likely catching provide immunity. Like, using bayesian statistics? low reporting days deaths, cases. Handlebar dump anyway. Fuck you, can't tell live! 

Such ridiculous response. Hardly anyone wears mask like wearing them, wear they're decent fucking humans want part slow virus spread no

its bars, restaurants, people slowly wearings masks, socially distancing much. plus tourists

AND increase testing. 

the beach problem. spread design (there wear hide virus, going vaccine soon). I'm sorry hear that. story precisely even someone wants gamble health, need consideration others.

Of course, anti-maskers like say ""Stay home, then!"" high-risk people need groceries too, live places grocery delivery curbside pickup. Gonna go roll eyes now. claim Chinese lying continue intentional shive head sand. lack education. It‚Äôs design America * inserts matrix 1 DVD *

Spoon boy: try bend spoon. That's impossible. Instead... try realize truth.
Neo: truth?
Spoon boy: wave. objections ordinance based questions scientific data others considered requirement infringe civil liberties

So... nothing changes. 

But interesting note periods San Francisco ""mask ordinance"" required masks overthrown time...

There 27 days November 1918 *only 9 days* January 1919 anti-mask cohort got way mask usage requirements overthrown.

After removing law second time, Feb. 1 1919, flu petered out.

We still argue, 100 years later, whether short periods measures (and voluntarily distancing/ masking outside mandated periods) crucial slowing --- briefness proof really anything. one cares live either now, town centre people queuing shops 5am onwards big queues too...also don‚Äôt see many people wearing masks either week least south east, temperature hitting 30 degrees I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll incentive people wear masks Bad news, friend... Covid January antibodies probably already gone test negative either way. 

You may memory cells rapidly produce more, unlikely find still circulating 5 months. is.......a medical professional? switched blaming melenials now... 

Not original least consistent, guess. NY forcing nursing homes take covid patient March, Florida recognized bad idea never recommended opposite. Florida required 2 negative tests anyone get admitted back nursing home goal test nursing home patient staff. 

Those great steps mind data supported. Right, staff professors workers college campuses also young? TABC, they're nuts. weird leftover rules prohibition pay COD beer stuff. someone loses check reports TABC shit ruined.

I used manage liquor store straight ended relationships two fairly big vendors reported us TABC check lost. could lost license pulled shit couple times. weren't. Sure, blamed surges states ended lockdowns protests. doubt protests significant issue changes - either protests end lockdowns subsequent BLM protests. 

My point is, New York seen surge cases New York population 8.4 million people. mortality rate coronavirus around 0.4% although probably little lower. would 33,600 deaths. They've 18,935. *not* growing cases great lockdown rules. They're growing cases *at least* half people already it. flatten curve. 

States cases surging simply gone yet. Lockdowns end eventually states it, question when. point flattening curve keep people dying could access healthcare resources surge demand. happening, even cases spiking now. Also, efficacy steroid treatments cautionary tales respirators, fatality rate fall. saying, measures place keep people getting exposed coronavirus, nearly inevitable. measures keep people *dying* coronavirus. commented elsewhere mother law, wife, issues getting tested. even places accepting walk-ins, reports really confuse strange times ""15 new deaths"" good news. shortage situation California beyond dire. Entire towns burned 2016-2018. rate new house construction like half needed keep population growth. Well offcourse good slowing spread 100% sure government trying get money can.  He‚Äôs protected nursing homes unlike states. Opening bars? That‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôm mind set Florida exactly do, protect risk let young healthy return lives. know 25 year old grandson went bars, maybe take upon say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt come visit while‚Äù rather shut everything protect small portion population. Even month Florida still look much better NY ever was. Seems like Sweden approach Herd Immunity exponentially gone downhill...  What? place going fire getting covid test? highly illegal. America founded greatest ideals, often Americans give times get tough. founded many one union, sometimes people forget together. Selfishness isn‚Äôt American dream, people sure act like it. struggled masks. got neck gaiters like much better! got mine Etsy, they're hippy looking, like wild colors. Here's neck go get lung x-ray. thing easy do? Genuinely curious cause lungs felt like shit 3 months tested negative antibodies. assume treatment improvements much larger impact deaths lingering health conditions. Preventing death inability breathe maintaining blood oxygen levels preventing lung damage causes inability breathe different things point time.


Fair enough, difference ‚Äúhaving much larger impact‚Äù ‚Äúhaving impact‚Äù. deaths *and* lingering health conditions (and probably will) decrease relative number cases, even don‚Äôt decrease equal amounts. well. 
 
As aside cleaning facilities, clinic we've started using UV lamps disinfect exam rooms end day lighten use surface disinfectant running low. sure feasible hospital setting since room emptied sterilization leaves harsh ozone smell, bring case could helpful. Also, run commercial cleaning solutions 10:1 dilution bleach effective COVID hard surfaces. Haha, appointment urgent care, still wait *three hours* test. wife got CVS drive appointment today. We'll see goes. hugely misleading statements made. expect hoped people would read documents. vast majority voluntary contributions organizations like universities (e.g., King's College London, Johns Hopkins), Health foundations (Red Cross/Red Crescent, FHI, Bill Melinda Gates), UN agencies (IOM, UNFPA, UNDP, UNICEF). 

The amount donated pharma corporations tiny compared others. go urgent care medical doctor insurance, pay out-of-pocket, it‚Äôs 3-5 day turnaround results. (If get appt).

This isn‚Äôt entirely true. mom went doctor got results two hours. friend went hospital gallbladder surgery got tested results 3 hours. paid insurance flu covid, flu mutates quickly that's need new vaccine. need new measles vaccine every year we? 

""so tests""

The US done 27m tests. clear cases recovering covid provides immunity, know duration. I'd mail diploma stay eff home me. stupid.

BS, hit damn security guard people can‚Äôt comply. bunch snowflakes can‚Äôt bother wear mask sake others [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/snmrs) [description Phase looks like them. wonderful news, weekly average well. Yay huge response, thousands showed up, immediately needed ask money.... sounds dead me. sounds like heaven Everyone says they'll go bang like stories hear paragliding 80 year olds? People cling life always. us bring end it. could back source possible? I'm interested Ok Trump Minnesota stopped counting much week

What? live news me. tests consistently gone since protests seen spike. Combined already days (non consecutive) without hospitalizations, good news   live nyc. I‚Äôd say see 40% people masks on. multiple parties weekend ppl didn‚Äôt wear masks all. Obviously anecdotal don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs imaginary argument say. website auto plays trump speaking... Bold move. Someone still need go people bring food. They'd meet others organize pass things around. People need go hospital. Hospitals need work. Here‚Äôs data TN. New cases spike hasn‚Äôt translated hospitalizations yet increasing said contact tracing 'very rare' asymptomatic person pass covid. really stats partial finding April 17 documenting effects COVID19 brain balls: blows ur mind people don‚Äôt take covid seriously? boggles mind calling people stupid top comment. Pandering Yep. One friends born Texas move Canada attacked racists 9/11. 

If North Korea tries bomb America, long aim Jesusland states shed tear. OK let fall bathroom alone lie immobile agony days dying thirst children visit Saturday? Exactly. couple articles discussing figures excess Good thing nobody relying chinese medical experts. thing last way longer NJ things somewhat right, getting results pretty slow.  hard get test results take least 4 days come back. Assuming China's numbers accurate - definitely not. ‚ÄúThere could lower viral load respiratory tract, probably due genetic mutation virus yet demonstrated scientifically. Also, aware disease able manage it.‚Äù


I believe significant mutation demonstrated scientifically. think virologist hits nail head second part. like corporations... need someon else enforce think virtuos.


Instead asking government somethimg something.. like like amazon treat workers? use amazon.


Don't like aiports mask policies? travel plane.


Don't like government spends money militarizing police? Stop paying taxes.  cell

Pardon Oh suppressed alright, way we‚Äôd liked Thank you, whole second wave horseshit trying cover pos  mess government. Except states bullshit thing steal property tax revenue wealthy school districts redistribute ‚Äúpoor‚Äù districts. Shitty school districts shifty people make student body there, lack school funding. Pour House. Wow $500?? That's fucking crazy.
Where live closer $10. Yes, duration contagious vary disease disease. Trying beat Florida kind prize. nice someone whose countrymen women fill many roles - worked nursing home sector - workers foreign, super cheap. 

Pay bottom rate wages people get lowest training, communication customer service skills. tend foreign workers whose poor communication working rights status allowed get better employment experience. often also poor tough lives, breed level indifference suffering others. Well fact President, Vice President, administration officials openly ignored guidelines said virus control, recommended wearing masks, made threats insults governors would reopen states, list goes on.

What good guidelines top federal officials, including POTUS himself, actively contradicts guidelines? But... but.... PROFIT MARGINS reason vaccine stated take long based much money throw it, long time vaccine trials take determine safe.

Here's timeline chart shows typical length various stages: **[How Long Vaccine Really huge part it, here's why: ""normal"" times, nobody wants fund next stage vaccine development there's positive outcome previous stage. steps get done **in series**, much time various steps spent trying get funding.

Now current ""all-eyes-on-covid"" times, steps done **in parallel** zero time spent fund-raising. Factories built clinical trials completed, means trials fail, eat cost now-useless factory. USA, ports follow CDC guidelines read past issues CDC, government port officials refusing repatriation. like one big clusterf** one wants take responsibility USA fire hoses spray gasoline. elderly people need fulltime care 24/7. majority needs someone cook, give medicines, bathe them, clear rooms wash clothes, like children normally. People work chores freetime. 

Babies need constant care one abandon ""baby homes"" this. mean yeah look now. Pittsburgh well haven‚Äôt big wave still low. admitted rally that‚Äôs whole point keep numbers down. average rolling seven-day average

I doubt so, considering last four days value zero. Talked father last night. lives AZ. He's convinced already got COVID refused go get tested anything. think he's gotten it. Certainly really care expects things normal out...

And he's asking I'm going come visit...  honestly want visit several reasons spikes helping. Yes. completely overlooked counting pharma companies bang vaccine yesterday. VA. VA. You‚Äôre seeing evidence protests riots caused COVID19 spike don‚Äôt want see it. feel much cognitive dissonance? Hiya, wanted say covid scare too. symptoms bloating, gas, cramping you-know-what, low grade fever, chills, fatigue, headache, loss smell taste. Apparently lot people hospitalized COVID stomach/intestinal symptoms first respiratory symptoms develop, never respiratory symptoms. freaked out, tested negative nasal swab, eventually got better respiratory symptoms. Probably ""normal"" stomach bug. sign, develop respiratory signs, covid. Til cautious attentive hope feel better. believe Northwest Orient first major carrier US ban it

That remember. also split smoking non-smoking aisle. Pretty stupid, broke logjam. article works assumption superspreaders get taken earlier epidemic thus reducing Rt quicker expected. makes sense me, think wait it‚Äôs peer reviewed generally accepted. Ben Jerry's ""reviewed"" Systemic Racism exist, sweetie. guess people listening Trump 'slow tests down.' must new restauraunt industry. Bosses break law time order save money. Yep, Israel went full-panic mode beginning among first ones close everything, ""act first ask questions later"" strategy paid off. compare, Sweden Israel roughly population. Sweden 5000 deaths, Israel 300. 

But economy took major hit unlikely go another lockdown, looks like buy time. World yes, article US. poor people access I'm country , especially now. would wise use plastic instead seems like another common sense thing without political. I'm sure, hopefully someone else knows more. guess patchwork state. Usually recommendation quarantine. Next step:

No tests = infected = we're healthy!

(I know, next step supposed take place first seems like lil bit unrealistic) OSHA Texas talked circles told enforce CDC recommendations. Like, dude, workers whose health safety risk. Wtf job? reserving care homes really sick ones (that need professional care 24/7)

Thats though. least Sweden, im sure countries well, get place nursing home sick longer live home, even home-care Parents ones vote school board members, parents love graduation. old news. true think mad home referred ""flyover state"". fair, I'd said Oklahoma look much service nation. Fixed. Thank you. also going post this. Interested thoughts it. fair, lockdown fail stop Coronavirus bit pointless. ran President, everyone loved him.

Check again. Trump left *a lot* people high dry real estate career New York. ""Everyone hated him"" lot closer truth, among people actually business him. increase due higher testing absolutely right. 
However, deaths reported (yet), mean noone died past 24 hours, unfortunately. New England pretty big area maybe start small. pictures prove masks? know phone also camera used take photos videos. account different photos videos posted online showing BLM protestors wearing masks. One could argue alcohol serving establishments always harmful community. opinion one virologist mutation specifically tracked scientifically

Kind says science based subreddit, no? think we'll known effective treatments end year. excellent studies extremely promising.

And think enough international commitment that, years, might vaccine. long countries decide live it. Sounds like ""it's flu, bro"" idiot Oh gosh. incredibly sad. can, trying. obviously going well. Opposite playing lot dance lately, saved lot Money, went back work got promoted! Oh also 2 month isolation beforehand pretty good break working long hours past! World issues pretty bad rn particular great. (For obvs things change I'm looking positive now) Make sure email manager/boss mention concern number people, etc, thank ensuring health future adhering health safety laws. Since post removed already typed response, take putting blinders innumerable sources stating numbers inflated?

And take putting blinders CDC calculates Seasonal Flu deaths using estimate claim COVID isn‚Äôt much worse? Every year, 2,000-3,000 people reported dead Flu. CDC, many careful analysis, came conclusion Flu deaths underreported 95% percent, multiply reported deaths 20x come estimate 40,000-60,000. Bet didn‚Äôt know that. high scrutiny COVID, unlikely COVID require 20x multiplier, but, according preliminary data departure actual deaths US vs expected deaths, multiplier looks though least 2x. 

Sure, COVID may receiving high report rates compared say Flu, still underreported according available data. Oh, bet wherever get news never mentioned tidbit Flu since would really undermined conspiracy curious, outrage sub protests irresponsible? want verify double standard I've seeing headlines.

Simce you‚Äôre conversation nebulous caricature sub, let‚Äôs focus views protests. think handled irresponsibly stupidly. example, protests would much disruptive traffic everyday life (the entire point protests) everyone standing 6 feet apart. area could cover would much larger. lack masks event people yelling (read: spitting everywhere) coughing lungs teargassed (for peaceful assembly) discouraging. 

That said, protests aren‚Äôt bad spread churches, classrooms, offices, stadiums, since protests involve outdoors usually constant movement. However, protests also important societies advancement everything mentioned except classrooms. confront ugly reality sending children petri dish future (once disease goes way Spanish Flu ~2 years) preserved. Come fall, relying stupid people prevent mass deaths elderly, way, I'd say dodged bullet able come Canada. Place kinda sucks since Trudeau's thing.

Oh yeah, I‚Äôm sooooo excited able smoke fuckton weed impunity spend ten days driving/ferrying Vancouver Bella Coosa, driving Mt Robson, meandering way Jasper, Banff, Yoho, Kooteney, Waterton Lakes National Parks crossing back US (and abandoning weed) peruse Glacier National Parks. Yeah, dodged real bullet. Maybe knucklehead side charge would imprison smoking weed close National parks sell part parcel logging fracking, WOULD ENJOY MUCH MORE. 

I don‚Äôt believe gods, thank cosmic forces universe Trudeau charge.  know opinion one virologist Italy, also says mutation specifically tracked scientifically... mostly posting see people's opinions it, thank say 90% least.

Not good enough. Ahah also Nijmegen!
2 weeks ago could enter AH without washing hands one day safety procedures cancelled.

Was important not? get it. healthcare workers. work home depot minimum wage. Wear fucking mask! occurred Fauci experts might simply try boost morale overly optimistic wrt. vaccine public? SE Asia countries less developed already contained virus. Yes, although would find term coerced ""under duress"" acceptable well. large percentage workers; quitting job current economy viable option. Yep.

But hit immune system damn hard (SARS/Sars-COV-2)

Steroids suppress immune system; becomes risk vs reward.

They may use steroids good results acute cases can't spare suppression immune system.

Lucky me, SARs strain hit hard 20 odd years ago healthy mid 20s. went autoimmune. Nearly died double pneumonia fibroids lung (now gone)

In early March COVID19 hit house mildly. Husband worse anyone else. last; early intervention key.

Albuterol best friend musinex. pneumonia physical therapy hot steam showers help drain lungs. (Gravity helps. Hitting chest back cough cough pulls out)

Antibiotics nearly mandatory fluid lungs. infection gets hold lungs kills. hard fight lungs full. Learned OG SARS survived. butthurt simple fact masks save lives, masks protect family loved ones, people community. Maybe shut fuck wear mask instead bitching. could give two shits, new shitshow norm. 

In fairness, Trump administration moved pretty early control borders (as successful countries including South Korea, Australia, New Zealand did) faced cries racism xenophobia. Americans poorly behaved. Ok let know think false this:

The average age someone killed car crash 38. 38 40.37 years lifespan left according actuary tables. average age someone dying Covid-19 78-81. Let‚Äôs use 79. 79, average lifespan left 8.82 however, unlike car crashes, Covid-19 typically kills co-morbidities wouldn‚Äôt typically lifespan others cohort. Conservatively, say average 79 year old died Covid-19 4 years life left average. Covid-19 death represents ten times less effect overall average lifespan typical motor vehicle accident death. threat average lifespan motor vehicle accidents, death count Covid-19 would ten times higher. isn‚Äôt likely year‚Äôs end. whole ""well we're quirky different"" attitude think rules apply they'll get away it.

Same UK. right enter someone else's private property make sick.

Why wear mask? also right moron.

/S scenarios, /u/skavau, exact example.  complicated problem sure. know. seem huge element chaos chance virus. I'm Australia, also federation states call shots. states allow inter-state travel. state Western Australia actually divided 5 sections people allowed travel sections months(3?). Admittedly WA Big state. Lol say close wait vaccine. can't pay something like refuse anything amount pay politicans. I'm actually done convo already tell stupid conversation going get. good life. think possibly [k helps distinguish large numbers smaller outbreaks vs small numbers larger outbreaks. live india situation fucked friend. People mass gatherings without masks. acting like covid never existed H1N1 got vaccine November 2009 iirc. 10 months pandemic started. vaccine 12-18 months doable. Belgian : least 5 schools already closed kids got tested positive covid19. 
The title clickbait make americans feel bad : covid present Europe suppressed all. let gard I've never part sub wished would die. speculating average age death go down. Due extremely low death rate younger ages, wouldn‚Äôt expect much effect all. culture, lot us children.  part, rule USA youngest daughter gets job seeing aging parents grave.   Nothing formal, man, common. single child families, course, one kid.  disruptive extreme lot people, spend best part retirement years caring progressively difficult people, sometimes best people best circumstances, often live location chose decades ago hell choices kid.

Not easy sounds. neither owe much healthcare workers other.

Unless want protest tear statues. lack balls collectively shut mask dissenters. They're selfish idiots. protecting us. us imposing ""opression"" them. 

When maskless morons treated disdain deserve we'll way normalcy again. before. Assume vaccine never going happen. Paradoxically, healthier operate presumption, mentally, spiritually, physically. would want waste time saying something incorrect? Many protesters wearing masks. 

The people packing bars flyover states, much. Reopening started 6k cases week. Last week saw 3,600 cases, 1,350 - - contained superspreading event. Contact tracing testing underway, virus found general population around meat plant, county may lock again.

I know 2,250 (up 1,750 week before), would start analyze cases surged. However, meat plant superspreading, one talks origins infections. always is. Whether enough differences called strain might debatable, virus slightly change regularly, changes make deadly, less deadly, transmissive, less transmissive, others impact aspects virus.

Similar living creature.

Here's one sources says multiple strains opinions seem divided lol can't wait vaccine open up, we'd bankrupt long then. need manage risk economy together. point locking 6 months save lives can't pay health service year's time China shuts shit fast, embarrassing American days.. both. need money three years, preserved. also need money twenty years, grown. People science degrees tend understand exponential growth better without... hear we‚Äôre important state year government deceitful Chinese gov. Temperature checking hardly solved problem no? don‚Äôt fever completely asymptomatic? UK seeing lot people Florida Texas like ‚ÄúWHAT!? guys still locked down?!

The owners main culprit this, decision forced employees precarious position. would argue employees entirely blameless either. falls realm ""I following orders."" Complying owners' decision break rules indeed employee's decision. complicit endangering patrons.

Regardless blame, people need understand lives important livelihoods. livelihood worthless without life, patrons employees. Yes hi, welcome subreddit. see things directly front noses, everything else doom gloom.  close dogs getting people smell covid. Close enough catch pass others?

I mean animals get though maybe less likely? first thought well. Wasn‚Äôt article day two ago China finding virus fish? government's helping people do? bills stop. people going stop flinging around ""second"" wave nonsense?

With luck, probably decide start referring shit third wave. thought exactly same, started. similar symptoms Sars hit vapers hard. Cdc reckons viral source identified. sars etc would've found - timeline feels suss. Oh wow, you‚Äôve sent link article posted left bias company who‚Äôs jumping bandwagon. Thanks that. without vaccine, hell numbers going continue stay down? enough respect rules still place. see going see another rise numbers. speeding anything up. 

Thick fucking government playing fucking lives. Exactly, eventually realize join view ""everyone work something, matter what"". Automation way safe money select few, get next stage society whole.
But psychologically we're seemingly still far behind..
Personally expected crisis ability quicken change better life everyone, right, haves managed keep people far afraid change even realize possibilities. little late that. ‚Äúwhile can‚Äù ran beds New York.

Because would cash money. Yes shows irrational level fear towards virus even news less deadly severe than. ‚ÄúVERY bad‚Äù news. Thank kindness like called calling others heros, hero hard aspire one, everyone aspire decent person. excuses one! immunity obtained coronavirus vaccine retained around two years more. stated director Gamaleya National Research Centre Epidemiology Microbiology Alexander Ginzburg interview ""Red Star"" newspaper published Monday.  him, vaccine administered twice, gene inserted different carriers, ""which provides opportunity obtain protective immunity, receive prolonged period time.""  approach guarantees high likelihood, person received vaccine booster variant, protected possible coronavirus infection two years least, perhaps longer period well"", - Ginzburg said.  said due mutual work RF Ministry Defense ebola vaccine facilities, able prove duration immunity use vaccine retained less two years.

That's death count dip, infections back late April. Muh freedumb, that's want wear mask. scary.  apparently can't handle facts, dont believe them.  rework numbers, ignore scientists doctors. That's counting government debt. see massive amount junk bonds issued last months? Also, massive amount dilution created stock offerings? equities simply worth pre-pandemic yet they're trending towards price levels.

As example:

PENN sold bunch real estate rent credits (no capital appreciation property rent credits much lower present value), issued bunch debt diluted shareholders stock offering $18 per share 13.9% (that's right, 13.9% shares denominator calculating EPS)! yet, price actually reached $37 trading Feb 21st.

Virginia really well too, guess we'll see keeps going ok things start open up. people good wearing mask though. hould ask question: people nursing homes fit description describe? children?

Yes do. instances, seen many many times children want take care elders that's reason there.

Because would require giving job interests 1-10 years, disrupting children's life ultimately would become progressive commitment likely culminate outright 24/7 care children child involved. Basically Outer Worlds IRL.  lower last 12 sundays. arguing fact? lowest daily death toll since March 23. Thats story, nothing more. athletic looking dude face mask probably think way rob Londis yes cases distributed different days, therefore cases put one day making r factor rise even one time went BART someone thought challenging fight BART police came asked trying start fight. also add new parent, I‚Äôve recently learned baby formulas ‚Äúcorn syrup solids‚Äù first ingredient listed ion label. one October.

Which one? saying we'll approved distributed widely then? highly doubt that. 11 domestic cases yesterday... headline bull shit. 11 domestic cases country 50 million... California 40 million people like 4k cases yesterday higher % positive rate, meaning California testing even Korea is. guess doesn‚Äôt fit subs narrative comes actual danger virus. Lol noticed cannot unsee.

How ranked?! IKR? fortress built late 1700's obvs great HVAC!

Memorial Day start great reason (holiday) put massive amounts people together (to celebrate). And, yes, everyone walking around living completely normal point show numbers moving forward. gonna show source that, since highest saw 20%, 3.4% upstate area less 1% MLB (which spread whole country). shitty stanford study even 30-40% Oops meant hospital deaths. Oh well ""two weeks"" thing went months, think people got bored left long ago. hard feel sympathetic anyone wear mask catches it. Can't second wave first wave never stopped cannot solve systemic problems individual solutions obvious reasons. Could link reports? yuppity liquor store guard fact enforce mask laws well. Even nicer grocery stores implemented this.

Yes, that's antibodies work. keep antibodies forever, knowledge make antibodies stored memory cells make correct antibodies next time catch virus. Exactly right! ridiculous treatment improvements getting media coverage. ""unemployment rate"" hear news politicians really representative sampling survery U.S. households many people currently job looking one. (~100k sample size) There's essentially mini-census conducted every month. one things Census Bureau non-census years.

Well, know that, know ""whole"" people workforce - either working looking work. survival rate auto accidents ten times that, still wear seatbelt  Require ya want, people arent going wear them.  

Until get leader wont say shit like ""i think people wearing masks showing disapproval me"" fucked. live Southern California. extremely careful grandpa 93 see him. getting takeout couple times month, since things reopening restaurants moderately busy. can‚Äôt go eat keep mask whole time. That‚Äôs think spread happening. I‚Äôm nervous go right numbers spiking. think less (real?) media, social media enabling misinformation exist perpetuate. summer heat kill virus tho could say rampant obesity, diabetes, cancer heart disease , that‚Äôs me. where's people mock asking ""where's spike?"" states reopened/memorial day gatherings cruelty point. Live rural area top ten hotspots ny times believe was. tiny area many cases still people still know anyone infected. Def recognized tons complacency. Even people know issue planning beach trips traveling city hang friends. insane Mexico citizens armed, violence would prevented reduced way?



Yes. People cautious know get bullet Maybe NY/NJ... think rest country anywhere near levels yet. Annoyingly Jet2 ""cancelled"" flight yet get refund. 
 
And announcement weirdly worded...the UK neither Shengen EU unfortunately. Gonna stay home bake bread tend garden, thanks Yup. Live Richmond area, cases stayed close peak, pretty much unabated. go auto repair shop day literally one wearing mask besides me.

A people around chin, one fucking face. mechanic helped mask all. crowding door refused move let people pass distance.

No one enforcing anything, businesses ignoring it.

Day 3 since then. Wish luck. \*sigh\* surprise tons people decided wearing mask means weak whatever. Im HB people still wearing masks - percentage much lower now. slight increase baseline mortality almost entirely focused old immuno-compromised. One meter plus... Whatever fuck means. corona farkle idea trying say? saying death rate confirmed cases 20%? tells seriously lacking testing capabilities lethality virus. Lets see maintain that. plenty simple ways massage testing statistics, including selecting test.

If testing mostly hospitals before, shift testing community (or retest negative people) induce big drops rate. Mask else end Darwin Award. Nooooooooooooooooooooooo fuck guys aren‚Äôt open yet? Millennials children boomers. Gen X children silent generation Gen Z children. seem remember Florida publishing [hospitalization] stats.

They dashboard figures publish suggest capacity spare 20-30-somethings need them. get test they're office something else even know Covid. Huh! Well that's enough convince people I've talked FL model job. common sex related injuries like breaking hip elderly populations common hoped. Ugh. can't standard dashboard every state? hard. one looks reads differently. Texas one trash imo. Whatever. give up. information change way I'm living regardless. Mask stay safe üíö focusing unnecessary failures / delays necessary PPE could avoided using existing system vetted suppliers proactively increasing manufacturing, training, awareness first COVID-19 hit side. e.g. H1N1 Ebola.

Your attempt spin optimism 120k Americans dead poor attempt cognitive dissonance American response COVID-19 poor, FEMA personnel trying best skipping protocols resulted increased failures delays ongoing crisis. would someone even that?

A reasons. First, everyone first-time home buyer. could investment purchases, flippers. people likely look broad levels identify purchases (neighborhood, city, etc.). Individual features house irrelevant removed/improved.

Second, sometimes get advanced info. mean realtors inside track, already shown pictures done walkthroughs house 'listed'.

Third, sometimes to. trying buy hot market, know area good (like case #1) may say fuck put offer immediately. usually clauses offer letters (at least ones I've seen) give buyer ~17 days back out, include provisions related inspections/appraisal.

So may offer sight unseen understanding back something disastrously wrong house. interest rates low lot people sort buying buy decent investment. Stay NY. good job, dont ruin us coming diseased hoping miracle. dealt checking IDs letting locals (at least state level) in? also way verify exceeding 25% capacity anyway. right? number feel wrong? Rural area psych nurse here. pt call last week saying quarantine, 5 members family tested positive COVID19, 2 transported larger, better equipped hospitals, sadly, time save either lives. also 2 meat packing plants county, hot spot own. currently 4 times number positives 4 surrounding counties, &amp; rising. Local news reports rising cases daily, yet nothing done.

ETA: also live red county, math. *insert eye roll here* workstation black dust that's employee. got furloughed would clean work area multiple times shift. whole state isn‚Äôt green. rural counties Maintaining means holding status quo. That's gonna sufficient Politicians start blaming politicians. DeSantis worse Xi Jinping. data lung damage result mild/asymptomatic COVID? someone high risk dying it, I'm absolutely horrified thought permanent lung damage. kept night. Ya like asymptomatic don‚Äôt infect people, Gem Saddest day life found technically millennial isn‚Äôt dichotomy much less false one. 

In order live need assume risks. don‚Äôt assess risks properly, either paralyzed fear get nothing done live lives have, reckless live needlessly short life. 

I choose driving risk almost us comfortable with, isn‚Äôt risk risk others assume drive, difficult want live life, go work, go social events, enjoy leisure time, etc. difficult many things without incurring risk contracting Covid-19 well.

So ask yourself: willing accept risk lifespan, road around road like pedestrians, get list reasons drive, making different risk/benefit analysis Covid-19?

And good point don‚Äôt die Covid-19 May health complications. goes well people survive auto accidents. say summer, like rest northwoods big chunk tourists go barhop via snowmobile. People pretty good wearing masks public Springfield too. parents live downstate say mask compliance gotten better, people wearing masks. 

If things get really bad Missouri, wonder bridges across Mississippi shut prevent interstate travel order keeping infection rates declining Illinois. legitimately scary time south carolina

1000 cases day past week. 200 charleston alone today. 

no one anything. state government 100% absent. fucked. look like [This document page linked.

Based reading seems FHM reports deaths lab confirmed covid-19 infection within 30 days death. Since every death actually tested I'm certain missed cases. However, search articles online difference FHM reported deaths excess mortality large enough cause serious concern underreporting imho.

How closely covid-19 deaths match excess mortality varies widely countries another reason hard compare countries. However, go clearly see hard hit different countries are. clearly see successful Denmark, Finland, Norway combating covid-19 poorly example Sweden done comparison. also check Spain, UK, Italy there.

The Wikipedia article [COVID-19 also interesting numbers Sweden. (With references!!!) Lets try out. 10 people report comment let's see gets removed. would online teacher parents work 1st grader decides go hunt pantry cookies instead listening another lesson sight words? camera, teacher sure bathroom even house. Kids young seem responsibility discipline attend school day voluntarily.

If responsible kids, older, might able make work. feel like scalable solution.

I love idea, can't figure could work. Ok d00mer. parents healthy want get back normal New York near 100% mask usage. 

Lol, imagine saying this... [Florida doesn‚Äôt exceptional number excess deaths compared states. thing going Montana. Recently travel Utah family issues drove keep safe flying coffin plane. Wore mask every time got car, often except get gas occasional bathroom break. Packed food stop food anywhere. insane many places went wear masks practice social distancing. people yell Utah need mask. Got weird looks every time wore mask, every state. It's... scary honestly. go get groceries occasional takeout places support local businesses, still wear masks wash sanitize fuck outta hands time. cases rising like one cares. Yeah high California still alarming :/ Haha ok mean that's true across board though, vast majority people testing positive get things fine. 

The issue spreads among healthier people, likely spread risk sound like petty tyrant. Whhhhhhhyyyyyyyy Canada never extreme Europe, fine. think mix people respecting measures government providing adequate social measures (Canadian Emergency Response Benefit - like super quick money anyone lost jobs due Covid) slow reopening. Got furloughed server middle March haven‚Äôt work 3 months. part sucks, able spend literally day everyday kids time made 100% worthwhile. Ive never felt closer kids Ive become stay home dad wife working days. gave insight first couple months childrens‚Äô births home day long too. really hope investigations many politicians ill intent misleading people putting peoples lives line lying them. one thing simply state dont want take certain actions right deal virus, another entirely intentionally lie facts avoid taking action. People deserve truth access right facts numbers, even dont want anything yet like closing state back down. flat lying driving crazy especially family quote lies truth. I'm sick lies, I'm sick conspiracies. people need start facing consequences purposely misleading lying people, especially related pandemic said information result death! They'll talking shit even lungs start shrivel die lol much teenager type comment? know! baffling. mean, supposed open Easter.

/s What's hospitalization/death rate though? boyfriend worked Brandon. couldn‚Äôt say worse things scumbag. proper scientific evidence claim. Yes myeloid response immune response sends cytokines. them?? they're bragging hospitals keeping everything moving along despite aggressive re-opening. Besides recent admissions policy tweaks may order, I'm hearing people say FL could model re-opening. Trevor A. Makal, associate professor chemistry University Virginia Wise, cleared masks block viruses even though don‚Äôt block fart smells.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs consider size molecules make stink smell farts,‚Äù says thread. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll focus one particular example, others similarly sized (when compared size virus). Methanthiol (CH3SH), like number thiol (-SH) containing molecules, smells! ‚Ä¶ smells like incredibly intense garlic; though many would say smells putrid. want everyone hate you, walk hallway carrying open container thiol compounds.‚Äù

Got it. Tiny, stinky fart molecules.

‚ÄúWell, CH3SH rather small molecule diameter around 4*10^-10 (0.4 nm, 1.6*10^-8 inches),‚Äù Makal continues. ‚ÄúBy comparison, viruses typically range diameter 20 nm 400 nm (J. Biol. Phys., 2013, 39(2), 215), COVID-19 around 60-140 nm (Cell. Mol. Immun., 2020). difference sizes COVID-19 virus common odorant farts 2-3 orders magnitude (100‚Äì1000 times diameter smaller methanethiol).‚Äù

Did get that? COVID-19 virus one hundred one thousand times bigger fart molecule. also please note Makal citing claims scientific journals. science. New cases new deaths I'm sure reality complex strict correlation antibody levels risk reinfection.  article indicates trend hard fast rules. would think vaccine would predictable since dose controlled, individual response would still vary.  Apparently immune system mechanisms control virus tied antibodies. Exactly. politics, life death.  foreseen hell consequences. Yeah, Dickey‚Äôs Texas morning even employees wearing masks. information isn‚Äôt surprising me. Fucking right is. everywhere state wide too. 

Wisconsin literally completely opened suddenly Supreme Court ruling, within days Minnesotans fibs coming pack bars. already stupid bar culture led huge spikes western Wisconsin.

Sure 25 people day week probably seem like much lot places, month ago made news 6 people one day confirmed. We've literally doubled cases little 2 weeks. There's cause celebration.

But people feel prepare hurricanes hit hard projected? mean peaceful protests. Riots small subset. Yep soo numb it, meanwhile got WFH September 30th! (Maryland, USA) There's already one Northern Jutland Hey buddy side effects quercetin Walgreens? I‚Äôve zinc broad multivitamin, regular multi Pepcid ac. Could use  point realize best protect moving life. Sheltering homes isn‚Äôt solution. sub safe loophole. Facebook, Fox news, Tomi Lahren said masks oppression, therefor must true since reliable news sources.

I'm facetious, case clear. would make also easy roll dice better not... Sorry maybe bad english. Non native speaker...

Edit: politicians gamble enough lifes citizens. Everyone prefers individual freedom possible. work collective action needed, e.g. 
climate change, epidemics YES.

We lot luck stockpiling advance wave two reopening meant returned treating every patient like potentially it. absolutely nothing people Alabama... three weeks might see rise covid deaths? not, what? Moops I'm expecting Texas curve drop bit, simply Nimrod finally realized complete hoax saturating hospital capacity matter time rate. much testing blame study gave zero insight susceptibility reinfection. confirm antibodies Covid, along every single infection, decline time. 

The 41% sailors neutralizing antibodies could simply re-exposed recently. 

While can't prove negative, seem virus around long enough us get insight long takes immunity fade. That's fair correct, largest single source deaths nursing homes holds true pretty much every Western country. 

Like said think probably right limiting factor though, significant portion risk likely already died ""I want say deserve it, that's get"" Canada none extreme policing, absolutely track US long time (we 10% cases 10% deaths, 10% population) along Europe recovery. tons testing province (Ontario) less 200 cases per day. simply police issue. International would even better Stop referring mom harshly Covid may go 2024. idea vaccine showing next year may happen. Next year scary. Please link something literally language affirming wild claim 20% local population wiped C-19. I'll wait. know why, we've fucking killed all, can't kill em twice! OP simply stating information. feel paint Sweden bad light, might time introspection. would inclined get test could confirm mouth swap locally, even halfway-up-the-nose test. 


There's less need exposed closely anyone 2 weeks, schools plan open area, expect shit get real. think they're painting similar picture varying degrees, many showing different things. link says focused Houston area. link OP Texas whole. graphs ICU, hospital beds, include 7-day moving averages... 1 250 MIS-C bad idea Wait, said wanted subs opinion first. don‚Äôt. want argue double feel guilty doing. even asking opinions you‚Äôre going realize all. Good luck. Hope don‚Äôt hurt anyone. Nobody wants get worse. opted towards scientific view expecting get worse, explaining inevitable, again, simpletons like you, parrot,' see left wants people die'

I say wholeheartedly

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck many different ranges given depending author sociologist. It‚Äôs 18 years.  Oh fine, apparently virus hoax Arizona. We‚Äôre still open operating full denial. mean assumed probably fairly obvious, basically everything that‚Äôs happened last 4 months... desperate hope leaders actually paid attention. Well yeah. dumbest people know sister Canada places

She invited birthday party nephew laws, grandparents house places

A bunch older people, parents even went yelled them.

Now I‚Äôm black listed whole family refused go called idiots

My fathers health poor too, recovering cancer. 

18 people including bunch kids.... probably around 25 people crammed backyard, nephews day care again

I‚Äôm still extremely fuckn furious this. family bunch idiots.

My sister said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs life must move on‚Äù 

I told mom dad get sick die, it‚Äôs you

They haven‚Äôt spoke since *Using data from* [*The COVID Tracking outlet confirmed Florida, Texas, Arizona, Utah, South Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, Missouri, Montana, California, Tennessee, Oklahoma showed rising cases results came weekend.* 

And California stringent laws country. simply proves overblown first place. Clearly reopen related?

Wut?  Go look Linsey Marr posts Twitter. airborne disease scientist good stuff. good looks HVAC scientists filtration info. He‚Äôs worst Appreciate speaking this. It‚Äôs public safety, political. Green Party. pretty much Taiwan (and force quarantine everyone flies in) they're right next China Go look Linsey Marr posts Twitter. airborne disease scientist good stuff. good looks HVAC scientists filtration info. Can't argue dead. 

Really hope they're embarrassed, actually dead.  Well said. guess price ""freedom"" everyone keeps talking about. Yeah, neither would someone born 1994. general cutoff millennial 1995 though suggest ‚Äò96    Already mutated hitting USA. It‚Äôs inevitable continue mutate, hope mutates becomes non lethal. reported more? possible virus less virulent? What, ""Sorry many people going die, Mouse commands it""? cutoffs millennials 1995 even 1996. local Walmart testing register take small quiz first. results came back said shouldn‚Äôt get tested I‚Äôll go tomorrow ask give peace mind! always works. everyone simply stop time again. Otherwise caught state everyone bit forever instead properly 2 months.  Eventually might make wearing mask punishable fine. crushed Mother cancelling vacation NC weeks. supposed bring two boys ‚ÄúGramp Camp‚Äù going play golf eat BBQ two weeks. 

I can‚Äôt trust people act right numbers exploding there....and live NJ. gets infected. Nice username. Good show. Yeah able full lock start, well, people got sick staying home would better position. EU opening up, people sick staying home well. going without masks. It‚Äôs human nature, critical mode long. couldn‚Äôt really lock right here. yes, shameful. us following rules still get penalized aren‚Äôt able travel EU. Sucks around tho. Yes excess deaths meaning deaths cannot hidden labeling pneumonia instead covid. deaths people claiming hidden show supposed do? Stay home? OK doom*r.

Turns virus gets bad enough, that's gonna do, government no. Yes. helpful article all. That's happens states ignored hardest hit beginning convinced it'll never happen them. course biggest failure federal level, nobody deny that, downright inexcusable point states enough labs running give tests anybody feels need one.  Yeah bot deletes comments time stating they‚Äôre political. couple months ago would hear sometimes shortage tests, sometimes reagents, sometimes swabs, etc. Since testing increased nationwide, assume USA got lot supplies needed be. we've administered lot tests. I'd curious know continue test rate (which still sufficient) risk running one needed components test? Seems whole world needs tests, shock figure way continue supplying states need months come.

...so...does anyone know much this? wish still updates task regarding this... one. Dude changed way count. magically 0 deaths change. almost EU countries still trailing deaths.

They (late) lockdown enforced strictly. fear numbers rise theyll cover up.

Spain wants let UK tourists summer. Would u that? I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs like moron, mum uses word lot always assumed spelt Berk classroom, two windows open, 1) next hardcourt/PE area, loud, 2) allowed open school case active shooter something similar. give information San Diego familiar that:

""In last seven days, San Diego County seen eight outbreaks COVID-19 community settings, metric prompted health officials re-evaluate county's reopening plan.

The eight outbreaks occurred June 11 June 17 two restaurants, three businesses, campground, social club private residence gatherings may occurred, San Diego County Supervisor Nathan Fletcher  die election? ""Due high number cases, city testing sites seeing delay 5-8 days reporting positive cases Houston Health Department, according Houston Fire Chief Pena said.""

That scary given someone display symptoms average 6 days infected, people wait days showing symptoms get tested, data likely lagging infections two weeks. means curve basically locked period time matter changes people make now. live Ohio got back week long vacation Myrtle Beach last Wednesday. 

Will report back find COVID-19. signs yet. Ohh, one *those*. tmc link one....you see data show running normal icu space...and largest medical center world shit school board Ontario Canada, hope changes things going forward.

That pretty much summing knew mid-February; early March saw spreading country world. Based information, path ""emergency shutdown"" would suggest? I'm definitely grateful Sweden/UK/USA volunteer samples ""different paths try"".

Good News, though: We've discovered intelligent lifeforms planet! Toilet Paper Pasta stock way shutdown imminent, people actually preparing even practicing self-isolation orders came :) Unsubscribe. Curly said best: they're bragging hospitals keeping up

Or one die unlike New York lol.

I mean hope certain point hubris come back hurt us. Wow removed comment criticizing them. facts I‚Äôd dispute didn‚Äôt start 10th, announced 10th started 13th May one one outdoor meetings 2m distance (highest distance world). June 1st involved opening garden centres, car show rooms etc non essential businesses, shops barring selling essential items select industries closed till 15th June. 

The big difference UK deep downward trend opening anything, whereas US seemed jump earlier. seeing countries, releasing lockdown little bit soon leads rise whereas holding little bit seems continue downward trend. 

Also, still don‚Äôt indoor gatherings *any* kind barring essential shopping. know outdoor transmission minimal comparatively even people break social distancing outdoors it‚Äôs far less likely transmit, whereas I‚Äôm seeing every day people restaurants pubs casinos America, it‚Äôs baffling honestly. 

I think we‚Äôve set much slower roadmap out, giving people freedoms don‚Äôt risk rise much people largely stuck them. mean London reported average like 30 cases day last 2 weeks .. city 9 million that‚Äôs actually ludicrous. 

Agree though, mask fact check. Says organization shunning freezing Taiwan called part China. peach. point, want admit wrong.

Many studies show this. miss science facts. Seriously though, there's lot factors. example influenza versus coronavirus, around long time caused pandemics different mutations say lifetime risk assessed one pandemic would assessed strains covid / flu lifetime. would comparable ""risk dying car crash"" accurately tell someone individual risk.

Probably lot average age infected coming dramatically. I‚Äôm hopeful stays low, time tell. liking beach Florida? Maybe virus less deadly summer? Reading article looks like assertion based science, anecdotal evidence. think second waves virus store Europe kidding yourself. Second waves store all, already happening sone countries. 50% increase hospitalizations. Surely one day‚Äòs numbers cannot assumed downward trend? parents don‚Äôt tell school sick with, don‚Äôt to. Doctors also don‚Äôt report schools patient illness. districts come plan state going back full time, full classes. stands right now, totally possible scenario. 3 days what?

See Japan, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam. Everyone wears mask, cases. Everyone wear masks, skyrocketing cases.

If masks work well, maybe virus eyes turnaway see Asias, duh? people stop eating meat enmasse plants automagically close. one day's worth numbers.... Sunday Houston's mess. way overtaking LA far confirmed cases. Harris County: 453 cases per 100,000. LA County 808 cases per 100,000. rising rate. Bur least would change obe set crooked incompetent legislators different set. people sitting decades getting rich complacent. consider question, please: heck become wealthy matter 4 8 years? Dang crooks stop behavior? even bother trying inventing numbers? dad due end April he‚Äôs comfortable traveling. think it‚Äôll hit miss comes up. might prefer stay like things open. Hard say. 

Can ShopRite get trouble enforcing it? I‚Äôm ocean county supermarket I‚Äôve still enforcing masks. haven‚Äôt seen anyone without one. arrows really followed anymore doesn‚Äôt bother me. don‚Äôt think really anything help. still squeeze past people regardless. I‚Äôm sending kid back two weeks, live state taking virus seriously think make difference. 

He‚Äôs five hasn‚Äôt played another kid three months. needs peer interaction. thing COVID 19 still new, 10 months old most, still scrambling come treatments new issues come up. grocery list normally looks like? truth new cases linked younger people.

Obviously I'm suggesting handwashing important. think anyone's trying Uber nefarious suggesting follow transmission prevention pathways. Nah man. 99% recovery rate, that's people sick enough get tested. probably like 99.95%. Something may eventually get us, ain't it. scared death forget live. wondered this. criticizing Florida shutting spring break opening beaches ‚Äútoo early‚Äù. time lauding Denmark response deaths per capita. changed fairly recently, Denmark got even open, remains even mask averse Florida, going well them, going poorly Florida even though locked Denmark.

It climate season seems matter more. Danes live short summer lives outdoors weather pleasant, Floridians moving inside AC temperatures humidity make outdoor live inhospitable them.

But blinded politics it. 

And funny thing is, shutdown shutdown doesn‚Äôt belong side political spectrum. Sweden far right party roots NWP-Nazis adopted pro shutdown stance. fact people‚Äôs stance shutdowns aligns political views tell us need know. Sure have. I‚Äôm say America isn‚Äôt they‚Äôre supposed to, it‚Äôs misleading post. UK less 68m people it, US 328 5x many people. numbers relatively close per capita. beautiful treatment before. saved life. Death rate going downhill think businesses need fined lose ability business. Government could create position this. sort compliance officer something like that. Basically go around ensure masks worn businesses business.

I work retail store smaller size make everyone wear face masks. want to, business us. Pretty simple.

My state require masks worn public settings, really need to. state decent covid numbers hey better right certainly needed.

The United States cares mainly money. Cuomo isnt competent. argue he's competent lets pretend like ignore virus far long well leading directly outcome state highest number deaths. Qatar population young immigrants South Asia infections come group.

Only 10% Qatar's population Qataris considered health statistics (noone brings obese Indians slave-like work).

Young population good health care main reasons low death rate.
It's also line Singapore, infection also spread mainly among immigrant workers. Uhm... okay clearly ridiculous character.
The FM one sent interview... dosen't change fact lying government testing.
You realise Government works differently FM high position?

Deaths start trend next week so. Grim Reaper beaches participated protests Reminds freaked early autopsy reports Covid people brainstem brains. realized people infected virus everywhere systems died it. can't produce evidence then?

Also say I'm anime lover, watch time time talk friends bit I'm obsessed like bullying kids internet. looking advice, stay away anything inside, especially direct physical contact, inside outside tbh. Stick fighting outdoors likely safer. take risk, since caught it, viral shedding around time visiting parents. mentioned UK video UK also proves point like Italy, France, Spain, Germany, etc. possible drastically lower new case numbers. mean look graph UK there. True, European countries done even better job getting numbers down, clear downard trend UK, too, current numbers far ther peak numbers. 

When look US graph hand downward trend modest compared UK US back peak numbers 30K day. 

Though point Russia. much downward trend there, least numbers rising. Antibodies appear last weeks longer people serious infection. 

It‚Äôs 1.30am here, I‚Äôll find source wake true. could national tracking app like countries. could based Google/apple framework. Completely private. large demand testing here. past couple months, least double daily testing capacity ever use tests widely available say even sniffles.

Having said that, people stop giving fuck past weeks horrible. Near barely see masks rare times go out. protestors atleast wore masks. Dow Jones likes üëç Better late never guess, described true 2016. already posted dingus. Quit thirsting upvotes. r/Masks4All , USA Yes, great leader almost perfected spread millions supporters, heroic efforts thwarted bunch teenagers. 

(God bless guys btw, please tell dog named Scooby cool ass van) thinking same. good, equally unsubstantiated, mutation story went kitty cat rabid dog they‚Äôd it. alternative nanny.

Shit Kendall Jenner going save us? really need r/Masks4All school planning fall sports(football, etc.)? still consequence covid. Idk voted. nations Europe far better others. 70% COVID deaths county live NJ long term facilities, really horrific report RAND corp. facts biased serve political 4,000 cases city Wuhan, Hubei province, January 18 18,700 cases January 23.

This estimation probably true. Testing sufficient moment even less known virus time. problem solved Feb thorough testing temporary hospitals isolation. That's jump confirmed cases time.

This actually proves important testing (with countermeasures), contrary POTUS said. Yup! declined bday party restaurant know several families vacationing Florida right now. wonder won‚Äôt visit.  use cold virus generate immunity. already immune cold virus; vaccine might effective. know lied. incredibly frustrating watch governments blatantly lie everyone. Must nice. Minimum wage gets rent food places US. Doesn‚Äôt really cover much else. businesses can't bothered follow health protocol, difficult do, deserve business. Riots ame changes.

Condren's mother Erin Condren (who also planning committee) owns company name makes paper day planners pretty big deal (mom blogger circles etc). thing going well company apparently, little bit problem name company you, make ban choices. News 11? Deaths lagging indicator. People don‚Äôt get infected die, suffer ventilators awhile

2 weeks surge infections appear event.

2 weeks (more less) deaths pick afterwards. Lol. You‚Äôre fifteen year old anime lover. Proving point everyone calling lockdown continue high school kid living parents‚Äô house. Thank you. Look US! I‚Äôve claiming spikes I‚Äôm wrong, even though POTUS pushed test underinflate number cases. Canadian, feel like sitting next kid carving Anarchy symbol desk hunting knife. Haha, see love them, always good food. friend rest world disagrees assessment. throwing Australia origin country disingenuous best, reads like trying create conspiracy none exists. started Wuhan China. significant evidence one outside conspiracy theorist posits otherwise.

Now significant evidence China drastically undercounted lied number infections. troubling give countries true sense danger facing.

This say China alone lying things. US damnedest pretend gone away everything fine isn't. Thankfully countries seeing bullshit allowing travel US. 

The govt. China may even known full extent due asymptomatic spread disease, evidence points numbers real even China mean misreprent true numbers. I'm China bashing one idea dealing time. anything immense response indicator countries, y'all things lockdowns countries cannot. able summon significant govt. response without citizens say ideal, case probably saved millions internally globally. important remember Los Angeles alone nearly half cases almost deaths easy looking deaths per million mind. Anyone surprised? Imagine trying happy spending 24/7 family. Please keep mind, rate positive tests, complete picture total cases. never get tested mild case, many asymptomatic, never tested. meant Great Depression... Literally Lol. Well, 300km US pretty far too, grew pretty desolate part Canada would travel far afternoon visit relatives. case, 300km far you‚Äôre speaking devastation took place Lombardy. people travel much Italy?  biggest barrier going another European country probably going language barrier anything else.

Seriously, cross international border without even realising. think schools gonna fall sports(football,volleyball, etc.)? Weren‚Äôt supposed flatten curve? one asymptomatic cases? 100% true. need decide society truth matter is. Either practicing preach social distancing agreeing necessary originally stated. Picking choosing agendas important others support information given us public health experts. hand, countless lives saved. 0 upvotes, 4 comments. guess said reverse would upvoted like crazy. Thank kind words. 

The ridiculous thing even ain't hard what's right time around, wear mask, wash hands.

Last week drove five year old girl hospital, nothing major, minor concussion bruises. sweet thing insisted wearing mask hands doused disinfectant entering hospital even though age.

Mad props parents. Wish people like them. true, mod bias sub, it‚Äôs impossible discuss why. you‚Äôre completely wrong. people wonder handled: debit credit card transactions continue charged cent. Cash transactions rounded closest 5 cent increment. 

If individual 10 transactions day cash, maximum downside exposure whole twenty cents every one transactions end .x3 .x8

In reality minimal nobody really cares Considering government admitted lied us I'd say look far blame. hope doctors come ass kicking. traumatized saw assholes saying fake. redirect attention. go r/coronavirus filled it.  


Any news Beijing outbreak almost always comment basically saying, ""Wow, shut hundred cases. America that?"" agree, fuck facts logic stop shaming stupid people!!! Surprisingly enough, I‚Äôve seen evidence virus spread much protests. seems wearing masks outside effective. Suppression never goal. called ‚ÄúFLATTEN CURVE.‚Äù One could hope :) stay safe! Here's thing. spread virus 1.1 people average, time passed people spread to, people spread etc. 7 times, twice many people infected started everyone previous generations eventually gets better.

If spread virus 0.9 people infected average, time passed 7 times, half many people infected started.

Now, maybe paying proper attention wearing masks correctly mean rarely ever infect anyone.

The thing is, culturally enforcing social distancing wearing masks, even bunch wearing improperly, still infect people, need able infect people little less frequently numbers still go down.

The US trouble everyone everything perfectly. rather many people openly defying appropriate behavior even bothering take minor precautions.

If everyone US wearing masks wearing incorrectly they're stupid, spread would essentially stop. need perfection, need people something approximates trying.

But many people trying, people even politicized idea trying point they're actively acting contrary necessary. point matter perfectly effectively rest country stopping spread, people alone dense enough ensure spread stop slow. also islands makes things considerably easier, yeah compliance also probably higher. It‚Äôs probably Lol 300km ‚Äòup road‚Äô. People US judge distances differently due huge ass land mass.

Dumb rhyme intended feel 100% certain there‚Äôs relevant data variable withheld That's good old *American Exceptionalism*.

""America unique different solution works countries could possible work here, America"" United Arab Emirates , restaurants reopened social distancing maximum groups 4-5 depending restaurant. say government got cooperation infected person. course do. SOLELY rely person's memory. Would know proximity restaurant/store subway past 2 weeks? 

Now splitting hair. know accesses sorts cell phone data. may tracers. Maybe CECC asks phone company run database get cell phones proximity infected person's cell phone 2 weeks prior. tracers need know message needs sent. They're sending entire population. fact know send people's phone numbers means there's Big Data analysis going behind scene. 

If makes concerned privacy, raise government, me. wear seatbelt raised wearing one. don‚Äôt even like car park off. 

I gone trip without seatbelt exactly life super uncomfortable whole time. lives
üòÇüëåüèøüíØ Weird everyone complained thousands protesting lockdowns pointing social distancing wearing masks, yet heard little nothing outbreaks month later. priority, don‚Äôt argue that. But, like others commented, virus doesn‚Äôt care. majority people counts working weekends. get trickle count do, backlog totals weekend Monday. given evidence EU better US handling covid 19 immediately spring thought ""Europe good America bad,"" maybe are.

Unless produce evidence suggests otherwise? like UK revise 3 feet help cafes guys know there's countries continents US Europeo right? Everything first-world centric... Springdale Arizona? Would take news point grain salt... hope true though Let test us. I'll isolation, let know goes. odd time.

I concerned happen daughter born keep safe. working me. work higher education appreciate social distancing policies enforcing. also know students gathering fraternity basements first week school part. students outside campus them, little faith take seriously thus leading inevitable outbreak. think overall, population Finland may healthier (ie, stronger) overall. population‚Äôs overall baseline health taken consideration considering reasons infection rates location. Shit. You‚Äôve put words. No. Excess deaths absolutely indicate COVID deaths. large number people avoiding unable seek medical care dying die due that, infection (whether infected time death). Glad could bring table. Texas never really peak first place this.

Sir that's record highs work. fair, tried hard... I‚Äôm sure good test like 6k people showed stadium. March someone said thread ""Italy go history handle pandemic"" everyone agreeing patting eachother's back.

Hey America, I've go news you, there's containing this. Start focusing deal mass unemployment homelessness.  Weird average American car payment little $500/mo. No. They're not. They're preparing campaign events soothing moron's ego. that's it. cases irising France, Spain, Italy? exceptions, still restrictive small fraction Swedish population match them. Claiming otherwise simply true. exceptions:

Danish citizen.
Lives DK.

Married engaged someone DK regular partnership lasted least 3 months (de facto 6 months in-person obviously possible lockdown period).
Visiting seriously/fatally ill family member DK.
Attending funeral DK.
Court appearance DK.
Passing w/o staying country (it's geographically tiny; Malmo Sweden Flensborg Germany, driving DK, less 4 hours).

Every single one require documentation.

In week, Swedes Blekinge, Halland Scania able enter present negative test 3 days old. change people remaining 22 Swedish provinces.

The vast majority able enter legally -and been- control, hence long queues bridge. Sure could probably lie/fake documentation pass like that, probably smart. One first legislations passed Danish parliament start outbreak law crimes related receive quadruple punishment. words, normally would result slap wrist (e.g. faking sworn statement, requirement using 3-month-partner rule, birth certificate, requirement visiting child) result far serious punishment. businesses need find way adapt it. always solution everything always room improvement. there‚Äôs vaccine I‚Äôll interested know many people refuse get them. I'm shocked San Antonio make list. cases imported US many Mexicans started get infected. Hoping exceed 200,000 cases July. Yo got r/outside peeps here? I'm convinced half problems people mask wearing US would go away someone got Trump red, MAGA-branded mask, convinced pose it, guaranteed percentage profits every mask sold. suppose depends definition ""explosion"". saw largest increases started lock down. New York cautionary tale best conditions rapid spread. 

But every reliable data source planet telling restrictions lifted numbers going go up. Hopefully tidal wave ""explosion"" degree mitigate it. Nursing homes place vulnerable populations exist. people going die. good number them. going happen. I'm saying parents time skills teach kids home unless full time job. Gym, would good chance pursue wellness programs like yoga, meditation, etc. Congrats watch Super Rugby NZ want. Wait 4 weeks UK back chart US Protest general allowed BLM. It‚Äôs exception BLM it‚Äôs protesting constitutional right exceptions right like pandemic, right protest. Using serious cause justify party another issue entirely. Whether agree not, story messed up. People understanding constitutional right wanting party thing isn‚Äôt really protestors fault. needed education protest happening doesn‚Äôt mean everyone whatever want. Protest aren‚Äôt new concept. happens lower guard agree messed up, let‚Äôs critical thinking folks. Let‚Äôs try rely government recommend something common sense. Sigh finally see uptick categories. good job Make America Safe Again. are, applies us. ;) alot muricans think virus real, ain't gonna let government tell do. 

They'd probably change tune knew people caught might byob corking fee, facilitate thr social gathering space What's point? okay abandon parents previous generations did? following China since early January--I ordered ton PPE, disinfection supplies shelf stable food mid January. started sheltering place mid Feburary. I've worried even limits. elderly risk family worry about, I'm also different circumstances many. US/ EU lowest deaths since pandemic began. Yet hysteria sub still here. 

Now they‚Äôve conveniently shifted tracking deaths ‚Äúcases‚Äù. case ranged suspected covid/ symptoms almost every symptom sun including hayfever dying ventilator, let‚Äôs establish that. deaths decreasing despite lockdown need something else cause panic put magnifying glass ‚Äúcases‚Äù

The figures complete farce. hope normal people browsing see don‚Äôt buy fear agenda. masks string connects top left top right bottom left bottom right elastic goes behind skull rather ears. could try find one That's I'm fucking saying dipshit.

 I'm saying 8-3 lesson plan could probably completed half time since kid wont moving pace slowest kid class. correct them. Maybe even 60-70% them. bound least 2-3 guys team play.... run problems. Totally getting crazy Mexico number cases skyrocketed 140,000 cases came US infections rise. Actually salmon disappear whole China overnight, seafood consumption declined dramatically due fear cold chain contamination, nightmare seafood industry. ships handle non-covid cases only. mistake one even made aboard. thought Treatment ? Lol gtfo Same, kind of. friends still prob think I‚Äôm crazy bc ask I‚Äôm ‚Äústill strictly quarantining‚Äù... strictly? 

To depends consider ‚Äústrict quarantine‚Äù.... short, yes I‚Äôm still keeping distance anyone don‚Äôt live with. Unless didn‚Äôt get message, believe still pandemic 3 months ago. government testing enough. Plus, se lot poverty people living paycheck paycheck even worse, whatever money get day, makes difficult preserve kind social distancing.

And top all, president downplaying pandemic since beginning, urging government officials end restrictions go back ""new normality"". there's catch: wants us get back normal lives approval ratings getting lower lower. needs able travel make campaign acts next year many states holding elections there's big chance lose majority un congress.

Plus, he's moron. view point already walked back. It‚Äôs likely younger groups infected such, given lower death rate, appears less virulent. sure someone downvoted this. New Zealand got covid free 24 days. got back normal even sporting events rugby game 42,000 people. week later let 2 people funeral let compassionate reasons virus. people aloud country back 9 cases.

I think belief back normal that's it. virus still get overseas. have, too! I've small house husband daughter 3 months now. alone THREE MONTHS! ideal. crazy live Florida travelling work I'm scared fuck go home week? I've wearing mask ten hours day every day PA that's here. I'm going go home cesspit germs. People literally look like crazy wearing mask public. master chief pizza oven cost $600 considered restaurant sell alcohol want? Thank posting! Professional sport back quite countries.

Italy, Germany, UK, Spain, Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Chechia, Portugal, Hungary, Ukraine, Israel name few.

They seem handle far, can't see problem US. Remember incident Chesapeake Energy Arena last March NBA player Rudy Gobert tested positive COVID-19 fans still spectators.  Agree... tennis... Golf.. NASCAR, extreme sports. Maybe Cross-Country start runners different times (no big races).

But hate say it... people think 53 men NFL roster going agree play middle pandemic.... happen.

To many variables teams sports... many individuals monitor... especially football. fucking nuts shortsighted happy finding PEOPLE STUPID DEADLY US?ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è mean recent headline read.

It's normal antibodies diminish infection months, actually good sign doing.

That study nothing memory cells, cells ""remember"" make specific antibodies fights infection.

Nervous something even bothered read on. sign times. Harder justify players dont get paid arent going pro. 

It sucks fans players dont see happening even pro sports struggling play making bank. Much easier play risk getting 800k+ year low end. Stupidity truly disease spreading faster COVID fellow paramedic, yeah true. seen people dead stiff, nursing staff said fine 10 minutes ago. seen force food unconscious patient mouth tell person hungry. crazy idea - seems outdoors quite bit safer indoors. I'm assuming mainly due much greater volume air ""dilute"" anything airborne. sun / heat might able evaporate airborne saliva.

So restaurants / bars / business office retrofit exchange inside air high rate, literally creating indoor breeze? Pulling fresh air outside, pushing indoor air out.

It sounded better head... :) still used, maxed NY rush increase capacity handle overflow.

They rush, saw models planned ahead time maxed death trucks nice little extra layer insanity NY go through. 

Obviously optics morgue trucks scary imagine city near coast getting hit hard... Military medical trucks right?

If referring medical ship, end needing people died today infected May, cases lowest. already know cases increasing quite lot expect deaths follow weeks behind. Large...ish Masks Social Distancing. Look East Asia. socially distance (because can't) wear masks. White people propaganda UK regime calling ""second wave"" LOL. buddha willing, UK's suffering UK's punishment crimes British Empire. may smart ass. Wow. lived Texas I‚Äôd often tell people don‚Äôt need gun already big dick. None really means deaths though? Doctors better idea treatments aren‚Äôt guessing now, effective treatments people dying. sure people die people really truly believe absolutely nothing worry about... family member today tried argue deaths real.. believe one bit. _heavily_ believe unnecessary protests going on. ""even money US, know could come crashing moment"" What's wrong blame Fuck THIS. got called disgrace uniform (USAF) advocating people wear mask US. Sorry I‚Äôm protecting you??? Raw numbers don‚Äôt really matter. really matters infections per capita deaths per capita. Greenland people infected, it‚Äôs like duh, few. percentages similar amount cases countries (in case semi-independent country). always profound respect good healthcare workers SNFs. imagine emotionally physically draining must work every day see things medics see minutes. 

I remember one guy would sit hallway door want talk anyone walked by. big American flag door loved talk military service. liked talk medic job sit day talk. Staff told family children visited him. still remember desperation voice eyes continue pick patient. would say anything keep conversation going, point walk away still talking. months grew reclusive non-communicative social isolation eventually died, think partially giving up. still think today, 25 years later, can't imagine would like worked facility formed closer bond him. Come Texas. loves dude going move already see enough working doesn‚Äôt effect anything... given specific guidelines follow didn‚Äôt. RTFA employees mostly masks lot coworkers ended testing positive Sunday s

Cause fingering faces likely. Improper mask use making worse likely.  12 states. need minimize. Short answer: it‚Äôs complicated.

Large particles settle quickly. seconds. Small particles settle minutes, hours, even days depending diameter. even we‚Äôre looking inhalation route, viral particles you‚Äôre likely exposed small unless happen breathing direct path sneeze. openings cloth filter far large filter - terms scale it‚Äôs worse trying stop gnats chicken wire. Wish US would actually ramp testing rather bragging best testing don't. Condolences üòê Thank wearing mask btw. Yet people need steal deal drugs feed families that's suddenly unacceptable compared spreading deadly illness.  seen this? ""The states saw increase Florida, Texas, Utah, South Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, Missouri, Montana, Arizona, California, Tennessee Oklahoma.""

With cases place, see slowing unless drastic action taken local level places. True. rich people get best treatments like antibody treatment poor people like us access it. fuck logic. bunch people means personal well well exposed compromised?

You wear mask good, well good people interact with. protest? Awwwww People following rules whats losing money. sad see people cheering punishing small business owners, small business owners know business source income. like ""yay lets ruin lives didnt force customers wear masks"" everyone bar wasnt consenting breaking rules. Also sad fuck see stupid bullshit still going people praised protesting thousands tight packed street masks, bar opens lets people sit next end world. actually debate whether US states legally allowed close borders--even whatever states question agreeing it. Constitutionally, Federal government specifically granted control interstate commerce leaned power many, many times. Several big supreme court decisions restricted states allowed hinged provision. (Yes, know US states implement controls crossing earlier pandemic. However, heard, limited specific major crossings, short lived. regard truly enforced border ""closure"" like EU countries capable of.)

So anyway, even states really went idea border closure, attempts enforce would likely turn political legal morass. Oh dear, CO-VID basically old news NZ. hope someone properly take charge situation replaces Trump soon. stupid? probably try stay business fire employees close good I'm curious part state live live Yakima tomorrow businesses must require masks worn enter.  reason people resisting official claims seem match reality people see around thats government deceptive intentionally misleading public early credibility trust problem. Worse, government trying avoid growing catastrophe mask wearing opposed addressing original problem. chose allow certain businesses families make millions knowing sending people grave. one talking part bad would general public informed. thought guy tho wonder anyone cosplay coronavirus? seriousness insanely fucked go this. Anyone contracted COVID loss taste, could try describe significant loss is? need know I‚Äôm afraid bad news family.

Rich, forgot rich. true, watch 7 day average, see uptick, good news. We're averaging 600 deaths day - that's far great. rising cases expect eventually change. look Iran - cases dropped begin increase took 6 weeks deaths really caught increase cases. 


You add recent deaths Spain, France, Italy Germany get 600 deaths day. Meanwhile, Tennessee went Walmart today and, myself, saw three people wearing sort face covering. Yeah title meant fearmonger misinform all.

People look Florida like we're crazy (such beach pictures) reality went beach recently, see single non-rental car Florida liscence plate. Thankfully there's area beach residents park, looking towards tourist area freaking packed.

We look beach like cities look trails/mountains, somewhere go exercise relax. Even packed areas people stayed area. There's much else one rec things .

I truly believe problem tourist trap areas causing numbers spike, essential workers bring home families, government nothing stop - beach resident-only numbers gone down.

You, many sub (when see link it), seem enjoy theatrics fear mongering rather considering virus does, done, less harm (to real lives) economic repercussions shutting everything down. 

Protect weak; smart business (e g. Instead shortening hours, leads immense backlog customers promotes close-proximity shopping, extend hours allow customers go different times; allow young strong carry weight order maintain economic integrity. 

This absolute embarrassing; I, Canadian, worry deeply long-term effects - things see long time people like followers sub decrying years. That's report Per capita death rate going down? happen add people Unpopular opinion, believe focus cloth mask usage backfiring. don‚Äôt problem wearing one indoors crowded outdoor areas (bc help, even minimally), believe gen pop consider masks magical shields forgets distancing hand washing components. 

Americans seem capable following one major requirement time. Anecdotally, since masks became required city, people hell lot less distancing streets, stores, etc. face touching isn‚Äôt helping. find behaving way, too. focus distancing, particularly indoors, would probably pay better. People city also insane think they‚Äôre going get infected mask less runner 10 feet away. 

If n95s everyone would different story. protests happened weeks ago. Almost 3. spike would well seen already. Statistically places seeing highest spikes huge protests, compare NY example INSANE protests numbers going down, data doesn‚Äôt support spikes protests. minimal compared done....but agreed. üçª Sorry loss. April worst though? feel like responding point. 2012 ~5 million eligible voters 2008. Furthermore, year election. 2012 2016 direct comparison. really comparing 2008.

Regardless, 2016 ~15 million 2012.

The fact Hillary could capture enough +20 million added pool since 2008 perfectly exemplifies ability rally voter base vote her. Completely agree. experiencing frustrations brought up. School surveys results favoring business usual parents saying refuse send kids masks required. Anyone ounce critical thinking skills see past economy first bs leaders downplaying virus. 

Unfortunately, US experience massive outbreak delayed fall/winter months. Everyone think school life general back normal, guarantee reality check already started explode lax policies rooted science. That's really guarantee, thing could burn US one wave reach vaccine herd immunity. point seems likely scenario. Getting flu next year have. deserve dogs ;\_; thing going change people's minds get someone close get it. Exactly, what's hard this? government state tells something it. good greater good Good you. work employer considered essential, never fully shut down, luckily foresight order everyone would work home go home. county still lifted public health order requiring telecommuting whenever possible employer rescinded stay home order. office closed since March. Bay Area first place country shut managed keep infection rates lot lower New York LA despite ground zero outbreak. 

Personally, think anyone business opening work remotely, can't, minimum number people required ensure everyone stays least several meters apart kind physical barrier separating them, everyone wearing masks, et cetera. way states employers handling blows mind. would like boring times right now, please. next generations fucked. take oil dependent capitalistic way life fueled willful ignorance waiting iceage reset us.

FUCKINF PIECES SHIT This, catch Covid 19 together. don‚Äôt fucking get people wear nose out. Wtf people know breath nose?? Seems little harsh, imo. employees? like decision break rules. You‚Äôre celebrating people losing livelihoods. vaccine still make huge difference - would something needs repeated (if proves true), much like vaccines. vaccines forever, need booster shots. one would frequent until, hopefully, eradicated. Agreed. think full lockdown necessary unless hospitals completely overrun. believe increase cases might warning sign put halt openings. increase cases opening bars, movie theaters high occupancy places could disaster. Figures available CDC: provisional death count higher deaths coded COVID-19 (and substantial amount which, say, widely reported).

Deaths seem decreasing initial peak, although important note data least past month incomplete notes page suggest delay getting data range 1 8 weeks. peak far 10 weeks ago, look like real downward trend, celebrating may premature.

It's difficult hide death data entirely long term, even without that, simply reporting confirmed deaths without properly highlighting reporting lag skew perceptions quite bit. interesting note CDC table linked, row week ending 6/13/2020 ""percent expected deaths"" 42. means supposedly 58% fewer deaths year week 2019, obviously nonsense unless social distancing curing heart disease cancer.

It's trend matters - eu decreasing, us Flattening curve means elongating X time axis. numbers still going climb point decline. It‚Äôs realistic expect growth virus spreads exponentially.

I would add one main strengths mask wearing slows spread asymptomatic transmission, benefit isolation much less effective overcoming COVID-19 unless government also adopts social distancing, social tracing, rapid testing quarantining.

Seeing HK managed reduce cases less handful (over last month) currently 5 COVID-19 deaths total, clear multi-pronged coordinated action plan (mask wearing, social distancing, social tracing, rapid testing quarantining) needed. 

Masks buy society time identify treat patients... Time absolutely crucial resource, fear many governments (Brazil, UK, US) effectively hit COVID-19 fatigue even stemmed flow cases. !RemindMe July 15 Boris soon. bypassing safety protocols.

People would feel differently reading stuff like don‚Äôt think proving animal model critical path getting clinical trial,‚Äù(( said Tal Zaks, chief medical officer Moderna, Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech produced Covid-19 vaccine candidate record speed. told STAT scientists National Institutes Health ‚Äúworking nonclinical research parallel.‚Äù Meanwhile, clinical trial started recruiting healthy participants first week March.

Between disappearing cases number areas trying trial vaccine candidates, certainly trying rush.  ‚ÄúI seen evidence‚Äù - people read ‚Äúno‚Äù.

What actually means:

* Evidence may exist personally seen it

* Evidence may exist categorized specifically event - test samples don‚Äôt include ‚ÄúBLM protestor‚Äù labels 

* Evidence may exist studied specifically nobody wants touch political ramifications criticizing BLM movement 

* Evidence may exist apparent excruciating little prevalence data compare baseline 

* Evidence may exist confounded protestors hiding biometric data - legitimate means avoid harassment &amp; prosecution also incidentally interfere correlating infections spreader event

* Evidence may exist, available yet since rushed preprints containing publicly controversial conclusions destroyed many reputations academia last couple months 

* Evidence may exist buried misinterpreted slanted critical movement

* Evidence exists, published, personally seen therefore choose believe opposite

Take pick, could condition ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen evidence.‚Äù

What *do* know protest, like public gathering event, featured large amount people close contact types events spread virus. masks...is effective 

We able meticulous research start quantifying effects homemade cloth masks, despite wide variations material, construction, well person actually keeps on...the short answer wear mask protects others slightly almost nothing yourself. Universal mask requirements good countermeasure, point they‚Äôre desperate last resort *because don‚Äôt anything else*. absolutely make universally required say ‚Äúvery effective‚Äù misleading scientifically inaccurate. outside effective 

Again, supported science. Although we‚Äôve little time study particular coronavirus, studied effects UV traces found natural ambient light extensively since 2001. subject interest seasonal vulnerabilities potential bioterrorism pathogen - fact research advisor time couple papers subject. Unfortunately, find lot applications concentrated UV light like 254-nm bulbs used water treatment, intensity wavelengths found natural sunlight little effect ambient levels. They‚Äôve found slight improvements recent research particular virus it‚Äôs rough order decreasing inactivation time 8 hours 2 hours. environmental pathology terms that‚Äôs practically nothing; virus spreads people crowded events seconds minutes.

I think respectfully may want step back think scientific approach - let want believe popular influence conclusion. matter much support protests, responsible time indicate events aren‚Äôt risk spreader events. Nursing home cases go asymptomatic, hear they're dying.

La La land. compared numbers killed? estimated protesters kill number people DAY protest versus many black people total killed cops YEAR. That's total black people killed too, warranted deaths cops could shooting self defense too. 

So basically, protests go 50 days, even 50 years (actually 100 years since black deaths cops legit) still killed people possibly save. assumes 100% saving practice never do.

What's worse now, days physical protesting means absolutely nothing. already made point. days protesting streets going make people resentful angry disruptions deaths protestors causing. hurts cause continue point. movement would much better moving noncovid spreading forms protesting. 

I'm actually minority sister covid. support cause means currently used absolutely immoral. protestors killing people hopes might change something even though matter succeed not, they'll still cause way deaths protested using different, sager methods.

In rural areas, sometimes one regional, low budget hospital extremely limited resources PPE test kits medical staff.

These hospitals less likely respiratory therapists, uncommon prescription medications, ventilators.

So, unless patients transported hospitals capacity, we're going see deaths. wrong. one got progressively wrong. That‚Äôs ok though. alternate facts. fact, force them. Consider duress. what? it‚Äôs supposed work. Fiat money inflation, driven underlying debt. Fed removed go back gold standard nothing change, think system come crashing down, betting masters money supply, Morgan, Rockefeller et al. national gameplan get tests needed.


We really national plan all. first states looked Federal level guidance realized Federal level shit together states started things own. President started covid task force tried push responsibility onto others whatever reason President let experts steal show. briefings turned complete shit shows conflicting messages President looked crazy every briefing stopped those. President finally got fed told Governors (most governors already figured point) President actively ignoring situation. ""How make person feeling depressed meeeeeee""

Don't downplay others emotions go around victim battles 50 upvotes it‚Äôs US got fucked hard superspreading event february; carnival. Tourists returning Italy Austria spread virus four days indoor drinking, yelling partying. I'm loan officer. know everywhere market (SE PA/South NJ) product inventory.

Having said that, I'm seeing little less demand normal borrower side things, even close rate lack inventory.


Tangentially, kind microcosm slowed economy locked - supply shock China shutting down. I'm Portland guess hot spot ME. think folks cautious sorts reasons politics actually affected. Things starting slip though, eg city's main Hannaford, employees wearing masks much, Home Depot Lowes I'm seeing less mask wearing among customers HD, among employees. little unnerving. Trader Joes Whole Foods fully masked, though.

I'm avoiding restaurants trying takeout especially around Augusta employees wearing masks South Portland wore partly. one local diner confidence that's it.

I'm thinking studying Maths BA, sure (the Brits STILL told us much cost, Cyprus, Germany Greece can't go I'm going Economico klado can't take university entrance exams, Switzerland damn expensive, I'll probably go Austria...) I've told go PhD Data Science I'll like ultra rich forever lol 

Is true though?? go failed economists medical advice. sub hilarious. Rioting looting perfectly fine god forbid anyone go graduation thinking thing regarding doom gloom. Comments extremely pessimistic social distancing masks really add nothing. Also, don‚Äôt seem care destructive results (economic other) lockdowns. Drink home, stop crying service retail workers wanting safe. Selfish child. ready friends go hospital prove right! 

(Not really, know.) surprise. Black Lives Matter important everyone's safety. protests going hard really give shit. Keeping distance important thing, think call working security guard casino ‚Äúmaking life‚Äù weird Jonestown flavor aid shit. You‚Äôve lived life long enough aren‚Äôt tired cast shell live peace lol know two people it, early on. family member colleague. women, 30s. runners (one marathons, triathelete). 2 months later family member back running tell things 'off' willing consider long recovery something like pneumonia. 

the triathelete can't run 1km without collapsing. 2 months. doctors confused pikachu face, one basically said 'this might new lung capacity. push yourelf medical community better diagnostics...i may years.'

when read NHL athletes like Auston Mathews COVID, I'm scared shitless career impact. he's 20% less effective, could difference superstar retirement. mean, we're really serious. like month pussyfooting around finally decided cities could backdoor ban people wearing masks public fining businesses enforcing it. governor acted like big fucking riddle finally figure that. in, played coy likely hundreds people died result lag time. Lol antibody tests remarkably high false positives? 

The reliability ‚Äúeasy get antibody‚Äù tests isn‚Äôt high. 

Trust you‚Äôre revolutionizing approach Covid testing forward thinking. every person could get antibody testing extremely accurate things may different. bought Dec., think first time made real wrong guess financially. Luckily bought well could afford.  I‚Äôm glad list hobbies expanded rather desperately going plague rooms drink expensive cocktails things going once: states reopening, protestors gathering thousands every major city country, testing people. surprise cases rising. inevitable, also expected? purpose locking hospitals overrun patients. hospitals still risk collapse know vulnerable population virus testing showing much lower death rate initially thought, can't move away one-size-fits-all strategy fighting thing across country? Euro Pound stronger US dollar decades. I‚Äôm sure fits narrative. you‚Äôre hard time deep breaths I‚Äôd go get checked immediately. Covid not, demands taken seriously. Rent dropping hard here, tho prices huy not. Tons airbnbs without tourists, student rentals without stAnford students, summer rentals without interns, thats wfh exodus. Yeah, depends initial dose. virus likely takes 15-30 minutes replicate single particle. Get dosed hundred particles, contagious least 12 hours later got dosed 1 million particles. likely 2-4 days really shedding enough contagious either way. Colorado middle lot ways. near geographic center US, 21st population, median salary outside top 10 big states...

It one largest states, physically fit, otherwise, sort just... there. You‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs Presidency ratings? Americans hate one two things, maybe even both:

1. told government.

2. think someone themselves. Opening bars June 5, think good move? Deaths now, bc shutdown cases Florida mid-May. know millennials new cases, work nursing homes. 

Cases, hospitalizations, deaths. Right cases, quite predictably, up. Check Florida month, tell great job we're doing. I'd careful there.

We're still months knowing long immunity confered recovery lasts. hope right though. Probably ventilators. Like said.

interesting planet live  hope got quote. Mr septiceye ban fast food, super easy. won‚Äôt open. It‚Äôs bullshit , fairytale planning right now. logistics complicated school district us pull off. can‚Äôt even get pencils classroom unless teachers spend money. soon fall winter wave arrives, kids back home parents...who also home again. Get sauna! IV vitamin drips bro! hear? president asked testing slowed many people testing positive. Red states like AZ complied. testing problem!

TL:DR US manufacturer made N95s ability ramp up, noticed high demand outside US, tried reach government, response. Adverse possession know got slapped Austin fairly newer bars, maybe less familiar extremely happy TABC kick shit in. Except don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going much cycle. Unless federal government changes strategies, open think open. ""but UK like twice many deaths per capita US? ""

Actually, exactly that. don‚Äôt see starting studies? Canada land border US closed, restrictions air travel fly please US. Can't say we'll polite usual American tourists days tho. releasing stories like these?

One big barrier healthcare privacy laws. Nurses &amp; doctors fear talking patient cases may get trouble employer government regulators.

But right would help videos &amp; personal stories available everyone else witness. feel like people use term ‚Äúoverhyped‚Äù expected Black Plague like levels death. term brings mind disappointment there‚Äôs massive death. Kind weird. warning effective stopping 'politicization' stopping virus lol Loads people give 5 10 years lives 

Again, that's old romantic idea.

You talking 15-20 years, change diapers, deal bed sores, waking every 2 hours calm frightened confused shell parents.

""Taking care parents""was time parents tiny pension needed financial support becoming roommates kids return help household. never issue 10 years medical geriatric care. still notion bad thing, parent neglect. one siblings pressured others basically screw lives (theirs parent).

The solution decent elderly care. expensive. want one good thing kids life, make sure afford it.

Whether want not, you.cannot.take.care.of.your.parents. trained it, house adapted it. medical needs 90y old worlds apart 70y old. old mom reaches 90? going lift bed bath age? probably drop break femur. grandpa, he's 84 also type diabetes.

From completely apolitical point view, realize jumped shark declaring support BLM, nonetheless... politics aside look lens effective policy.

Contact tracing involves multiple requirements effective:

1) adequate testing capability readily accessible limits exposure. that.

2) well integrated, well funded Public Health service educated prepared pandemic response. that.

3) effectively able isolate potential exposures positive test case able reliably trace exposures end point. Participating kind mass gathering prevents that.

4) traced end point exposed must voluntarily submit Quarantine/Social Isolation/ROM protocol ADHERE it. also happening.

What I'm saying test trace method good small unified populations. scale past certain point becomes unsustainable, irrational, provides diminishing returns lockdowns happened first place.

Now, infinitesimal sliver chance force nationwide lockdown reset game clock allow effective contact tracing. Unfortunately, squandered opportunity suffer consequences. Anyway, looks like country big trouble. sincerely hope get control. Yep, even simulated already.

Upset, sadness angry voices - Swedish death tolls arouse strong feelings Finland. widespread Sweden contempt. contrary, Finns lack neighbors, according Finnish Interior Minister Maria Ohisalo (Green).



""Finland ready help every way""


Private individuals reported social media Swedish-registered ""illegal"" cars, crossed border. expressed sorrow sometimes directly hateful dung Swedes, Sweden chose different corona strategy upset Finns think many Swedes reason put death. worst social media angry voices screamed loud enough, moderate partly also sad voices drowned noise.


- Sweden Finland close other, common history active relations across borders, says Finnish Interior Minister Maria Ohisalo (Green) SVD asks explain Sweden always seems evoke strong feelings.


Images widespread disdain Sweden information Swedes become something pariah one wants keep away Finland, takes great distance from. general disdain Swedish, says. contrary.

- hope one stir feelings. entire Finnish government, say would important get back normal situation Sweden soon. constant contact Finland ready help every way: intensive care, test capacity, everything can. you.


That Finland, example , decided allow Swedes properties Finland romantic relationship Finn travel across border, thinks gesture meant show want meet dear neighbor extent permitted situation.


But otherwise border remains closed Swedes, explained ""epidemiological situation"". Finland chose early pandemic shut large parts country quickly restricted social relations people. believed reason fewer 330 Finns far died covid-19 wards, situation control, society slowly started reopen.


Gunvor Kronman CEO Swedish-Finnish cultural center Hanaholmen, closed borders concrete effect. one able travel meet, joint Nordic education, meetings seminars quickly transformed digital versions. However, technology cannot infinitely replace real meetings. believe Nordic countries endlessly act nationally.


- whole Nordic countries based free movement common labor market, see Nordic decision-makers acting together message coordinate solve together. meet, visible, says Kronman.

What heard, however, angry voices that, debate, partly condems Sweden's corona strategy, partly deeply upset many Swedes died. part debate sometimes unpleasant, says Gunvor Kronman.

- always small minority extremely nationalistic, apply Sweden Finland, emerged borders several countries well.

According her, emotional outbursts also explained fact Finns generally seem afraid infected corona common man Sweden. always follow everything happens Sweden, Swedish line puzzled many.

- almost obsessed Sweden follow situation online, also Swedish death figures. fed horrifying images clear affects public opinion.

She wants Nordic countries start acting together, nationally. addition, calls realistic view Tornedalen [ed note: Me√§nmaa Finnish, border area there‚Äôs city (Tornio) functionally one city bisected artificially Swedish/Finnish border], hit hard closed borders.

- special area, largely lived city. Here, Finland able find special solutions instead closing borders.

However, running, according Ohisalo. borders opened, decision cover whole Sweden, Tornedalen. it‚Äôs gotten rid of, nobody knows. issue discussed Nordic ministers midsummer weekend. ultimately comes copies virus body. body's ability stop copying itself, ""amount"" virus exposed public. There's reason doctors nurses contract harder time, many copies bodies due exposure. still premature terms studies, anecdotal evidence there, evidence relapse reinfection. verified data that. Fake news, studies already found neutralizing antibodies rechallenge studies showed reinfection. We‚Äôve never needed make coronavirus vaccine sars burned chance make one.

And never entire medical research capacity entire world unlimited funding trying make vaccine. advancements last 20 years rapidly changed timeline. original sars didn‚Äôt even test outbreak nearly over, one within first month. see graphs new positive tests (1st graph), hospitalizations (2nd graph), deaths (3rd graph) deaths sex age (4th graph).

For first three graphs deselect 'tot en met gisteren' see new data person tested positive/ hospitalized/ died.

As today 81 (+2) (updated 22-06 13:55) patients ICU. patients confirmed suspected Covid-19. total 2921 Covid-19 patients ICU since pandemic began. [Source lastly, Covid-19 dashboard published state collects important data one place. [find everyone getting clue.

Giving kids sense normalcy parents hours well deserved rest pretty awesome gift! Last night, really surprised local news. know national news, like CNN, it‚Äôs talking deaths gonna crazy across country reopen...and trying create panic fear. local news pretty lengthy piece last night lockdown illinois even necessary outside Chicago. talked rate deaths areas, always way projections...even opening. death rate actually still falling. nice see local story swimming tide corona coverage. Cases going hospitalizations lag 1 2 weeks.

It true younger people infected recently, hospitalization won‚Äôt bad, spread vulnerable population, contagious people around. tons excess deaths around country 

The last count saw 44k. ""probably closer reality"" number around 160k dead far. BARge 295 docked boat, I'm surprised even got enough people get TABC's attention. speak Canada say 2 months since declared outbreak Jan 30 Canada pandemic March 23. ample time prepare.

In fact, find Canada handled poorly. Speaking firsthand experience working hospital, I‚Äôm almost ashamed poorly handled. 

Just last week made ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù wear masks hospital work at... 3 months declared pandemic. we‚Äôre lowest transmissions Covid19 patient numbers entire situation. It‚Äôs utterly pathetic.

Way different you‚Äôre NYC. Sorry learn places NY... states dropped social distancing. states relaxing earliest ones trouble now, boat. soon state opens up, probably going pretty bad trouble. problem. Misinformation seems big issue stuff. I'm glad help. Well course less since states apparently ordered test, per admission Tulsa. plenty people way younger 80 dying. 


There also plenty people ""recover"" massive ongoing health issues. equation used classical herd immunity assumes everyone equal amount contact others. valid realm vaccination people essentially vaccinated random. pandemic, people contact others get immunity earlier average. 

And papers topic, though science still relatively underdeveloped since pandemic herd immunity likely occur naturally century.  second wave already self quarantine, ask should? I'm confused That‚Äôs insane hear, I‚Äôm NH anyone get test it‚Äôs super easy sign one. They‚Äôre even telling us people symptoms get one go back work. camera angle pretty misleading news well. looked Snapchat event curious happening around it, inside snaps show far separated audience. Also made giant walkway get stage could avoid ramps would guess lol. Even though far separated, I'm sure people yelling projecting enclosed space recipe disaster. Coca Cola lmao People also love guns refuse acknowledge problem Let's take opportunity put production distribution resources dimes quarters.

It's time leave pennies nickels behind. articles suggest number causes besides reinfection symptoms experienced recovered patients. evidence point case, especially ‚Äúrelapsed‚Äù patients seem infecting close contacts. that's like today it? going meanwhile parents?

Did guys burn loot stores too? Deaths consistently lower week week given day time. 

At point higher case number going translate higher death totals, though may spike. Texas, Arizona Florida abnormally high case numbers compared death rate. least four things play
- Increased testing
- increased infection young, lower death rate
- lag case rise death rise

As got downvoted, there's pack inorganic accounts downvotes anything reflects badly Swedish strategy. Children rifles pistols. people supposed provide daily care aging parents work day? 

Yeah, sure money, space time it, choice choice limited select number people. 

You're also ignoring fact lot elderly people want live kids old. That's many financial plan place final years. plant small outbreak (20 people, 2 hospitalized). 

Our plant decontaminated daily longer cleandown shift. Stations spaced far apart engineering reworked things ensure this. 

20 people still got sick. 

They discovered 20 got sick part carpooling system workers put together get shift workers together. carpool infected person, one 20. Then, one person sick enough go work, formed different carpool, people. infected, know it, longer wanted risk getting infected, formed different carpools infected people. 

Everyone survived hospitalized workers made home. 9million still concerned. Anyone else find ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried [insert public policy decision here]...‚Äù condescending annoying hell? You‚Äôre expert were, people would actually care you‚Äôre worried about. You‚Äôre worried NY states contained virus probably don‚Äôt even live there. 

Is don‚Äôt like people allowed finally leave homes (with precautions)? many sad rest world (or parts it) finally see sense normalcy you‚Äôre still stuck loneliness nothing quarantine begin with? You‚Äôve quarantining social life forever short time, everyone feel pain. you‚Äôre alone locked house. 

Btw, someone pushes BS me, I‚Äôm PA favor lockdowns. we‚Äôre averaging recoveries per day new cases. Hospitalizations down, deaths down, etc. I‚Äôm still going restaurants even open back up. I‚Äôm going keep working home go back. wear mask distance much possible. no, I‚Äôm ‚Äúit‚Äôs flu bro‚Äù idiot.

Also protestors tend socially conscious. willingly taking risk wearing masks taking precautions. I‚Äôve attended several mask use like 95-97%, 99% some. people throughout crowd offering hand sanitizer, extra masks, contactless sunblock, water, hand wipes. 

Every time touch something find someone squirt hand sanitizer you, many do.

I would bet crowds full people generally responsible terms care others take additional precautions going home avoid spreading anything may caught.

No please tell us China loves us let handle everything. That's entire preproduction run, think. Governments around world essentially pre-ordering shares that. prepared america lose status country worlds highest disposable income then. pay 40%+ income tax. Texas Florida testing less goes theory... Ya... None affects 99% Canadians, good job showcasing PM's virtuosity. thanks assuming stance issues - saved time type out. likely reasons.

1. know virus getting better treating it. Early on, believed critically ill patients needed intubated, thought giving nasal oxygen would spread virus throughout hospital. turned case. Intubation major procedure increased change death. 

2. We've learned people lie bellies helps, used well help patients. assume breakthroughs can't name top head.

3. lag time cases deaths couple weeks, spike cases reflected death count bit.

4. past month--up past days--the overall rate people diagnosed holding steady, though overall rate positive tests dropping. indicates number due wider availability tests, meaning tests catching higher percentage people disease, cohort much less sick first wave March, serious cases could get tested.

5. Many vulnerable people still taking precautions, whereas greater percentage people getting virus younger people going bars.

However, past week we've seen big spikes number states, along higher percentage positive tests. again, we're hearing shortage tests Arizona. indicates re-opening, virus starting spread exponentially number places, probably see different outcome first wave (because testing still catching higher percentage cases back medical interventions improving), states roll back openings, impose face mask laws, take actions bend curve, even lower death rate per case, we'll still see medical systems overwhelmed weeks. dunno. inoculate risk death rate keeps dropping see enough return normal. try ivermectin !! cheaper! Quite content current situation.

Unless old sick, chances dying statistical noise.

If either two categories, stay home. not, live life.

The pro-lockdown tyrants terrorized us months end. turn taste boot. must stopped testing. heard makes go away.

That sounds bad, let's think actions realized magnitude situation. risked political career calling 911 getting prostitute desperately needed medical attention. I'm sure current governor would that. 

The willingness sacrifice political career save lives exactly Florida needs right now. stretch days would open window sit front closest could get sitting outside. pretty rough around April. I've thinking deaths ""firm"" number is. I'm worried things:

1. certain states intentionally juking stats skew obfuscating entirely

2. sure true, reports hospitals usinf c19 post mortem diagnosis order get money

3. seems inconsistency patients quantified. words, die c19 die it?

And write things out, wonder kind cancel leave us number precise, actually relatively close true number.

Sarcasm can't leave Calm storm. Feel obliged say - FT British newspaper (owned Nikkei), HQ's London first published 1888. always, people like projecting issues onto others. Pure lies. 100% mask usage protest went to, volunteers hand sanitizer, relatively spread out. federal government sets minimum standards requirements must met. Beyond airport able operate independently. 

The federal government may requirement face coverings can't used (there's plausible security reasons might case) public information, invite research find citation requirement. first 500k deaths 

Doctors enough experience treating want talk people care social distancing. care safety, people come contact with? family, others' families? 

I get people care catching it, feel responsible life choices, apparently know virus is, attitude extends caring anybody's life enough inconvenienced. congregate population NC taking hit..they'r majority numbers NC country in?? say, generally speaking, part rural America taking COVID seriously hasn‚Äôt hit us hard yet. simply give fuck.

It's sad places need get hit hard NYC (for people take things seriously). can‚Äôt imagine India less Russia right now. Actually I‚Äôm pretty sure US Right, trump dropped national group funded tasked preparing federal response exactly situation. South Korea  stumbles sec -then fucking nails it, treating people daily us total. Sends guidebook trump. throws away. nothing two months effectively get ahead it. starts telling people it‚Äôs going really really really fucking bad won‚Äôt go away years fuck bunch handling China getting out. look closer ‚Äúwhere American doctors staff? liaisons tasked keeping White House date doing?‚Äù trump fired them. fired WHO. put kid charge-he‚Äôs smart two four made apparent. 

None groups perfect there‚Äôs running theme. Obama watched Ebola outbreak America (fucking crushed mercilessly) wrote book modern America. Trump tossed without reading it. 

Every step way find trump defunding discrediting scientists bad news. fucked many ways Trump went public record announce slowed testing bring numbers definitely caused huge numbers unnecessary American dead. rebuilt-trump committed crimes humanity.

Ok, think agree you. Clearly people cruises find boring. No, Trump‚Äôs fault providing leadership clear messaging, especially regarding masks. cohesive strategy it‚Äôs free-for-all.

Good luck that. Especially shitty small towns barely enough services keep roads maintained public libraries funding already many places - police it. 

You pretend bucket issues public services police budgets, much larger systemic issue applaud caring, going see real change keep shouting ""defund police"". Nope, specifically said cases comments above. 'whatever I'm talking about' mild moderate cases either linger long time, never go hospital, amongst 30% false negative, silent pneumonia, e.g. pulse O2 sat 50%, etc, either long term complications, ones spread others end long term complications. wish, hope wrong. Especially case. Now, won‚Äôt last long.

I think nice way saying ""With way US Brazil treating this, good possibility last longer"". NJ done tremendous job flattening curve. phased opening approach, far, seem working well. 

hospitalizations, ICU, ventilator usage decreasing past month+. new cases trending down. infection rate currently .79.

A lot people thought opening parks, beaches, increasing outdoor gatherings, protests etc. going cause another spike yet see that.

Ugh, thought work-from-home promising wrt infection control hoping places would keep going post-reopening. lot people talking benefits exurban/rural communities ‚Äúsocially distanced‚Äù already, least grew FL, lot people lived rural/distanced areas would still go offices work. Offices *always* air conditioned (because, know, *Florida*), many shared spaces (the kitchenette, bathrooms), designed pack lot workspaces close together.

So, sure, people aren‚Äôt packed subways together, they‚Äôre still sharing bunch poorly ventilated spaces hours time 5 days week (possibly without masks), that‚Äôs still huge opportunity spread infections. Everywhere I‚Äôve worked, everyone knew cold season comes around, *everyone office gets sick*. doesn‚Äôt matter live suburbs live apartments live middle nowhere, they‚Äôre sharing space least 40 hours week. ecornermy* vulnerable population dies quicker would otherwise. can't say deserve death sentence vulnerable.

Except buying strawman majority protestors wanted haircut, worried livelihoods lost anything.

Is possible open window workplace? Outside airflow seems like not-insignificant component keeping spread low, know lot offices non-functioning windows. ""On average across USA testing simply catching people, great.""

That sounds like wrong explanation.
The number tests same, %of infected higher.

That's really good news Pls read article commenting.

Docs ran test flu, found negative, despite told flu.

That said, agree think there's good chance doctors actually believed covid free, whatever reason. 42% cases La last two weeks. rest California passed La month ago. investors really stupid believe it. Congress president trying give businesses immunity liability coronavirus. Whether immunity right now, others looking you, following guidelines wearing mask signal others also wear mask. Dunno specifics, least Seattle protesters wearing masks. serve double function protests. :) recommends 4%. 

Seems like stricter lockdown countries avoided excess hump completely. TIL Bing still exists. ""Banner Health's chief clinical officer said Friday Banner's Arizona ICUs nearing 100 percent licensed capacity, hospital administrators preparing add additional beds expand ICU capacity 25 percent. Arizona hospitals mandated state government surge plans increase capacity much 50 percent, necessary.""

So still lots room then.

""At Maricopa County's public hospital, Valleywise Health, doctors seeing patients tested positive coronavirus, seen small increases hospitalizations""

So one hospital system filling-ish, another room.

""Hospitals across state hit peak overall inpatient numbers week due combination coronavirus *an increase elective surgeries* patients.¬†The hospitals averaged 87 percent capacity reported Thursday,¬†but number reduced slightly Friday.""

So may already peaked lot increase driven resuming surgeries considered ""elective"", extremely important.

I've hospitals normal times seen family members wait 2 days bed emergency department. Hospitals run full time. That's make money.

The first phase big-time college football season ‚Äî voluntary workouts ‚Äî begun, several campuses month welcoming players back phases. Major sports conferences National Collegiate Athletic Association laid guidelines colleges restart athletic operations even pandemic surges parts country.

‚ÄúThe way truly mitigate risks robust testing people every single day. ... impossible.‚Äù

Dozens athletes several colleges already tested positive Covid-19, presenting preview early days fall semester could look like. campuses, testing procedures produced positive diagnoses rigorous ‚Äî limited number students involved ‚Äî likely deployed fall. disparity raises questions whether colleges prepared contain sudden outbreaks.

The University Texas Austin reported Thursday 13 football players tested positive. tally Inside Higher Ed put number positive diagnoses nationwide least 56 Friday morning. Friday evening, USA Today reported 28 members Clemson University's athletics department, mostly football players staff, tested positive Covid-19 ‚Äî largest known outbreak since athletes returned. Inside Higher Ed's count included two Clemson football players.

The positive diagnoses come amid escalating concern well-being athletes, called return campuses weeks ahead rest classmates. University California Los Angeles, 30 football players demanded ‚Äúthird-party health official‚Äù attend football activities make sure program‚Äôs Covid-19 policies followed, according Los Angeles Times.

Concern likely grow rising case count. rapidly climbing number diagnoses could result campuses‚Äô testing athletes upon re-entry, whether show symptoms Covid-19. Among Texas, Oklahoma State University, Iowa State University. Texas tested athletes random returned university well testing showed symptoms virus, Iowa Oklahoma State testing players once.

Players test positive told self-isolate officials conduct contact tracing ‚Äî finding they‚Äôve interacted recently instructing people self-isolate, too.

To contact trace quickly accurately possible, many universities keeping track people football players live interact with, said Michael Huey, former president American College Health Association member Emory University‚Äôs Covid-19 task force.

While procedures work well football teams ‚Äî include 100 players limited number coaches sports-medicine staff members ‚Äî testing contact tracing become much costly difficult larger scale. Consider fall semester, millions students expected stream back campuses.

As colleges universities struggled devise policies respond quickly evolving situation, links Chronicle‚Äôs key coverage worldwide health crisis affecting campuses.

Colleges likely won‚Äôt able scale testing procedures athletes entire campus population. example, neither Texas, Oklahoma State, Iowa State planning test students upon return. Rather, testing students symptoms exposed virus, according university websites.

Public-health experts say comprehensive testing close ideal containment scenario. social distancing, masks, precautions important, colleges open blind spots testing everyone frequently.

‚ÄúThe way truly mitigate risks robust testing people every single day,‚Äù said Jean Chin, executive director University Georgia University Health Center associate professor. ‚ÄúIt would take testing people every single day frequency. It‚Äôs impossible.‚Äù

But inability test large populations frequently doesn‚Äôt mean universities can‚Äôt contain spread Covid-19, Chin said.

Crystal Watson, senior scholar Johns Hopkins Center Health Security, said testing capacity key. ‚ÄúAt point, using testing strategically probably realistic approach,‚Äù said. individuals can‚Äôt tested daily, twice week could realistic frequency could also help contain virus, added.

Even frequent testing athletes better positions officials detect virus, it‚Äôs far perfect. Mark Coberley, associate athletics director sports medicine Iowa State University, said effective contact tracing quarantining aren‚Äôt easy pull practice.

While Coberley agrees contact tracing vital safely reopening universities, emphasized need immediately quarantine exposed infected person administer test later quarantine.

‚ÄúWhat we‚Äôve learned far want testing accurate, needs period time they‚Äôre much anyone else,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúThe challenge you‚Äôre testing screen people, screening people symptoms need quarantining that.‚Äù

While contact tracing useful isolating infected slowing spread, Watson said, Covid-19 incubation period unclear person could receive negative result tested soon infection.

‚ÄúEven testing contacts, contacts still need stay quarantined two weeks, even test negative middle incubation period, may still develop symptoms become infectious later on,‚Äù said.

In addition testing, college football programs applied measures researchers believe decrease spread Covid-19: masks worn times practicing, social distancing enclosed spaces, emphasizing necessity students avoid crowded places, bars parties, often large part collegiate life.

But there‚Äôs much universities programs control. ‚ÄúThe real challenge college-aged students they‚Äôre away university,‚Äù Coberley said. hope planning decent, user friendly home curriculum kids aren‚Äôt going returning.  grateful lot parents want homeschool kids. help lot ways. everyone incentives help can. idea even considering pre-k. That‚Äôs ridiculous. masks don‚Äôt work! /s 

It interesting see comparison US vs literally every country see badly fucked advanced notice Good. would ""love"" ton protests concerned spread COVID-19 area? makes sense.

Sniffles? Contact tracing? Coupled 95F temperatures? Oh gotcha I've said million times since crisis began: key metric reducing interactions. big cities facilitate interactions, small towns also intense repeated interactions time due 500 people going churches walmarts I'm Jersey NY Metro area. crazy different things metro rural areas. resident two hospitals, one 5 minutes away 15 minutes away direction. roommate works different hospital that's 20 minutes away. think one two hospitals live within 30 minute drive.

They full COVID patients peak. cannot fathom scary going get rural areas. continue see rise cases country world wide riots get worse summer heatwaves draw people beaches river rafting. USA opened stuff soon lifted restrictions soon. over. testing less people according Train WreckTrump solution. cases remain showing up. Studies need larger, small study good useless since entirely possible sample shit. bothers much list states alphabetical order.

Get right. Younger population low life expectancy means less old people compared US Reasonable ask what? staff risk getting something like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome organ damage return working site things home anyway? library going way get everyone site, even departments fully functional shutdown, phone service staff set home. small portion. We're talking hundreds thousands millions people.

What disgustingly barbaric thought even suggest okay. super-smart-persons rationalize selfish fuckwittery reason leaving house FFP2 still feel safer work infectious patients, people like around. Wtf hinders waiting OTHERS passed isle?
Btw get beating day. well deserve it. anything adjusts number new reported cases increase testing? Hrm. possible drew wrong conclusion post, admittedly! ;-) Didn‚Äôt know ‚Äúkill grand parents‚Äù day France I'm glad China admits source virus. Yeah man, eye opening sure. tending Jades front unit walked by, said hi nothing ordinary. Healthy dude, spartan private. found bloated green corpse 3 days later medics estimated he'd dead ""around 72 hours.""

They also stressed PPE cops went investigate. told site ""pulmonary complications."" 


... hazmat team came exactly next day sci-fi lookin white coverall suits. unit across little 8-plex Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa? comment Germany. wife dance tango, lately community back yard. go one else using space. fair clear trades long time ago. can't pump dump please. Instead, know stock sold, make press releases leak good news day before.

Not really different saying though...   Face shields much situation, protect direct spray virus floating air float around face shield, masks would better situation. See convince students wear masks. counted ICU beds?   article countless others saying thing lying? source that? conspiracy speculation? sports cancelled, surprised NFL is, too. Masks part solution. going back was.

Large scale testing tracing also part solution. Plus social distancing working home needed.

We see next wave coming time respond. possible February. went Draper get supplies desk work stopped gas station parking lot shopping center. one gas station wearing mask (inside out) saw maybe 2 people 50 going stores wearing mask. restaurants/fast food places full saw one besides workers wearing mask. would almost idea pandemic there. It'll mess Texas. I'm Houston, almost everywhere go, I'm lucky find place many 50% people wear masks type. people walk around, go bars/clubs, shopping, etc. bringing kids, acting like virus never existed many store cashiers wear masks, employees floor don't. lot irresponsible, selfish, careless people Houston metro-area. Walmart even stopped wiping carts customers. reason Texas shooting numbers 5 weeks since state reopened. Next week, numbers shoot even higher due protests last couple weeks May. true extent. 

For me, issue structurally unprepared something like completely. bumbling around trying figure out, haha.

I think seeing contact tracing trending people said needed two months ago took long figure large enough scale country. So, cool first come app plan implement it. meantime, 75% country already got bored fearing virus opened country... like say, contact tracing pretty pointless. 

In words, ""borderline impossible trace"" now, collectively decided probably need trace thing anymore... scary enough. truly afraid enough virus enoguh contact trace back least two weeks every person tests positive order aim completely stopping spread best can, cannot also allow social gatherings pretty much everyone go everywhere again... basically constant situation regular ""random encounters people subject people"" daily basis. 

We would need locked nonessential work like weeks ago could count two hands people contacted outside norm weekly basis (for people). people started trying contact tracing.

&amp;#x200B;

So guess... maybe truly need contact tracing completely could be. maybe opened much US. honestly know. specific (possibly irrelevant) point made here, going take contact tracing seriously intended, also need aware go rally event 1,000s people could contributing spread virus need clear possible interactions test positive. 

&amp;#x200B;

If think trace thing... you. Everyone else is. know trying ignore first place. there's anything learned childhood "" ignore something like it'll go away"" far memorable ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

we made unfortunate mistake feeding viruses intent bully us Yes, know made wrong interpretation figured out. 

I‚Äôm saying title changed since ambiguous could read two different meanings.

I made edits clarify  Texas govonor speaking right now. Basically saying things ok state trend wise, begging people wear mask actually changing orders rules. Still 75% open restaurants requirement wear mask. sucks small portion lose lives, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth shutting society over. propose mass surveillance everyone possible terrorist attack? Sorry, life trade offs. Destruction aggregate months years lockdowns far surpass damage virus seriousness, thing still around say January 2022 (and assuming super bad mutation), think things would return normal except people would always need wear masks distance. Life put hold long, economies put hold long  protests seem actually imply that. beach goers could caught somewhere else. anything back up? That‚Äôs kind wild accusation. NY DOH used anti-body test created that, global semiconductor industry really Chinese control quite yet. Many electronics manufacturing partners trust vice-versa. need time afford try go alone without foreign partners. Striking Taiwan right would absurd mistake would cut tech transfer gravy train nobody China needs told that. taking Quercetin part Covid vitamin cocktail 2 months now. Medcram covered one point early days. cant live virtual sessions??

How whole country make uniform school platform??

Ugh I'm done USA needs break individual federations. Manageable chunks execute properly. wrong Florida right missed detail can't explain reason well. found explanation admit bit tell, app using WiFi Bluetooth (which would) added protections place limit exposure MAC address devices either randomizing giving something that's always actual MAC. app use need location data. Clearly neither problem important enough people work together solve. Yup. I‚Äôm agreement they‚Äôve got monitor crap super, super careful. Like said really takes one event shit hit fan. 

What I‚Äôm saying Northeast seem different outlook it, feel spread thing highly driven human behavior. AC reopen much smaller crowds start with, norm PPE well distancing casinos, hope cases kept minimum. It‚Äôs polar opposite approach fair, think that‚Äôs population seen bad get quickly that. got frickin slammed thing Feb/March such, we‚Äôre mostly seeing people taking seriously...utilizing masks instead politicizing high majority population wants way. 

100% still constantly keep guard up, that‚Äôs kind point phased reopenings. Making sure people abiding rules place, watching case numbers make sure they‚Äôre spiking reopening it‚Äôs going right direction holding back isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs tough one feel like right behavior population reopening responsibly see much higher success states aren‚Äôt right now. Fall scares I‚Äôm honest, country living proof we‚Äôve got super short term memories lol. things kept check summer needs stay way next season instead reverting back ‚Äúeverything normal, thing over!‚Äù. Stay safe FL, looks like shit show moment I‚Äôm hoping atleast aware alert protect madness. seem good head shoulders, keep using it. seems like would important information It‚Äôs Google? hospitals hit surge capacity, treating ICU patients non-icu rooms, see imperial county, san bernedino, nyc, montgomery, among others NYC tests literally people seek testing report positive.  


Asymptomatic likely tested reported anyway they're \*gasp\* fucking asymptomatic.  


jfc even understand reporting working Like, doctors one home ? always shitty steamroller little ball measure air. 

When going actual asthma doctor machine measures entire airflow point almost black 2 weeks quarantine could eradicate many viruses. bad people can‚Äôt patient think takes years. Spring break? almost summer lol wonder implications could outside stadiums masks mandated. much, though. signs hope new treatments, enough change alter mortality rate much. There's mostly effective drugs people getting virus vulnerable. sharks trying avoid virus...prudent Everyone needs play part. Everyone. 

Fuck man. WWII, woman working assembly lines making everything help war effort. Times incredibly tough around world everyone knew needed done. 

And people can‚Äôt put fucking mask stay home think rights taken away need haircut?

Somethings gotta give blame social media large part psychology today‚Äôs fucktards even normal people. serious underlying problem rural Idaho, similar places, went months lockdown virus hit them. virus come many want go back restrictions. Isn‚Äôt rapid test 50% accuracy? reverse? Patients regular floor receiving ICU care? don‚Äôt understand. lot people focusing young people, let‚Äôs clear *yourself* high risk group, probably protesting. 

I‚Äôm talking part article:

**How would advise individuals might considering attending protest evaluate risk COVID-19?**

It's really tricky, everybody weigh risks balances. think household elderly parents elderly relatives vulnerable, may seriously want consider steps take, [including getting] tested protest, quarantining away attended protest protect them. Thinking social network household structure important first step. putting risk, addition yourself, attend protest? then, course, taking many precautions can, research ahead time figure route take kinds things. organizations [leading protests] put pretty clear guidelines actual behavior protests around social distancing wearing masks on. much needless death &amp;#x200B;

Abstract:

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) represents emergent global threat straining worldwide healthcare capacity.

Ascorbic acid crucial vitamin necessary correct functioning immune system. plays role stress response shown promising results administered critically ill. Quercetin well-known flavonoid whose antiviral properties investigated numerous studies. evidence vitamin C quercetin co-administration exerts synergistic antiviral action due overlapping antiviral immunomodulatory properties capacity ascorbate recycle quercetin, increasing efficacy. Safe, cheap interventions sound biological rationale prioritized experimental use current context global health pandemic. present current evidence use vitamin C quercetin prophylaxis high-risk populations treatment COVID-19 patients adjunct promising pharmacological agents Remdesivir convalescent plasma. made wrong choices basically already proven. 

No - hasn't. opinion based hypothesis locked down, would dramatically decreased number deaths. 

By logic, could argue number deaths increased Italy, UK Spain *because* lockdowns. 

Both pure supposition. 

However, appear hoping - mortality rates increase Sweden - prove right wrong. Europe coming lockdown facing Covid Sweden done - without vaccine - probably careful wish for. Exactly. Without trendy names, ask person long generation is, they‚Äôll typically tell decade. 10 years. 

And that‚Äôs exactly name groups people. Thank sharing!!!   Zostavax shingles passed trial phase 51% effectiveness 5 years protection. bar lower think everyone stories hundred people fine recovered. Brother sister law covid 2 months ago, fine without issues. report scary stories things happen world; People still smoke even though know could get lung cancer, people still drive cars knowing could die crash people still go hiking/mountain climbing/swimming etc knowing dangers rare. relativity dangerous things covid obliviously scary, grand scheme things many us lose family member friend this. Even though we've reopened bit, people still careful. everyone, overall people taking pandemic lightly. time need Bing something, use google instead. antibody levels undetectable time, they're probably susceptible anyhow. This. Sorry, I‚Äôm meaning ‚Äúscare shitless.‚Äù think healthy level fear valid global pandemic - amount fear keeps following safety guidelines totally complacent. end day is, keep look especially family members high risk categories!

Stay safe want information have

Yes.

Someone asked frequently worst case scenario occurs. answer question SPECULATION worst case scenarios.

To point, would like questions asked answered information. know something, perhaps answer ""I know"", rather guess die droves figure out.

You're fear-monger, making doomsday shit catch slight whiff unknown.

I'd suggest step back edge, looks like already gone cliff fear, uncertainty, doubt, terror.

I'd like make something clear here. believe actively purposely spreading terror.

You terrorist. love much saw advertised Trump held campaign rally Tulsa, Okla, Saturday, reportedly brought 6,200 thousand attendees

6.2 million showed event? Wow idea trump kind popular number hoping for? funny election date would pick. might right audience comment.

I think politicize something like pandemic essential.

We need everyone understand success failure pandemic response almost entirely dependent politicians creating policies solve problem.

Whenever hear someone politicized something, usually means they're suggesting policy solutions systemic issues. Like gun control.

Regardless feel guns - people said politicize mass shootings - means they're using current event justify position.

We need eventually settle issues can't shy away politics. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nope. restaurants, churches, house parties. Use full face snorkel mask filter intake exhaust. like family get togethers. ever try talk politics mom says, time talk politics. I‚Äôm like is? Never seems answer.

Then get argument talk politics doesn‚Äôt really effect us? I‚Äôm like everything politics. air breath right politics. weren‚Äôt politics we‚Äôd still breathing lead emitted cars. reverse commonly true come back bite desantis ass. point supposed attend to? could take lots groups change rate. large part reason take precautions protect vulnerable, elderly immunocompromised. Everyone knows highest risk, point taking precautions?  AZ went shopping early morning beat crowds. Walmart. Maybe 50-50 wearing masks. However, noticed quite people wearing mask around neck. Like go effort bringing mask putting on, walk around store around neck. Why? 

What could public health messaging (I'm PH educator) might help people wear masks properly? get behavior change took get used bringing mask me. confront people directly store professional capacity share flyers/messaging part job. mods apply much nuance removing posts. something needs enough reports remove it. guess often certain people hit report button mind. Something could 100 upvotes 10 reports reports would win. Herd immunity come! sad places need get hit hard NYC (for people take things seriously).

And happen? think distrust government plays role, political party occupies white house taken strong, solid anti-science stance decided politicize precautions, meaning ""weak sympathizers"" side wear masks.

When politicize everything us/them choose side follow science evidence, get. read found good article, curious posted article anything new didn‚Äôt say anything negative.

It you. We've getting bullshit headlines several days people focusing statistics meaningless.

""German infection rate triples one day!"".

Yeah, went around 350 1100 one meat packing company, gets repeated suddenly people asking, Germany fucked up? enforcement mask 'mandate.' places masks minority.

The state whole plateaued now, bc Northern VA trends (later reopening) parts state reopened earlier trend up. everything become distorted. Rent home prices crazy; stocks bonds. Wages inflation adjusted stagnant decades. lot people truly can't afford save pittance. Then, pile materialism-consumerism general financial ignorance top that... That's system fucked ""get economy going again."" fact, that's system probably hosed anyway point, whether becomes technically political infeasible continue policies got us here. crazy think, right. Kids asking continued spread much long, answer is... people feel like wearing masks social distancing. Literally many want it. :/ Add two roll dice Yes, it‚Äôs victim blaming. kinda need that. Why? corporation going agree cut back advertising us dumbass choices. hope exist people barely affected advertising recognize giving messaging don‚Äôt need to. We‚Äôre browsing websites without ad blockers, watching commercials sound on, we‚Äôre yelling ‚ÄúOi, y‚Äôall, let‚Äôs boycott Subway; they‚Äôre shoving secret ads TV shows!‚Äù 

They‚Äôre going stop. to. we‚Äôre going stop message ‚Äúwell, it‚Äôs fault; cleverly manipulated.‚Äù No. choices making, letting consumer hook making choice put food face gonna anything except perpetuate existence victims. Bravo. Humanity fascinating Feds don‚Äôt supply 100% hospitals‚Äô PPE. States/private companies run hospitals source addition Feds pumped crisis phase. 

So 2 7 contracts canceled? 5 didn‚Äôt canceled. myopically focusing outlier bad cases ignoring good done Task Force. could help explain it.  Anecdotally act stupid, fail. surprise, I‚Äôm expecting thing ramp tear like crazy end year. retire well her.

ftfy Nurse here. reminder virus fatal people mean affect people. I've seen plenty young patients strokes, long traumatic stays inubated ICU, severe lung damage. patients survived covid lives never take months acute inpatient rehabilitation. Mom? two graphs showing Houston area. Houston one part Texas. someone could order everyone wear mask... lie/falsehood. pay decent wage, Americans job. raids Koch Foods plant Mississippi hundreds Americans went jobs fair look Interesting popped I'm VA way things I've considering moving back folks. home old 1978 4 acres tucked back near prime hunting areas. 

If things turn around soon I'll list see happens. I'd happen break even. ‚ÄúDumbass‚Äù?... hope never hit hospital... ‚Äúdumbass‚Äù may save life. Even testing capacity takes labs turn around results. still often delay 48 hours more. 

I know Texas many hospitals Arizona desperately trying recruit additional staff state right. Actually ICU/hospital beds bottleneck, staff care people them.  Nah, larger metro hospitals already shipping sponge rural areas always near full capacity.

My urban Medical ICU mostly received either train wreck cases rural docs final gave towel care newly resuscitated dead hospital.

As ER RN COVID, mostly hung onto boarded critical ICU patients upstairs flooded maxxed medical systems vents' available. 

Since March, state we've built overall capacity convention center hotel field hospitals. Basic shit (oxygen, beds, care staff, etc) added 2k beds.

If states done cuz, well, COVID liberal plot... well then, they're gonna cause huge over-saturation already scarce resources top can't decompressed urban transfers it'll swamp sink systems. need lash hurt feelings. thought Amazon still selling individuals.

For awhile, selling certain products hospitals. Nah, convincing I've heard LOT firsthand Swedish HCWs critical groups. article, saying saying fits first hand accounts I've heard elsewhere. 

But apparently think Swedish healthcare workers credible guess. Us government handed two trillion dollars people mostly didn‚Äôt need couldn‚Äôt spend - surprise here.

That 2 trillion CARES act go wasteful fraudulent government program ever. least increased savings rate! worries, know test iffy. really feel like there's much gaslighting. sure even care read crap part safe. Drives nuts. safe, thanks information! places like NYC seroprevalence studies showing 25% infected may actually 50%+ well way herd immunity?

Would explain fact tiny new case count compared somewhere like California people distanced sooner.

This also means mortality rate likely lower it‚Äôs infectious previously thought. one wonder long take negative number ICU beds available they're required start reporting patients need intensive care. Undocumented? mean illegal immigrants.. Yeah, months. deep nasal swab procedure that's used collect samples active COVID infections throughout USA world. easy verify following link r/elcuervo posted.

[http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Mayor/COVID-19%20Testing/20200612%20COVID-19%20Guidance%20what%20to%20expect.pdf](http://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/Mayor/COVID-19%20Testing/20200612%20COVID-19%20Guidance%20what%20to%20expect.pdf)

""How collect sample

1. take sample, medical staff ask tilt head back 70 degrees. insert swab deep one nostrils collect sample. held place rotated collect sample.
2. staff prepare sample processing.
3. hand form QR code it""

Of course that's sampling part, give details test kit. don‚Äôt plan. going give try play coaches parents get sick die. Take look mirror accept fucking blinded media shit fucks.

You answer hard questions. That's ok. Continue gulping dosage media want people die. right one times! also mostly early 20s people protests there's going lot asymptomatic carriers. random tests, going see many hospitalizations protestors long enough contagious, transfer it, secondary people (parents, grandparents, store workers, etc.) progress far enough. 

 3 weeks expect able see now. Canadians still fly part US vacation long they'd like, get panic this. Americans can't come quarantine Canada Canadians fly florida, arizona, cali, nyc, etc quarantine, go fun, fly home. 

Your cases skyrocketed either -- new thing. guys always allowed here, long drive. still visit family, go funerals, get married, etc run across border groceries. Alaska booming tourism industry wealthy people like brag roughing Alaska.

Fishing tours, cabins rent, even big game hunting. actually believe this? We‚Äôre talking trained soldiers full body armor enforcing cartels carrying advanced weaponry citizen going go toe toe person armed handgun zero training that‚Äôs going decrease violence? make sense? Massachusetts, study nurse worked ICU 12 years pretty much tell anybody needs intensive level care ICU nobody else. dumbass. Yup.    
Apparently positive negative matter negative small calculate IDK which.   

Percentage people blood type   
1	O positive	38.67   
2	A positive	27.42   
3	B positive	22.02   
4	AB pos	5.88   
5	O negative	2.55   
6	A negative	1.99    
7	B negative	1.11   
8	AB neg   0.36   

So think saying percentage peeps CV Type is:   
A + 45% 27.42 + 12.33 = 39.75%    
OR (27.42+1.99) +45% = 42.64% 

Type B &amp; AB follow general population percentage within statistical norms type O's represented number 30% range possibly. Yes, people totally downplaying handing masks constantly reminding people social distance them.

Yup, totally deserve scrutiny vs people wanna go bar fucking get wasted refuse wear mask -verifiable- cases associated it. Yeah mentioned land vs. air &amp; water travel. still mean much like international travel US bad. Yeah got COVID originally another country, basically everywhere else, too. We're bad jack shit stop it. Great point, expect low enough positivity that. False negatives even bigger problem though. That's better position using stupid comparisons score political points still lean towards position. Without vaccine herd immunity, way ""suppress"" virus drastically alter way life end slows inevitable. 

Take New Zealand example. touted shining example eradicating virus last unless social distance forever complete isolate country rest world seem realistic me. Interesting, 37 people nearly enough sample size determine widespread is. Also, know conditions appearing result respiratory infections? normal thing happens result cough goes away time? raises Calcium high parathyroid tumors. surgery delayed pandemic. Thank. You. guy know ""IC"" means? JFC Philadelphia here. see people wear masks absolutely necessary. regard people unless store strict policy. It‚Äôs outrageous. can‚Äôt read Chinese. can‚Äôt read Italian. you‚Äôve participating discussion 11 days. uninformed opinion useless. I've suspected would interesting know sure. True, also something mitigated wearing mask taking unmasked group selfies... nurse here. sore throat cough direct exposure likely exposed. antibody test high rate false negatives. caring Covid patients direct.contact daily 12 hour shifts since March test also negative. found hard believe. Y'mean epidemiologists, virologists, disaster management specialists, myriad professionals ignored? one hand kind reasonable. icus operate pretty much full everyone needs there. run relatively empty floor patients overflowed there.

Currently there's likely cohorting covid patients icus.

So icu beds used always accurate critically ill patients. seems like non mask wearers don‚Äôt understand severity decided go normally. Really Really Intensive Care Unit Really Really Sick People Feel Good Need Really Really Intensive Care. Take meds, dangers covid real, second wave begun people like deny presence danger spite experts medical professionals saying. Fuck selfish cunt dad One reason might show confirmed suspected sometimes take while, 3-7 days, get test results back. personal experience another state, YMMV. also previous articles false negative rates PCR tests could high 25% (but really want get digging data). Yeah know. That's meant Australia international land borders. way people come boat plane, I'm sure methods easier track. reason think that's stupid explanation Australia better US 1) originally got COVID Europe China, Mexico Canada, 2) community spread domestic travel WAY problem international travel, regardless whether land, water, sky. 

So agreeing you. I'm saying plausible reason could think would relate Australia island lower COVID caseload would due lack international land travel. followed ""I think that's stupid argument"" there's way explains US bad. see around people care anymore, why. Tr*mp beat Cli*ton wealthy educated votes.

Media classist pattern depicting red voters uneducated poor Tr*mp appealing businesses donor agenda. None actually criminal codes, thus actual crimes (of course ""crimes"" morally speaking) Gee, Greg, wonder why.  get killed police once. drove bunch restaurants using curbside seating saw 50 people eating talking around tables within area maybe 40ft 20ft outside. Really enough space safe all, complying regulations, seems like regulations go nearly far enough.

If enforced first quarantine instead making merely suggestion, world's number one covid capital. I've never liked KSL, man they're bad job virus. Yes they're posting articles numbers super sly talking almost unnoticeable ways. Saturday's record numbers included headline basically ""No deaths cases"". times seem bury information update information timely manner. recommended sources state? got difference susceptibility intensity illness, regardless novelty virus. Otherwise New York City sick. I‚Äôm looking forward learning more. Lol... okay bud... One day you‚Äôll learn ‚Äúhigh schoolers‚Äù pass virus onto parents... take work... increases spread... meaning hospitals overrun people high risk greater chance exposed.

It‚Äôs big guy. combo attacks thinking Florida man whipping Burmese python. exact words used posted social media. Well, less colorful ones, anyway. Asian standards? arent handful Asian countries better Korea. headline guy's comment misleading. People read think Korea huge explosion cases, reality 11 domestic cases yesterday, averaging like 30 domestic cases past weeks. I‚Äôll tell what, available vaccine less year I‚Äôll apologize virus capability return often it‚Äôs circulated like cold don‚Äôt want believe enjoy multiple bouts it. won‚Äôt apologizing I‚Äôll try avoid infection.  lol would define wave?  like every time crisis state. gives shit? can't tell someone can't go enjoy live important them. That's problem entirely. 

Don't go sick, scared getting sick stay home someone live you. think asymptomatic, wearing mask shit coughing already. 

Tell me, EVERY SINGLE PROJECTION 50 STATES UNITED STATES WRONG? WANT SEE PEOPLE DIE say right. say ventilators going shortage everyone die. single ventilator storage USA? many bitched moaned president direct manufacturing centers demand build pointless fucking ventilators needed? ""mobile hospitals"" corps put plans build never utilized? 

Why entire world ended mass protests already multiplied Covid numbers beyond anything ever scene before?

Take look mirror accept fucking blinded media shit fucks. Look yourself. Go MN dept health website.  demonstrations caused spike, think showed now. belief bubble really hard break read opposing opinions.

I know really hard, takes conscious effort. 

A principle reasoned debate able argue sides. can't, perspective biased opinion compromised. 

The informed, well-reasoned, defensible conclusion must tempered able contribute discussions whether reddit, Fox News, MSNBC. 

If exposure one sources nothing anger capable civil discourse them. can't civil discourse them, condemn responding perspective anger instead logic? 

I'll give hard first. like learning coping mechanisms anything depression ADD. even painful first. learn people coming least see humanity. like able empathize people, even think they're willfully ignorant dangerous they're still human beings. Hope that's ray gun he's holding, ZAP can‚Äôt even read said. 

I said 10% small town. Maybe 1 10 could happen virus hit really bad there. 

20% confirmed diagnosis died - yes several places went high days ran beds. 

If 50% town infected would lead 10% town death rate. McAvoey yeah part/speech really great. .....and carrying around spreading people get sick die. Real responsible. boss moving 'they require masks, they're fine!' What's apathetic? opposite apathy. Apathy pretending keep running bar pandemic. CDC, WHO, Surgeon General, Dr. Fauci, random doctor experts CNN, etc. 

Pretty much everyone supposed know telling us masks work normal people (they get dirty since many make touch face!) wear them. Yeah, figured case. like, again, I'm protests (looting that, see core level people that, I'm fan it) people crazy aware denying would add cases. stupid good lockdown. You, too, friend! hope (but doubt) hospitals required link daily list patients ""in ICU bed needing intensive care"" billing department, poor patients charged level care required. done automatically transparently, slew lawsuits would order. worst part is, second wave begun. still first wave!  gives shit? can't tell someone can't go enjoy live important them. That's problem entirely. 

You dad responding like anything materially affects life enjoyment it, people asking wear masks whenever close contact others. freedom live life, that's even giving half shit health health people around go sick, scared getting sick stay home someone live you. think asymptomatic, wearing mask shit coughing already. 

Wearing mask still matters, since spread germs without coughing top people going coughing without masks me, EVERY SINGLE PROJECTION 50 STATES UNITED STATES WRONG? WANT SEE PEOPLE DIE say right. say ventilators going shortage everyone die. single ventilator storage USA? many bitched moaned president direct manufacturing centers demand build pointless fucking ventilators needed? ""mobile hospitals"" corps put plans build never utilized? 

Because lockdown worked. still get worse, Covid far entire world ended mass protests already multiplied Covid numbers beyond anything ever scene before?

The protests mostly outside, people wore masks, amount people close contact still dwarfed comparison amount people suddenly going every day nothing ever happened. States tend overreact risks large metro areas completely ignore actual problems rural America cares town gets mostly eradicated COVID-19. small town. virus doesn‚Äôt free float though; travels larger particles. **guarantee** million people **could** wind dead.
 
I think get saying, could literally guarantee anything *could* happen. statement really mean anything. words, said absolutely nothing meaningful. Good gravy! Maryland nearly 3 months go in, get nose swabbed, 36 hours result!

What deal, Arizona? know dollars Maryland able get stuff together test everyone wants tested! Italian region Lombardia [about 6000 people died covid-19 population 10 million people. That's 0.06% *population* dead. must gotten covid 1¬Ω times get many fatalities.

Or, know, 0.04% number 10 times small. source this? I‚Äôve seen anecdotal reports, data must dumber doomers think America pollutes ocean. That‚Äôs long time stay lol Let's see many people die. willing say 1% It‚Äôs totally okay frustrated that. set boundary sounds like lied you, huge violation trust, okay! 

However, keep mind virus proven little effect children. Less 100 children died covid-19, almost underlying heath conditions. children contract virus symptoms mild symptoms. 80% deaths individuals aged 70. virus overwhelmingly disproportionately affects elderly underlying health conditions.

So reasons staying isolated keep daughter safe - 100% right family must respect choices - would encourage maybe consider costs compared risks. also baby couple months older understand urge take every precaution keep safe - PPA trust one!! also think it‚Äôs important remember life risk free must assume risk order maintain kind quality life. far covid concerned baby higher risk dying car accident way visit family would catching experience serious symptoms covid-19 arrive. Lots states starting open things back you‚Äôre going healthy might consider starting try reintegrate society bit. Covid isn‚Äôt going anywhere it‚Äôs right stay isolated long feel need stay safe - point ask risks outweigh cost living like that.  think really big factor actually. 100,000 tests completed June 16th May 16th number cases stayed same. 

That said, numbers arent going theres currently spike many Southern states underway. really believe mask usage determining factor here? lack social distancing events like protests? really new kind must-see-tv fall preview! Understood. Stay safe friend. pass tyrants gonna tyrant. went stage today added absolutely viable information solution. He‚Äôs keeping true ‚Äúeverything must open. Wash hands. It‚Äôs fault‚Äù mentality. 

He still thinks enough hospital beds Texas even though it‚Äôs obvious may end next month rate. He‚Äôs job protect us, financial assets would think would already done so. Wishing didn‚Äôt live Texas rn Yes that‚Äôs right, 100% infection rate. Yes it‚Äôs friend. I‚Äôve never I‚Äôm really excited visit. understand need postpone 3rd time. 

I feel bad one thing another. Bachelorette party postponed, bridal shower canceled, 30th birthday quarantine, wedding postponed, bachelorette postponed again, MOH pregnant won‚Äôt able make wedding new bachelorette party date due date. think we're dealing lot want try nicer people it.

But encounter stupid people hard. crossover Ash ‚ÄúEvil Dead‚Äù franchises? chainsaw attachment. never said US handling well article fearmongering pretty hard I'm worried well, roommate essential workers, immunocompromised.

The US overinflated military budget. feed everyone 3 weeks would take lockdown knock virus out. don‚Äôt want consider obviously calling genius sarcastically. 12? think that‚Äôs clever? sub related America? 12 states lol I'd venture statistic need wait 12 months longer much validity across Covid-affected countries.

We oz managed initial outbreak ok (after letting dozens plague rats cruise ships !!!) community transmission limited overall.

This unlike USA / UK etc virus (and is) prevalent many areas.

There enough reason believe whole aids pandemic spread among Africa Ebola virus well Lyme diseases tested home soil north u.s.a. states really believe virus naturally made pandemic. Yes conspiracy nut, also believe natural cause. There's way science reason given public, records made CDC actually using ticks see Lyme's diseases spread delivered public. see reason listen Corona virus initially created spread bat species city wide spread delivery food resources also next door CDC related facility. Furthermore one person area suggested released virus also murdered whistleblower furthers suspicions. 

I know truth neither general public, know told suggest public regurgitate news, root sources make claim truth. seems alot deeper ""facts"" ""data"" easily manipulated television stance I.m.o.o. wanna say.

I've really disappointed experts failed discuss pandemic way help laypeople understand data they're seeing (prime example said ""no evidence"" immunity). sub definitely endless echo worst possible interpretations data, too. many per population probably bad numbers alone, might one worst public hospital system latin america, we're still screwed really know although say parents husband's parents definitely going lot are, early 60s. They're masks hand sanitizer distancing all, still. side protesting, would said they're fools blame corona resurgence. incredible biased people be. head Florida Chamber Commerce said Florida model opening up.

Other states definitely studying it, that's sure. Legitimate, honest God question. whole flattening curve thing never supposed reduce total number cases, right? supposed prevent medical infrastructure overwhelmed spreading number cases longer period time. never overwhelmed we? still aren‚Äôt right? 	So told beginning long medical system wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed, number people would catch virus even die total, whether medium height curve short period time really short curve long time. theory/approach virus still valid? course it‚Äôs absolutely terrible many people US died, based understanding outlined above, always going lose many lives matter cautious (as long didn‚Äôt overwhelm medical resources case would more, haven‚Äôt done right?). 

I‚Äôm trying educate fill gaps knowledge. Thanks. likely already 20 million. 2 million CONFIRMED cases. Based 0.7% fatality rate, take number deaths far reverse math. MANY MANY cases already. I‚Äôve paying attention politics 3 months last 30 years life... I‚Äôve never unhappy. Enough enough. I‚Äôm going back rock. Ignorance bliss. Good luck stay safe, people.

New York pretty fucking overwhelmed... spiking fuck place now. ok, probably right, armchair scientist. Thanks this.

 Interesting daily cases graph really axis labeled help numbers every two weeks June, there's numbers June 1 June 15. click bars order see numbers are.

Looks... good. AMERICA #1!!!! ‚ú®üéâüéäüéâüéâüéâüéâüéäüéâ Prepare liftoff. far likely simply found volunteers willing socially distance, rather actively infecting them. True  People used die lot earlier. use move aging parents home move helped child care couldn't... folks local church took care died lived home death much younger age. Even lowly UTI's often fatal due kidney failure. flu would sweep countryside mom/dad would die. Nutrition, food, medicine advanced folks simply didnt live long, percentage folks making 80's extremely small. 

Mother law suites still pretty common south, mostly used offices she-sheds man caves bathrooms. 

The average run mill nursing home charging insurance $15k-$25k month basically hand meds bathe weekly lucky monthly not. 

Long term care insurance option, I'm extremely familiar it. know there's good choice, fair choice financially responsible choice.

I'd rather enjoy life suffer it. Several experts suggested new findings necessarily mean people infected second time, given even low levels powerful neutralizing antibodies may still protective, immune system‚Äôs cells B cells. deeply apologize. wish contacts messing zone.

But spread forest, trying let spread fast, wait moment trees could burnt. hospitalizations deaths trail positives, one gaslighting bullshiting anything No, run beds took measures mitigate virus outbreak. still change fact hospitals beds never ran out. showed NYC managed outbreak succeeded goal allowing hospitals collapsed. Still good Central FL well excuses rolodex guys go till one sticks? Meanwhile Florida resident get deal vacationers governor hoping get herd immunity doctor nurses back march april US. got called sorts names, liars, fakes, betrayers, go back china etc ....

doctors nurses dont deserve that. Seasonal effects necessarily correspond temperature. There's also UV-intensity, humidity, pollen counts (which speculated major component seasonal differences contagion illnesses), factors may even know about. 

Seasonal effects exist observed correlation, causal mechanisms still fully understood many seasonal illnesses. Exactly. vast majority protestors (the age current workforce), can‚Äôt completely open everything keep risk quarantined. Let healthy go back.

Common logic seems fly head want tarnish whole population brush. One problem would consider enough staffing. matter many beds have. staffing that's really gets overwhelming medical staff front line. heard NY really bad even use field hospitals. still seen lot deaths. also know treat better would expect us able keep deaths down. think vulnerable point still protected quite bit. find way keep following guidelines everyone get board masks surprised get going back right direction. Except Florida, test positive rate climbing despite testing remaining constant slightly downward EU Europe. People keep forgetting polarity earth‚Äôs magnetosphere changing super rapidly weirdly. There‚Äôs sort weird eddy flow developed planets molten core. may result almost effect, effect satellites navigation, wipeout modern civilization literal death life earth lack magnetism exposes us radiation unprotected. 

Enjoy. So... speed limits US? Except US still lowest cases per million people. Data manipulation finest people. Watch lie pass politics. Common Sense: CDC clearly political point, let‚Äôs look counties success do! Oh, they‚Äôre wearing masks? costs almost nothing almost everyone it? Maybe try this? Lol... pitty you. Hes covering ass know it. Hes bad 45 Europe better testing know numbers going apples apples... Thank understand people learnt already. many people got sick died already, obvious methods lower risk. still it.

If flu would fine. Flu going lasting damage, flu much lower mortality rate.

What's got sick probably spread people. Selfish C. CA, governor made masks mandatory. one local sheriff, conservative rural counties, already publicly declared enforce mask wearing. Presumably elected officials, think gain votes way.

Throughout whole pandemic United States shown little correlation positive cases deaths. Seriously situation Southern United States affiliate Western World treats elders way? take parents home, reserving care homes really sick ones (that need professional care 24/7) like peoples do? Yet Walmart‚Äôs state still allowing people without masks. I‚Äôm NY every business I‚Äôve entered there‚Äôs someone without mask. Usually multiple people.

The goal always flatten curve, squash it. We‚Äôre making go one idea right thing do. Oh yeah. Sorry, mean imply Covid, colchicine inhibition alpha defensin part interesting me. Yes. understand wearing mask. Breathing comfortable. fuck people don‚Äôt keep 2m distance.

And people even hold hands, like WTF. many people parks. I‚Äôm like duuuude. Don‚Äôt don‚Äôt that.

We humans kinda fucked. government said ‚Äúyoink‚Äù Americans suddenly deeply passionate something government one telling can/can't it. Government says wear masks? Suddenly care DEEPLY feeling fabric touching cheeks, makes uncomfy government right. Can't graduation ceremony? Well, fuck them, want kids pack close possible say fuck government. 

It's also surprising LA. corona story socal vs NorCal different. mean, duh, right? anyone even resisting this? ""Let's break school study library instead lame Zoom thing!"" 

""Yeah! Fuck system!"" ok. way awhile places seen surge. Remember ozarks Missouri--those vids pics went viral? According NYT website, new cases reported last two weeks. 3 deplorables walk bar? whats alternative? Stunting kids development phase years. Possibly causing long term psychological problems dont understand whats going on?

Schools going reopen, needs planned, isolated classes, masks etc. However going years without social contact developing minds really, really fuck life. Came say Pay wall. what? /s Oh yeah. Sorry, mean imply Covid, colchicine inhibition alpha defensin part interesting me. Yup since New York pealed it‚Äôs trending down. 

I suspect risk population centers (nursing homes etc) really cracked refined isolationist policies. 

I know suburbs Dallas huge spike nursing home infections April don‚Äôt see reported. mean long it‚Äôs young yippur snappers getting showing mild symptoms think good.

Not mention, think treatment progressed point aren‚Äôt throwing everyone ventilator. luckily, one two people can't ruin everyone. Assuming masks help (which clear, data leaning way), even 75% people wearing correctly indoors close together, that's big help. essential workers wearing N-95 similar masks, that's big help. Even many people still occasionally breaking social distancing rules going houses friends family, that's still going cut lot people regularly hanging going work events bars together. 

If everyone perfect, things would even better. half-assing actually huge positive impact. Today ran friend girlfriend, GF daughter wearing masks walking park could play. wearing masks, swear giving look like weird one.

messed thing actually made feel uncomfortable, embarrassed. Bingo! Even everyone somehow could afford it, would instantly supply demand issue like everything else Covid creates. Yes, know. That‚Äôs said surge. needed stop surge. numbers low.

Do trouble reading charts graphs? 18 cases ""wave"" wonder would call countries? lol People dumb bet. literally flabbergasted dad saying, ""I know carb is"" Diabetes Type 2 btw. Actually, arrogant assholes like wishing death upon others what‚Äôs really tiring right now. though amazzzing discovery!! Let us take heed (without political bias) practice! getting numbers? CDC shows 678 deaths yesterday, 608 today. 298 deaths recorded June 15th. hope still able travel. travel London two weeks board repatriation flight current home country. really hope UK doesn‚Äôt start banning Americans transiting airport. don‚Äôt understand virus well enough know gets weaker. 

the cases young people surprising. hospitalization rates though many states currently experiencing outbreak.

the folks virus greater chance spread someone susceptible it. People it, can't it.

It could done. People selfish, won't. 

It's shame really. work Spanish border near La Jonquera amount tourists saw today border opening making worried summer. seen anything confirming yet, apparently cutting board market china used cut salmon tested positive it.

It‚Äôs getting people actually follow them. Get heads butts. Realize COVID-19 isn‚Äôt going anywhere, anytime soon. idiots cause many deaths country.  So, remembering correctly, makes UK, US, India Egypt signing Oxford vaccine (Brazil, I'm guessing since Phase 3 trial there, heard anything purchasing) flew back US yesterday (spending last year England been... Interesting.) CDC came plane announced ""Because coming country corona virus outbreak, required self isolate."" wanted laugh point outbreak bigger one left. really expect everyone buy whole pigs carve themselves? don‚Äôt think even enough entire animal carcasses available purchase widespread option. time ready could 50,000 month. Now- decent facility upwards 10,000 month, depending located. apparently Spain, France, Belgium UK either, higher total number excess deaths compared previous years, reliable way measure since count covid cases mortalities differently. Damn Sunday? Anyone wanna bet beat high score tomorrow?  outbreaks keep happening meat food processing plants... shut contain outbreak... Supply disrupted right? Meat fresh produce time supply chains.

Good chance we'll see empty supermarket shelves point. media frenzy. lead fear driven stockpiling. UK still count Europe? Japan, almost comical predictable Sunday dip. NL

Former teacher here. lucky relatively unlimited copy budget (they tracked it, never ran copies...though leaving, rumors limiting amount paper allotted department making teachers make difference pockets). 

Other photocopies furniture classroom, everything else supplied me. bought paperclips, staples, pens, pencils, highlighters, post notes, cleaning supplies. offered high school students extra credit bringing tissue boxes hand sanitizer (I could go box tissues DAY, sometimes two cold flu season, way could stock classroom). purchased colored pencils, glue sticks, scissors, staplers students use case didn‚Äôt own. 

If student didn‚Äôt money buy recommended supplies class (a notebook loose leaf choosing notes number 2 pencils tests), would happily bought students (I messaged sensitive way never anyone take it). 

Orphaned pencils class became community pencils could use forgot day. 

My best friend teacher buys folders students every year - 150+ - everyone folder notes system. 

I work private sector job supplies office crap know - mostly paperless company. It‚Äôs insane. 

These supplies don‚Äôt cost much, school budgets thin can‚Äôt afford provide them. can‚Äôt even pay teachers they‚Äôre worth; would able supply tissue boxes? clear higher alpha defensin cause worse outcomes, worse outcomes cause high levels alpha defensin. definitely noticed. week two plan used cash $0.02 cent transactions debit $0.03 cent could save money.

And realized meaningless $0.02 cents is. ‚ÄòOnce summer here, go here‚Äô - Covidiot, 2020 summer solsticez PPP runs soon. Like us, thru first yet. NY, it‚Äôs money. lives dont think trump prepared goddamn thing life.

Whats gonna do? claim already beaten 2nd wave?...You know exactly fuck orange jackass gonna do. Stay strong. right thing see it. It‚Äôs easy follow everyone else. what‚Äôs hard, what‚Äôs right. you‚Äôd hope others would do. clearly good person. alone. recently Beijing small outbreak due import frozen salmon. 
it clear virus survive long period frozen meat always cold, wet aviod sunlight. labs always using conditions store virus. fellow US citizen, pride left? There's single thing better countries eith similar governments. like 10 weekends late president trying ensure health care workers get another patriotic flyby. 

Dont tell saluting healthcare workers military. 

Just another liberal hit job glorious leader. /s hell? Colchicine? I.E. gout drug father died took off?

Holy blipping bleep... read this, think people treating father coughing lungs rehab center idiots.

They took colchicine, saying ""It's damaging kidneys!""

I wonder CoVid nearly 2 months due transplant medications keeping totally killing body taking colchicine allowed run wild body.

Because know dad high level alpha defensin stuff, liver doctor made note records.  What's sad people wear masks, probably small percentage possibly roughly equal wear here. 

I got groceries last week, 15% mask use. Hundreds?! Holy shit. bad, bad news. 
To think knee great country like USA situation 50 million unemployed within last 4 months, massive Protests, government truly
Fucked every single person, expect 1%. 

A great time revolution, now. import karens TBH Italy always really bizarre p0pulist leanings, surprise kind opposition emerged Yep, babies going born next year stopped testing pregnancies. choose work there. trust anything Iran's statistics, really weird whole time, autocratic regime tries avoid losing face means motive lie. 

There examples though. Florida example. Well, either fake, completely deny reality legitimate advice/information experts give. recently mentioned somewhere else within group people talk to, people still getting sick, symptoms, testing positive. Despite numbers reported completely stagnant (might confirmation bias, talk decent chunk consider ""higher risk"" individuals). said, got response basically saying ""What, heard anything, talking about"". Well course haven't, likely talk different people...

On top that, got people vehemently jump 2-3 stagnation say ""It's flattening"", absolves risk possibility another outbreak, despite us seeing pattern multiple states countries. mention many people see know careful, wearing masks they're shopping something. Many people cookouts (roommate holding one speak...), partying, hanging friends, etc. shame, we're relatively ""better"" state, one ones seemingly taking seriously. 

I know, think lot people like admitting possibility real life repercussions another outbreak somewhere else, current one continuing, convince there's absolutely problem last possible moment late. mean, right what.. 6-8 states currently jumping infections, obviously going slow take recommended procedures, people actually listen.

It's shame, people admit train coming bearing them, anything convince ""everything okay"". CDC would picked pneumonia like Wuhan.  Probably, really depends designed. states like Texas ""full back school suggestion masks"" plans moronic.

However others planning design school plans dividing kids 9-12 kid cohorts keeping completely separated one another throughout entire school day someone cohort gets infected spread contained within cohort.  It‚Äôs pass buck type situation. 

I saw thing early job (hotel) back job. 

When shut breakfast pool fitness center, guests kept asking why.

Instead employees even managers saying ‚Äòbecause we‚Äôre pandemic‚Äô it‚Äôs ‚Äòthe safe thing do‚Äô; hell could even said ‚Äòit‚Äôs company policy‚Äô instead said it‚Äôs governors orders. 

Easier make someone else bad guy answer tough questions take hard stance. good alternative would commercial airports go bankrupt, owners investors get big bailout Federal Reserve US Treasury. get mad, I'm suggesting feasible alternative! evidence Covid care much money famous are. spottily trying meditation techniques. Honestly, listening 90s music replaying video games youth therapeutic. know nostalgia trap, stay long. Yes. overreaction response kills people virus itself.

I‚Äôm glad page. Exactly. Right closest large-ish town us (less 20 minutes) highest percentage cases per capita country last week. hardly stand even claim due ignorance misinformation. don‚Äôt remember fully tbh (see 20 years since graduated), maybe individuals money burn. definitely excess people seemed like hearing talk even though basically saying thing. anything? confirm. Also bread makers. I'm shade green. Nunes country? Health insurance cost tied bottom line for-profit company. tied cost healthcare adequate pay professionals. Glad expert said it, cause math hard. (I 7m 8m 8 days) yeah, scary. say pulse : ), wife mentioned big rant one vloggers watches, told story days ago.

I'm saying trying ignore shit that's going cause 2nd wave ignorant. Soon Brazil surpass USA terms number deaths mid-July Brazil‚Äôs COVID-19 deaths doubled. Man ages badly We've 'most new cases ever' days least weeks now. Deaths trending downward. 

That said, still sheltering place exception work (essential industry) hope mask-wearing becomes non-issue actually clear. think headlines call re-institute lockdown. countries able mostly suppress Covid-19 (especially early Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, etc), since develop herd immunity like heavily impacted countries, happen open borders again? weird position can‚Äôt really open fear outbreak? Would stay isolated world? Heres thing- OC people *rich* *red*. 
Whereas Angelenos mostly broke, even care social distancing many still working unsafe job. OC people afford ait couches 4 mos...

Ya know, anybody interested talking actual public health policy.

This still theoretically non pol tab. Us Canada Italy sent lots faulty PPE tests well . There‚Äôs studies showing slightly effective. buy little time reduce little transmission don‚Äôt much all.

Wearing mask curtailing freedom, banning gay marriage cool upsets misinterpreted 2000 year old fairy tale back belief. Virus doesnt care ""most"" Korea proved that. Allowing riots social distance protesting massive mistake, controlling spread distorting peoples optics danger spread.

Watching people massively pretend pandemic rally shoulder shoulder streets quite insane telling America's mental state.

Ehhhhhh Since first italian doctor say assume factual evidence patients less severe symptoms 3 months ago.

BUT.

One thing saying patients coming average better clinical situation another thing pushing theory virus less strong scientific evidence support claim.

That dangerous people might take less precautions.

What instead virus much aggressive use masks, social distancing, testing + early detection people exposed reduced viral load general time hospitalization better position treated?

Potentially. general recommendations wearing mask public contribute meaningful way? Earlier studies comparable respiratory infections either shown effect little effect low evidence. done quite few. effect meaningful, would probably shown itself.

The vast majority cases Wuhan. let's say half - 86 cases per day. Wuhan, actually 1 129,000 people, nowhere near 1 8 million.

1 129,000 seem like huge odds, Wuhan government admitted 5 million people left Wuhan lockdown.

Wuhan also major transportation industrial 300 world‚Äôs top 500 companies presence city, including Microsoft, German-based software company SAP French car manufacturer Groupe PSA. 

Business travelers 300 top companies alone could account much exportation virus.

But let's mention that... RAND sure hell want bring ""globalisation"" spotlight. Thats good they'd even worse US already are.

Lolll knew handlebar (Houston) would blow it, like way gunna follow rules. 40% COVID deaths come nursing homes ‚Üí 20,000 deaths avoidable. 

Numbers lie. Cuomo does. 

He violated protocol &amp; forced COVID patients nursing homes‚Äînow he's trying cover horrific outcome. 

He must held accountable. one day crash burn, yet. Right now, americans well trained begging go die profit rich further. mindset loses, going get worse.

Probably also system unemployed really without means almost anything: home, food, name it.

Social security enables labor rights, among stuff, workers face unemployment time without life endangering poverty.

One reason big fan UBI whish it. kinds lung exercises doing? Natural selection!

I'm saying context, saying since started ... time strongest come civilised common sensed people. agree clear.  Calling experiment pretty dumb underlying virus causes COVID-19 SARS-CoV-2... named genetic similarity predecessor, SARS-CoV. reinfection studies SARS-CoV (in ferrets, general compatibility respiratory systems, inability ethically induce reinfection humans.)

They found SARS-CoV absolutely reinfect *but* characteristics reinfection, 30 days mark display resistance. detectable viral loads (and antibody response,) characteristic differences degree inflammation characterizes damaging pathology SARS.

That's say degree resistance cannot lessen time, immune system's resistance characteristics change SARS-CoV-2, simple taking anecdotes saying COVID-19 provide immunity. degrees resistance, might enough mean COVID-19 significant health risk IgG antibodies. I‚Äôve socially distancing wearing masks drive public see restaurants bars full people masks. many people don‚Äôt bother find happening pandemic killing well 100k people country? Seriously?

Also medic. antilock folks wanted nail salons applebees open, folks emboldened stupidity ignorance german states degree autonomy coronavirus response american states though many people would died taken extreme measures control spread? Current measures reported cases reported deaths put mortality rate covid around 5%. understand may know true mortality rate time, assuming number close, covid 50x deadly flu .1% mortality rate.

Coming Seattle life good simply thought I‚Äôd able compare two different cultures lifestyles. 

I definitely think it‚Äôs first world country still, relative Netherlands felt like couldn‚Äôt categorize sphere anymore. 

The way Netherlands pays attention detail efforts improve every day life people terms infrastructure, support, aesthetics, mobility made really feel like different tier. 

I felt similarly lived Germany kid, think take another level Amsterdam. That's terrible manager! Grass Valley meth capital America fucked That's true. situation West annoys though much unnecessary, shady business practices. Desantos gift keeps giving, even pass ban large gatherings Well Covid deniers kept saying Sweden did, well go! Sweden old people, worse health care system, higher population density, going absolute success story, F'ing virus. Or, came Wuhan via World Military Games. Finland, Norway New Zealand examples countries reversed initial rampant spread without use masks. argument work, rather alternative viewpoint many reference countries evidence playing important role.

Personally think social distancing increased awareness far important universal mask wearing. Cleveland here. We're still pretty good all. I'm saving tons money going restaurants bars. But, instead, spending car repairs, new curtains, new bay window, new vacuum... Crazy much money saved dining wining it. corporations *never* done right thing unless forced state.

Oxford vaccine's base tested, years, safety. vaccine safe, one worried that. question efficacy, aka often need get booster shots. Honestly, I‚Äôve never used Snap Map before. loaded up. Clicked around hot spots...I saw maybe 2 masks wearers whole montage (they I'm hoping newer stories longer term (maybe permenant) damage finally get study started it. one thing tell others hey, I'm seeing lot stories about... multiple peer reviewed studies indicate X% suffer long term Y% permanent damage. someone educate young people immunodeficiencies higher risk developing virus? see heart lung disease followed diabetes risk factors. Hashimotos thyroid disease, otherwise healthy 22 year old. 

I worried phlebotomist plasma center also work CVS---so I'm two likely places transmission. thyroid disease properly treated medication---am still considered risk? Glad see domestic cases coming down. Looking like things getting control.

I wonder much testing China latest outbreak. stated. far, many big spikes BLM stuff. However, seen massive spikes opening especially states open slow (Texas, AZ, Florida CA mixture good bad) FAR 85-95% necessary perennial vaccine-based herd immunity.

Where's source 85-95% threshold herd immunity? ¬´¬†Taking parents¬†¬ª stems time elderly contributing members household. could still cook, care children, household chores. 

You cannot care 80y old demented elder. don‚Äôt medical skilss it, house dangerous place confused demented. caring someone right now, warped, romantic fantasy parents live you. basically forcing one siblings ruin lives. it‚Äôs going you. Sadly work living can't quarantine week.
But I'll go see next week anyway. Statistics lie, liers use statistics. Haha good point I'm sure one thinks resurgence happen. there's nothing jinx. 

Anyway, Arizona &amp; ilk serve warnings. Suddenly it‚Äôs fragile American pride moment step defend barrage European elitism. act like case numbers won‚Äôt sharply escalate countries start open like have. soon someone says anything remotely pro-American, lash blame pride. somehow immune fact there‚Äôs tons idiot Europeans? idiot Americans get way flack Reddit. 

Our response pretty ass, sure. administration took seriously, could handled lot better. you‚Äôve site past months, it‚Äôs pure anti-American sentiments spewing people‚Äôs replies almost exclusively anti-American news, fact similarly developed powerful countries handled arguably worse. someone lives here, it‚Äôs truly bad. It‚Äôs fucking disaster. major rural population naturally mitigates spread many bigger cities cracked early. population ~330 million: ~30,000 cases day ~90 per million. someone goes point out, chalk American pride. Don‚Äôt hate people, hate game. We‚Äôve definitely got keep strong. It‚Äôs hard. Everyone fun, we‚Äôre stuck home. helps read guys also staying home. keep reminding hours roll dice perhaps ending death. worth it. 

I‚Äôm mad though. part. people acting like there‚Äôs pandemic destroyed chance break summer. can‚Äôt imagine else going impact. Infrastructure. Longterm health. 

I assume we‚Äôre stuck home vaccine. though. keep strong. *minor* inconvenience. even acknowledged 20% americans do. virus present dense city, amount land exists montana zero relevance all. ""The Surgeon General says hazardous breathe."" Damn, muh freedumb spreading like virus sold stock?  true. healthcare options work well like COBRA. want see face riot police. need data long term consequence Covid-19 infections. IFR tells small part story, disability rate post infection? I'm betting higher IFR. Yeah, rolling dice breaking rules hopes little extra business nice little nail coffin, guess. Soooo true. Unfortunately people sub love miserable. sub looooves miserable, there's point trying convince facts. Gonna give new meaning Con Crud They're respectful people serve store. Question. wouldn‚Äôt fill room again? saying keep empty someone died? California trending upwards, they're spiking. Arizona skyrocketing. Ah, long protest ‚Äúworthy cause,‚Äù won‚Äôt care potential higher infections due protesting? Got it. 

Well, everyone‚Äôs different worthy cause may something completely different. it‚Äôs ‚Äúworthy cause‚Äù appreciate support. honestly believe health insurance everything deny claims, i've got bridge sell you. There's gonna insurance reckoning health bills COVID19 come due. Maybe Congress finally act give us universal healthcare. LOL employees businessess state BEGGING get things. waiters/waitresses cashiers lowering masks talk customers.

Most wearing mandate, imagine trying convince people wear mask 3k people died last 5 months state population 30 million people minimal shutdowns.

Not everyone blindly fearful lot us actually looking numbers seeing fear inducing ones seeing.

At current rate deaths Texas, virus looking kill number people die second hand smoke year Texas. second wave get current numbers standard past number second hand smoking deaths texas sees every year, actually managed kill second hand smoke Texas yet.

By logic Texas banned cigarettes long ago prevent second hand smoking deaths. First all, want point measures aimed population level expected provide individual person adequate protection. fact term ‚Äúsocial distancing‚Äù medical value believe first used widely 2004 outbreak since become buzzword; included 6-foot rule result non scientific guide document 1945 since disregarded. 

You mentioned quarantine. throw word around lot people mostly staying home, true quarantine stop virus entering. physical location, people come physical contact all. think US done full quarantine, said time people thought nuts, far broad, looking back would far less impact we‚Äôre now. Heavy monitoring land borders, international flights out, cross-border traffic essential produce imports, personnel permitted debark seaports. Prioritize testing hardships logistics, example international family traveling hardship waiver like dying relative, truck driver hauling fruits vegetables imported Mexico maintain food security. Limited numbers people would able come internationally 3-week screening - government facility, promise-you-won‚Äôt-leave-your-house weak lockdown. done things, would virus, would able go lives normal, 100,000+ lives would saved wouldn‚Äôt looking prospect millions deaths total.

We should‚Äôve adopted universal mask requirements much sooner, time get bothered see false sense safety people mention ‚Äúmasks social distancing‚Äù. we‚Äôre talking putting piece cloth face gentle reminder people stay arm‚Äôs-length away other. need serious, medically-sufficient mitigation measures stop virus dead tracks gets worse. Feeling powerful although don‚Äôt dictate live. relieving frightening time. There‚Äôs lot unpack ya know? personal responsibility obsolete evidently I'm beyond tired. Thanks part, risking loved one's health others idiots semblance normal live. long care others think worth it. Consider several strains virus already. COVID-19 virus mutating much faster Add reliable safe previous vaccine corona.

I love write ""only people clue think..."" yet damn near everything said wrong -- clue. don‚Äôt blame people much one tbh. Politicians giving lot false hope one...it‚Äôs one many lies they‚Äôve pushing public. People really need start thinking independently look stuff themselves, leaders failed us pretty hard every step way thing takes slightest amount research much better informed things shit isn‚Äôt severe enough threat survival. that‚Äôs opinion I'm beyond worried dad keeps night Southwest requiring now. helps government back point coming absolute top! God hope God sad see developed world Blue Green there's goddamn America bright Red. also majority portfolio bonds. beyond building capital focused preserving it. Maybe Agent Smith right, human beings real virus. Exactly! actually GOOD THING cases high deaths low. shows virus damn Black Plague. anything, 99.5% survival rate people senior citizens. That's amazing news. Would consider UK Brazil similar boat? [Human life expectancy remained less unchanged past two - appears increase decreased infant mortality. People regularly lived 80s well beyond 1970's, *majority* lived past age 65.

What actually changed Western culture accepted unprecedented level wealth inequality, leaving majority people without means save golden years, let alone support parents. five Western families gave wealth, would enough every Western family support elderly members without breaking sweat.

Western culture also severely stigmatized idea multi-generational home, proclaiming child sharing home parents past age 18 failure one kind another retired parent moving back home children nothing burden. stark departure largely took place 20th century, pretend understand drove it, seems quite mad me.

Lastly, austerity measures Western governments routinely targeted vulnerable portions society sacrificed name feeding fattest bastards yet pie. Minorities elderly seen support dwindle away, social security budgets either forbidden keep inflation, otherwise outright slashed. subsequent tax cut paid blood grandparents throughout country. need hear survivor stories. reason need wear masks. Yea low percentage die, survivors rough too. like recovering flu. Also, downvote saying this, article say happens people well. also low percentage thing. going vaccine worlds population better make sure safe. sceptical since impossible long-term safety data efficacy side effects, without long term study.

Oxford one I've read I'll speak -- Oxford vaccine's base already tested safety modified COVID, UK government approved combine phase 2 &amp; 3 testing. They're skipping steps testing, they're steps simultaneously held back usual bureaucracy.

But base vaccine already tested. safe. give long-term consequences. Right test efficient it. We're seeing fairly efficient minimizing effects COVID (they pumped monkeys FULL virus worst suffered mild cold). matter seeing often we'll get booster shots. wish day USA would green list. shame.

Here cities lifting restrictions way new cases begin stabilize people already care anymore deaths respecting social distancing (and police siding idiot president turning blind eye enforcing restrictions). live minimum wage America too. us much pride live frugally. Hey, it‚Äôll okay, friend. 9 million people gotten virus. 7.8 billion people world. one tenth 1%, .01%, world tested positive. 6 THOUSANDTHS percent, .006%, died.

Until then, see anything wrong articles like way make people aware potential dangers. I'm surprised Cl√© get nailed. Agreed COVID? articles virus detected - modern science detect incredibly small amounts even broken protein chains - different matter whether measurable residue infect anyone. looks like surfaces infect easily; crowd shouting singing (as football match, choir demonstration) bad. i'm sorry hear that. rough something like happens close you. anyone impression flatten curve meant something else?

Stay safe term social distancing different connotations depending country/city. UK might mean 2m rule pathetic inadequate (especially coronavirus shown persist air enclosed spaces hours).

In HK physically practically impossible stay metre apart due population density public transport etc. term social distancing much closer meaning self quarantine home. family stayed almost four months home (work home; remote video schooling, visits anyone including friends family, restaurants/cinema/etc.). public events facilities (libraries/sport centres) cancelled government.

Yep, went Gamestop, sign door said people including employees required wear masks.

I'm enough expert predict ready, awfully sure someone getting basic facts incorrect. Numbe 1 time nemesis China. Ofc Chinese Virus scared going there. don't. can't recall last time used money... COVID-19 usually fairly unique usual respiratory virus symptoms. heavily symptomatic cases, usually causes intense shortness breath, like cannot get enough air even walk bathroom. lungs supposedly get painful takes LONG time recover it. also appears cause unique anosmia phantom smell plurality cases due damage olfactory nerves, usual sinus congestion brand anosmia. go like light switch, especially recovery. People often get confused illness hallucinate due low oxygen, brain inflammation. I've also heard lot intense body aches sound much worse flu. mild cases seem difficult distinguish knocked something flu-like set described, seems unlikely. read many real case progressions /r/COVID19positive. 

There usually tons nasty viruses going around CA. heavy travel Asia Latin America densely populated cities lots squalid third world parts. moved here, got horribly sick almost every time came something unbelievably bad time. literally broke spots body whatever nasty, nasty thing caught. Yeah, too. town heaving tourists today.  number cases detected 1,750 week June 8th June 15th. week June 15th June 22nd, case forced mass testing 7k employees Toennies meat processing plant G√ºtersloh, detected 1,300 cases Coronavirus. course forces reproduction rate 1. new cases quarantined contacts traced tested. meat processing plant closed, county may lock soon tracing emerges virus spread beyond plant workers. cases low enough Trace Test Isolate, unsanitized r number limited informative value. comparison, r number New Zealand ‚àû last week.

**However**, remove ""one-off"" superspreading event local authorities aware of, remaining cases detected last week 2,250, still 1,750 detected week before.

What appears trying advocate position ""Governments planning vaccine bail out, rather plan mitigate worst-case scenarios virus burns susceptible population naturally."" That's something agree with, governments \*should\* that. 


But comparing vaccine development timeline ""historical"" comparisons bad methodology almost certainly knows it. vaccine history given essentially global blank check produced quickly possible, vaccine history comparable timeline purposes.

You‚Äôre right thread isn‚Äôt going radically change course history, it‚Äôs still important think weighing policy options. 

There many deadly diseases fear strongly fear Covid. know lots people terrified coronavirus unprotected sex strangers lives. It‚Äôs rational. must many people can't afford $79. don‚Äôt think virus knows difference. 600~1000 1% positive tests.  mean see bunch super muscular men horseback approaching offer either paying tax completely slaughtering village, would completely braindead agree tax spot yeah. lot people saying different things second wave could result school closures. course. logic, literally every strategy employed anywhere Western Hemisphere herd immunity people typically mean specific thing refer herd immunity strategy. It‚Äôs common humans use language way.

Herd Immunity simply means strategy bulk population gets it. Whether today tomorrow, essentially need get it. Trust me, millions Americans think that's case. like MLB players agreed they'll play season. really one particular country stable genius president.

UK, Sweden, Italy, Spain, France. playbook same, masks really work, go ski vacations, football stadium full people, herd immunity BS. made fun Asia thinking Asian problem crisis hit far worse. 

However, western regimes like this. Shout Austria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Slovenia telling citizens wear anything covers face. Thank expounding referring - nicely explained went mall China old guy yelled. Put mask! strict here. people charge got tv said ain't old nothing worry about. Anyone remember that? It‚Äôs public school like MRSA goes wipes hospital ward, somehow saying 'well hospital something else, blame antibiotic-resistant bacteria? think really states power U.S., even divisiveness. federal government weak response states left respond own. 

The federal government could created coordinated response taking virus seriously, issuing mandates keep everyone safe, getting supplies everywhere need be, shifting budget supporting health financial infrastructure get this. 

Unfortunately, federal government taken people want destroy undermine federal government. They're pillage everything themselves, lead country. So, nothing, worse - lied severity disease delay take responsibility, defunded vital health welfare institutions, profited chaos withholding information, gave important supply contracts cronies cheaped provided subpar useless supplies equipment. 

It's good thing states enough power ones willing able could coordinate strong response own. Things would even worse states completely dependent federal government. Regardless intense next time get tell without doctor able infected every 2-3 months certainly cause enough damage time cause serious health issues.

""As point time"" really hope youre right remember get feeling part brain lighting MAGA heads see Trump trolling liberal tears. Guy near park today took cough.

Thank you. much case, COVID no.

Even basic masks, needs used education simply isn‚Äôt any. Hell, someone claim illness prevents wearing mask - woe business asks proof violates law.

New York cases actually going downward least since late April/early May. NYC actually starting green phase tomorrow, rest state green weeks now. Stay strong dude.

Almost everyone saying opposite. remember getting downvoted hell back questioning someone spoke authority ""healthcare professional X years"" assured everyone masks nothing bother. 

Why would ever make sense? course masks help... something that's spread coughing/etc. would something helps contain particles useful? Like they're foolproof, help. 

And yeah, many actual healthcare officials said masks anything... maybe they'd honest start we'd already wearing them. understand motive. people say cloth masks don‚Äôt protect you? protect particles getting what‚Äôs logic particles getting in? building field hospitals then? Seems confusing af. aw fuck shut file complaint OSHA. states (including Texas) whistleblower protection laws.

Could things workout given summer here. lol keep trucking BEEEweeP economic downturn worse reopen soon.

There basically 2 scenarios:

Option 1, fear economic damage, open 50% population feels safe reopen. Majority rule right? Except force people work, shop. people (like me) feel safe absolute minimum outside house. company selling groceries delivering mail, lose half customers 50% revenue. 

Aka, bankruptcies layoffs every industry opens soon. Massive economic disruptions wholesale devastation entire economic sectors enough people feel safe shop-which happens later additional cases opening earlier. Oh, economic damage extra deaths extra people hospital rest lives. survive Covid19 killing kidneys, die transplant fix you.

Option 2, go slowly, government gives support workers, companies even landlords wait out. fewer deaths, fewer long term disabilities, fewer bankruptcies, fewer defaults. economy actually rebounds earlier, returns semi-normal faster. study flawed one commented on? How, exactly, contain based test results?

I know you‚Äôre going say, it‚Äôs going contradict something previously said. ""essential worker, aka expendable"", worked since day 1, seeing idiots care world, even 50 cent mask, makes miss days quarantine. Go home idiots. Sorry stay home....lol Oh case using false numbers justify choices point time great, I'm really curious. work? Sure. know degree certainty? No.

I'm masks, think people wear them, there's nothing else (or we've rather implemented everything else). officials honest. understand articles like don‚Äôt get upvotes. realize fighting pandemic government. Even BLM protesters succumb covid. Really? elaborate? makes sense. land mass matter people actually distributed across area. It‚Äôs high school graduating class  There‚Äôs gotta end first there‚Äôs second... we‚Äôve advanced enough country get first. problem! attempt, stagnation.

Already caught late May. EU 297 deaths per million, US 366, 23% more. Given 4x faster rate dying, odds reasonable US nearly double deaths/M EU has. not. Never said good thing. wanted point per capita testing shiet still high amounts tests think weeks ago India behind 7 countries tests alone terms sheer numbers. They'll certainly surpass UK number's testing soon lol broke gf right quarantine hit. god knows many fights would've gotten into. part reason broke first place. public vaccine available 2020, reports say literally lying

Hmm listen u/DakodaMountainborn, literally Oxford. Tough choice. Even 98% protestors wore masks (it's probably single digits people wore masks entire duration protests), still enormous amount people. 

Also outside matter people huddled together densely inside pub? corona become virulent soon roof overhead?

Let's lie pretend lockdown losing job anything one hardest things someone do. see people flaunting simply knock statue offensive. need excuse it? Lord self centered. Think 2 seconds. experiences absolute mine fearmongering huh? like spewing propaganda, see say buzzwords too. 

But sure, keep thinking current system gunna support seriously need it. I'll bet kids super happy medical bills show die. I'm going keep demanding change, best part democracy need convince you. change system whether like not. may true snapshot, good 'ol 'Murica wins everything. #1 too! show 'em

Then lessen odds one spot breathed on, one spot sneezed on, one spot touched hand virus one spot sanitized properly. Ill give benefit doubt say think could march both, celebrating graduation also protesting BLM. People don't, either side it. pro-EU people absolutely facts behind though, even particular one seemed dumb explain well. American here: completely right. significant percentage people (much larger Trump-supporting population) 'given up' shelter-in-place measures, precisely due lack evidence sickness directly front eyes. People extremely ignorant falling confirmation bias. hear time days 'well, feeling shifty needed get out'. What. Use brain. Ahhhhhhhh. people dumb outside wearing masks. good New York state. I'm getting closer leaving place every day. Poor dogs. Chicagoan here. Finally back work July 1. like "" take 2 weeks?"" We're restaurant. 30% wearing masks go out. like "" sacrifice adhere strict guidelines people put us shut again. strict mask wearing customers. leave. great owners. 4 busiest months year start mid September. praying 2nd wave. dont want again. great extra 600. people dont realize open 25%. maybe 50% august(?). going back diminished wages knows long. extra money we've keeping reserve. Knowing would open back restrictions. Sure. lets confuse following two statements:

* islands keep virus infections bay
* easier islands keep (known) virus infections bay

Meaning: find islands almost virus free like NZ, Greenland maybe Hawaii mean impossible normal continental country. close borders well - that's special form quarantine / distancing will.

And also easily find islands messed things up, like UK. obviously tough thing predict, money ""close land borders"" sense. might mandatory quarantine, might mandatory testing. would probably sporadically enforced fine, even 90% compliance would achieve desired result. UK left EU January 31st 2020. That's called ""metadata"". stuff USA collected since like 2001 patriot act days.

They collect it. US people admit much Orwellian surveillance state rest world worse, thus result Americans die keep act pretending best pretending things politically convenient. permanent. you‚Äôll get people attention. Good them.. Right much protect you.

But limit amount droplets spitting mouth. everyone wore least cloth masks infection would go down. That's phase 1 is. They're looking safety healthy adults. Phase 2 branch out, look adverse reactions groups. Phase 3 efficiency.

Of course, always overlap among phases. surprising all. shit president. Places everywhere re-opening way early. 95% people dumb fuck. Also help thousands people protesting giving damn u mgtow sir? Korea NZ much smaller, far less interesting compare with.  forget us, Sweden! suppression here! oxford's planning done soon adjust pre existing vaccine go put practice mechanisms protect vulnerable long haul ‚Äî probably one two years,‚Äù Senum said. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt expect everyone wear masks two years. end game here?‚Äù

Good lord - two months least start bitching it? see you‚Äôre already popular lot businesses, especially large ones like Walmart attract special crazy customers, would need hire security keep people without masks. Walmart greeter, cashier, even manager makes enough money risk physical danger people would put in.

It's hard blame places trying harder enforce it. People idiots, apparently that's lot ask. Someone dress virus. Huh, reminded this, wonder anything it.

I‚Äôm going let someone‚Äôs fearmongering try tell experiences wrong even though I‚Äôve literally saved $10,000+ health insurance/taxes current system. I'm really interested see whether calls open borders adjusted given outbreaks. take putting blinders innumerable sources stating numbers inflated? incentive code people virus? Need think rationally sometimes take mainstream media's message face value. hope people start realize fear... reading things sub always bit jolt reality demonstrates people's craving fear. 

Just curious, outrage sub protests irresponsible? want verify double standard I've seeing headlines. 

By way, I'd say dodged bullet able come Canada. Place kinda sucks since Trudeau's thing. Exactly. equivalent drunk drivers. worst part don‚Äôt potential hurt hit. potentially hurt people‚Äôs families on. first article listed specifically suggested isolation 14 days receive call.

Again, none Europe, Asia, Oceania holding large events. Many still borders closed. haven‚Äôt seen scenario reopening containment happening. Good, fuck em thought Americans like this, boy wrong. Hurr durrrrr said weeks ago masks world end casrs going multiply faster ever... yet even close bad want Well front runners producing mass distribution numbers already. hopefully soon approved ship out. Cowards, real lack leadership right now. Liberate Hong Kong Ohhhh them, fewer fewer every day... probably see massive spikes. Absolute numbers pretty low Germany, likely see uptick going get back peak numbers overnight. probably get stricter restrictions settles down. We're ""the dance"" part this. Yeah, could also taken early steps like new Zealand, taiwan, vietnam, south korea. na, let's happy something, better baseless statistically extrapolated value small localized outbreak country supposedly largely eradicated disease.

A better comparison would talking PRC handles new cases Korea New Zealand, countries also largely rid (in NZ's case, entirely) disease new cases. Kill restaurant save patrons. worthy trade. Stupid? know them?! knows? one closing land borders US. like NYC RI exodus April, means split gets ugly increase rate land. Anecdotally people second homes family New England Midwest. People protesting, Republicans making political statement. Hurts many people part rest fucking prolonging without anyone care others. 

I support BLM, also would rather show care black lives spreading deadly virus. would take till September *manufacture produce* enough already discovered approved vaccine distribute effective manner across UK (not even start Europe, Asia, Africa Americas). meantion establishing infrastructure distribution methods get vaccine people. 

A public vaccine *will not* available 2020, reports say literally lying see 2 mistakes here.

That‚Äôs exactly kind response I‚Äôd expect someone doesn‚Äôt understand money life. Except, know, this...

I‚Äôm happily surprised Texas taking social distancing masks seriously. Statistics saw show less mask use US. Lol, how? That's exactly happens. tiny subset people wish restrict rights others, whether abortion, gay rights, general equality minorities. group people definitely overlaps people throwing collective fit wearing mask public, limit spread disease kill people spreads. countries recovering virus, not, also lot people reject wearing mask. difficult draw conclusion cost lives.

I'm single person antibodies went help friend clinical depression weekend, wouldnt flown myself.

However, family specifically need 3 seats, talk flight attendant arrange that. saw one family flight sat together. misled believing exactly? town we‚Äôve nothing available us except occasional drive-thru ‚Äúblitzes‚Äù coincide whenever press criticizes Ducey mayor testing. I‚Äôve heard friends went, takes people 10 days get result, time could easily contract virus, it‚Äôs pretty useless. 

Then big antibody testing blitz work last week - 1,000 employees took place one room. department given hour time slot that‚Äôs 50 200 people place. public health degree responded directly HR director said concerned spreader event speaking concern employee safety. want see widespread is, could statistically random sampling employees. response basically respond it‚Äôs perfect safe cc department head told I‚Äôm contact department head without approval. 

I asked coworkers went said madhouse. safety director put tape separate people pulled down. Everyone treating waiting area like big reunion, hugging shaking hands people wearing masks. Good thing dont let reddit keyboard warriors alter day üòÅ keep preaching big boy! talking about? labs processing tests mean people dying. 

Do understand viral load is? Viral load quantity virus given person across population. saying Minnesotans get smaller infections?

If look actual number cases, slowly declining like death curve. testing percentage curve increased quickly ramped testing.

I think political stance try discredit Minnesota's data ignore it. list includes countries European Economic Area (EEA) countries EU. also includes UK EU EEA. coordinated responses eu level sure could found fine solution without shutting Schengen, EU doesn‚Äôt kind influence anecdotes could made know. strong believer making people wear masks, enforced social distancing, comes across fear mongering sake clicks. going statement hear said people is, it‚Äôs unconstitutional hinder restaurants ability operate take ‚Äúfine‚Äù later take court state likely drop fines. That's awful. reminds happened black plague UK. People fled London took plague country homes, spread small towns provided supplies country homes. 

That 400 years ago, really understood diseases spread. looks people learnt nothing time. )-:  point is? decribe 2 pigeons stopped midsentence?0.o  arent. median age infection like 30 years younger April. people tesring positive wont even develop symptoms, let alone die. Oh dear, nooooo! Fellow Michigander? crazy watching people acting like Covid gone shit open. got antibody test swab test current infection LabCorp. Total cost $10, antibody. LabCorp Pixel home swab kit free. mailed couple days, picked day, results 2-3 days. antibody test LabCorp ordered 15 minutes. got results 2 days.

There LabCorp locations Arizona US, definitely something check anyone wanting peace mind. Hope helps.  Yet prices want go down. Makes sense. lot people delayed listing houses around (northeast suburbs)

Yeah...I work company considered ""essential"" along, we've far peaked 25% occupancy -- many require physical access facilities spaces can't accessed used remotely...either federal law, contractual obligations, equipment damn big get door. highest new daily cases since May 1st past days 33,000. death rate lagging possible come average 500 day highly unlikely death toll 200,000 december want Nano Defender. Firefox version works best uBlock Origin setup right. FL 1/4 total cases NY, yet 1/10 deaths. course rise bit due current spike, current rolling average daily deaths 33. Florida could see sustained 10x increase daily deaths (even pessimistic models would say unlikely) would still take 3 months catch NY. see two possible conclusions here:

1. virus significantly less deadly March: won‚Äôt speculate there‚Äôs likely combo things play, better treatments obvious one.

2. virus deadly increased testing giving us truer picture total infections: Many people head 3000 new infections = 200+ deaths, simply hasn‚Äôt case anywhere US last two months. means FL probably 5-10% NY's peak, despite 40% level daily confirmed cases. stopped reporting cause Midsummer weekend, they‚Äôre reporting ignore countries. can't help people do.. stfu Hey now. know people won‚Äôt listen medical facts! That's exceptionally optimistic outlook. pictures things getting better months? really think will, also really want wrong that. I'm curious outlook comes from. r/antivaxx

Eventually worked way forward line, cop car National Guard woman. told current wait time 5 hour cop car marked end line day.

In Orlando turning away least three quarters people trying get tested. massive spike confirmed cases. numbers peaked (higher April), FHM stopped reporting data thursday. good...

Sweden basically shuts summer. They're still planning reports couple times week. Why? science behind opinion? kidding me? It‚Äôs horrible lol, ideally wanna less 5% I‚Äôm sure people destroying public land businesses perfectly fine  Cuomo, Murphy Wolfe sending people nursing homes take others right thing? Well, seeing NY one lowest infection rates country, proven folks still care. live South, basically IDGAF Jesus save attitude. Seems like OP changed headline ""A unifying structural functional model coronavirus replication organelle: Tracking RNA synthesis"". 

The article talks virus hijacking infected cells change parts cell virus replication organelle. guess point, becomes part virus hence possessive makes sound like part virus itself. important falsely re-assure. chances severe consequences short death opposite noise. understand personal complacency point since probably concluded immune future infection. NY State 1000 weeks. view world way.  boring events drag people them.  That's support friends.  even attend last two graduations. Found anti-vaxxer. Yea think suppressed wrong word here, US much worse, doesn‚Äôt mean really suppressed. Medical Center great page updating relevant info greater Houston area comprising 9 counties. Cases, testing, % positive rates, hospitalizations, ICU capacity, deaths, PPE supply thresholds, etc. 

Houston good shape. Contributing half daily cases Texas whole recently. will. Miami‚Äôs mayor strict coronavirus since beginning. So, wait second, family 4 (3 seats + 1 lap infant) wanted fly, we'd split two rows, one us would seated next stranger? 

How hell make us safer? Worst case scenario vaccine sides 1 18,000 chance developing narcolepsy. I'll take lung scarring thanks signed it? mean certainly reasons (unforseen lasting side effects), considered signed up.

I would say go point. Definitely historic event. I'm trying turn negative positive. I've really focused fixing house, driving super cheap cars make happen.  big clean parts saved. Traded truck guys needed engine. Going freshen 383 stroker old truck. Don‚Äôt take photos people protests. Memphian...

It really seems lack concern here. work around city, really disappointing see minimal amount people wearing masks, etc. Everything open (which prefer anything closed). passed city ordinance wear masks public, , says ""immediately"" 3 days ago, really signed mayor first, likely tonight's council meeting. going really hard enforce.

One council person proposing go back Phase 1, would shut city lot again. Personally, think businesses would enforce mask (worn properly) allowed stay open.
If codes walks in, see blatant disregard mask ordinance, shut put time out. would go business, regardless big corporations mom pop stores.

Personally, take virus seriously. work medical field see patients. dumb like China without economic power. getting this? deaths happened today people caught virus 3-4 weeks ago. 

Many areas US seen huge spike past week. Many people already infected going end dying next weeks. least semi-reputable source like local government.

*Florida entered chat* Yeah exactly. That's even bother responding. Well personal attacks. Arguments like made bad faith worth time. Deaths dropping weeks 90% drop peak. many people get irrelevant, deaths days. Still need 55%-60% get infections get hurt immunity put crap away Yah, .26% No. Eastern Washington trying form state.

Similarly, Arizona started reopening, saw people social media driving California Arizona vacation get haircut (California still locked down). Arizona major outbreak. ability travel states makes harder contain virus putting fire one region, outbreak popping somewhere else tied travel initial outbreak. people flying country Florida summer vacation. Many states gotten outbreaks control, someone brings virus back Florida, another outbreak. ...regardless caused damage, depending kind damage is, doctors normally tell, degree certainty, whether permanent not. needing lung transplant arteries damaged clot. Yes, things, like glass sics, doctors aren‚Äôt sure going heal not. 

Regardless. It‚Äôs panicking say, ‚ÄùHey look, unknown virus running rampant - meaning don‚Äôt know kinds lasting effects it‚Äôll have. Here‚Äôs people know recovered permanent damage.‚Äù 

To me, that‚Äôs reasoned statement allows people conduct risk assessments actions. something liven mood, eh, gonna remove since apparently tasteless. yes, undocumented newspeak illegal aliens Nashville also Mayor Cooper scared property tax increase Nashville scooting phase 3 phase 1 still. tells U.S.!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ‚ÄúThey‚Äù? pragmatic point view would irrelevant ask someone attended protest contract tracing perspective. go attempting trace anything? 

You basically point obvious. protests, opinion 100% justified, serve mode transmission COVID-19. 

Additionally, real issue NEVER effective test trace mechanics set entire country. Without appropriate infrastructure place get now. can't done ffs. Maybe need, people world need every day earn money live. Florida report 4,250 Monday? That's true. takes distancing (extent based circumstances), washing hands self quarantining symptoms individuals. robust contact tracing/ testing public health authorities. 

Masks far magic bullet. Great, looks like guys agree me, let's blame proper protests, others. Thanks Virginian, thanks. Possible explanations:

* knowledge simply isn‚Äôt here. 
* machinery isn‚Äôt made and/or backlog own. Retooling manufacturers (if even possible) make costly, time consuming worth it. 
* aren‚Äôt many places could easily repurposed make PPE going medical settings. Existing places little room accommodate.

Anyone find link actual paper there? hyperlinks clicked took elsewhere complaints cited March April according Thats people keep voting man lol Hey, following President's thought; test much many cases, right? Apparently happens regularly, Sahara dust cloud basically stop hurricane activity week, see cool sunrises sun sets US starting Wednesday, people allergies extra fucked days.

Check radar, looks like big thunderstorm thick That's crazy might work. think. I'm familiar airlines since loyalty Delta, see ton American flights everywhere. I've heard (and United, obviously) pretty tightly packed. you‚Äôre exactly right. doesn‚Äôt keep quiet lot either. still intelligent. book smart maybe better term, don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôve struggling term call people, highly educated, fast learners, excellent problem solvers, people you‚Äôd like team work...but they‚Äôre also complete idiots things like racism Covid. doesn‚Äôt add me, much cognitive dissonance. mortality rate much less 5 percent. might 5 percent 65. 65 without pre existing condition almost never fatal. Americans want help first thing worry stupid mask improve personal health. Put double decker cheeseburger supersize fries go exercise. respiratory condition right? I‚Äôd willing bet get better overall respiratory health chances survival greatly improved. Americans don‚Äôt want that. want inconvenience everyone rather themselves. easier. Blame group rather look person died, died. tell persons family relative died diabetic 100 pounds overweight smoked pack cigarettes day. it‚Äôs easier blame disease. blame disease someone 85 years old dies, we? hear news person 92 years old, Parkinson‚Äôs disease diagnosed cancer died Coronavirus ask not. Remember, AIDS never actually killed anyone. People AIDS generally die either form rare skin cancer pneumonia. realize AIDS actually in, fair, didn‚Äôt. old people dying Coronavirus. probably wouldn‚Äôt die except many things bringing down, generally older degenerates immune system allows Coronavirus kill them. don‚Äôt see many healthy people 50‚Äôs dying quarantine them. you‚Äôre scared, stay home. don‚Äôt shut economy country world hold rest us hostage person correct. run mill healthy patients 99-100.

People getting denied treatment Sweden tests become ""negative"" inconclusive? Let introduce China..

Who done MUCH better job protecting low wage workers USA. 

I work China everyday, factories risk immediate prolonged government mandated closure outbreak precautions taking impressive (daily health + temp checks entry, mandatory mask use, social distancing etc) course. go doctor taxes done. Well, given years medical expertise, I'm ears..... Oh bartender lol Could recent rise cases related fact we're testing more? expect see deaths hospitalizations increase rate cases? tested earlier week got positive result morning bar hopping. guess much wait results partying though Unlike everything else phone (email, text, calls, social media) there's nothing inherently trackable system. Please read it. misunderstanding seemingly widely accepted. Yes, well, people US seem think asked wear mask oppressive, never get compliance good Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea. wonder people refuse wear seatbelts.  ignoring China blaming Africans covid decision knife two blades, risk second wave risk destroying economy lots people it. agree reopening soon, right decision time. 

In opinion, people need raise awareness take better precaution measures. Seems like everyone suddenly forgot virus threat care it. places like Minnesota Wisconsin, people spend Summers outdoors. places like Houston Miami, spend indoors. almost one factors play here. ""Church action tax justice"" churches pay zero tax billions rake in. bit hypocritical view. 
Yes tax tax abusers including religions. infuriatingly stubborn isn‚Äôt. much granular that. could said driving Italy Germany fine go straight quarantine 14 days. doubt it. Meanwhile seen.. many states South peaking last days New York seemingly course success.. knows. Yeah definitely agree Lol really want asshole insults deceased? make choices reconsider Yeah well like 5 bars Orlando closed 1 person tested positive yet went bar hopping night last Thursday. Pharma companies pay wages. saddest part Im actually 43. experience similar yours. CNA six months. Worked deeply caring staff, there's 4 staff 50 residents simply can't provide lot care.

Wrong.

A journal Lancet rewarded transparency continuing make retracted papers available. allows researchers examine retracted papers, example look common features. may noticed paper link provided shows word RETRACTED large pink letters, several times page, confusion whether good bad paper.

 trust Google. country. state. town.

Some people is.

But I'm really uncomfortable entities, known exploit data like this, getting data.

The pandemic highlighting societal ills countries long avoiding. bill collector arrived countries frustrated address things there's little political address. tested vaccine. vaccine candidates past testing, obviously worst case. multilateral policy setting body rooted assembly members. extent course political organization. That's referred ""politicizing"" pandemic. They're referring need global solidarity, using vaccines political tools, saying pandemic going disappear want win election. would like see students least opportunity play and/or work game. Honest question: death rate dropping states wouldn‚Äôt imply less people higher risk group contracting Covid? 

I‚Äôve following along rate dropping increasing surprised me. expected steady incline. 

Do know what‚Äôs happening? really millennials Actually, Boston ran special testing (free) BLM protesters released results that. Overall, u/eaglesoar correct. results show outside masks generally safe. really curious see numbers Tulsa days. 
Here example Uhhh, taking home 2400 month I'm sure industry saying well paid anything making less 40k well paying industry general. Like, sounds like fairly well paid retail call center worker. do?  BLM related numbers begun swell seeding events occurred within past two weeks. Give month we'll begin see effects. Depends Italy going, southern Italy really hit coronavirus numbers trend going fast northern Italy lately aswell. There's big possibility going safer Italy US concerning coronavirus trends continue now. Hmm no? look last day fohm last day worldometers, see they're off. Let‚Äôs honest, kids partied hours parents went home. masks. Lots red cups. Yea. overpriced areas drop. underpriced areas rise.

The net impact What? work major University Massechussetts building gearing process 5000 tests *a day* students get back fall.

We‚Äôve 1200 population 7 million. state live in? Media ? Godamn surgeon general said don‚Äôt work ! People aren‚Äôt taught research correctly. Plus, lot learn American history straight lies Agreed... Although 90-95% right thing follow protocols.... trust couple hundred ppl. Will? 30 teams? Probably think that's really feasible option. seriously denying Sweden serious, ongoing trouble Health Social Care Inspectorate, reported4 75% complaints received public care workers lack protective equipment facemasks care homes. One care home worker, speaking anonymously, told BMJ ‚Äústaff often work 14 hours substandard protection continue working despite exhibiting symptoms.‚Äù guidelines keep changing accordance availability material, city council voted make face masks requirement public, think mayor signed it. that's separate phased reopening plan. pretty light restrictions, honestly think we're decent job, particularly compared southern areas - recent upward trend notwithstanding. got back Nashville bars downtown hopping. Lots signs saying ""we comply regulations, feel free come party"". go downtown, pictures people sent me. HA.

Out things *expect* google doing, google tracks me. Pretending google tracking literally everywhere go flat denial.

It's one expected things.

Not bashing app uses google 100% tracks you. Contact *tracing* tracking default. Saw USA Today headline weekend. Nashville mayor raising property taxes 35% offset damage done COVID. Adjuvants injected placebo, see table 2 ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù. Yes, obviously real placebo, misrepresented nearly every vaccine safety study. precisely point. safety compounds, unless show completely benign already unethical breach consent. burden proof researchers injecting things, find study showing fact neurotoxic. asthma, never heard exercises. Strange mean thats hope for. Soon enough guess. Younger population lack comorbidities combined lack testing.  


I bet see antibodies population wide testing. diabetic survived prostate cancer. probably willing live life cuz appreciation it.

Not every senior wants cling life. accept borrowed time want make it. implication post I'm replying suspect comes ""foreign country"" Soooooo, video saw South Beach weekend everyone standing next without masks means South Beach shut down? thankee~ oh gee feel better. idiots denied 2008 collapse denying reality STILL That's mostly irrelevant, since memory cells rather serum IGG would facilitate acquired immunity. clearly works wheels greased tax payer dollars. Unless government prints money (which cannot without insane inflation, unlike US), able afford keep system running. they're trying slow testing even great long live two countries...

I'm danger... Need get kids back school parents reason return work = tax dollars mr desantis hard time working shift, I‚Äôd get lung x-ray.

Cuomo shat bed everyone conveniently forgotten. one said bad. data presented They're definitely gonna reopen without safe. live Berlin local tram route I'd say honestly 50% wearing masks, many (especially younger people) not. hope mask-wearing becomes popular again, we're yet! response global warming national healthcare. Pray okay goes badly then, ""Jesus, take wheel.""

I'm religious I'm certainly saint, Jesus I'd resent hell attitude. ""I done messed up.

All read article post excerpts think important.

You're welcome thread. one strangest things ever tried do. rightfully put end suggestion next day. even appoint him, gives shit? tu qoque fallacy. they're saying politicizing pandemic right valid. virus politicized actively making situation worse. see part nose smelling, olfactory cleft, blocked swollen soft tissue mucus ‚Äì known cleft syndrome. rest nose sinuses look normal patients problem breathing nose. model remotely accurate yet one. I'm also talking late may compared last week testing. seeing 2 3 times active cases states total us similar. one reasons contact tracers supposed ask/not supposed report talk someone undocumented. bit hyperbolic comment. state, things shut little month, three. many places shut completely three months? Hey idiot üëã

Not first time Chinese companies sold fake vaccines citizens including infants children. reason distrust anything made China. milk formula scandal worse. 300,000 victims. 54,000 babies hospitalized.

I'll take things peoole say pregnant women 800, Alex.. lol one strain, different isolates. meant title posts. family also made comment confused me. crazy person saying protestors test positive? See, I'm speaking primarily toward Elementary kids need support. 17 year old swell home, that's great! that's also near college age little kid. second didn‚Äôt see coronavirus subreddit thought Germans making babies furiously No,

I want accurate information instead fear mongering. even ravaged, nursing homes also enlisted response outbreak. taking coronavirus-stricken patients ease burden overwhelmed hospitals

This worst fucking idea ever. 850 like days ago Morons. Truly, deeply, hopelessly stupid. Canadian here, seems like leadership isn‚Äôt really enforcing anything either. Federal government using ‚Äúprovincial jurisdiction‚Äù excuse dodge many issues. Provinces handling issues downloaded onto municipalities. 

Problem one municipality keeps bars closed town 10 mins allows open everyone nearby going town drink. 

Stupidity knows bounds, least Canada haven‚Äôt seen much ‚Äúbut freedoms‚Äù bullshit regular citizens business model universities trash now. don‚Äôt realize yet. Everything higher education change next 2 years. Yeah, that's I'm talking too. That's CA (where live) claiming, I'm inclined believe we've seen steady decline death rate even new cases increase. I'm sure that's true FL, TX, AZ, though. going ensure people actually quarantine 14 days? EU opening borders US saying come quarantine 14 days? get it... safety established signals efficacy give drug, atleast give people want ? real downside ? Good job, buddy.

One might laugh chuckle political turned something solution this. math doesn‚Äôt check out? We‚Äôre 123,000 deaths today. hit 250,000 we‚Äôd need another 127,000 end year. 193 days left 2020. average 500 per day, works 97,000.

An average 500 per day rest year 220k 250k. know doesn‚Äôt seem like much, 30,000 lot people. apparently don‚Äôt understand vaccines treatments work.

scientist doctors getting understanding works. patient.

by end year we‚Äôll least treatment reduces mortality rate risk people. 

June 1st. day Fauci said talked Trump 2 weeks I's potentially 5 weeks spoken. Generations typically measured 20-year blocks, always children parents technically generation.

What's bad this? comment helpful. Someone asked sense many people experience worst case scenario, threw bunch scary medical jargon them.

Thanks fanning flames fear. Jerk. Honestly bad idea. general life ‚Äúbusiness plan‚Äù build wealth, moving EU I‚Äôm older sounds nice. would need coins? would anyone? OOOO yeah forgot Dallas, probably couple cities Texas well. Norfolk county blue last election, there's lot non military big place. Colorado Springs surprise me, Colorado lot moderate people think. American people suck. Nah I'm trying help calm state panic. isnt 8 million people coronavirus. like splash back lungs got jacked regular pneumonia, would think Covid would worse. hey, biggie big scar tactic/hoax, right? Yes do. beginning link Florida fucking death wish. think reason there's definitive science based studies prove otherwise. That's usually go there. Someone's opinion (or group people) hold merit nearly much actual, quantifiable data. also ZERO idea badly want true weakening also lol. mean athletes stupid?  considering nothing changed organised funded 2020, makes wonder lot things currently going on. doubt cough sneeze produce. Sending kinds school middle mess seems like pretty moronic idea me. guess Florida's government thinks otherwise. I'm betting involves 100% large families though.

My grandparents taken care 6 9 direct family members + spouses. rough doable.

I'm currently going taking care demented parent 2 2 spouses, 24/7 logistics almost impossible. literally destroying retirements this, since required giving jobs. less people literally would able this. able discharged back care first hospitalization.

I kids, one niece. Tell kid able take care parents aunt uncle dementing. dare you. kids take care old age requires amount population growth world longer sustain.

It's easy feel smug superior different situation. source worldometers Eventually vulnerable ones die. think number 2 million.

... we're 6% way there. means 7 years left, assuming 5 month time table get point.  
Why Houston worst Texas cities? necessarily like rules; like rules seem unnecessary, bureaucratic belittling. hand, rule gets accepted, gets followed pretty well majority population (in case social distancing, almost ""Karens"" ignoring experience). ""intelligent lockdown"" genius move Dutch government. still complain every waking second though. Fatality isn‚Äôt matter x percent die across board tied local conditions, America yet hit point ICU overfill yet. couple weeks, maybe month start see deaths look like. outdoor? Jealous. think great idea Biggest ‚Äúduhh‚Äù ever. anyone would want try navigate quarantines, border closures, canceled flights, etc boggles mind. survive rest year taking road trips camping. feel crazy like fucking global pandemic people seem want bury heads sand get back normal like still ravaging country. 

Maybe 15-20% people grocery store masks on, good number mask nose, I'm sick hearing people say greatest country fucking give problems like this. get paid challenge trial? Im sure police shoot anyone comply, right? Becuase - comply, break law first place? asked extremely obvious question people governments developed world everywhere aside US understood. I‚Äôm getting debate this, it‚Äôs clear works. yeah, educate it‚Äôs easy thing research. keep confrontational using laughy emojis makes feel better. scientists r/COVID19 tracking lung damage coronavirus months now.  milder cases covid19 milder cases lung scarring shows ‚Äòground glass occlusions‚Äô x-rays. Unless exercised hard sick covid, cardiovascular system isn‚Äôt pushed hard enough notice mild case lung scarring diminished breath capacity.  

Heaps athletes fit people noticed recovering well, diminished lung capacity illness cv19. thinking case majority people

Did say was? didn't, know possible we're still early days.

I hope wearing mask go door. do. probably would've gotten away too, meddling kids. Many colleges universities 100% going back fall.

They‚Äôve already announced making plans. 

I think somewhat doable. Students don‚Äôt need close contact like athletes order work. get sick, generally lower risk group schools setting buildings quarantine people in. faculty harder question. teach, allowing us decide much little class person vs online. going go hybrid format. statewide closure, unfortunately, one county. live different part state confirmed cases gone 400% (literally) past 3 weeks, county officials stated yesterday cannot anything help situation including mandating masks social distancing. claim state make requirements. state Tennessee cares ‚Äúthe economy‚Äù lives citizens. Governor Lee made perfectly clear. America, 21 cities 24 deaths. What‚Äôs point? support protesting rioting looting don‚Äôt. wants keep testing...... people he's going come contact with, (daily expect). 

The rest America, well, bother. Gotta keep numbers down, they're bad reelection bid. time launch COVID-19 pro Outdoor transmission low-chance, mostly one-to-one/few instead one-to-many. neither anti-lockdown BLM protests could add much. 

But indoor gatherings happen, someone coughs everyone else breathes contaminated air many minutes. wind movement, outdoor sun/UV kill virus, concentration droplets high. get large one-to-many clusters bars, churches, family gatherings, etc. high-exponent rise cases. Depends school district. converting Specialist Teacher positions Classroom Teacher positions transitioning much Specialist staff possible (rather firing hiring). 

The private school work hiring 10 new employees facilitate extra classrooms.

Others moving rotation schedules half class campus time.

A long-term shortage nurses around country [of Sweden] exacerbated corona pandemic. places, vacations cut ‚Äì even rental personnel taken.


- take little extra work, us sell week vacation, says Claudia Rivera, psychiatric nurse Uppsala.

- less staffed almost number patients, think tough.

In March, National Board Health Welfare noted 21 regions shortage specialist nurses, case specialist doctors undergraduate nurses, shortage almost equal.

Since then, covid-19 pushed healthcare far ordinary SVT reports half regions hiring staff last year considering so, also concern even staffing companies able cover gaps staff ledgers. 

Sineva Ribeiro, chairman Healthcare Association, calls nurses' situation historically strained.

- **The lack specialist nurses member groups worse ever meant given lot work spring longing vacation. sudden get work further, employer enough skills, much tougher summer ever.**

Jeanette Hedberg, Deputy Head Negotiation Sweden's Municipalities Regions, says trade-off staff care health care difficult, feel staff drop out.

- seen tendency staff go staffing companies situation, image loyal employer.

Claudia Rivera, become specialist nurse, understands colleagues commute Norway move staffing industry.

- Quite frankly, thought several times myself. salary terms.

- still think workmates environment work weigh little heavier right now. hope rules regulations slow spread even towners come visit.

I talking caring elder. child normally take care elder. ""Born serviture"" LOL. Serving elders something would proud of. think parenting also taxing then? 

Dementia, failing pysyical abilities things take care of, means it. I'm talking people healthy.

Also, think nursing homes cost? Free? know country, mine. 

Taking care parents priority, currently option inhumane. you, can't restrict you. lose job then??

A lot East South East Asia really reacted quite quickly, speed accuracy measures. also willing play along giving certain freedoms, privacy rights etc safety collective whole. highly centralized governments I'd argue people there, instead mistrusting trying limit government power, basically gave right expand powers even more.

South Korea essence implemented country wide surveillance contact tracing, openly said people 'it's necessary limit personal rights freedoms'. Taiwan went similar route, Vietnam reacted quite harsh traditional methods significantly poorer two cant airlines set policies themselves? goal smart waiting government take action. Forgive me, maybe help understand. NYC 30% heed immunity, isn‚Äôt actually good news? Wouldn‚Äôt mean need least another 30-40% population develop antibodies?

Municipalities [in Sweden] allowed order protective equipment several suppliers despite ongoing pandemic, instead regions [equivalent states / provinces] given priority. shows Ekot's review.

- cursed, course. pull legs away us, protective material, region, says Tarja Viitanen, medical nurse Nyk√∂ping.

When tried order aprons, mouthguards respiratory protection suppliers, told ""the goods blocked regular orders distributed among regions' buffer / emergency stocks"".

- look high low, contacted paint companies, nuclear power plants, everyone could kind protective equipment Sweden, says.

When situation corona center worst elder care Nyk√∂ping, repeatedly met message.

- expressed 'we deliver anything case state wants it'. go region first place, says Tarja Viitanen.

But municipality Nyk√∂ping. Municipalities Dalarnas Stockholm counties also state Ekot allowed order protective equipment.

The municipalities, take care elderly care, different providers protective equipment met message. Everything would go regions, charge health care.

According authority Socialstyrelsen, decided this.

When Ekot contacts one suppliers, Apotekstj√§nst AB, turns list 30 so-called ""corona products"" blocked regions since beginning April. According Apotekstj√§nst, Merchandise Supply, regional collaboration five regions, blocked products.

Supply Goods [Varuf√∂rs√∂rjningen] want interviewed this. reply Ekot via e-mail reason decision ""ensure even distribution regions receive material depending population"".

According them, municipalities order products, based proportion municipality usually orders products, little relation health care.

S√∂rmland one regions behind Supply Goods. Helena S√∂derqvist director support service services region, says difficult everyone get equipment, region period also could get ordered pharmacy service.

- critical S√∂rmland, difficult us get Protective Equipment, says Helena S√∂derqvist.

Several municipalities today received help through, example, National Board Health Regions obtain protective equipment. first deliveries started mid-April. then, deadly week pandemic already taken place.

Tarja Viitanen Nyk√∂ping believes municipalities given priority, suppliers authorities, already started talking protecting elderly.

- prioritized came protective materials, would ensured, says. Everything experiment. like anyone based last time Covid19 epidemic. were, response Sweden would probably different good news, though.

Thanks info. Hadn‚Äôt hear explanation before. thought people dropped street bleeding eyes not. Ha good one, leaders massively incompetent.

Pakistanis afford that. I'm pretty sure Americans alternative retirement homes taking care grandpa grandma small apartment, hiring nobody take care unfortunately way rest world takes care elderly. 

The vast majority elders retirement homes USA sick live conditions. Also, close family healthier thrown away, even get better treatment second think answered question, elderly go elderly homes get best care buck. alternative crappy care home. 

Except really sick elders, crappy care home better go elderly home (or warehouse). Bringing *military* help [severely strained healthcare system sign chosen wrong strategy. 

No Nordic country this, chose suppress virus adopt Test, Trace, Isolate strategies opposed trying herd immunity like Sweden did. study says 4% healthcare workers (who

So cool shutting restaurants/bars/establishments stop outbreaks E. Coli Salmonella, they're shutting outbreaks Covid, suddenly ""secret police"" organization? Temporarily. God bless great state Texas! keep saying ""now-contained"" - containment assumes migrant workers zero contact Germans.

Like said, yes answered also gave examples well. Caring child child take care elder. Normally government state system care elders. don't. yes inhumane. Nursing homes inhumane. hope not, is. like OP said. like many witnessed. 

Second thing: also option advanced physical weakness dementia-related issues make full-time care bare minimum, incredibly taxing.

California &amp; similar here. new place get junkier drinks/snacks long walks Circle K, that's even ONE employee wears mask, &amp; store mentions te state mask requirement front door. pure. art. Depends approach it.  conventional way test vaccine manufacture large number doses (10,000?), distribute placebo population, observe course span time (a year?) many group gets infected, many develop side effects die. That's ethics-board-approved way, way avoid liability, way things done Western medicine.

That's ludicrous plan right now. Every day wait, thousands people die.

Human challenge trials speed things up. manufacture small number doses (100?) placebos, take group people low mortality risk (volunteers 20's plentiful, almost negligible mortality risk screen comorbidities), expose virus deliberately. confine isolation rooms two months, test every day (since asymptomatic). even 10 days trial, pretty good idea whether vaccine protective not.

If confirm highly protective vaccine candidate ten days manner, begin 10,000 person test similar conditions, examine significant acute side effects low-mortality-risk cohort. graduated cohort testing (call 1000 doses people 30's, 1000 doses people 40's, 1000 doses people 50's) without challenge, check acute side effects, publish results month. round cohort challenge trials, without placebo.

At point, we're maybe three months testing, we're ready phase 4 trials, roll doses millions. New York outlier state failed respond pandemic properly. transferring sick patients sick transfer, properly training medical staff, many factors lead widespread incompetence top down. 

No state death toll like New York states actually decent job. ~Laughs~ Cries swedish requirement EU law employers keep records employees, check example, right work. think second design. literally collegue gave job home, moved different country could take care old father. regret one bit, think brothers come too.

That's good him. Many parents would even want encumber children option can't finance it, maybe father live instead him. that's it. time see life people people want disrupt life. care actually.

It's also option advanced physical weakness dementia-related issues make full-time care bare minimum, incredibly hard, should. option inhumane.

It interesting track places actually guts back phases outcome meeting targets. could good sign. varies neighborhood neighborhood - fog war effect - example think talking NorthEast. Auto-correct strikes again! kids thriving online learning? teen loving online learning better school face-to-face learning.

The FDA approved inaccurate antibody tests hydroxychloroquine starters.

I understand desperation things wasted time resources may put people risk. Yea, dialed back testing make graphs look better. 2016 election, lot right-wing American political activists started focus Sweden, wondered effect would be. quite striking see Sweden move toward American model several different ways, method dealing virus got obvious similarity two. shame watch Sweden abandoned social democratic principles favor disaster capitalism. expected put capitalists charge society, run ground everything else. They're not, they're going hanging out. lot people move Aizona go outside, right that's exactly they're doing. Replied quote agree probably case. sad thing Sweden almost certainly going implement kinds measures. curious see outcome trying implement TTI stage be. suspect help large degree, ofc effective would lockdown get caseload quite low starting TTI. One thing true, however, Swedes along Nordic peoples good social distancing / following recommendations thing, *maybe* enough make situation much better. Deaths creepily consistent weekly pattern - tomorrow slightly higher, they'll spike following day fall gradually throughout week. I'm guessing states/counties report weekend, report Saturday Sunday, report weekend. 

The important thing yesterday's data lower previous Sunday data (331 267 Worldometer). aren‚Äôt ones deleting comments reference three month old articles don‚Äôt reflect current reality need public, non-profit health care accountable people. Private, for-profit health care proven worse useless. condolences man's family, died died real developed nation. states seeing spikes, could see second national lockdown future would end creating whole new issue? seems despite increase cases may see another lockdown again, case first one damaging global economy. hopefully don‚Äôt see entire nursing homes absolutely massacred, many states, significant majority deaths actually gratefulwe cohesive policy this.

‚ÄúYou see delaying see common leadership tactic running around like world fire. Instilling confidence hopefully avoiding panic. Panic like caused people hoard TP... tomato tomato guess.

I think EU vs US good comparison due Trump's hands approach letting states decide plan action. I've never compared EU US corona virus numbers I'm going that. Using Google's US Coronavirus numbers see -2.18M cases 117k deaths. Using site looks official dot eu address see - 1.5M cases 172k deaths. US 370M people EU 446M (surprising, thought US would TIL). 31.16 deaths per 100,000 US 38.6 deaths per 100,000 EU. US better end. overall US death rate per capita better 8 countries EU. overall, trump phenomenally better overall EU better larger countries looking death rates. agree - based numbers - trump's response great compared similar demographic countries.

As far comment imagine HCQ, study referring pulled using bad data.

The pandemic team - believe mention - disbanded all. proven false.

Look, obviously like guy that's totally fine. widely incorrect data opinions. look stuff maybe feel better US response.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt think link carries googled EU coronavirus Every time think people start get really worked it, think price gas. reason gas prices still low fewer people driving many people driving less. Neighbors, no. always talked specific household instances loud arguments. I'm probably neighbor empathy towards them. wife psychologist similar situations, helpful walking this. Yes saw mastermind news. depressing also see childrens' inheritance diminishing hour.

There's reason happening. People think they're owed something. Fuck that. Well... tsunami's much obvious respect, many cities recently? live Pennsylvania almost everyone wearing mask, places like Philly Pittsburgh near universal compliance, rural areas little less still vast majority wearing masks. entire Northeast taking seriously, NYC. Ah know something happens China. flew Lufthansa last week, also required masks times. served meal first class passengers. I‚Äôve never happier flying economy, listening silverware clanging side curtain. there's whites go school poor areas blacks go school rich areas? Sure, username guaranteed legit. Since Trump business man

You realize that's qualification political position? mean, even accurate, purported business man con artist. Yeah, mortgage $530 month. Bought house January. 1300 sq ft 2.5 acres. able work remotely days, also live way country pretty much lowest cost living state. Hospitalizations 50% last 7 days. winning battle. 70x easier covid spread 70x people spread spread 70x easier spreads exactly alsi america big place ireland way smaller, smaller individual states, obviously easier spread america built areas people 70x easier spread states Article 6/15... He's less upbeat week later, enough he's press conference afternoon face continued skyrocketing case numbers hospitalizations. article title misleading. article mention students pretending Black Lives Matter March. lessened air travels lead lessened cases influenza? 

(Or, spread influenza locally still dangerous outside influenza strains effecting different regions world?) American sentiment. I've never heard anyone 'being caught'. department responsibility investigating. go doc complain back pain severe stress, whatever, doctor gives repeated 'sick notes', there's lot anyone prove 'sickness' genuine. Chances there'll smaller class sizes international students stay away. Provided small outbreaks tackled quickly Ireland good position get back normal then. exhaustion go away state like 150 infections day we're celebrating great ""success"" response (only thousand died üôÑ) - admittedly compared 1800 infections day peak pretty great, yeah... standard success lot impressive. Yet another firm boycott. Honestly think would safer Disney world lot public places precautions taking willingness ability enforce rules perform duties high level. 

Still much say true. matter won‚Äôt perfect. 

Personally wouldn‚Äôt go Disney time soon. Safety definitely reason mostly wouldn‚Äôt fun conditions. kids go school? mean hire private teacher kids separate room house? 

A lot people that. And, civilized world, children goes school 4-8 hours daily, time spend home. WhiTe pRivilEgE Oh, damn relate. really want attend person classes fall. want make new friends go club meetings again. However Coronavirus says absolutely not.

And yes, government really fucked response pandemic. suprise though, one many things messed up. took 3. I'd try get tested again. Help state get accurate COVID numbers also would good get confirmation actually antibody reasons. Yeah, think lot trash ends even throw trash can? Hint: lot still ends ocean somehow. Therefore, everyone wearing mask contributing problem, throwing ground. maybe let police get half fine fund ppe get give covid19 handing fines pro-epidemic citizenry.

and double fines elected officials obey!


this public health issue like second hand smoke drunk driving. need local, state, federal government take seriously enough citizens taking seriously back public disapproval, boycotting stores enforce, buycott do. take health workers seriously pandemic trust sell us safe non-putrid food period? fairly healthy 29 year old I‚Äôm still working home going grocery store leave house.

I want long term long issues. losing 4 months ‚Äúnormal life‚Äù quarantine fair trade off. apparently others don‚Äôt share view it‚Äôll likely vaccine normal life resume me. America religious European countries. Religion part *problem*, missing solution. Florida good now. ALWAYS asymptomatic presymptomatic people. ALWAYS.

Anyone functioning brain knows this. news. disease exists matter what; populations (including volunteers) already risk exposure due pandemic conditions.

Participation challenge trial seen less heroic selfless act (with associated ethical challenges), calculated risk trade-off: one trades risk contracting COVID wild pandemic continues (and unvaccinated) towards BENEFIT getting vaccinated asap, risk vaccine effective enough them.

In countries handling pandemic poorly stroll towards herd immunity, becomes risk worth taking regardless actual disease severity. live place work job chance contracting COVID Q1.2021 would like 50%; current stage vaccine research (including antobody tests etc) believe vaccine probably works least 80-90%, take risk then? 

As added benefit, volunteers given priority pass vaccinate immediate extended families ahead line (or part next steges extended trials).  correct. death rate healthy people 18 low many kids health issues like asthma using numbers healthy people applying entire class isn‚Äôt correct. class hundreds kids there‚Äôll almost certainly several kids asthma many people illnesses may never diagnosed yet. clarify, first report since thursday, deaths reported thursday 11:30, friday, saturday, sunday monday morning. 

On average 17,25 per day Never trust employer tell laws regulations work... sorts people would interested know, even fact, place packed. Even pre-COVID, fire departments interested things. Right Mr. Lebowski. 1 women make baby 9 months, 9 women can't month Even Oxford Moderna work perfectly, proven safe, September/October, it‚Äôs still likely going take years ever see enter body.

First it‚Äôs going go directly healthcare workers first responders.

Next government officials, military, etc. 

Essential workers next line.

People work home last line. We‚Äôre going waiting months months finally allowed get vaccine.

All assuming rich elites don‚Äôt cut line over-hoard big supply doses, delaying everyone else longer. We're still low PPE, VA fighting allow employees use sick time test positive covid-19, working VA feels less like service like risk. I've hearing happening lately... thought people ignorant denial affected anyone knew bad enough... stories popping saying people who've friends family die STILL refuse consider danger. makes wonder many people actually unable feel empathy world. previously thought... Stop downvoting this, need know people think, even patently scientifically wrong. Yeah I'm fucked thank ive quarantining How's Florida now? Okay wait two weeks?

What understand people freaking long term impacts virus. mean, hardly complete lockdown. people still went work, could leave homes whenever wanted went nowhere ‚Äúexplanation‚Äù made sense whatsoever. 

I understand think Hilary bad candidate, I, choice. dem primary 3 million votes. 

Finally, going back months comments fucking weird creeper move. muh economy, muh herd immunity, muh sweden there's constant circlejerk people think weighing risks impossible think cool start witch trials anyone disagrees. think understand harmful would forbid everyone anything vaccine mass produced. Yelp reviews several businesses masks worn. also called city health human safety got machine. Left message. white school less!

 Dude front left knows what's up, socially distancing, mask on, probably mentally bitching Karens Barbies demanded happens. Well, medic, can't specific. months many different approaches medicines tried treatment covid patients, proved useful, others useless even harmful. Better care means experience gained months, medics know avoid dealing covid patients. No, I‚Äôm trying learn what‚Äôs happening people share world with. understand situation US 90% articles posted sub US. want know what‚Äôs happening rest humanity. build dome USA, we‚Äôll let thing check every 5-10 years know single person wearing masks public wear mask.

Do think case everyone else though? everyone share experience?  average rolling seven-day average, indicates number deaths declining. meanwhile Europe looking US complete baffled look. Yes we‚Äôre still safety measures, like distancing etc, things slowly opening up, outside local outbreaks virus seems stay within controllable numbers (4K daily EU last 7 days, 30k earlier whilst test now, meanwhile US around 25k still. back 30k well).

I‚Äôm really curious see long term economic impact sides Atlantic. think initial impact bigger, manage keep contained, whilst keep floundering half population scared half whatever, economy take way longer recover. Fever chills body aches definitely COVID-19 symptoms, sense smell especially thing. Rest treat like COVID get retested work requires diagnosis met stay home full 2 weeks.

It‚Äôs issue. don‚Äôt need study. basic math see case.

The average age someone killed car crash 38. 38 40.37 years lifespan left according actuary tables. average age someone dying Covid-19 78-81. Let‚Äôs use 79. 79, average lifespan left 8.82 however, unlike car crashes, Covid-19 typically kills co-morbidities wouldn‚Äôt typically lifespan others cohort. Conservatively, say average 79 year old died Covid-19 4 years life left average. Covid-19 death represents ten times less effect overall average lifespan typical motor vehicle accident death. threat average lifespan motor vehicle accidents, death count Covid-19 would ten times higher. isn‚Äôt likely year‚Äôs end.

Despite proving time time breeder safe best interest best interest working class. needed laugh today expecting cloth facemasks work like fitted respirators. don't, full stop. point current mask guidance catch respiratory droplets people inhale them. everyone wears mask, amount droplets hanging around air goes way down. contrast something like N95 respirator, yes, want full seal around whole mask filter air coming mouth nose. cloth masks intended respirator, way limit spread respiratory droplets. Testing per capita less (82k/1M population vs 86k US), deaths yes significantly worse Italy (573 vs 369 US), cases much worse US (7k US vs 4k IT), hope translate future significantly higher deaths count.  It‚Äôs something we‚Äôll accept. We‚Äôre clearly going accept infections. faith young college students older people around see doctor. cousin diagnosed clinically positive actually test came back negative. around large outbreak nursing home works nurse. symptoms sound lot like yours.

So testing negative really needs followed medical provider.
Take precautions keep everyone around safe. West (North America) botched tremendously. I‚Äôm actually embarrassed country.

I'm afraid much nuanced this. forgetting badly American Brazil neglecting states US track contain Covid. Good Asia Europe‚Äôs quick responses.

Again, let's look facts.... China denied contain it, lied characteristics, continues lie impact, praising response? 

Many European countries waited overwhelmed serious response. Sweden recently reported almost 1,500 cases one day Michigan US averaged 1/10th similar population. 

There governments (countries states) globe handling well handling poorly. 

Some world's current worst hot spots US, much true. better generalizing one segment population entire people? ""nobody US control willing use face masks"" ""Europe Asia right contained, bro"" narrative false frankly racist. got invitation bridal shower. I'm going decline. someone's house. Dozens women, even know, crammed together house? No, thank you. There‚Äôs sub stories think it‚Äôs Covid-19positive something like that. People tell experience it. What? Masks mandatory public transportation. comes bus driver yeeting ppl without masks bus? also saw ppl making snarky remarks maskless Karen train weekend next station, pushed wagon. Maybe NRW people bit edge days whole meat plant thing. Florida reporting excess 3k+ deaths pneumonia...then there's spike cardiac deaths... thoughts test dead covid, mislabeled. doubt numbers accurate. Plenty BLM gatherings tolerated Europe, despite directly laws regulations. Japanese person jealous amount cashless-ification country :) Well really think state individual European country. Florida Georgia three weeks out. Arizona four weeks out. Protests almost three weeks scale. 

But NYC Minnesota bad indicators NYC
was kinda careful even looting Soho (I watched lot video) Minnesota stopped counting much week.

If want see impact protests clearly find somewhere mostly followed rules ~up until~mass protests. Even less deadly, disease also seems bad lingering effects cured patients like chronic fatigue syndrome. One longest term friends got covid early apr. 3-4 days hell followed speedy recovery. breathing/pneumonia problems whatsoever treatment. Month later kept getting dizzy pushing doc xray's lungs. Ground glass sig doc said see lot yet know treatable, self-resolves, never resolves. That's scary man. Yeah makes sense Amsterdam like country that's community, much harder pull 300 million people.

But yeah man good visit countries see differences everyone hit lol. NYC actually great. experienced medical staff. It‚Äôs probably absolute least favorite insult website. website, like never hear people actually say shit irl sites. overlay # tests % positive results? 
I feel like total case numbers completely misleading seeing places barely testing all, course number stay low. Data shows nowhere near support person call check you? Bring food, meds? never said hypothesized Florida hot spot lead next New York terms death. *You* one put statement mouth. I'm arrogant think I'm smartest person room predict pandemic course also attack posters hold different opinion.

What know people predicted, common sense, loose zero restrictions southern states would come back bite degree. proving case perhaps making feel uncomfortable agitated could potentially wrong.

Side note: want convince people argument best leave aggressive tone attacks door. comes incredibly childish. Oh, great state Texas Governor Asshat declared enforcing orders requiring face coverings unconstitutional said local city governments would punished trying so. also, course, opened capacities 75%. That's stupid bar owners were. could 75% greedy even follow that. 

Maybe fact we've gone 30,000 cases last week make see he's killing people. Production much easier speed massive parallelism research. sounds like non functioning company. arguments say something okay others worse. That's cheap. fact total deaths per 100k really much higher year previous year. fact, last two decades we've three years death rates *higher* now, nobody panicking then.

Covid catastrophic event media hyped to. worth shutting entire countries, making people depressed suicidal, destroying economy, fucking children's social development potentially life even causing famines developing countries. needs happen Arizona!!!!! ""Free""

Someone pay it. ppl working paying taxes, be? Well duhhhh Exactly, bigger diverse toolbox potential solutions better. don‚Äôt see look what‚Äôs happened normal times say ‚Äúbest case‚Äù 4 years unprecedented effort

This often fatal flaw people dismissive timeline. urgent need get vaccine developed, ever essentially unlimited resources behind development? Precedent good metric apply here. People seriously stop believing everything 'hacked' reported 1M dead someone else pointed showing -271 dead Europe days. data can't trusted. Stick [John another least semi-reputable source like local government. thing pains states barely enforced lock decides open even cases trending upwards. New York things seem settling now. wish whole country page. get concerned ""significant negative effects recovered patients"" real data support predictable outcome. Right read headlines alone may pushed direction. know single person wearing masks public wear mask. people spending much time energy arguing mask use 99.99% people they're supposed to? Sometimes feels like people arguing opinion nobody even has. People streets thousands, let's revoke alcohol license bars. trying figure okay here. Elaborate? look current data trends NY state whole far better states rushed reopening. Maybe it‚Äôs went high school 60% Asian Americans, see single person that‚Äôs white. Tuesdays tend weekly 'spike' Dutch covid figures data, result backlog updates. Lets hope keep up! Europe done anything.The number cases Europe higher US. Slawww dowwwwn testing, please! Indians Reddit suppressing news shit COVID-19 situation is? They‚Äôre passing 500k total cases number tests per population LAUGHABLE. aren‚Äôt testing high numbers, many cases truly have? 


Never mind fact India recorded highest deaths one day. No, viruses care anything. political agenda equates safe practices ethical future work unsafe practices unethical politician. Vox generally worth reading. 

Bet single false negative test two positive tests, reinfection. Studies confirm reinfection possible. traveled Heathrow last week masks handed entrance. man wearing mask mouth. Free nosing it. Obviously UK, pretend keep people safe. Interesting, whole chickens one things grocery store never shortage of.

Then I‚Äôm white bread Utah County, Utah. doubt demand high here. much effort cook here. getting young people hospitalizations go up??? right, deaths hospitalizations drastically decreasing national level. new cases since memorial day really changed much far. lesson is:: virus loves crowded spaces

Yup. Avoid indoors multiple people household. arguably bad Boomers. They've really changed 401K's grew. Much much better treatment options mar/apr combined appears lower avg age new cases keeping deaths jumping. Imho- death # go new surge works way likely nearly bad before. 

Doesn't minimize chances significant negative effects recovered patients. That's next news story imo I'm personally much concerned dying CV. nod say ""uh huh"" start snapping pictures. keep Ricky quarantined Lol. post history literally insulting people. I‚Äôm sorry feel insecure hide behind computer screen feel better yourself. You‚Äôre toxic. hope find happiness life. It‚Äôs 53 men roster, practice squad, dozens coaches trainers, medical staff. given NFL team probably least 200 people connected operations somehow takes 1 screw whole thing. powers want everyone back work. trend going letting know food safe. hot water sink part.

Thank you. worry... cigarettes years (maybe 20?) seriously intend start now. there. mask required public transport. found article says 70 percent take seriously bvg gonna strict masks.

To elaborate this, whilst vaccinated monkeys indeed traces active virus noses, *none* got pneumonia lungs considerably healthier state control group, even incredibly high doses.

If anyone wants actual progress update vaccine instead uninformed speculation random Redditors, [listen Sarah Gilbert gave days ago Oxford's YouTube channel. fascinating, particular uses exact argument discussing monkey results: dose received *way* higher humans would expect encounter day-to-day lives, results human trials much informative useful vaccine be. live?

The attending doctor discuss various treatment options patient, decisions almost always made consensus. Many elderly patients prefer less invasive treatments even mean slightly lower chance survival.   possibility certain rules could put place (no indoor eating, mandatory masks, etc) slow infection rate?

In supermarkets masks mandatory. traffic aren¬¥t. problem since weather got much better recent weeks contact restrictions canceled, people go groups celebrate. basically keep social distancing make masks mandatory every public area. Wait, first wave even left?  Haha think she‚Äôs intimidated cause make happy ways can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs mum all, quarreling might way showing affection.

Imagine fucking self-absorbed armadillo need flak jacket? german, think second lockdown isn¬¥t unrealistic.

Although good see, daily new cases still around 500 per day. seems like full lockdown without mass increase daily new case counts would tough people justify / understand. possibility certain rules could put place (no indoor eating, mandatory masks, etc) slow infection rate?

In UK we've pretty much plateaued 1200-1500 cases per day month June, however outdoor pubs markets open restaurants scheduled open weekend. sad think euthanasia centers in.""Soylent Green"" great idea? least go peacefully, terms, surrounded beauty.

Guess choseM knew test anyone, maybe could avoided many cases. cloth mask provided company least two layer, blue exterior, gloves really preventing virus, clean room environment would wearing gloves veil normally, standard disposable cloth mask blue exterior elastic loops instead veils. I'm even trying hard inflate gloves, even hold tight face so. think better gun violence, Covid problem eventually solve itself, flu also plague, people necessary die point either virus get weaker, medicine pops everybody get antibodies. Gun violence solved political overwhelming public effort, see neither that. yet still breaking record numbers cases? Imagine shit together testing front.. I'm US.

Second lockdown definitely cause type riots protests. literally happens every Sunday. death count significantly drops someone posts death count lower every Sunday 3 months.

Your pattern recognition terrible. Probably Agent Orange people slow supply lines. Nice fake news fox news. ocean can't wait Yeah excess deaths real number watch especially states reporting, cutting back testing, etc. Netherlands, USA orange travel, cannot see improve soon till winter rolls around. layout maths me?

Slave owners? Last time checked slaves get salary (even quarantined working) + worry paying rent/food hard times... remind ongoing protests USA? .... oh that's right human rights. referring world cup labor, laws passed since require expats earn certain amount including accommodations transport, food, housing.

Not mention complicative factors advanced dementia. last one. I'm guessing though. What? talking to? live state one earliest country initiate lockdown procedures implement phased plan. state fantastically flattening curve already opening businesses due this. 

My argument ever imply implement procedures fight pandemic. studies shown using mask, using mask, reduce spread infection 75%. significant. people wore fucking masks lot problem would diminished. they‚Äôre not. symptom factor. Nice. Sweden basically acting way Trump would like do: Forget loss lives weak wulnerable concentrate economy.
They getting rid old people would create extra burden healthcare system future.
This good news everyone else except eldery... ¬´¬†Well well well... turntables¬†¬ª One day realize sex normal making prostitution illegal really stupid idea. Yo! question answered. different discussion altogether. point life-state vulnerable weak older people prime concern, ultimately need care homes. That‚Äôs actually posted it.

It's sad majority Indians online eager discard denounce anything even remotely traditional without even trying it, extremely receptive anything Western best analogy seeing still get fartsmell without pants. Explosive diarhea works better Right? Clubs also prevent people going follow dress code. different see hike complaint that. Saturday full fucking moon god damn Okay, propose a, say, child lives apartment take care surviving parent middle-stages alzheimers, poor mobility?

Wait: got more.

What woman 3 children suddenly deal father declining physically mentally, home built facilities needs (ie: bath, washroom, corridors small wheelchairs). prioritise children? give whatever work might do? completely upend home, move another, 'elderly' friendly home? afford this?

Or two late-middle aged children suddenly finding 93-year old parent needs full-time support. older children entering retirement themselves. want become effectively full-time carers? parent may well heavy require lot lifting. Would okay completely destroy backs trying shift mum dad around without proper equipment (know average house hold hoist?)

Sometimes ailing parent refuse leave home. kids move in? Report sector G mood enhancers. mostly zinc 97 percent. eat one get pretty sick. Literally nothing good penny number commentators thread absolutely suggested outright stated care homes exist. They've 98 deaths entire pandemic. I've read cases young, fit immigrant workers number cases high mild cases recover London City started flights, worth mentioning flying UK destinations now. 

I‚Äôd expect Johnson announce we‚Äôre bang target ready next phase time.

That said, I'm expert, may partially wrong assessment. probably improvements treatment understand virus better better. credible source, sad fact okay, politicians ones gambling. health bet. Maybe actually medical workers staff beds claimed free?

I didn‚Äôt say millions though. said hundreds thousands. people like scoffed remark... well go. CDC too. understand federal medical leadership bad... Fox entertainment. Trump asked slow testing. Spread out. statistics released weekend (which one biggest holidays year Sweden) either deaths, confirmed cases tests done. Lead situation reports saying Sweden seen new cases couple days. Nice input fuck? guess gotta read article.... probably meant say completely asymptomatic individuals rarely spread infections compared presymptomatic individuals. bad PR them. 

Still, since people symptoms likely coughing shedding viruses, would still make removal mandatory screening dumb. us NC freaking out. 

I've isolated since March. feels like there's end sight people refuse wear masks and/or think whole thing hoax. guy said fully opening schools early August won‚Äôt require masks classrooms, bus. said parents keep kids home virtual learning want to. said attempt social distance classroom. schools see 30-35 students classroom recirculated air rooms windows. schools already issues keeping soap bathrooms regular year. idea he‚Äôs going keep cleaned this, teachers must use money regular year buy cleaning supplies. Yes. still extrapolate data positives make estimates. That‚Äôs lot it. evidence upper respiratory tract viruses survive longer cold, dry environment, reason better simply people spend time indoors. summer Sun Belt many people spend time indoors AC. says clearly said May. Oh please. People use blanket terms allow craft whatever narrative want.

The damaged done either way. point, something going give. deaths causes 5x normal. Can't Covid Deaths blame everything else.... 

Our governor trash. Unless live here, please refrain praising telling us bad shit here. majority peaceful protesting ... say it‚Äôs riots disingenuous That's even counting many people simply ""believe"" things emotional scale. people simply see something, without actually reading it, tricked words ignore entire article. mean, many times reddit see someone complaining something nothing article, single word mentioned? matter country study comes from?

Yes, certain degree. countries, even US States great reputation recording data presenting facts.

Just fact ""excess deaths"" concept easily measured, confirms countries covering data. quote Whew thank Dr. Kudlow. getting worried minute Yeah watching since Wuhan predictions never wrong early. Usually week early. Sometimes more. random system actual random human variables would expect case. 

I think see things like one town hit super hard next town fine, virus spread across landscape like fine mist. actual random event human variables would see. Whether small town gets infected could depend whether guy goes certain church got elevator B went visit banker last month. real talk, Earth US going deal climate change? Something far slower less evident Damn, right. participated one testing blitzes free, even though symptoms. waited eleven days results. feel exploited.  Science facts never stopped anyone conveniently placing blame elsewhere. bookmark says 'Coronavirus Update (Live): 79,565 Cases 2,619 Deaths COVID-19 Wuhan China Virus Outbreak - Worldometer'. Must good old days. That's daily count Maybe he's talking Peter Noone Herman's Hermits. He, could predicted this! understand point temperature checks anywhere. People spread COVID without fever. Also, tend run hot ear forehead thermometers mouth ones, imagine others well would sent home ""fever"" others ill would deemed healthy. Hahahahahahahahahahahaha ..... \*breath\* ....

I'll get test give mom little peace mind. pretty much corroborating I'm saying. Yes wearing mask particularly comfortable, necessary, people brain matter use regardless need so. People wearing they're extremely uncomfortable making excuses though. public health one's wearing mask right thing do. Specially grand scheme they're particularly fun wear, million things wear uncomfortable wearing mask, yet power every day.  parents live Louisiana, berated warning back January/Late February took seriously closed churches. they've opened churches parents think safe greet shake hands folks going church. I'm waiting get point, give trying reason unreasonable. ""Global cases novel coronavirus surpassed 9 million Monday, Brazil India grappled surge infections, United States, China hard-hit countries reported new outbreaks, according Reuters tally."" real time? like last 12 weeks ""flattening curve?"" Non-US redditors: lot ""anti-maskers"" country US thing? nurses going strike? think it‚Äôs time. area south, people arent wearing masks Yup. remember back Europe opening schools actually events analyze causation sub talking non stop swimming pool Missouri real indication anything. minority US decided entire US opting herd immunity. first part Adria tournament, contact him. telling 900k people die heart disease every year 90% caused fast food? would like see study shows correlation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Heart Disease byproduct many things, genetic environmental, age related diseases. Jobs sedentary for-profit companies produce highly addicted additive loaded food. Many 'fast food' companies produce highly addicted products 'fast food' companies make brand producing healthy products.  


The average age first incident heart attack 65.6 according 

&amp;#x200B;

Near height infection Italy, reported cardiac arrests 58%

  


So non-diagnosed COVID19 gets recorded cardiac arrest, state 900k people die every year would 522,000 people annually would approximate range COVID19 related death. 3 months data maximum limit around 174,000 excess cardiac events US date that's true. account infection rate understand probably around half that. find data years numbers compared years can't tell there's increase not. rate provided frequency event provided Italy, apply COVID19 infection rate general area able within range provide rate area.  


So able look areas adopted wearing masks social distancing versus areas compare cardiac events see measures positive impact data. 2200 positives week old, according state‚Äôs data dashboard. due delay date collection date test results processed reported. positive rate yesterday‚Äôs 11,000 tests won‚Äôt fully known week (potentially more), it‚Äôs likely even worse seems. thought debunked. make announcement back away next day? Yeah mean definitely sound like hater comment, it‚Äôs pretty nuts. Lots people going absolutely crazy couldn‚Äôt go hangout bar. 

I get able work job, that‚Äôs different issue entirely. ‚ÄúThere serious agency report violations to...‚Äù Sounds like job government oversight authority.

I‚Äôm sure coalitions private service providers little say gets formally recommended... /s I‚Äôm sorry, seem like really easy things adjust pandemic can‚Äôt afford work. 

I‚Äôm best description seen this. Nice work going kill cares. let get sick, build immunity, grandma protected. 10 times population way International trade/commerce taking place. Trump fucked up, think nature America made bad place virus like show up. would fudging numbers control. case US, Deluge? think ""evil"" word looking for. add this. class employees told job depends getting convicted rape, murder, felony assault, hosting dog fights, using drugs, etc.

Yet, kinds things unheard among pro athletes. absolutely get become carrier coronavirus. read article? found rate positives different rate positives general populations already testing sites. That, coupled fact that, overall still seeing decline new cases (while positive test rate continued trend downwards), indicates protests minimal impact COVID-19 spread state. ‚ÄúThere serious agency report violations to...‚Äù Sounds like job government oversight authority. 

I‚Äôm sure coalitions private service providers little say gets formally recommended... /s mentioned post responded to. Currently covid spreading faster Florida state - point recent decisions helping get lower? local health agency. aren‚Äôt staffed enough reckon could enlist cops worst come sto worst military.

And Eu isn‚Äôt opening US spreading like Wildfire free travel union normally They‚Äôll keep talking shit. got demolished civil war still talking shit that. Viral shedding refers release environment ‚Äì including air surfaces. Huang said necessarily lead infection others, research needed find coronavirus could replicate human cells. still certain whether asymptomatic patients infect others ‚Äì World Health Organisation said early month remained ‚Äúa big open question‚Äù.

I impression China include asymptomatic patients infected, sure transmit virus others? missing? government recognize - daily report provide, also includes chart weekly death entire country compares previous years. open missing numbers.  virus killing people bad thing virus evolutionarily speaking, virus weaker symptoms still incredibly infectious therefore successful Take away sports,movies,parks,schools it‚Äôs wonder. It‚Äôs miserable outlets normally have. It‚Äôs worse people mental health issues. No, China dedicated fudging real numbers like since start. Wow, really? unexpected demented parent leaves stove burns house down, walks house aimlessly wanders traffic, falls steps, thousand horrible outcomes. 

They pass away peacefully sleep like movies. sure arguing that! still remains many exceptions border totally closed like many think. Sounds like like assume. riots I'm reffering shit that's happened city others. understand protests, I'm dumb, assume like there's riots bad people ignoring protests. news reported riots lot protests gets attention. Pretty much anyone works one-on-one college students sees close quarters normal day-to-day scenario, actually includes professors office hours. teaching scenarios call close contact university settings well. sister academic advisor-- normally sees students across small desk small office, one another. Low-wage workers like dining hall employees/janitors also pretty close contact students normally.

Some things brought online fairly easily can't. sister working home. many, many staff members universities normally worked (physically) closely students pre-covid. total propaganda. fooled.

1. ""the average person ¬£10 million total remuneration effective tax rate 21 percent ‚Äì that‚Äôs less someone median earnings ¬£30,000.""

That means person earning ¬£10m paying ¬£2 million pounds year treasury directly. also employing people money paying wages salaries get taxed, likely spending paying vastly VAT. probably using NHS taking welfare using many services. probably means ¬£30k earner over-taxed strangely never spun way.

2. ""This led disproportionately high tax burden placed poor, chronic underfunding public services lends support bogus narrative need implement severe austerity measures"".

That person earning 30k pa probably paying around 10k income tax. 10m earner paying 200 times more. total nonsense suggest ""bearing burden"" rich pay nothing. importantly chronic underfunding public services nothing HMRC's tax take. tax income country doubled overnight really think extra money would spent hospitals schools? Fuck no, would used look peers rich donors, probably increase MPs salaries, used buy votes via tax CUTS wealthy like always is. Underfunding due policy, lack income. government quite nicely us is.

3. ""80 percent 1,000 working age adults thought tax avoidance morally wrong""

Tax avoidance cannot morally wrong. moral issue all. people pay minimum amount fundamental principle taxation. intended adversarial process. That's everyone hates HMRC, side. 

Directors companies legal fiduciary duty act best interests shareholders. imagine would happen company said ""we pay ¬£100,000 tax year chosen pay ¬£1m profits instead morally right"". even able find lawyer represent charges.

The one thing article got right international tax system fundamentally broken. tax laws places like US UK fucking complicated nobody even understand them. experts chapter area no-one understands whole mess. reason clusterfuck exemptions loopholes, gaps double taxes, mistakes attempts patch built decades like pigeon shit statue. government really wanted avoid mess would throw whole thing start something fairer. that? know would reduce tax grab ¬£30k earners want money. would increase tax companies want employing people, spending money voting them. instead? pay idiots like ""Citizens Financial Justice"" start PR spin campaign government cake eat too.

In words great Ben Goldacre (who talking tax all) appropriate unsexy response crap ""I think find bit complicated that"". proven effective anyone. never said wasn‚Äôt problem. one saying problem. article psychological worries HCWs doesn‚Äôt really support that. 

If find article psychologist talking nurses saying there‚Äôs shortage equipment would never take proof. would say anecdata. Standard A2.5.1.7 Member shall facilitate repatriation seafarers serving ships call ports pass territorial internal waters, well replacement board.


I MLC ISM auditor. makes head hang shame knowing keen ports punish vessels MLC violations give fuck themselves. ordinance go effect making face masks mandatory indoors, thing businesses basically expected police know county won‚Äôt punish them. work restaurant inside hotel 250 person wedding ballroom, masks. It‚Äôs infuriating. Would surprising given SARS never happen people refusing work, Federal Govt give anymore money CERB. I‚Äôm Chicago looking bigger place neighborhood. homes listed covid already far fewer market now. Places list going pretty fast. it‚Äôs supply buyer interest around well. number seems high Yeah difficult situation sure novel virus pandemic got worry health Canadians first worry rest another time. slow act reasons listed. 

With current admin south, might well close since good relationship right can't trust care safety can't even bothered care citizens. honestly looking specific examples clickbait headlines journalism millions fucking articles produced year? Cmon dude. 

&amp;#x200B;

Its easy. profit media financial incentive create many views boost advertising revenue. run old tired shit clickbaity headline, will.  


Not sure argue opposite good faith honestly man. also City Memphis affect suburban cities parts county. ease anxiety look charts positive cases, deaths age deaths state. realized get Covid age group 2% death rate. realize long term side affects do? take precautions. like one person comes town within week hundred infected via secondary tertiary infections. doesn‚Äôt spread evenly across terrain like mustard gas. people much much infective others. There‚Äôs quite lot know assume virus. Seems smart. NOT! -Borat making assumption juen 15th first time talked since then. I've watching pressers, talked well, quickest article could pull call bullshit Here's another link:

 let natural selection take course. Maybe weed stupid gene pool. Floridian here. everyone else know super pissed wait weeks. made much progress get fucked over. list states? I‚Äôve pointed smart decisions continue make addressing nursing home. multiple. 

I explained logic don‚Äôt believe action necessary. taking data driven approach. 

You free point flaws logic. tried read article. judgement OP, damn Newsweek, many popups slides notifications everything else made unreadable.

When Newsweek become bad clicky click bait news? don‚Äôt get news Fox still it‚Äôs obvious, thousands people packed shoulder shoulder almost every city America, how‚Äôd think gonna turn out? Yes. They've power forever. 

On hand - federal requirement gives legal protection. Half hospitals even proper PPE cousin who's medical army front lines it. even asked mom given proper PPE.... ill listen virologist people US soon fed BS time. Lmao guy probs can‚Äôt even hold conversation barista without sweating. Extroverts make insecure. based much money throw it, long time vaccine trials take determine safe

That long takes scale production distribution. 4,000 cases day, around 400, 8,000 hospitalized, 1,100. Deaths, ICU beds, Ventilator usage continue drop. upticks anything opening yet, beaches parks open well month well.  Well, faking done two ways. also goose numbers up. study yesterday showing 25 deaths 20% people hospice. person count COVID deaths already dying. callous maybe COVID moved date death weeks person dying already COVID nothing that. quite say NY successful compared southern states virus already ravaged NY shifted southern states. Give couple weeks southern states stabilize trend downward well. 

I believe 50 states virus control August. forget they'll people lung|organ|all kinds other| damage. Florida rise leadership 1 Desantis!!!!!!!! /S Cruising boring. wasteful form entertainment  tried get test days ago CVS walgreens drive testing like 12 sites within hour drive they're booked next week. separate company walk-in testing found 100 people line constantly ""rapid results"" walk-in testing sites \~20 people line find result lab 7-10 days later. 


After days trying scramble find test, started feeling better gave trying get tested. Really goes ""it's bad India"" headlines I've seen posted good news I‚Äôve change route walk dog tourists congregating outside bar near apartment Nashville. I‚Äôd rather walk corona cloud. Vault already employee test positive.

Honestly; comparatively Marc bad. Far tell actually respecting capacity guidelines. 

 Zelicks seems best, probably cause they're outside square. They're actually trying function 25% capacity, letting people crowd bar turning people away door.

The Vault packed. Every day. Line door packed. don‚Äôt think people, including political leaders, understand stuff resurface easily. can‚Äôt expect something go extinct it‚Äôs still available habitat Protest led spike cases.

This happens get news Fox. like predictable. Burying head sand effective preventative measure. Anything legal right work state. literally say ""he good fit"". crippling even people. are. DHHS secretary stated concerned. VP Dr. Birx called state asked what's going on. Sorry, tried make simple possible. is, all, internets definitions explanation terms found. I'm summarizing, lecturing. already concerned, maybe good thing realizing might good idea. mean you‚Äôre still gonna Karen‚Äôs gonna fight matter idiot conservative youtubers...you‚Äôre cutting big chunk hopefully shutting mouths complying whether agree know. 24,000 deaths. Wonder southern state beat that. Doubt it. European politicians discreetly relieved Trump closed border. USA majorly jumpy kind stuff, closed weeks would otherwise. NY still got wave similar Eastern France / Switzerland / Italy least rest EU get contacts epicenter (there many flights EU NYC). agree 100%

Except contact tracing abilities suck, seems total lack desire public agencies link infections protests, probably never get definitive answer. Apparently people saying vaccine could developed next year so. understand SARS vaccine trials turn well vaccines average take 5-10 years develop. vaccine found next year get not? I‚Äôm anti vaxxer timeline seems short develop safe vaccine I‚Äôm sarcastic here, but: indoor activities worry me. NJ handling better states? Masks? would news editor lead covid protests? Covid change much day day, gonna 2nd story run something important happening.

I swear, people want see media conspiracy would make choices. silly. Thats fair question, one wondered well.

As understand it, goal break infection chains. comprehensive mean undertaken. binary, still effective slowing spread even miss presymptomatic asymptomatic spread.

I'm kind expert though, kind specialized background.  Maybe people standing behind shut Oils bad, saturated fats least bad, probably worse. Sorry crash keto-bro-science-history people eaten vegetable oils regularly starting 20th century. Canada decent entry opportunity educated and/or skilled worker. possible go north. Mitch McConnell. power empty centers. chose keep them. agree, crowd right like 'but muh freedom threatened mask! want haircut frozen margs! Trump nashun!' 

Then left like 'You idiots need stay home quit spreading virus! Hold on, gonna gather large masses across country weeks. Fuck police!' 

At least one crowds real cause tried wear masks none good time. media great keeping people polarized showing telling group WANT hear making story crazy real life becomes self fulfilling prophecy they're inserting ideas people watching. God hate politically charged country is. That‚Äôs true, percent GDP US international trade smaller Canada America could afford trade war China

The difference people actually listen government Canada america 

&amp;#x200B;

How spike now? job manage people's emotions. litterally wants people die brings joy selfish reasons. I'm depressed. I'm meds myself. Despite depression hurt people hope get hurt.

Depression get jail free card shitty behavior wishing ill death people. ""me"". chose say something fucked insensative public forum ok he's depressed? comment reddit like get replies. Oklahoma City went Trump 2016 flipped back blue 2018 midterm. probably cutting colds flus places people less, also interrupting vaccination screening programs developing world help control likes polio, measles, TB. Oh man that‚Äôs fuckin wonderful. starting relax bad virus is. Idgaf much hate Trump. CCP overall unethical culture Chinese forever remain miles worse. Good catch, you‚Äôre right article republish multiple news outlets, link original. talked two weeks June 1st, June 15th 4 weeks. June 20th means 4 weeks. Presumably talking simple conversation gathering date scientific information make informed decisions. course, Fauci's job reason Trump 'talking' frequently. based real date Fauci talked Trump two weeks. Im sorry wrong regarding timeline. repeated incubation experiments done asymptomatic carrier samples found good indication weather patient asymptomatic pre-symptomatic

* asymptomatic - virus replication samples incubation experiment, likely infectious shedding viable virus

* presymptomatic - virus replication samples incubation experiment, likely infectious seem shedding viable virus Unfortunately backlog deaths coming week, Gov. given number said fairly substantial. sure point week #1 ranking going look better. Outside tweet maybe indications briefing think released whole lot info explaining it. people who:

1. Opened salons bars covid contained.
2. Fail wear masks.
3. Ice cream man made mask order.

Yeah... can't trust say point. remember everyone like ""We need reopen economy ASAP, need get testing send clean workers work.""

I said ""That creates economic caste system where, fault own, must live destitute. people forging/fudging test results people back work sick. need solution that's everyone, Lockdown is."" harness would probably go long way. can‚Äôt tell actually asking genuinely concerned, working multiple test sites N.H. (National Guard). sites Keene, Londonderry, Concord, Lancaster, etc... there‚Äôs several. encourage walk ons. plenty tests I‚Äôve yet see site run test kits work day. contamination taken top priority everyone proper PPE job test kits always protected. Anyone says cannot find tests N.H. either lying haven‚Äôt tried hard find site. Results generally take 2-5 days depending many tests labs get given day. could hardly call what‚Äôs happened New York success. different timing. 100% agree delay unemployment. atrocious sure. sure mask comment I've seen 3 press conferences last week wearing properly. 

Our positive cases seem younger demo history shown us less vulnerable. 86% FL deaths 65 90 died 65. obviously sad data shows populations infected high fatality rates. 

Saw heads hospitals last week state less ICS patients height this. also saying steroid use early tremendously helps. 

Also....I see another lockdown happening. However, I've enjoyed cooking home wife hate it! Disney smartly,remains closed. doin there, Universal? I‚Äôve heard friends went, takes people 10 days get result, time could easily contract virus, it‚Äôs pretty useless.

Once think may exposed take test supposed self-quarantine, easy get infected waiting results. exactly reason guidelines place. stupid kids likely die flu. think maybe give kids someone else. Weekend numbers generally low catch Monday. Nationally Friday heaviest Sunday lightest. We're 15-19% depending day - see tab 3 spreasheet lmaoo been. What's going in? 

Florida here. know. sucks. mean personally home owner, property taxes went 10% near seven year drought raising them. I'm saying jump 34% chunk change. number one reason many Americans wear masks Donald Trump. Fauci gone reverse stance though. say about... quite people Automod like posts about.

Yeah, fucked message, he's dedicated every second airtime get correcting that. certain orange someone would listen... Cool, see comment posted. That‚Äôs way refutation inference based phylogenetic bracketing COVID probably produces long lasting immune response. Unfortunately people don‚Äôt think like you. guys sick. Fucking sociopaths Reddit coming woodwork agree everything revolves around US. put ‚Äúthe country‚Äù first comment without specifying. Yeah. Pubs, restaurants etc still closed UK, shops opened last week. UK reacted late least kept order place sensible amount time. ironic coming WHO. people attacking police jailed case deported country origin.

We nice country, attacking police declaration war society.

My thanks goes cops serving people. feel deeply. concrete proof, evidence suggests, far, possible get again. get T2D fat sugar, sugar. relatively new discovery, known while. Fat diet accumulate muscles (""marbling"" call animal farming) happens, muscle cells stop responding insulin flowing around blood; insulin trying tell cell open take sugar blood; that's insulin resistance slowly gets also reversed, assuming pancreas still working. Quebec Canadas hardest hit province, nice hear! 

Lots love - Manitoba I‚Äôve seen much pessimism phase 3 tough get past comment really nice see. one vaccine already reaching phase 3 surely promising. fuck call foreigner illegally residing country?

Why insist downplaying illegality actions? straight believe borders?

I expect actually answer this, seem kinda stupid, rhetorical questions audience. not, also renders idea ""this contact tracing app cannot track you"" completely wrong. setup location architecture makes possibility needs confronted instead hand-waved away.

The article linked elsewhere says still possible, even unstable workaround:

""The Apple-Google decision allow GPS data collection contact tracing system require public health authorities want access GPS location rely Apple Google described unstable, battery-draining workarounds. ""

This entire article OP example tech journalists taking press release word interrogating further. field work Yakima area noted massive number fruit processing plants, fruit picking etc. imagine lot set like meat processing, people close together?! Also, imagine lot Yakima population foreign temporary workers? seen issues rapid virus spread temporary workers, various reasons. I‚Äôm little bit lost thing deaths since China reported less 5000 deaths. supposedly disease spread US numbers say otherwise.

Maybe I‚Äôm wrong don‚Äôt think said 100% children could infected, symptoms severe, mild. average, still heavily true. Yes I‚Äôve read Kawasaki-like disease coming children, overwhelming majority still unphased. numerous reports (granted US) stated reopening schools led rise cases. fun fact, reports primarily European, Chinese. better?

According Worldometers, 98% mild now. Seems higher 80%. Even accounting number aren‚Äôt admitted bed-ridden, large majority cases still mild.

Maybe countries cancelled flights China, wouldn‚Äôt left China? Honestly that‚Äôs every country still allowed travel to/from China beginning. Even so, report stating already Italy December. come January, keeping China window regardless said.

They say need concern? called ‚ÄúPublic Health Emergency International Concern‚Äù. Could officially declared pandemic sooner? Probably. Would made big difference countries anyway react accordingly PHEIC? Probably not. Would made difference countries listened ‚Äúwindow opportunity‚Äù already made border closures among others, rather waiting end? Honestly, yes, we‚Äôd still worldwide reckon.

I mean know it‚Äôs Hot bag China right now, point, it‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs fault. need lie questionnaire order get approved. Say symptoms even Thanks clarification, see many posts. ""Covid spread long x, y, z"" different statement ""covid spread"". Unfortunately based photos protests everyone took advice. lost credibility lack self control Compared NY, competent governor (or, least adult capable learning adapting), walk CVS, Walgreens, etc. get test within minutes. jump deaths usually follow every jump cases two weeks later. Assuming virus mutate time, maybe. happened initially success hit first hardest.

What happened since March 15 New York absolutely success can't comment unless New York see change state.. mentality people. That's one. I‚Äôve read, people long term side effects much older experienced bad symptoms. Every nurse I've ever known, answer question ""What's weirdest thing ever pulled someone's ass?"". answer never ""Nothing, I've never pull anything someone's ass"". protests sparking absolutely huge outbreaks, several groups tests protesters turned low percentage positive. think cities careful masks also careful reopening (Seattle, NYC) cities South masks ridiculous reopening. 

So formula Stupid Reopening + Sloppy Protests = cases. 

Whereas Masked Reopening + Partially Masked Protests = obvious outbreak far. many BLM protesters wear masks, whereas 'freedom fighters' intentionally, purposefully congregating without masks prove work. able provide link? Add first comment voted oblivion watch everyone stop voting it. moving goal posts, said 3 days since fauci said talked two weeks. That's we're discussing. aware ways we're causing big problems future, alien invasion might optimistic thing; maybe could help us. absolutely committed going don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs significant risk hiking Black Hills Reddit: breeding ground doom gloom everyone expert. Go back r/neoliberal dude, you‚Äôre incapable coherent good faith discussions. much typing! little evidence. job prove silly conjectures. Actually difference wild dogs domestic canines.

They completely different species. confident ignorance, humility, might learn something. suggest ""just walking past people"" either, one thing I've noticed lot people getting smarter blocking aisle shopping cart. 

People (at least Aachen) gotten lot better pulling way let pass them. ? look comment responded took consideration wear mask**. Easy task. Apparently hard task Americans.. mean Mississippi might forgot email password... yeah that's pathetic / criminal level cover thing wake Americans world wide pandemic world wide pandemic hit face. 

This America‚Äôs ‚ÄúI‚Äôll believe see it‚Äù.

Half year they‚Äôve talking shit New Yorkers wearing masks. they‚Äôll drowning bed wondering why. - know wild thing imagine - masks actually little effect? way live tbh. People saying lol. People saying show us proof. -Doctors = infallible, made besr judgment could given available information (lack of) resources 

-This occured mid March, time experts docs still early stages learning virus, time difficult separate covid flu

-any implication docs somehow""wronged"" patient false. True form Mouth swab brain stab? People waiting 72 hours test weeks ago mouth swab test. thinking changed somewhere September 2020 mid 2021 late 2020. Looks like Arizona took Trump‚Äôs advice. Actually flying Denver driving South Dakota Badlands Nat'l Park, Wind Cave, etc. Figured would work best since SD never really shut begin with, Rapid City, SD low numbers. 

Our Airbnb Rapid City emailed us back concerned 13 total cases city. heart tell coming city thousands lol. It‚Äôs happens people tested matters. Isolating time test results received? Isolating 14 days least test date confirmed positive? Quick trace, test isolation contacts positives? Testing without isolation tracing pointless. deaths nowhere near March April numbers track assuming somehow things magically change without us anything? think ideals foundation problem. 20th 21st century generations raised idea USA greatest country default. we‚Äôve decades complacency real grasp effort takes stay great. It‚Äôs like wants virus familiar NC? areas tourist areas kind impact tourism having, any? brain says tourist areas would east coast (beach), map isn‚Äôt showing major outbreaks there. symptom easily hidden couple ibuprofen. Take easy vitamin D, unless getting blood tests monitor levels. intelligent lockdown about? think America better without president. Instead voting symbolic figures White House, better focusing issues actually matter, like financial institutions lobbyists regulations Funnily enough numbers coming areas affected protests possible reasons

Under reporting - Deliberate - know that's thing (it always been) probably responsible level decoupling.

Young people - understand it, higher proportion positives young people probably know they're less likely get serious case summer bars etc open

More testing - positives found percent positive high 5%) means they're concentrating people think vs random testing suggests ""more testing"" statistical dependency thing He's King d00mers. likely be. People gonna less likely wear facemask social distance cruise ship obviously, means flu spread easily ships. Flu + Covid-19 probably good, especially ship. SARS 1 vaccine effort suffered major setbacks animal testing stage. massive reactions. happen Covid, first batch animals studies safe excellent results. long term side effect studies bit compressed, I'm worried part long term side effects non-live vaccines extremely rare. rush came running trial production side side. Unless sort pre-existing condition, really scary. highly unlikely contract COVID. one unlucky ones do, extremely high probability fine. 

If read sensationalist headlines understand may scared. unfortunate media likes hyper focus case counts things like recoveries. Case fatality rate lower; possibilities young people infected, better hospital treatments, virus mutation, sunlight - vitamin D. clue talking about, close. country immune. think said countries immune?

This huge population Florida risk. world reopened school without spike cases.

The US prematurely reopened without ending first wave, June numbers basically starting look like March/April numbers.  eg: lot people getting sick dying. 

I guess ending first wave read avoided ""spike"" ... damn, that's terrible waste human life. yo idiot. get first sentence.

But people right free speech, assembly, protest, - cause aligns viewpoint. 

We don‚Äôt restrict speech assembly based whether think topic important justified. Well since single city South anywhere near size New York City, might right. 

But since many South proven ignorant.. maybe Florida Texas state surpass New York. Plenty time left year. parents drive kids car too. Motor vehicle crashes leading cause death kids 18. Covid doesn‚Äôt even touch death stats car crashes. don‚Äôt see clutching pearls wagging finger people letting children get vehicles. Wonder is? really know parents kids they're school? go aftercare programs summer camps- closed lockdown. people may lucky enough family nearby help, midst pandemic that's mowing elderly, parents eager ship little germ factories grandma's house.

Our summer camps cancelled daycare closed, alternative point hire nanny. However, vast majority people can't actually afford that. evidence this? seems like wild speculation I‚Äôm confused. got next-day appointment results 24 hours.

Following pattern, Millennials *should* defined 1/1/82-12/31/99, would also fitting name. alive, 18, turn millennium. Damn, feeling situation India? [look good](http://worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india), there's textbook exponential growth. 51 think people trying say masks magic bullet. bare minimum people doing. people refusing even bare minimum. Cool.

So seeing thousands thousands pneumonia deaths season?

Are claiming second shadow disease causing second pandemic? type things work out. SMH. Enough people diagnosed recovered serious concern science would shouting roof tops. death rates low recoveries high three countries compared US? nobody uses Bing Unbelievable , US company failed state, 2 poor developing nations.  much winning! believe infection numbers then?   mention thread decreasing death rate? state, no. certainly federal thing. Lol going post link shocked pikachu face much better. lot easier bans people visiting patients hospitals.  30-35 kids per classroom even legal? mean businesses area, right? 

I wear mask work people can‚Äôt resist expressing pity wear one. Little realize care would wear one even required. It‚Äôs also foolish express employees cannot let genuine opinion matter known work. I'm saying accounts lot drop, least get big rises places. people wearing masks - also hundreds people gathering large groups protesting - always individuals wearing masks groups, means chance infection. chance coronavirus anywhere threat coronavirus everywhere. Yup. Yeah, get that, even government mandating it, push back medical advice? people take 3/10 days antibiotics ""I feel sick anymore"" back doc office complaining month? medical advice become political? Well, hopefully someone speaking huge event location city mandates mask usage, wear mask, get fined. :-) Hrm. extremely homogeneous nations. thing, you.


What direction speaking of? watching documentary Quincy Jones life. documentary followed brain aneurism, heart attack, diabetic coma, major blood clots. struck symptoms described. symptoms exactly many longterm Covid sufferers going right - cold sweats, shortness breath, chest pain, extreme headaches, reactions sugar alcohol, tachycardia, sudden weakness dizziness, confusion, loss appetite, even loss consciousness...all symptoms every single medical site tells seek immediate medical assistance for. things daily norms mean nothing doctors Emergency Rooms medical clinics.

I healthy, fit underlying medical conditions this... Hey man, I'm saying am.

But think human nature take granted seems like amazing things people. people, face face interactions important technology.So respect sorta see point view, even agree it. I‚Äôve got friends valley there, hope it‚Äôs stays :( Agreed. people governments selfish, though. them, convenience lockdown worth inconvenience bunch deaths care. LOL know this.

This campaign ad. dared get close restaurants, stores go (a bit south SLC) maybe 25% people wearing masks. Maybe less? family friends live Arizona can't tell regardless much testing people care virus take precautions. Many people wkthout masks going restaurants stuff weeks ago. lack common sense. statistically estimated rate 30 days they'll 490k cases Californias current rate 355k 30 days, that's failure leadership also information lack effort population folks help? make masks send you? buy things send you? answer this, unfortunately, going come federal government, going come Americans helping Americans. earn way buy way in. they‚Äôre politics it‚Äôs usually latter. Nothing virus justifies lockdown. also know rebound, regionally, health care system collapses.

It takes lot resources stabilize hospitals overwhelmed surge. Medical staff, cleaning staff, medication, body bags, refrigerator trucks, money convert waiting rooms wards.

And lot money undo changes waves.

Hospitals converting trauma surgical units COVID-19 treatment areas. agree. wear mask everywhere I'm starting dislike everyone wearing one. Selfish assholes. thoughts borderline impossible trace certain point. access random encounters people subject mass gathering. Even used location services everyone's phones track down, would still woefully unequipped actually perform relevant tracing might able isolate exposure, reliably trace exposure cross exposures. literally attempt quantify exponential nature spread illness. Eventually administrative process outweighed speed spread. Trump makes nurgle proud. ...we deliver emperors justice. article many quotes taken people still suffering permanent organ damage mild cases. That‚Äôs article about. Healthy young owls eat right exercise getting mild cases needing lung transplants worse. 

Bad cases you‚Äôre dead days. know bad cases look like-it‚Äôs local storage places cleaned prep body storage. you‚Äôd think put stock medical experts across globe trying tell him.

I guess he‚Äôs interested kissing Trumps ass protecting people state? 0.99-1.7 /100

Our current meatplant outbrak Germany started religious service couple people May 5. 1,300.

U dont need lot people catch it. U need people catch carry communities.

If u demographic group running around roughly 1% active infection (not antibodies) u serious problem hand. Well, quite literally give shit - or, accurately, rides along shit. northwest PA. Put house up, one week later offer. wait buyer get loan move to.....Arizona..... far 0 cases Ontonagon county western Upper Michigan well. Rugged wild. 99.9% trees water. anything asshat wants slow testing, leave decisions states, dismisses science, exactly. Besides keeping buisnesses running make money. Seems like saying testing fevers safe, precautions necessary.

Its kinda like cdc said people stupid wear masks false sense security we‚Äôll tell wear mask. saying kiss girlfriend get COVID-19? Wow I'm gonna go read some. Thanks understand saying. However, Guillain-Barre syndrome specific enough symptoms clearly recognized. OP article says:

""Patients suffering phantom pains, memory loss, personality changes, psychological issues extreme fatigue, along lungs won‚Äôt heal, even months discharged hospital...""

If people reported symptoms like COVID vaccination, matter child affected ways routine immunizations, detected? (Would kid ""extreme fatigue"" vaccine show trials vaccine administered 6 weeks?)

What wondering post was: considering harmful effects diseases immune mediated, something *about* vaccinations makes cause harmful immune reactions lower rate disease would have, cause harmful immune reactions (or even higher?) rate mitigating direct harm disease? seems cluster unfortunate facts here: (1) diseases trigger harmful immune responses, (2) vaccines designed trigger immune responses, (3) harmful immune responses sometimes vague symptoms. worry things happen, long trials measure them, risk would much less risk disease. worry things hard measure may even quantifiable trials. Plus, discussing vaccine safety going get political soon fact measurement centered. latest figure saw 51% Stockholm nursing homes. figure rough, main point feel Sweden pointing blame private nursing homes rather policies, countries appears similar numbers elderly home residents impacted. started smoking cigarettes drinking coffee suppress hunger. spiraled control there. look deaths, Guilford (Greensboro) behind Mecklenburg (Charlotte). Raleigh Durham confirmed cases neither close amount deaths Greensboro. I‚Äôd really like know aren‚Äôt populated touristy. Same. haven‚Äôt left house three months guess I‚Äôm leaving time soon. county one worst rates infection now. Great thing higher brain function ability override instincts...

To extent, seems point made here. kid stupid don‚Äôt know much bad effect school closures people behaved Memorial Day weekend large gatherings, many states re-opening large scale protests hundreds upon hundreds thousands across nation hand hand....this going away anytime soon us... Husband got tested 10 days ago. Still results. real journalism, would follow up.

As though, media interested actually informing you. Brazil I'm betting mild anxiety issues well based things going. super careful still work. Yesterday started showing mild symptoms I'm getting tested. pretty fucking scary tbh. Might covid. Maybe there's sudden rush of, uh, rattlesnake bites require ICU stay? think wearing mask makes wuss, even though primary purpose mask protect everyone else person wearing it. bet ice cream sales down, too. problem virus, policy stop people depend livelihood....so ?

They need find new livelihood. sucks that's ""choice"" virus made us.

Unless think bars nightclubs worth .28% world dying. realizing many going business anyway people going go bars normally matter law is. got fined dollar every demonstrably false statement. fact political articles allowed speech banned lays bare glaring hypocrisy subreddit. moderators really ashamed behaviour, stifles intelligent, informed debate. feel ashamed laughing this, that's good one. still stopping wild wet markets comprehensively, mean, mean it. China something mean it, obvious everyone mean it. resolve yet seen. leaders keep moving goal posts say things aren‚Äôt getting worse.. even going cabin middle nowhere (within 8-10 hrs) good idea?

Besides bathrooms way there, worry about? coworker filed lawsuit company worked for, sexual harassment owner told lawyers drag case long possible make suffer. finally reached meager settlement mean time lost house couldn‚Äôt find new employment. system setup help average joe. There‚Äôs multiple articles showing protests little effect positive covid cases comment aging like fine wine :P I‚Äôm PA far NJ, can‚Äôt find decent place PA I‚Äôve looking year. hesitated one house like much, much larger looking sold within day anyway. sold house NJ 2 days 40K ask realtor set price pretty high IMO. That's good first step. gives us 50% hospital capacity, huge sad use self-censoring techniques get around pointless word filters, certain people charge admit wrong.

Just like lot mess going pandemic certain pol***cians said big deal can't admit wrong.

Human arrogance comes sizes. I‚Äôm surprised Mississippi one states. work nonessential retail customers don‚Äôt wear masks. also still try get right face like isn‚Äôt deadly pandemic. discussion someone back. nursing home burned ground everyone inside, count every death burn victim want marked cancer, heart disease, dimentia? doctor gave someone triple dose morphine never woke up? medical malpractice mark stroke? covid fuck people up, sometimes people preexisting conditions sometimes not, can't arbitrarily treat differently every cause death.

but even did, figure world suddenly killing 200k americans previous year two weeks won‚Äôt surge deaths. think college actually affected much outside labs. Adults much better dealing interactive web meeting. taking classes last semester actually enjoyed lectures moving online. long professor takes seriously decent set missing much. Totally. went around town bike friday night. People everywhere.  masks. FYI - major re-elected also Jaws 2. got voted implying Florida's response COVID-19 still disaster despite plateau curve seemed hitting, fucking idiots still outside without masks spreading shit, got told overblowing bad here.

I want give everyone thought Florida fine big fat ""I fucking told so"". Called super hard weeks fucking right would back square one, we'd shit hard we're actually square negative one right now. think lot world agree  Got tested first time... reading people talk swab back brain, pretty quick painless. closed eyes 2 seconds, feeling like right sneeze.

Fully expecting come back negative (as well antibody test got anyways), preparation returning office, company making everyone get tested. 1A rights, beyond that, protests equality, wanting shitty selfie classmates. need Ian Zierings quadrant, right now! Frankly, lot wild, unsourced speculation flying around, especially early (not stopped now, either).

Fortunately, HIV pretty unique way affects host, signs similar. think they're prove point (that 100% agree with) protesting mean coronavirus disappears. think would gotten complaints black people, think would made lie convincing. Dumbest country around, far. makes lot sense tbh That's I'm thinking, too.

We already built surge. seems inevitable point.

And genuinely good understanding happens health care system collapses.

I work hospital. we've maxed surge capacity, detour patients hospitals.

If hospital one several hours... patients still car accidents, cancer, falls, overdoses, etc.

Italy advantage super fast rail transit system. used high speed rails quickly move patients one hospital another across country.

I work hospital options ambulances life flights. Ya NBC article almost reenforces South Korean findings also. May truly second time infected. Here‚Äôs little something make easier understand. still don‚Äôt Clorox wipes even masks ain‚Äôt going able get vaccine anytime soon folks. Anytime soon. remember wrong immunity. get coming back weaker every time kills you. Grow up. Put god damn mask on, social distance stay fuck away crowds. Morons. makes intelligent, craven, sycophant interested approval role model health well-being constituents.  That's literally damn image that's posted searchable via text: 

You must enable location services order use apps, full stop. way around this, Google allow BT stack leak location anyways (the cited reason Google allowing this)

Your entire comment proves idea devices, especially Android, handle location BT, actual BT tech itself! able enable BT without enabling location tracking ages, API prevent apps using GPS feature all, means app dev work around API!

Don't fucking spread misinformation subject know nothing about. Yeah everyone America flee Cuba. Even people financial resources pick move another country did, still wouldn‚Äôt enough room everyone That‚Äôs opinion, it‚Äôs fact shut China banned travel. that's right China head pocket...

Puh, luckily Trump got could US. /S That‚Äôs needed strict lockdown. Asian countries shut everything everything open worry second wave. Meanwhile Korea dealing while. Same, completely illogical least one covid positive person could start chain reaction. Mostly KKona states ""nothing makes goddamn sense""

I think majority us say multiple times per day watching/reading American news. new normal. Forgive Canadian ignorance Mammoth Mountain California? 

Actually, nothing new me. third summer living grid like gypsy. thing changed year local shopping supplies frequent business rural area avoid spread. husband brings everything city. pretty much stay put little paradise friends visit usual.

You're good friend hope guys awesome time. good place forget that's going world little rest mind, body soul. Wait karaoke even allowed? article says hospitals created dedicated COVID units within ICU's. make sense infection control standpoint hospital put patients COVID unit dedicated team.

That aside, unusual hospitals ""ICU boarders"" time time. Sometimes patient requires particular type bed (telemetry, airborne precautions, etc.) temporarily available wards.

ICU beds inherently expensive. ICU care expensive. Patients ""boarding"" ICU would incurring expenses requiring ICU nurse-to-patient ratios. stated above, hospitals set Covid units ICU isolate patients patients may require intensive level care. Also, patients occasionally stay ICU due lack regular bed available elsewhere hospital. never took seriously. March italy locked smurf festival modo smurfing corona virus...  elders... forget scandal started patients kidney problems (of ages) also turned away.

 absolutely hate time frames associated groups. Theyre ridiculously long. circumstance planet earth would look 40-year-old call fucking millennial. 

Same thing Generation X, I‚Äôm part of. People born something like 1967 considered generation X. Generation X literally Kurt Cobain, 1992 highschoolers born 70s.

If you‚Äôre going name generation, definition generation 10 years absolute maximum. 15 years more. 

1960-1969

1970-1979

Etc. Deadspin used post [something year that] ‚ÄúWe spend first year child's life teaching walk talk rest life shut sit down. There's something wrong there.‚Äù - Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Love quote this. learned ""real life knowledge"" free time now(almost 10 years graduation) podcasts/random books got interest etc. since im older interests, 12 years high-school could've saved much time progression career, general life even personality, shit teach school meaningless real life, unless job guess, even teach school basic basics get punished left without notice middle work. bad humanities culture yet catch technological advancing since still outragious barbaric traditions world need 5 clicks see earth space learn almost knowledge desire asking, imagine that.... Quick question. someone Asthma much death rate increase person? simply isn‚Äôt true. stated above, hospitals set Covid units ICU isolate patients patients may require intensive level care. Also, patients occasionally stay ICU due lack regular bed available elsewhere hospital.  Yeah, although honest might go right places, much anywhere indoors. see occasional people masks outdoors, I've never overheard anything. would want send stuff. country clear now, throw away masks aprons away every use. nurses still frugal them, cleaning job awesome. PPE gets dirty feel guilty anymore. 

Just normal masks 10 5 euro regular shops now. Companies get half price guess? believe majority taking seriously become complacent pre-pandemic lives even thought crisis burns out, let alone actual crisis hits. wearing masks trying find new best way forward, done pandemic lockdown even started. used first hearing aides find gaiters push mouth much push much top nose. That‚Äôs point. ICU bed don‚Äôt require intensive care. hit nail head. 

As stated above, hospitals set Covid units ICU isolate patients patients may require intensive level care. Also, patients occasionally stay ICU due lack regular bed available elsewhere hospital. lies problem though doesn‚Äôt it? given time could turn radio TV look around would think world nice peaceful place wouldn‚Äôt you? think people start taking things seriously gets level movie ‚Äúoutbreak‚Äù people straight dropping streets it‚Äôs literally everywhere turn. That‚Äôs people expecting think pandemic. since don‚Äôt movie version simply think it‚Äôs serious. That‚Äôs little theory. That's rich coming depends happened tested batch. Positivity varies much based testing strategy day day. 500k deaths every year smoking related. 40k secondhand smoke. decent human wear mask, constantly let slip nose? fbi several police districts already using photos protests, facial recognition, cross referencing photos social media identify protestors  truth. Tough governmental action inherently political. rational world, government could trusted communicate candid options based science medicine explain government make certain choices. Then, people could hold government accountable decisions. That's politics too.

Instead, world ""leader free world"" says explore whether treat virus disinfectant injection, since disinfectants work counter tops. try best. hope get better. find NZ wife haha never high blood pressure blood pressure checked. Never diabetes never check blood sugar.

Hell... never go doctor could live short life perfect health! don‚Äôt think knows that. legislation changed law (high) school average class size 25, small classes balance bigger ones keep compliance. aren‚Äôt filling up. Colour fucking beige. Americans decide bored covid? truly surprise virus comply wishes /s couldn‚Äôt help it.

You know there‚Äôs sequel, can‚Äôt say it. can‚Äôt. 2020 massive disconnect federal government citizens US. either need become 50 seperate federations 50 presidents need powerful government created app allow citizens vote issues arise create instant laws.

Otherwise representation represent people want need divide US up. lol sure man! Perhaps kissing cure That's bullshit. America basically outsourced pollution China (and third world countries). Well shit, second wave means it‚Äôs back simply isn‚Äôt true. stated above, hospitals set Covid units ICU isolate patients patients may require intensive level care. Also, patients occasionally stay ICU due lack regular bed available elsewhere hospital.  I'd argue political... stating facts. definitely reason. know many people feel way can't stand home.

Yes, challenge balancing work kids, worth prevent you, family, others getting sick possibly dying. Well, address COVID could stay home observe lockdown.

If nice employer flex around childcare needs let work home. everyone Yeah, that's long term issue. pandemic immediate.

Wrong. COVID inequality immediate issues. Neither immediate solution. pick COVID care about, that‚Äôs issue affects virus care legitimate grievance is. go out, putting everyone around risk.

Black people live society tells every day lives value. white lives risk that‚Äôs Given virus particularly deadly ethnic minorities, protests counterproductive.

So what? Black people STFU? one country. new business non essential, Canadian government shut down. running long enough get CERB government assistance, work security slightly money people sitting home (but half much used make) get spat occasion. great. insane me. literally requires basic precautions, somehow people incapable those. Ask 2008 recession predictions worked out.... what? cant drive car 30 minutes? make sense. 

I'm sorry friend heart attack, crazy heart attacks happen 20 year olds 80 year olds without type symptoms, really difficult see correlation spikes many cities. Look numbers US cities see increase Memorial Day now. New York Philly prime examples. Seattle even study people tested site:

Fewer 1% Seattle protesters test positive coronavirus: epidemiologists healthcare experts say minimal impact, I'm inclined believe them. would assume means they've found new way manipulate data lie.

There CASES testing readily available. LESS DEATHS good news. took consideration wear mask. Easy task. Apparently hard task Americans..

Yeah, but, free wearing mask limited interactions public? wonder why. would think would socially distance naturally maybe tight community places. simply isn‚Äôt true. stated above, hospitals set Covid units ICU isolate patients patients may require intensive level care.

Will keep tabs this.

What I'm saying necessary keep 1.5m distance walking past another person wearing masks. know nowadays. I'm hospital cleaner since covid, Netherlands. use bleach indeed. First make clean normal cleaning routine, wet chlorine/bleach. stay wet 5 minutes work. 

The room aired 45 minutes another patient enter, say hour nurses always try cheat bit. 

On ER use different cleaner patient enter 5 minutes soak. 

They also removed curtains ever could, changing cleaning every patient. 

In country everything going ok now, hope get second wave Karen's exist political sides. agree you. not? public place something draw attention problem. photos exactly need. historic photos taken people protest. one things come shock smooth brains cuz literally zero common sense. Let use simple example explain this. walk large, old, enclosed building (especially one low ceilings) good air circulation lot people it, immediately notice? GEE, FEELS STUFFY HUMID EVEN THOUGH LIVE MIDDLE DRY DESERT. wonder?

Oh! perhaps humans give persistent aerosols breathing speaking area poor air circulation accumulates given chance clear evaporate? broken federal level. It‚Äôs nightmare. tried make simple possible.

I appreciate Reddit post, term paper.

.. summarize information requested, summarised scariest shit could think up.

My 'Fanning flames fear' statement stands. think lot wfh people can't stand stress working managing kids getting sick around partners 24/7 (sad know).

I work school many staff members dying go back reasons. Meanwhile, I'm dreading reopening schools hotbeds virus pass family family. Even precautions, think it'll ever 100% safe.  come it‚Äôs safe travel again. happy ya.  think fair say ""highly unlikely"", relative numbers. Even 5 million people get (5x current numbers - far-fetched, we'll play long), still 1.5% population. 98.5% would clear. number active cases. Remember, 6% 1.5% need hospitalization (the real number tracking). Therefore, yes, highly unlikely. Anything say would get banned. guess settle - actions consequences.

How this:

‚ÄúGood‚Äù. I‚Äôm fine simply good. People learn hard way. reason perfectly fine potentially 19,000 maskless people packing rally Saturday. also refinanced mortgage get lower rates. income/job hasnt affected. got stimulus check would normally throw savings like save, decided part stimulating economy furnishing backyard. learned bake bread various bread products fun delicious. I'm introvert loves attend large social gatherings. almost feel guilty negatively affected. know guarantees though. husbands WFH job pretty secure moment could always affected always chance someone love gets virus dies. biggest fear losing loved one, parents especially. stop  wish article better job saying, ""Congress sentenced people death thought job hard."" give damn someone close dies.

^^^times million. There's segment American population completely antagonistic COVID, illness general. know are. employer gives unbelievable amounts hell taking day illness. even university holier-than-thou professors miss single class reason, drop two letter grades.

Only death immediate presence ever stop give pause. Wake county/Raleigh much lower case per capita areas. there's hospitals right here.

A lot problems highly infected rural areas, there's less access good care.

I think Cooper going roll back least stop next stage reopen week. He's decent job, hopefully get numbers lower slower. Increased isolation level help. know hard understand. disbanded saying travel restrictions useful. sure seem important now. hope time hit peak treatment place lower deaths. Texas Florida going hot mess. severe cases.

In theory, mild moderate cases may benefit more. However, hospitalized, benefit remdesivir. 

If essentially find take home version, possible see much wider group people shorten span disease, possibly even help eliminate lessen long term effects Covid 19.

In short, group may benefit remdesivir access. may give access. Stupidity American thing people consider Miami like 15 different cities ranging North Miami Kendall. I‚Äôm Tallahassee, Florida. waited 6 hours instant result test.  know why. 

They would shouted shamed, large group people currently believe gatherings OK, gatherings exact level risk OK. 

The mob would tried ‚Äúcancel‚Äù principal. doubt tremendous buy, deal like never seen before, beautiful stock ever one.

Of course, days, would've *actually great buy* fed would've bailed *ensured loose money*. husband WFH September. friend mine got new job he's WFH July 2021. He's hoping prove enough time permanently WFH, really want move job is, good offer turn down. Yeah that‚Äôs true, even still cases resulted sort severe symptoms. long term damage studies focused primarily older people experienced harsh symptoms. isn‚Äôt case vast vast majority young people. new cases since memorial day really changed much far. That's one decision compared one state. IL put back nursing homes either. Florida CRUSHING infection numbers right opened early creating culture masks. 

&amp;#x200B;

When go grocery store, person wearing mask noticeable. People talk it, get thrown out, I've seen pictures taken. work, away desk without mask, sent home 3 days unpaid habitual issue. What's Florida help health promoting masks? 7 day rolling average best way see trend I'm sorry country made feel way.

It's head.

And I'm sorry happening you!  important point said stupid thing, staff advisers agreed follow stupid thing. seem worried personal health safety. going fine, even get virus risk issues low. might spread disease around, low risk too. everyone we'd deep shit. look #1 though, k? from? want know drew line masks. shoes pants? Can't shop without either. test. tell. 

Daily new cases looks like spike me. last spoke number new cases per day gone 21000 \~28000. 

That's increase 33%. 

That's spike.

Daily death cases dropping already killed 128k vulnerable targets mean got control. means running chips lose casino. get one Trump has. maxes 243. lockdowns work! it‚Äôs states reopened early problems! /s We've literally known since early March Chinese Bus case MIT follow study. hard believe people still follow 6ft bullshit, lol possibly compare Mexico battle heavily armed brutally violent drug cartels anywhere else? Mexico citizens armed, violence would prevented reduced way? obviously grounded lot science, girlfriend‚Äôs boss got covid began showing symptoms, turns tested positive covid. 

She contact showing early symptoms similar cold. got results together shared kiss, asymptomatic, tested negative. 

So hopefully, CDCs new theory asymptomatic spread seems least common, true. country saw large increase cases dropping pretty much quarantine measures making masks ""recommended"" only. Masks initially mandatory, small vocal section society complained it, government caved removed that. they're implementing again.

We went six cases per day 2000 tests 130 cases per 2000 thousand tests.

Testing still woefully inadequate. Makes sense conceptually want tracing best possible. question adequate. sure 4% number example actual target. latter, arrive that? boss said 15 days would over. yes, let's take heart coming mindset insight. think run longer simply last global pandemic lasted 18 months HVAC. HVAC going keep going years. Change filters. Four people outbreak? is, however, troubling see relative long antibodies corona viruses last average suggest C19 unusual interacts immune system. course already knew hat based unique inflammatory responses we‚Äôre seeing. 

Either way, it‚Äôs *good* news. say now, see group 30 rowdy young guys you‚Äôd wishing did. home, learning remotely, 3 5 days. wish answers. Maybe people countries smart enough smell bullshit mile away? personally know lot Americans think every single thing see internet true. It‚Äôs unfortunate. that's through, thanks that. Nope Latah north, I‚Äôm way south. biggest outbreak near Sun Valley, presumably due tourism high number wealthy Californians second homes brought virus them. thing i‚Äôve seen entire thread women fb group i‚Äôm (mom group) day something along lines can‚Äôt wear mask bcs pass out, asthma, masks make faint, can‚Äôt breathe wearing it, etc. makes feel like surely passing piece cloth? Well, could also argue mortality rate dragged upwards elderly people. know 60 unlikely die, whereas older much higher chance. Politicking, health authority.  Counter point- death possible negative affect virus. Long term lung damage affects age groups. one thing, happening.

Even lazy googling first state, Health, state's largest healthcare delivery system, reports intensive care units approaching 100 percent capacity.""

If can't process understand problem, either arguing bad faith capable understanding serious is. Again, protests started cause massive spike like what's described we'd seeing cities like Boston, NYC seattle protests various degrees happened almost daily. (It takes 14 days incubation symptoms show enough get tested)

But we're not, mostly due mandatory masks (and people actually trying adhere social distancing)

You're trying scapegoat protests spikes reality bunch selfish people refuse wear masks help protect others going partying -indoors- work university library. I'm concerned. Let's also forget attitude population. lot people either value ignorance may value knowledge lower priority say working familiar responsibilities. attitudes usually often correspond social class.

I'm trying make bootstrap argument although truth that. that's one factor. Money often immediate need poor families. raise standard living poor communities, miraculously education level goes too, creating negative feedback loop. inverse (or converse?) also true. nations politicizing virus would even listen WHO... father-in-law colleague epidemiologist Taiwan counseled us outset pandemic open windows needed office. group meetings, hold outdoors patio. masks &amp; gloves required times. check chart again, likely looking cfr instead IFR unless senior citizen LA opened bars? 

Here IE restaurants bars open month. burned nursing homes New York, new jersey, PA, states, states like AZ TX FL seeing current large outbreaks. vulnerable populations states still suseptable. bars, working home, indoors events, gyms. worked medical claims. Ugh sex toys least would step non sex toys don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true. I‚Äôm pretty sure biggest drop cases whatever narrative wanna push fine I‚Äôll margarita think ever chance find out.  always cringe mind hear ""6ft"". Thats nearly far enough. Ive seen articles call 20-25 feet truly safe. isn‚Äôt much hear outset novel illness information. uncharted territory. People far flippant regards outbreak, like don‚Äôt know consequences aren‚Äôt any.

It takes time gather data check patterns. sift patterns separate correlation causation. know more.

Until then, appropriate response take seriously act decisively. even prepared, lookout. kind outbreak predicted years ago; many people didn‚Äôt take seriously are. Nothing. Kids need structure socialization school provides. Keeping home dangerous well covid. blocked. nice life.  LA County, bars 50% capacity + restrictions could opened June 19. Restaurants could opened May 29 60% capacity + restrictions. Illinois kicking ass right now.

Almost 2 weeks tests positivity rate 3%.

Cases/day around March/April level.

People mostly following rules, wearing masks etc. it‚Äôs probably due .04% mortality rate, guess. Planning send children back school fall ABSOLUTELY INSANE. they‚Äôve told taught best world, freedom can‚Äôt infringed upon entire lives. would interesting world put much effort vaccines one. direct energy focus one two diseases per year, get vaccine add kids schedules. one one diseases would wiped citing rate. [Not ideal source, look experts think rationale sound; can't really consider mortality rate per official numbers large portion deaths actually caused COVID yet documented (around 20-30% higher official number), due lack tests, unwillingness test, confounding variables. would push mortality rate somewhere .2 1.5%. count excess deaths versus expected given month compare random sampling exposure per tests carried CDC, likely get accurate depiction real mortality rate. Maybe they're going church ""Pray coronavirus away."" wouldnt let pass. would alert store clerks nothing, would call police  ""We're it""

On what? Hyrdroxychloraquine? Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania states well right now, think thoughts pandemic summed 3 sentence comment reddit.com

FTFY: **Well actually**, thoughts pandemic summed 3 sentence comment reddit.com Lol what's crazy cars seat belts, air bags, expensive safety features (such blind spot monitoring), car seats, list goes on. Travel car is, lot cases, essential families bring families school, go work grocery stores. People keep children safe cars, people informed, put safety care first. 

In situation, parents informed, schools children's best interest mind, could easily mandate masks better yet, continue virtual learning. They're ignoring safety precautions, endangering children, families, without putting much thought it. 

You cannot compare two things. deaths lag week behind cases 

a week? try 3-4 weeks. financial advisor making medical health decisions now? access media Canada shit ain't happening That's is. mind crashes, mind *when* crashes -- election would prefer crash. think really douchy behavior. Endangering people 5 min wait much get nice-to-have 1 item. fair, case countries mentioned, like Denmark, they're pretty responsible, younger students micro groups. think older children still virtual there, strong protections, work unions, respect teacher health. I'm American teacher issue going back small ways, idea flinging door open disregarding teacher health. I've heard lot distance options families union filing lawsuits playing bulldog, school district would fling us virus without second thought, health community spread damned. that's really Denmark Austria per articles. smart strategic. 

It's ""school"" made contribute spread, way done social distancing conjunction community factors (spread successfully slowed, public health compliance, contact tracing place, etc) made work. People pointing thinking, ""Look, full reopen fine, schools cause spread"" miss point -- they've actually done show us ways open schools safely. There's way remove tray hot oven safely, mean tray can't burn decide tongue instead oven mitt. idea spike, that's wild speculation. Everyone said Florida would spike opening beaches weeks ago, never Follow trend, friend. August COVID less non-issue.

Wondering confident feel comment made month ago. 

We good lull spikes positive cases, going corresponding spike 2-4 weeks.

Definitely 'non-issue'. evidence transmission occur least teen tween populations.  guess want second term... Here‚Äôs interesting piece data. state (Maryland), 16 people age 30 passed away COVID. *at least* 14.5k cases reported age group. 

Striking little affects people aren‚Äôt elderly. Besides already malaria, AIDS ebola epidemics, Covid seem biggest problem think. Yup. They're basically little alien proteins full genetic material storage compartments. Canada. Maybe Denmark, Netherlands, New Zealand. Typhoid Vinny! people stuck protecting others, healthy person gets protection even cloth mask (about 70% filtration cotton cloth, according study).

Sounds like enforcing personal fantasyland putting everyone &lt;data Meanwhile, people OK aren‚Äôt even aware reaching new peaks cases. It‚Äôs literally worse whole time. 

The number deaths per day steadily decreasing past month continues government overreach surrounding understood minutely fatal virus getting ridiculous, swear tomorrow could come say ‚Äúwe cure Covid-19, you‚Äôd line single file gain access gas chamber, administered you‚Äôre inside‚Äù, would probably scratching get front line. data came directly Florida's state dashboard.

Your governor also asked folks listed ICU unless need intensive levels care. Think that.

Then think pushing narrative.

Now, consider state 100k cases guidelines place stop spread.

The fact enough respect member society care personal health throughout comments says lot person drunk long take breathalyzer test. Something like 9 total.  never openly endorsed it. statement Tulsa rally probably sarcastic, likely case since bragging much testing we‚Äôve done compared rest world. say increased testing cause surge cases, that‚Äôs likely optics thing doesn‚Äôt mean actually wants stop testing.

Also, adds bit credence trend places got hit first go around seeing spikes round 2 May ask many firefighters there?

No one die gasping air. something simple wearing mask limiting usual social events help prevent that, I‚Äôm in! truly think masks mandatory everywhere people reprimanded wearing one could freedom. don‚Äôt think country opened don‚Äôt think people taking 0 precautions.

USA basically nothing calling China literally welded people houses He‚Äôs ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs heads...  reading correctly: Florida‚Äôs positive test rate 14%? Wow.... there'd still big spike amount cases aren't. 


What hard understand that. I'm sure relevant point 2 live society younger, healthier part population spreading around bad news everyone else! Markets complicated beasts.

Many operations short-term things: ""since market rallying, buy sell two days time, earn X$, chances everything going crash exact two days?""

Also, 2008 shown investors risk anything. worst case, tax money bail out, regardless wins elections, alternative even worse country. say, generally speaking, part rural America taking COVID seriously hasn‚Äôt hit us hard yet. simply give fuck.

Don't worry, alone. suburbs cities give fuck either! I'm Switzerland common sense gone window here. packed Ikea Saturday guess something like 1 30 mask. Walking around city, same. People thinking over, going affect them. like first wave never happened. government says people wear mask social distance. case numbers low lowered people dangerous false sense security. Covid great spreading silently exploding like mushroom spores step one. Good luck Texas. alone. Yeah also I‚Äôve read, antibodies don‚Äôt stick around long body doesn‚Äôt forget make them. someone may March capability create antibodies (meaning possible immunity) wouldn‚Äôt picked antibody test. even possible?

Are throwing cash site-unseen? would someone even that? that's one reads critically. Defund police, fund education. New York 2% positive test rate 30% 2 months ago. population reason positive rate differences California double pop NY? shit Good luck stay strong. example right. Sorry mispelling. think hand washing counts nothing Covid unless normally wash hands. ""extremely politicized untrusthworthy organization asks people political."" like i'm reading onion COVID statistic. never affects numbers.

What statistic exactly? result still included state's count positive cases.  school fall needs focused solely educating students safely. Period. one die playing sport one year, plenty people might get sick die do. He's doctor. plays one TV! Type 45% higher risk contracting coronavirus **'other'** types.   

Type Less likely **other** types   

Inference Type B blood group neither less likely. everyone work home. small businesses employ lot people. Huge protests thousands ok opening small businesses not? boredom, paying bills food. hear next wave layoffs white collar jobs.

Not everyone can, lot can, should. White collar jobs mostly intact moment, getting laid coming federal government badly mishandled this. easily could smoothed more, targeted, stimulus efforts.
 Can‚Äôt shut economy months without consequences. already flatten curve enough give time hospitals prepare can‚Äôt stop it. way stop spread without vaccine. least 18 months lucky.

Flattening curve something call mission accomplished. flattened curve contain uncontrolled spread, need slowly open things back up. Unfortunately, direction White House open fast possible, little care it, including holding campaign rallies thousands people (thank goodness many people show up, could even Great Depression here. unemployment PPP runs out.... layoffs bankruptcies. job safe. New Jersey alone tax revenue collapse 30%. Going get worse.

All could handled better fiscal pandemic plan federal level. Unfortunately, White House chose turn political issue, instead dealing unified, controlled way, 50 states running around best.

History look kindly administration. Isnt folk like outdated word people used 40s?

Last time saw word reading online something ""folklore magical creatures.""

Do ppl really say folk? areas trending downward matter months, there's something else top re-openings protests that's going here. Us knowing mean draw conclusion protests affect case rates.

This makes sense. pretty simple. We'd know protests would negative impact spread virus spike number positive cases, whether daily count 7-day average. increase cities provided last month. means far, protests caused spike positive cases. protests caused substantial increase cases, would see substantial increase cases. sure relevant might worth noting despite article calling overseas territory, French Guiana part France proper, basically like Alaska US state level lower 48. average American 0 work ethic, always staring phone.

The average politician age 65 average time served congress 40 years.

Our country going pleasent path, rest world see that.

And apparently hope Joe Biden? No. Get younger minds seats start making changes.

The shit going congress years real changes brought about.

That's direction we're talking about.  Source? dick - Abbott want shut first time quickly opened soon could. interesting! know people nyc lived someone positive test, symptoms, still tested negative antibodies. infections March. immune new information? 1.5m arbitrarily set know virus transmitted, used influenza guidelines. outdated information. 

Read understand article below: masks prevent infections indoor settings, physical distancing. matter one bit close walk past someone everyone wearing mask. good job /s really run group people thought kids made report card go away could make bad grades go away too. Considering one spend money normally do, expected. Oh boy. going end back started test easily T-cell response? yes That's definitely possible. mention, reasons immoral inhumane... idea. What!!? Florida re-opening rules smokescreen real reason re-opening. DeSantis company want $$$ care get it. town never shut actual shutdown. understand using mask correctly greatly decreases spread virus.

But simultaneously, [this country's corona cases looks **without anyone wearing masks.** seen single person wearing mask, even personel elderly homes. regular parties celebrating graduations, going holiday.

The answer corona masks, government takes seriously, combined society practices social distancing hygiene. feel sorry Americans, government care you, people believe virus. Huh? apologies broke rule. answer applied multiple statements cut pasted. 

I don‚Äôt doubt DeSantis made change benefit, pointing patients ICU don‚Äôt require intensive care. trying speak truth. doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt think get it, aren‚Äôt worried it. day yes. night people go clubs parties etc. end inside - least that's goes Florida - BBQ day - depending hot may inside - fireworks later - club party night old folk go bed. consequences science denial, lack common sense, treating politics like football, folks. race determines perspective issue I'velived it. crying anything, explaining protests important POC affected. Exercising rights give fuck think. Open mouth, insert foot. irresponsible thing say. Trump admin jackassery beyond belief stupidity. wish you! work cancer hospital, occasionally put patients ICU bed available unit would normally go. Absolutely moronic levels stubborn willful ignorance incompetence.

If there's justice world, backfires massively faces theirs. Maybe 100s thousands people protesting, yelling other's faces something it? talk that... 2nd wave 1st wave still high gear. /sighs Florida Ontario, province 14.5 million, 160 new cases per day less 1% positive hit rate. Arizona contrast half population, 7.5 million, seeing 1500-2000 positive per day. scary. Wow thanks everyone responding thoughtful comments. thoughts Agree!! hospitals doctors getting better treatment recognizing virus earlier stage

I think virus modified less deadly version, early say that.

The nursing homes locked degree, believe older folks safe (masks). Younger folks concern therefore see age infected dropping.

We 3rd inning 9 inning game, maybe beginning act little responsibly? There's always 'thoughts prayers'. always seem work past. excellent point.

The lockdown bought time everyone competing short supplies.

Now we've reopened hospital still falls short PPE goals.

We handful vents.

And we're larger regional hospital. Wait 2 weeks, we'll see! products sold? fucking love Americans, Murica!

I watching movie shot Texas Texas movie star Renee Zellweger! Rhis pandemic isnt bad collective action isnt needed. Yeah concerning me. saw too. forgot e) ignore it. weight lower ever say heard vitamin may offer help prevention. read wikipedia's info coronavirus misinformation section. know huge reliable source wanted get info could pull research myself. bet one em [this maskless lady handing caseload steady percent positive cases drop higher number tests run, hold steady. They‚Äôre bad shape lot states, first warning sign need think getting shit together. I've seen couple times states classifying pneumonia deaths fear based food supply chain holding up? Anyone sense knew gonna happen. matter when. Well now. high hopes people would smart situation, I've constantly disappointed.

And health Department's video today amounted ""businesses get tested case reopen 2 days"" .... except can't get test without symptoms.

We're fucked month's least Trump recommends testing reduce cases.

Last night, Trump looked horribly tired.

Today, rally workers test positive virus.

Trump can't test test positive virus they're longer testing/screening. Coronavirus.utah.gov places source data from. also use rt.live check R0 score understand Abbot DeSantes basically thing. reason DeSantes comes bigger conservative blow hard. reason feeling Abbot's secretly concerned virus hands tied deep red Texas. medical advice learned zinc normal amounts good lungs. get sick now.... population Utah youngest country, spreading like wildfire, doubt deadly states area schools open right beginning August. mine didn‚Äôt record deal  live work Tempe. lot coworkers got Rona. haven‚Äôt able get test since don‚Äôt car regular dr No, bit woosh. game breaker: rest stops

Can't see entering one places probably next 2 years. Using restroom #1 concern. pack food gas without entering building. restroom safely? really can't done. whose fault that, Gov? Paywall immigrants foreign workers even want come country cases millions? I'm still worried though. I'm immunocompromised due taking meds autoimmune disorder. husband's OTR trucker who's country comes home weekends, teenagers work fast food saving money college. far one gotten sick know much needed lockdown home impossible. hope virus might weakening people exposed arent passing along easy. Idk, I'm still worried Butcher Box gots back. fact would even mention closing Texas last option tells suddenly came realization might deep shit. forgot nuke  Oh that's really worrisome. see, number daily deaths US steadily declining since late April. Even cases spike climb, number deaths continues decline.

This clear visible first wave.

The 2nd wave said started number daily deaths begins increasing again, trends upwards 7 consecutive days. issue assuming making masks making testing vials difficulty problem. machines, technology, materials required make sterile medical testing vials certainly going lot difficult simple non-sterile paper mask. FOOTBAWL going dignify retardation answering good faith entirely true. ICU beds billed higher rate med/surg bed. It‚Äôs base rate that‚Äôs different. maybe poor, underprivileged, guilty receiving poor education. know rich white dude telling less privileged people morons helps anything. Might better try best educate hold class resentment, etc. hope stay safe :( shock.  Hello COVID old friend.... don‚Äôt want honestly don‚Äôt want wait year see family flu season start things get worse get better. Lol aww I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre trouble getting tested... happening! I‚Äôd try Banner Phoenix... symptoms especially tent testing center... stay car get tested. We're talking pandemic response impacted electoral outcomes.

This seems pretty within scope. seem like understand concept really well.

Let ask this:

Would rather die age 38 live age 79? SWMO here, confirm we're actively fucking ourselves. hey, least conspiracy Trumpets calling hoax loudly past weeks! ""Will rage""? Try ""*is* raging"". Shelby County probably one poorly governed counties State. Shelby County Commission case study horrible politics carried people intelligent, think geniuses. welcome, I'm sure taking vitamin supplements summer northern hemisphere make much difference, evidence makes sense harm unless really go overboard amount take I'm taking case. kind makes sense considering re-opening schedule. many deaths March/April quarantined, there's two week delay infection probable death! course were. voices amplified shady fuckery.  I‚Äôm buying locally raised goods days. deaths steadily decreasing past month despite cases per day staying relatively same. Yesterday saw numbers seen since mid March 68, Medicaid cover insulin? hope still make it.  delay longer it‚Äôs bad since start cool fall. makes sense. logistically need able safely isolate patients across spectrum care. prepared could create many overflow/surge issues simultaneously empty floor beds. 

I work hospital northeast. wife works ICU. That‚Äôs simply handled things here. covid patients getting admitted needed intensive care. downgraded and/or discharged soon stable. needed supplemental O2 getting discharged ER. 

Unfortunately, think Desantis trying create false narrative. already grossly tried blame surge Hispanic workers, isn‚Äôt true. thoughts. People lack understanding social responsibility freedom. people still think freedom means whatever want. It‚Äôs freaking mask. Seriously worth trouble prepare 30 min rant it‚Äôs government encroaching rights every time someone ask put mask. ""Advises."" governments refusing tell angry white people ""no""? Ok eligible UI CARES act steps can't return work provides like 80%of wage. actually know scope hockey tests. NHL reported 11 players tested positive. 3 Lightning, 1 Maple Leaf, I'm exactly sure Penguins player included that's old report. believed also Arizona Coyotes players skated Matthews. Andersson, Leafs goalie, however, lived Matthews far negative.

San Jose sharks Montreal Canadiens positive tests beginning pandemic. Coyotes rumored to, well.

The NHL interesting seemed learned private mumps outbreaks (and infamous Sidney Crosby ""I mumps"" video practice- visible signs mumps interview). much info leaking, least.

The stamina needed play hockey, however, makes possibility reduced lung capacity super concerning. 2 minute shift already considered long ice tired get. players late 30s, well, least 1 top head 40s (Chara), they're young. Since ever stopped people getting together party and/or shooting own? live fireworks banned, they've canceled memorial day fireworks year, still going time people fun lol. People get together well, 4th end, look us two months later measured approach. Ridiculous. Yet China claims happened frozen salmon. people downvoted time look Texas covid numbers rn. Lmfao understand. I'm you. I'm sure problem here. flattened curve, hospitals caught ppe. Capacity overloaded currently makes sense low open watch numbers change. Cases means little deaths going much. dipshit serious. Sir, put us clusterfuck us concerned opening right up. feel like kind post trolling (whether intentional not). can't see would generate meaningful debate discussion. remember correct, much difference private state nursing homes, little towards private. worked special care many years ago, municipality/kommun used trick stop giving shifts temps forced hire full time years. Sure anecdotal private sector sucks, system failure shows face now, worst possible way. wow, almost everyone told would happen one listened. TBF, south still talking shit Civil War, lost 155 years ago. bad decisions really fail interpreting posts. pointing good news bad regarding coronavirus. Deaths less one third worst media never seems mention that. Much lower. seems people aren‚Äôt willing expose virus media projected. even closed outdoor overflow started. Flu tests pretty high rate false negatives. Especially rapid ones give results minutes. Thanks. early 40s young senior citizen either. Hopefully. 

Covid scary mild symptoms. heard say Fox news morning, talking upcoming segment discussing something ""post-pandemic"" America. Arizona planning thing. 

I sure hope Florida‚Äôs superintendent doesn‚Äôt get sick. never know going severe case doesn‚Äôt.  think projection fear onto tangible body. Can't shoot virus. Let give hand ALREADY raging ' like forest fire' unprepared America, Reddit user simply warns.


Edit: didn‚Äôt want anyone misconstrue simple it‚Äôs statement simple. idiots. Like me! Although sub pretty good is.

Fabrications media? Hey, now, us sense. can't vouch sanity, though! ???

Do think top income bracket stumble trove gold sit it? They're investing it. They're buying companies, building factories, running real estate...

Your area sounds like well, maybe that's feel differently. state breaking records almost daily, almost religious resistance anybody wearing masks, violations like overcrowding indoors reported hundreds response, leaders told us implementing restrictions time open. I'm Florida..

Literally wear mask people attempt publicly shame media sheep. 

I give information understand I'm coming I'm trying lock activity everywhere. I'd happy people simply realized situation acted like responsible adults it, majority still believes everything negative virus fake. mother. Germany.

She convinced virus hoax. said rather kill virologist wear mask. 

She spends lot time pondering behind this. would government require mask wearing dangerous virus? virologists pushing world domination? revenge virologists losing lawsuit? trying get lot money selling masks? American way! head sand approach. 0 times 10, works everytime!  literally eye hurricane everyone acting like storm ended that's usually works. Two anchors, take twice weight, one goes, one suddenly get big yank. Absolutely.

I think many Americans prepared bad get.

And reopening schools, sports, venues absolutely create catastrophe. Thanks taking time list combination factors make COVID ""serious"". rang? would create isolation area ICU also tele medsurg floors? would terrible utilization resources. soon able breathe either

good riddance Incentives work  üôèüèª Going need source last statement.

The CDC guidelines clearly show instructions report covid underlying cause. (Theres video site)
And trump CDC tight leash. Sentiment well good, solve situation. magic money time become long-term full-time carer 5-10 years. evil deluded (hard sometimes tell difference) use whatever peddle stuff make money.  Colloidal silver, testerosterone boosters, weight loss, Covid, weiner pills, name scum pushing it. truth that, large, kill them. comes data. Severe COVID-19 (requiring ICU admission) almost exclusively appearing senior citizens significant comorbidities. Now, note definition ""severe"", mean younger folks get rough time, might require hospital admission, even become severe eventually cause death (esp. person undiagnosed comorbidities), significantly less likely so. Exactly!

I huge hoarding tendencies MMO's play, I'm surprised took apply mentality real life too. Stupidity knows borders evil insanity balancing knife edge. 

Businesses want open. UK goverment want cannot afford pay furlough more. Common interests here!

People die guess risk goverment ready take. like... know... *they* affected. Floridian here.

I may got punks. cases cases. point people cherish living ancestors more. yet dumbf**ks rural area Illinois want go Missouri it‚Äôs open.  Well zuck donating trumps campaign think second accident think that's good fair point.

It's one societal ills we've ignoring.

Households resources need make work.

They Congress care. live Arizona, got sick Saturday. Almost every testing place booked 2+ days out, got really lucky basically trying book appointment urgent care get test. literally drive 30 minutes another county get test. Got one, positive.

Most places run swabs can't take walk-ins. Nice knowing you, boys. grandson lives another part country, perhaps young family, can't afford quit work? certain would like live life die. they're üòÇ

The vast vast majority people suffer long term symptoms.

Stop hysteria. one enforcing masks social distancing people US can't trusted either own. obvious infected daily numbers. words Coach, fucking embarrassing! great news, MD DC also seen huge drop cases. Another comment alleged 'picking' studies, fervently masks? Wearing mask admitting body capable infected. admission vulnerability weakness, certain circles America‚Äôs hypermasculine culture worst thing be.

It‚Äôs hard w anxiety get head rational things even understand you‚Äôre tripping . certainly good thing hospitals report data want long contain HIPPA materials. Ok. Houston‚Äôs hospital situation 3 weeks ago? Since want tout ignorance, fear shit. Care share data now? continue ignoring problem they‚Äôve collapsed?

Boomers see definate cultural difference older boomers younger boomers. US failed State. expect people eat drink masks? hate, REALLY hate whole 'the government trying control us' bullshit. 

These people think they're important Gov cares minute actions. wearing mask anything government control?

ugh. hate us cause ain't us!

In seriousness, amazing much hate CA receives around country. remember there's map shows state state hates most, good half CA. I'm sure weird combination jealousy/media/ignorance, though.

For worth, lived abroad, identified much Californian American. simple yet people hard time understanding this... usually end hospital diagnostic test. Corona VirUSA. guess smart way idiots weed smart ppl bu seeing doth protest. ""See! believe science! hell lot!"" significant amount non elderly people get bad enough hospitalized. 

In CDC's COVID-NET data hospitalis across 100 counties 14 states, week ending June 13th, 64% patients hospitalized 65 y/o. 41% age 49. 

 

So hurting elderly. Good thing federal government still sitting 12 billion dollars testing üôÑ hear you, that‚Äôs messed up. Hosting political rallies churches violates professed values American government also Christianity. Jesus intentionally political leader. Jewish people practically begged rescue politically Roman Empire, clearly stated wasn‚Äôt goal. don‚Äôt know beliefs churches host political rallies adhere to, clearly isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs bible. excess... Meaning normal. looks like COVID hitting Florida later areas, excess deaths would show later.

Before this, possible spread slow enough increase go background deaths expected.

Also, reporting deaths lag month more, number revised upward. protesters ‚â† looters [You're white washing ‚Äú*It‚Äôs going disappear. One day, it‚Äôs like miracle, disappear*‚Äù 61 cases hospital run. Jesus that‚Äôs small hospital lmao.

Did miss part says over-run bc short staff working bc covid.

I can‚Äôt take ignorance fear seriously linking articles sensationalized titles eat up. Hard Byrdes launder money everything shutdown. Bravo. That's pretty bottom barrel passive aggressiveness, there. 

You deny reality want feelings political bias. doing, American, care internal politics. Stop assuming rest world does. whole world runs concept 'blame.'

I prefer actually understand going virological perspective. want see could affect country. Protests pandemic exist another dimension vacuum. biology 101.

Once goes South... watch blame health officials Hospitalizations going roof.... show graphs hospitals happening? headlines articles actual graphs. Curious see them. Underrated comment. See new hampshire ‚ÄúHouston area officials say plenty room hospital whole‚Äù

Did miss part? That‚Äôs article link prove point. tell 4 Houston hospitals there, article says plenty room whole.

God people dumb. Media + fear + ignorance. Man hate fking media. great news, aware even Covid kill you, mean gonna picnic either. make violently ill, even permanently damage organs sometimes. hate break you, I‚Äôm far Alabama. Americans wonderful. üòÄ awful. Justice highest bidder American way unfortunately. double secret ICU. seems happening US virus shifted away elderly population, probably due better protection nursing homes (typically 50%-80% fatalities) population seeing much smaller death/case ratio result.

Gotcha. Thanks. pretty much drop due North East able contain reduce hospitalization sharply. 2 3 weeks, we‚Äôll see happen South, since hospitalization skyrocketing many states Cookout! Fascinating. probable American health care system collapse? hate chinstrappers Can't stores kick deny service wearing mask? I'm trying figure shop owner could get fined/jail time someone went without mask cop happened stroll by. 

""No fines issued person abide order, however, business operator could face fine.

Honest question, ideal ICU occupancy rate hospital? get saying, isnt total amount funding go towards this, small pocket funds compared hundreds billions given corporations.

Its like first 14 billion, wanted slow less people sick dude legit believes looks away moving car coming longer exists. reality car swerving road smashing bus stop full old folks. right now? suddenly locking entire country Jan 25 sign, would be?

Yep! first ones see house finally closing on, made offer less 6 hours viewing it. like day probably already gone. work industry I'm unemployed no, fuck you. Get head ass.

Even then, easy say right thing. 

Do find hard say? implementing 50% reduction testing. /s fuck Wisconsin list? suppose mostly western Wisconsin still. Hi neighbor! Haha thing VA. people realized mask mandate enforced, openly began flaunting it.

 Wow Florida man, stop trying Florida hard. low population density, outbreak first place?

Do registered superspreader event trace origin? sorry work conditions. experience WFH people perform home perform office either. Good hope play it‚Äôs dream since 7, high schoolers likely die playing football actually getting virus   2 guys talking golf course. Nothing visually offensive. say though..... protests equality

The virus indifferent legitimacy grievance. Chuckles close giving containment, go forward schooling fall business usual officially signal raising white flag Father law went tear masks work 4 people job got it. take they're working close quarters hot that's it.

Literally knows, personally, 5 people who've gotten virus. Literally knows wearing masks. Literally cites Facebook posts Cooper wants destroy north Carolina.

The south talk shit put ventilator on. Californians getting lazy masks, least see around San Francisco NorCal, although news rising cases seems made people wear last days. don‚Äôt understand, that‚Äôs easy. alcoholic stop drinking love enough. Right? Right? failure protect citizens, actively preventing measure slow block pandemic, using federal money given fight pandemic look, think Tyson chicken plant Benton County AR huge spike. Also, SW Missouri border Tulsa, spiking OK. makes think want happen? don‚Äôt want happen, people completely trying downplay risk infection protests. missing point, forced lockdown demands officials take responsibility economically businesses losses. lockdown, monetary loss officials. That's fear. also, like... every bar problem maybe bars? Ugh. Weird, condo's I've looking West Town/Humboldt Park market while, I'm seeing modest price drops units selling. best guess lot investor properties people want pandemic recession. could hire Americans

Look this. Americans jobs, period. min wage, $15hr. know high would go, $15-20 /hr tried Americans simply back-breaking jobs.

If let go undocumented workforce, run food immediately.

If pay proper min-wage slightly better, documented, pay taxes, legal regulated, almost nothing would change. American's want jobs anywhere near would pay people offered proper path legal work gainful participation society.

You make citizens. keep temp work visas renew every couple years. making documented means track better, pay taxes orderly, long subject crime abuse take advantage people recourse society.

And important, people think stuff 2020 important spare thought. people working lands means food security country. Imagine things look like pandemic, world crisis war, physically people working lands, food comes outside borders food stops.

We recently ugly bout food insecurity due pandemic many areas still suffering. still grow enough food home. want keep way. cannot circumstances allow people leave go grow food Central South America ship there. want here, working land, matter national security. one getting lung transplants mild case lol. severe irreversible damage. yeah recognized username past posts. guys crispy. Sweden tried that, got 15% (or lower think) covid antibodies. Also, antibodies last 2-3 months -- even know herd immunity. best option keep many people uninfected healthy till get options treatment billions doses vaccines. Texas days pretty much takes statewide offices magic (R) next name. going retort scientific facts instead decided ad hominen attack call flat earther.

What *really* sad - apart obvious - 'theory' quite simple.. early day call Sweden's strategy failure call country's strategies success. opinion nothing decided yet facts revealed examined, sides scientific debate listened put test .. decision made. now.

My question people want badly seen failure - even seem wishing another 1,000 deaths prove right.

As said - pretty clear everyone want seen failure, really unclear why.

Maybe could address point instead coming silly &amp; childish little ways trying insult me? they're slowing every province, btw, still fly US canadian, vice versa. canadian wanted take vacation florida right now, can. can't drive there. 

You guys giant increase due canadians returning yet so.

Don't get wrong, get it. Closing borders stopped travel, stopped spread. However, think people traveling means how. flying florida vacation, that's dangerous letting people drive see family terms contact tracing general contact public, especially canadians fly orlando go disney world weeks americans still can't see family members. already are. likely critical patients distributed around . problem hosp capacity ship critical heart patient network hospitals nearby make room covid patient? bean counters revolt. wear masks see neighbors going walk suburban neighborhood. However wear see everyone wear stores. sure count this?

However recently outdoor games allowed saw one playground maybe 50-100 kids, almost zero masks. sure regulations around close corona breeding ground infected nursing home :( Outdoor transmission much less likely indoors.

In likelihood, reopening businesses, especially brick mortar like restaurants, people forced breach others air 30+ minutes, causing spike cases. fact president undermining good faith approach virus politicizing perfect recipe, conjunction protests (where air &amp; bodily fluids exchanged especially due tear gas among variables) likely resulting spike. hard say variable contributing more, science read showing indoor proximity much dangerous outdoor latter certainly immune spread, lack better phrase. fuck country.

Move Canada.

It's hilarious act like concerned virus post history championing huddled together thousands lol. people DEFINITELY lacking self-awareness.... .just like you. Sorry bub, fault everyone complaining about. Minneapolis MN huge demonstrations well things.   perceptable change cases, deaths, hospitalizations etc. 166 icu beds Covid peak 200's. blame red belly California LA county. yall need spankin one article... guess third way left. I'm polluting youtube history stuff. Mention citations peer-reviewed papers, preferably systematic reviews reviews. 

People bring oil nowadays know eating much fat problematic, want promote butter, cheese, bacon. type thread attracts conspiracy folks, point indisputable falling deaf ears Thank you! Here's another one. I'm wondering saying confirmed suspected one. thought enough testing. Something adding all. Like, flying nurses/doctors NYC experience building field hospitals. whole thing complete shit show data reporting media. need gotdamn leadership. number hospitalizations number ICU admissions COVID. positive case still show total case numbers. count COVID hospitalization death. Thank God Donald Trump! Woooo! Trump 2020. Keep Murica Grate! could seen coming? Right program full steam ahead fall sports. even paid $20,000 company broadcast games fans watch TV. Coaches refuse wear masks distancing joke.

I think bad idea... can‚Äôt imagine would allowed play football. Abbott never fails what‚Äôs best spreading virus. physical embodiment meme person puts stick bicycle wheel blames somebody else Germany baffles me. Berlin big numbers all, despite TONS people coming Italy France Spain February March. also whole neighbourhoods basically ignoring lockdown well big lockdown protests streets since least end April.

And people say ""Germany testing right!"" certainly didnt seem big thing. Tons people still havent tested. small handfull people know tetsted, mostly made effort go themselves.

But somehow none resulted big numbers Berlin. seemed dodge Covid bullet. replace "" dog"" animal article reads same. Unhygienic animal farming common across meat industry, dangerous processing. 

Wild animals different story vectors disease, anything domesticated raised captivity seems like it'd level safety. Lets hope keep outbreak contained region. 

China fortunate isolated outbreak early stages. shipped medical personnel China deal Wuhan. 

They knew enough medical workers tend epidemics multiple hotspots. 

Hence strict lock downs. think meat packing plant outbreaks caused infected pigs? Good luck guy, it‚Äôs fucking tough. can‚Äôt imagine actually OWNING bar board happens drop you‚Äôre liquor license everyone‚Äôs going think ‚ÄúThat bar wasn‚Äôt following orders‚Äù fact it‚Äôs drunk customers ones caused problems. entire world makes China factory gets pissed China still lower emissions per person almost western country.

Absolute bullshit. China invested solar technology brought price globally anyone else. state metrics summary, current caseload growth indicates exceed ICU capacity 2 weeks growth rate increasing. seems like trend across nation: Lauri Jones, trouble began early May. director small public health department western Washington State working family quarantine coronavirus exposure. heard one family member community, Jones decided check in.

The routine phone call launched nightmare.

‚ÄúSomeone posted social media violated civil liberties [and] named name,‚Äù Jones recalled. ‚ÄúThey said, ‚ÄòLet‚Äôs post address .‚Äâ.‚Äâ. Let‚Äôs start shooting.‚Äô ‚Äù 

The fact people want hurt someone, trying help stay alive, beyond me. Southwest Missouri thinks liberal hoax. never gain weight pressure Surgeon General lie health. Shunning reinforces beliefs. need address instead saying ‚Äúlol ignore crazy people‚Äù like young anti-vaxx flat earth movements. sure getting downvoted, that's certainly new revelation. practical terms that's mostly bad news China since rest world already strain.  Nope. They'll get tired tax revenue eventually, ignore spikes, say, ""Nope! see 'rona 'round here! Let 'er go!"" Maybe he‚Äôs already mild case. antibodies may think fine. doubt he‚Äôs thinking much anyone else. do? 

a) Shoot 

b)Build wall

c) stop testing

d) make rules penalties Always upvote McEvoy. Texas treating like joke, unfortunately us, joke going end anyone laughing. 

I live suburb north Austin (RR) Saturday afternoon Twin Liquors getting bottle Tito's Father's Day Moscow Mules 20-something sorority looking girl comes in, mask course, hops line front grabs one larger 1.75 liter bottles cheap tequila counter. 

Cashier points MULTIPLE signs say ""no mask, service"" flat says believe masks flu-like thing what's big deal? Cashier pulls bottle says ""Bye"". stands moment - huffs-and-puffs spouts ""F-you, place sucks"" walks out.

A guy behind line - mask less - sees apparently triggered starts spouting ""you can't customers"", sets prolly $150 booze counter walks screaming ""I'll tell everyone know shop here!!!!""

I stood like WWWTTTFFFFF happened. wearing mask got upset serve someone not?!?

My guess wearing mask ""had"" selfish way - get booze. saw another anti-masker go off, let true colors shine. 

And Texas huge case count soon...sigh....I fear kids... work hospital.

Most larger hospitals multiple ICU's...Medical ICU, Surgical ICU, Cardiac ICU, Trauma ICU, etc. usually physically separate one another. order minimize risk rest hospital, facility may take one ICUs designate COVID patients. patents may need intensive care...ventilator, constant monitoring, etc...but may not. may ok supplemental oxygen, breathing treatments, antibiotics, etc. could cared regular hospital floor easier isolate dedicated COVID ward happens ICU. know it, they‚Äôll teenagers, times like cherished moments. W H ? Still one linked secret service article western countries get build wealth pumping shit ton CO2, underdeveloped countries need curb output get enjoy riches? Seems fair Let guess, stupid states? fucking idiots, seriously. They‚Äôre putting everyone risk, themselves. Smh least BLM protest yesterday weren‚Äôt stupid. Even catches virus access fresh plasma best docs. happened Spanish Flu - hence middle aged people suffer bad age groups due getting immunity previous outbreaks like 1889‚Äì1890 flu pandemic. THIIS UNACCEPTABLEEEEE!!! would pissed. islands close borders effectively Hawaii subject US laws. Yeah, put everything specifics looking at. also Canadian, read stats Canada US may mixing two, thought seen deaths specifically long term care homes. need take look, wonder many 40 million live types areas. 

I think point would reason less deaths reason think more. Check account history. Certainly true Minnesota, far anyway. wait till u find real reason virus illness. eat words. u keel first. AFAIK travel non-Schengen countries still closed. insane. I'm guessing week Florida surpass 5k daily cases 6-7k daily cases occurring next week. 

Disney closed 600 new cases per day 3% positivity rate, want open 400% increase cases? makes zero sense completely irresponsible. Possibly. Wish could say sure. Maybe even 4 weeks. general sentiment deaths lagging indicator. 

I also think we've gotten better treatment that's guess. Arizona here, first-hand account sounds extremely accurate. We're small town traffic backup ""testing blitz"" half mile. 

Antibody testing even worse - bring hundred people one big room ventilation order get blood samples. spoke friend said everyone masks off, people hugging treating like one big end-of-lockdown party. Isn‚Äôt supposed help provide global leadership pandemic events??!?!!!! Ordered 100 surgical masks arriving soon...have N95s...which fine short term...but multiple hours. matter much coming years. we'll see. mean can‚Äôt ignore go away ? anecdotal evidence useful. story representative efficacy masks, impact would clear &amp; overwhelming.

I'm saying masks unimportant, I'm saying masks important factor among several important factors. People tendency lazy behavior, think masks like armor could well stop following practices know important. Kids forced stay home want drama.
So avoid needs done compromise keep room much possible. Parents think actually bonding, hilarious. Ah, see (not science person) so...question.. would indicate we‚Äôll see spike colder months (in opinion?) 

Also (in Canada) we‚Äôre seeing spikes migrant workers, I‚Äôd assume that‚Äôs living conditions, cold temps it‚Äôs unbearably hot mean started May 10th? 'Everyone stupid except me' point self reflect notice narcissist stuck bubble? lot people don‚Äôt answer calls unknown callers days. I've never understood feel like office super inefficient. Everyone wastes much time, mention commute. wake like get half workday way noon. get actual work done people stopping chit chat bunch dumb meetings could emails. type 3 number combination google followed ‚Äúnew cases‚Äù news article every single one top listed.

A lot people sub wary media listen scientists. There‚Äôs reason they‚Äôre easing restrictions buying fear porn. worried Florida right now.

I elderly family know mean. another pair asshole relatives taking weeklong vacation ""just get away all"". Disgusting. Compassion enforced fiat... much compassion! complain Karens want haircuts next? that's part problem. I'm living life fine. I'm working. I'm eating. I'm raising kids. wear mask take pandemic seriously. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll affect business know truth.‚Äù fiance nurse (NY/Westchester area), says treating completely different hospital break first started. intubation, flipping patients stomachs open lungs, giving oxygen much effective treating virus.  Yeah, people hospitalized sick weeks/months Therefore you‚Äôre expecting spike deaths in.... two three weeks? almost took serious measures slow spread virus worked? No, coincidence right? state monitoring counties elevated levels transmission. Stanislaus County, Central Valley, drivers transmission include family gatherings, businesses health care facilities well hospital accepting patients counties, decreased use face coverings social also series outbreaks San Quentin State Prison, NPR member station KQED noted. state reports 304 active cases COVID-19 San Quentin, 19 inmate deaths statewide. what‚Äôs point here? Stalin good guy Churchill bad guy Soviets died? possible? people must honest telling others they're positive. Hell, know people affected, live fairly middle-class socioeconomic area, though tend know people lower-middle spectrum might explain know many. I, one, tell true.  guess protests catching thought potential therapy showed impressive results earlier on. Great see actual testing.... ""Let's honest, come lot going live long anyway."" Precisely. let‚Äôs acknowledge real risk different populations focus discussion needs be! Thank you. 

I quick skim, realized I'd come back look things like LDH is, guidelines are. 

We started phase 2 province 2 weeks ago (we regional approach), interesting see similarities differences. live Ohio, Coronavirus fatigue setting big time. passing day see fewer masks adherence social distancing. like decided inconvenienced enough. depressing see. Sadly even family members giving hard time continuing wear mask avoiding large gatherings. act like made stop weak minded. Haven‚Äôt EU done closing external borders EU zone? stopped now? 2 weeks now, America see deaths follow current case path. That's long death lags infection. doubt governor‚Äôs shut back down. much money stack. Money always important lives USA. Trump already stated won‚Äôt shut country back down. Leaving governor‚Äôs. business owners could always shut doors besides grocery stores doctors, see knowing they‚Äôll take hit pockets.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* hard predict people south start dying similar rate happened north month two ago 200k almost sure thing. restrictions, irresponsible people refuse social distance wear masks, reopening, weaker health care institutions...sounds like recipe disaster.

Remember NY went lock still struggle get things control. Florida going zero restrictions?

At least make face masks mandatory there. Deaths result infections happened 3 10 weeks ago. New infections happened 3 10 days ago. restrictions lighten, virus spread easily. also wasn‚Äôt much testing several weeks back, don‚Äôt necessarily complete curve far tracking (same goes accurate death reporting). infections lead death. time, doctors know better treat covid patients, help lower death rate well.

I worried Florida right now. stopped posted month half back, became clear ""quick decisive"" lockdown done nothing delay spread. numbers speak themselves, worst thing India hit peak yet. weeks back ICMR said peak would hit August. week revised mid-November. There's long way go getting back control. disabled, lacks empathy. blows mind. (I‚Äôm disabled say this) whole thing highlighted like 90% schooling parents need childcare break kids. Maybe ten percent actually teaching learning. search function thing, you‚Äôve sub last weeks would‚Äôve seen front page hbomberguy reference?

I watched couple videos recently can't tell I'm making head reference not. True unless really believes drug took preventive really gave antibodies kinda like Dr hide cauliflower potatoes... stop travel states boat speak. much want look state level impact local outbreak still felt regionally even nationally. I've saying well agree more. motivation average American reflect inward improve ones self.  keeping waiting two weeks something terrible happens?

Yes, thats phase 2. switch ""remember right waiting two weeks?"" Everyone gave trying. live Cali. work positives, tested waiting results. meantime still go work, kicker...one employees tested positive Wednesday came work saying fine now.  Probably also linked unmanaged psychosis is! 

Wearing mask hard it‚Äôs really proven helpful slowing spread. wear mask. Well normally 85% capacity, room 15% beds occupied COVID patients. COVID patients need 25% ICU beds, need reduce background ICU rate less 75%. That‚Äôs usually done reducing surgeries selective surgeries high complication rates. leopards ate faces. Right. increase coming Memorial Day folks. Whelp, least Texans may serve next Italy-style cautionary tale get people buy restrictions mandatory mask wearing rational areas.

Honestly, point human instinct flee plague seems rational Texas Florida governor. bright side, attestation allowed work, tell truth. Yeah, that's said long.

You skate 2 minutes get caught ice. Ive seen happen plenty times, especially pk. average shift somewhere around 50 seconds. 

And age seems factor health, brought Chara. Also, age, taking even mild lung damage probably career ending, least. new motto: ""We give shit Big Al's"" president loves goalposts headed. WaIT WeeKS I'll go slang definition bit funnier I'll enjoy educating friends road, haha. Much thanks everyone's responses! that? Jersey it‚Äôs lie 100% masks store. Outside areas I‚Äôd guess 50%. Beach zero. Americans take Europe seriously, either. eh makes sense Reopening causes spikes.

The goal prevent spikes

The solution reopen.

If never reopen, never spike

Therefore, never reopen, win. answer phone unless number already labeled saved.  mean news article came saying 2 hairdressers positive covid masks on, well 140 people saw infected, transmission. Even variables, single infection means masks gotta account something right? 

[Heres Okay, let try explain differently:

If disease killing people 100 years killed 30,000 people last year, disease B killing people 6 months killed 120,000 people far, suppose likely kill arbitrary person next 6 months? fucking people say PC ""not real"" prefer ""the blunt truth"". Well, is. Starting think Trump wants get entire US infected purpose. unfathomable idiotic slow testing, stop preventative measures case count exploding. Russia helped elect purpose, knew would destroy nation.  Sick tired phrase  ""Hey, when's good time OSHA come fuck ass tomorrow?"" Deaths lag cases honesty got hot shit weather got nice. friends cooped inside mixing music twitch streams stuff. Soon got hot memorial day weekend everyone sun, hitting beach, park etc. dont got air conditioner apartment might well outside least breeze. protests. everyone restraunts one wearing mask. least public bay im id say mask use 75 percent maybe time jobs there. There‚Äôs multiple articles

Links none Yes makes sense. didn‚Äôt think Germany Phase 3 testing. try find out. Cmon guys....were better this. 250k easily. would say that‚Äôs racist asshole. Looking location tag Instagram, looks like still going strong today. WTF wrong people? probably true many places, US may still first wave fall. That's kinda super huge over-generalization Hahahaha, Beijinger, I'll tell saw real.
China's top infectious disease experts (Zhong Nanshan, Li Lanjuan, Wang Chen, Zhang Wenhong, etc., etc.) common understanding, stated countless times media generally accepted government citizens, infectious diseases cannot controlled ignoring breaking chain transmission, prerequisite breaking chain transmission identify source infection, i.e., detect cases.
China's goal eventually control virus, make ""look like virus control. country world able control coronavirus without finding case. correct number cases released raise public awareness allow people take sensible precautions.
From point view, releasing right information much useful releasing wrong information.
If China wanted save face Beijing time around, would released outbreak all.

As claim infection rate Wuhan millions, personally think data back up, since medical issue, good idea make public. Category, recognize top journals basis paper. fact exact statistic data, Wuhan tested everyone nucleic acids antibodies, Sampling statistics.

„ÄÄOn June 5, Nature published largest prevalence data serum antibodies China date.
Serum antibody testing 17,368 people seven cities, including Wuhan, found people direct contact hospitals. Serum neo-coronavirus antibody positivity rate 2.5%; serum neo-coronavirus antibody positivity rate people without direct hospital contact 0.8%. seropositivity rate Wuhan, outbreak center, ranged 3.2% 3.8% different sub-cohorts.

Let's simply take population Wuhan 10 million multiply 3.8%, number people ever infected also 320,000.
Based 80,000 symptomatic cases published China, 240,000 people asymptomatic recovered spontaneously, undetectable, 75 per cent asymptomatic recovered spontaneously.
Another article analyzed 78% cases asymptomatic infection.
The two ratios also pretty much right target.
But another reflection right China enforce blockade Wuhan, 240,000 asymptomatic patients running analysis-bmj-study-suggests-78-people-covid -19-dont-show-symptoms


Nature publishes details largest prevalence data serum antibodies China date

„ÄÄ„ÄÄFrom March 9 April 10, researchers collected serum samples 17,368 people seven cities China's Hubei Province (Wuhan, Honghu Jingzhou), Guangdong Province (Guangzhou Foshan), Sichuan Province (Chengdu) Chongqing.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe samples included 2,535 patients, 4,384 health care workers, 219 family members health care workers, 346 hotel workers (these hotels specialize accommodating frontline health care workers fighting epidemic), 442 factory workers 9,442 community residents.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe researchers divided test subjects two groups: health care setting group (n=6919) community setting group (n= 10449). Health care workers, outpatients patients routine maintenance haemodialysis part health care facility setting sample, others part community setting. Sample.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe study found seropositivity rate medical facility group 2.5%, including 3.8% Wuhan. community setting, seropositivity rate 0.8%, 3.2% Wuhan. Good move. Low common US associated vicious Covid disease. great vitamin epidemic bone health, improved mood, heart health. Consider starting now. sunshine exposure also boosts levels. opportunity open. didn‚Äôt follow rules. 

They getting deserve. prior told ‚ÄúABSOLUTELY STEROIDS!‚Äù Trump orders glass water Vegas mayor takes bets whether Trump able raise way mouth. sure fit governor that, it‚Äôs start... Typo. It‚Äôs 0.03%. IHey Jim j US Brazil way fewer new cases today? Brazil 55k new cases two days ago 15k today I'm suburbs Massachusetts I'll tell going stores restaurants could forgiven thinking coronavirus gone. minority wearing masks point. ok loot, riot, burn police precincts. Priorities people. we're ruled idiot shut area . localized cluster long . Agreed. I‚Äôm doctor high school pretty meaningless me. Also moved grade 9 honest pretty angsty difficult time life miss way. Nobody disputing tho Hi 12, I‚Äôll support ya lmao tens thousands deaths been, one worst death rates world. could done much much better job, even control moment (still plenty time another peak reopen course, chance people follow restrictive rules time, thanks DomCum). US death rates absolutely peaked. They're something like 75% peak. That's outstanding.

New cases terrible proxy measurements time countries. measure testing changes actual prevalence.

Do whatever. economy going implode. Lol right? gonna say...

My grandfather 97. drank beer today talked enjoying growing hair out. Thinks it‚Äôll finally get ladies. FaceTimed 102 brother.

So yes, many folks live far past life expectancy demographic, most, still worth living. r/legaladvice IMO many active cases peak deaths time-frame northeast. Im NJ resident say get tested needed severely symptomatic (they would check temperature test site didnt post 102 werent getting tested). Therefore NJ reported 4k new cases day, 4k extremely symptomatic cases. simply can't compare data early days much changed. can‚Äôt expect everyone wear masks two years. end game here?

Yes can, necessary, expect everyone wear masks two years. big deal.

I've see ""What end game"" verbiage parroted endlessly- particular talking point originate? Hey! HEB great, also great much less busy kroger now. highschool best time life I'd suggest actual living late. Saturday, Alabama 29,000 confirmed cases COVID-19, quarter cases reported **in last two weeks.** Sadly, believe scientific community share TPR abbreviation Americans read ‚Äútoilet paper rolls.‚Äù would NY/NJ/MA went lock kept stringent measures place. even still slow progress. Imagine like weeks Florida still head sand. Yeah, mixing user replying guys seriously still trust anything CCP pits out? heard specifics actual challenge trials people get intentionally infected.

I‚Äôm well aware it‚Äôs flu, reason original comment. Yes, hopefully don‚Äôt use overflow. honestly think may become super desperate try stop election covid. Won‚Äôt shut anything couple weeks before.  Wait till July 4th rolls around lol Trying kill small businesses Agreed. Everyone right live well. live excess like rich. It‚Äôs unsustainable wrong. large percentage protestors wore masks. also outside. Freedom double edged sword like sometimes He‚Äôs downgraded doubtfully admission icu bed Confirmed cases terrible proxy. Way biased measure testing prevalence. 

Mortality reasonable proxy. Obviously subject lag (small) differences population makeup. nonetheless much better. Goverment fails properly implement pandemic protocols. Businesses suffer, whether open close. positive rate going 5% May 17% week especially troubling. people immune news virus hits personally - folks got cited wearing masks today supermarket even know mask law.

The mask order still pretty much limit state allow local governments do, really disappointing cities outside Maricopa/state capital sphere.

Food, gas, electric, water risk urban parts state. Two large wildfires burning last two weeks (Bush Fire near Mesa nearing 200k acres, Bighorn Fire near Tucson 50k acres) pretty big concerns, they're near Covid-19 hotspots firefighters can't exactly social distance job (thankfully, smoke mostly issue populated areas.)

The food distribution network fairly robust - reinforced since March run stores emptied things (some union drivers worked external contracts deliver extra shipments stores restaurants closed up.) distinct shortage anything local stores here, stores local distribution problems (like one store gets baking soda, one store gets yeast...) Restaurants still good supply (even started getting generic paper products want distributors order branded products contract hours serving conditions again.) makes pissed, I've seen too. bored kids, decency people. met human race? Pick one argument pretend like actual care it. convincing throwing everything ignoring contradictions. Ugh accompanying FB page Masks4All toxic. point even know post sarcastic not. Yeah. serious note, think things play contributing things exploding fast doomsayers doomsaying.

1. Humans understand exponential growth. true February, virus growing 20-50% per day everywhere.   pace, nowhere couple months catastrophe. Now, states growing 5-50% per week, meaning places months years catastrophe. rational perspective, obviously means plenty time deal things become catastrophe. viewer's perspective, means ""the month February"", took month infections reach catastrophic levels, instead going take many months. doomsayer's perspective, since people know math, means say ""in weeks things hit fan"" actually months.

2. We're keeping nursing homes long-term care facilities. recent study Belgium claims 0.4-0.8% IFR non-nursing-home males (I believe long term care facilities group), half females. nursing home IFR something like 50% males. Nursing homes problem point view spread (see point #1), there's overwhelming evidence early everywhere higher percentage nursing home residents infected general population. keeping nursing homes - done focused testing, easy point - cut hospitalizations deaths large margin.

3. We're actually better able treat virus better now. think way judge degree factor, since outright positive thing I'm going put list, hope lot. vitamin D/C/zinc, earlier hospitalization oxygen, fewer ventilators, fewer people getting huge viral loads, use AMS drugs instead bullshit advanced cases, people taking care bodies they've told weak people greater risk. could improve early-stage immune response enough figure virus spreads far body, decrease hospital mortality/stay duration keep hospitals overwhelmed. PPE huge part - wear mask, people.

4. We're getting better hiding impending catastrophe. could come several forms, want highlight Arizona's clever method moving patients around hospitals keep load balanced. means hospital Arizona (pretty obviously state closest breaking point) going overwhelmed, one day run beds once. (If we'd done early on, though, would spread virus faster PPE.) weird? completely agree small flareups wuhan weeks seen go measures. guess implications bejing getting control pretty bad makes sense. doesn‚Äôt be. Idiots cannot argued with. truism. someone lives Houston really hope people would start wearing masks.... n=37

Fearmongering best hope every country world closed boarders anyone coming US. Good point... also spent 60 freaking million one Houston April tore May. recall completely flabbergasted one vaccine, nothing chained. lot cities that. I'm glad scared like was. Wear mask, stay panic attacks replaced boredom fine with... troll little much now. proud did... throwaways lol? Exactly. Controlling virus isn‚Äôt hard make be. ""It's end world""

But us get sick maimed, really end world. like, unlucky. 

/s went tech heavy school atleast compared state school. Anyways. Atleast college enjoyed everything it. people, classes, buildings hanging around campus. twisted way enjoyed my.labs field study. College great ever level(for me) compared highschool friends... maybe sports that. big what. mean say Texans dumb? Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, El Paso 5 top 20 cities population. Plus Apple Tesla moving Texas. Houston largest port western hemisphere. Houston also one diverse cities America. hugging brain socially distancing. üòú thing US suppress minority votes  No, think understand difference number increase decrease percentage increase decrease. talking numbers, percentages data speaking facts. ""methodology"" simple arithmetic percentages. seem saying anything except think I'm wrong without supporting data own. 

Example.

Facts;

6/20 - 119,131 total US deaths

6/21 - 119,719 total US deaths 

That's difference 588 new deaths representing single day increase .49%. single day percentage increase US deaths bottomed .26% June 15 fluctuating. 

The 5 day moving average daily percentage increase US deaths currently .61%. 

Maybe missed:
 daily US deaths slowed

Cleaning minimal often left teacher comes desks shared supplies. lice outbreak non stop child's school last year, head lice hard get compared Covid19. importantly, sick kids sent school often due parents able miss work. 

Covid popping American workplaces right Americans prioritize work life. schools opened again, we'll go back work. open something, there's going back. ramps Covid plans. We'll get lose even people.

China's top infectious disease experts (Zhong Nanshan, Li Lanjuan, Wang Chen, Zhang Wenhong, etc., etc.) common understanding, stated countless times media generally accepted government citizens, infectious diseases cannot controlled ignoring breaking chain transmission, prerequisite breaking chain transmission identify source infection, i.e., detect cases.
China's goal eventually control virus, make ""look like virus control. country world able control coronavirus without finding case. correct number cases released raise public awareness allow people take sensible precautions.
From point view, releasing right information much useful releasing wrong information.
If China wanted save face Beijing time around, would released outbreak all.

As claim infection rate Wuhan millions, personally think data back up, since medical issue, good idea make public. Category, recognize top journals basis paper. fact exact statistic data, Wuhan tested everyone nucleic acids antibodies, Sampling statistics.

„ÄÄOn June 5, Nature published largest prevalence data serum antibodies China date.
Serum antibody testing 17,368 people seven cities, including Wuhan, found people direct contact hospitals. Serum neo-coronavirus antibody positivity rate 2.5%; serum neo-coronavirus antibody positivity rate people without direct hospital contact 0.8%. seropositivity rate Wuhan, outbreak center, ranged 3.2% 3.8% different sub-cohorts.

Let's simply take population Wuhan 10 million multiply 3.8%, number people ever infected also 320,000.
Based 80,000 symptomatic cases published China, 240,000 people asymptomatic recovered spontaneously, undetectable, 75 per cent asymptomatic recovered spontaneously.
Another article analyzed 78% cases asymptomatic infection.
The two ratios also pretty much right target.
But another reflection right China enforce blockade Wuhan, 240,000 asymptomatic patients running analysis-bmj-study-suggests-78-people-covid -19-dont-show-symptoms


Nature publishes details largest prevalence data serum antibodies China date

„ÄÄ„ÄÄFrom March 9 April 10, researchers collected serum samples 17,368 people seven cities China's Hubei Province (Wuhan, Honghu Jingzhou), Guangdong Province (Guangzhou Foshan), Sichuan Province (Chengdu) Chongqing.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe samples included 2,535 patients, 4,384 health care workers, 219 family members health care workers, 346 hotel workers (these hotels specialize accommodating frontline health care workers fighting epidemic), 442 factory workers 9,442 community residents.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe researchers divided test subjects two groups: health care setting group (n=6919) community setting group (n= 10449). Health care workers, outpatients patients routine maintenance haemodialysis part health care facility setting sample, others part community setting. Sample.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe study found seropositivity rate medical facility group 2.5%, including 3.8% Wuhan. community setting, seropositivity rate 0.8%, 3.2% Wuhan. agree. woods, even close. might even regressing. country rock hard place.

Everyone acting like virus longer problem worse ever US Brazil. also circumstances Trump admitted suppressed testing numbers make look bad. actual number cases almost certainly way higher.

There's literally good argument them.  sensitive anyone putting vaccine bad light. Staying facts shady practices certain vaccine developers unfortunately this. Also, Canada plateaued declining. Theres like 10 cases province. America sucks. Congrats! toaster. yes. New York run space, help medical ships, able control insane amount cases had. medical ship entirely preemptive barely used. Remember NY one point thought needed 40,000 ventilators. 

Just ship used mean ran beds.  would better selfish narcissists wearing them. could also truthfully caveated statement ""provided put take correctly (link CDC guidelines"" minimise indoor time strangers. recently, last 50 years meant.

Im saying afraid admit.

If wondering deaths falling fast:

1. Better operating procedures nursing homes, bulk deaths happen.
2. Better antiviral treatments. Despite hydroxychloroquine fiasco, we're finding good number generic drugs successfully treat COVID.
3. change demographic make-up infected people. early days pandemic, disproportionately large % confirmed cases among elderly, increased risk death. complete opposite, disproportionately large % young. They're far less likely die. So, total number cases increasing, number infections among elderly falling fast, daily death rate falling fast. analogy perfect highlights main point - freedoms others literally hurt anyone, cry ""muh freedom"" actually fatal consequences.  thought fb killed reunions? People also need learn obligated patronize business like rules. house, rules. pump dump scheme continues. wasn‚Äôt impressed data released certainly wouldn‚Äôt hold normal circumstances.

The convention center used. Thoroughly.

Don't know part ignored...

Don't know part NY double total amount beds available downplayed... sucks field hospitals mobilized pretty quick.

ChaChing! Merkel actually explained TV R0 means important 1.

A scientist government good explaining things masses. fantastic. antibodies would give longer term immunity, memory produce believe. 1. would fine everyone wore masks 
2. Lots hotties I'm floridian. hope. That's please let one there's nothing else new cases likely protesters. young doubt we'll see death rates go dramatically. That's personal opinion though. could bc lot things America huge nation. say ‚Äúcases going flat‚Äù it‚Äôs actually declining previously hard hit states, IE Northeast, picking alarming rate states south like Carolinas, Florida, Texas Arizona among others. really want champion country getting control reality shows hotspots simply shifting south? Also boot, almost action taken said southern states getting hit hardest it‚Äôs get way, way worse gets better.

As said previous comment, there‚Äôs lag diagnosis hospitalizations death. IE, pointing death hospitalization rate indicator cases came weeks month ago. influx diagnoses now, think equate states seeing terms hospitalizations deaths near future? Pro tip: won‚Äôt anything good them. Said states taking actions get control much like northeast states first hit hard back March, unfortunately isn‚Äôt happening. Unless things change better now, it‚Äôs going spell ugly future far road. pisses irrational covid beliefs. many years local clinic hospital mask dispensers almost every doorway. Every single person America knows hospital workers, especially nurses doctors, wear masks routinely around patients.

Yet somehow, people ignore fact hospitals clinics masks place. decades. Instead recognizing mask usage obviously done cuts spreading germs, decide masks good, wear them. 

It's like suddenly decided that, since cars still crash even though brakes, bother using brakes anymore. wear seat belts, saw car hit tractor trailer head seat belts save anyone.

It's willful ignorance, start finish, nothing else. absolutely know better. Hell, Seguin (pop 25k) there‚Äôs 10 bars know of. dare speak people like fellow engineers. certainly miss highschool. never meet single engineer ever made claim.

Just miss highschool doesnt mean shit. Aye, someone else posted virus mutated weaker strain. good bad new. Depends see it.

Well what‚Äôs current data makes sure? know fact EU didn‚Äôt decline testing? economy hurt more? Would interested getting fuller picture data form opinion.

Make mistake though. It‚Äôs EXTREMELY hard fish kind punishment lot evidence. Additionally, it‚Äôs tough TABC go handing bans like candy since bars restaurants really struggling keep doors open. hope patrons owners Texas make better decisions want favorite bar restaurant stay open.

Also, Abbott go suck cock blaming ‚Äúyoung people‚Äù. disagree. Life series calculated risks. end, it‚Äôs ‚Äúevery man himself‚Äù, grey area people make choices. 

In case, daycare option facility everything within reason keep children faculty safe - masks, distancing, cleaning, etc. Despite may read here, data overwhelmingly shows children fair well virus. Anecdotal course, children know COVID-19 experienced mild illness. factor things decision making. 

On top that, social interaction vital developing child. months isolation becomes obvious. 

So, see someone make decision use daycare provider blissfully ignorant ‚Äúcovid denier/hoax‚Äù. Wait, know three sea shells?? Yeah read UK changing one meter breath school reopenings. going crazy next months. I'm 100% certain, pretty easy infer based current data currently likely outcome. Right?!? Ima need fellow prisoners find way develop sense comradery inmates jailhouse getting really fucking annoying  Let‚Äôs see numbers look couple weeks due rally Transmission death averages 24 days. Deaths today indicate transmissions ~24 days ago. New cases indicate transmission ~10 days ago. expect two week lag them. Deaths would expect based lag. Good. lack collective respond adequately company reopening office Monday would like word you. However, there‚Äôs evidence may advantageous receive vaccine early.

A recent study indicated maximum immunity achieved shortly following vaccination decreases passing month. Therefore, get vaccine August, may susceptible infection late flu season, around February March.

The CDC recommends getting flu vaccine influenza activity begins pick within community, ideally end October.

Just way see MLB, NBA NHL. Three major reasons opinion: 

1. majority players wealthy. Multi-millionaire's afford take part season even full season off.

2. ""Bubbles"" actually happen.... remember players young men 20""s early 30's...somebody sneaking going South Beach someone undoubtedly bring virus back.

3. virus asymptomatic point. matter good testing... virus always show certain amount time host.

To many ""ifs"" also ever fully get big leagues running. 

Just opinion. know soccer (EPL) playing... think unfortunately short time positive cases shut down. know rest US like northeastern states covid went crazy month two dropped?  beep boop stay home dads? Yes

It's shit show I‚Äôm sure Tulsa rally won‚Äôt help numbers either Yep. much rioting.  wear ball cap? Buttons side near back might able hold straps ears. never called cold. never made references death rate. never even mentioned flu.

Also HIV adapt, hides immune system cause symtoms years specifically allows spread.

I'll enjoy low lasts. would way nicer though calm storm. I'm still trying understand point is. one? think right, seems like relatively safe hedge, things risk considered. think week I'll take look gold try work strategy. TBH think showing narcissism value business, economy money life kind knew already USA really fully believe it. Even day-to-day without virus, USA country over-worked people least 1st world perspective compared 1st world countries Europe least. Nobody saying virus cares knows difference, that‚Äôs took away, you‚Äôve sadly missed point. see /s I‚Äôm curious nonsense they‚Äôre spouting CO2 haven‚Äôt heard yet. Since 40-59 considered ""young adult""? I'd say that's pretty adulty billionaires work millionaires Still cannot believe government still refuse mandate wearing masks outside still extending emergency orders Andddd ain‚Äôt flying anytime soon states, may try mislead thinking that. true. unemployment funded least partially federal government basic rule work fault own. 

If unable return work risk contracting COVID-19 employer cannot arrange alternate work (like working home), eligible unemployment. may need contact doctor get medical exemption present employer requesting specific accommodation. may even initial claim denied disputed. ultimately, government can't deny unemployment unable work real risk COVID-19 returning normal employment. Kids benefit parents work. They'd probably dialysis patients receiving went route. Obviously ideal prevents heart attacks, strokes, etc. maybe viable option. People go bars get away kids asshole brings 

This^^^ Americans terrible memory. already seeing many people wearing mask socially distancing NYC. sacrifice go waste keep up. pisses Americans seem realise Europe many different countries. I'm UK well we've done badly! Sadly bullshit spreading... I'm seeing mumbojumbo spiritual medicine bullshit spreading country well...  article dumb. course know transmit via airborne particles. look church choir restaurant ventilation cases well documented. Given easy virus appears able spread, certainly spreading via means versus someone simply coughing you. numbers know about. would easy assume millions more, given suppression/reluctance/inability test. 

Fuck. I'm even sure CARES Act UI got ground yet Ohio. governor making daily updates April May, lt governor kept making bad promises it. Yeah happened too.. slow reopening everyone mean take precautions mindful means hey fuck 2 days covid gone. accurate? shape curve - flattening truly boggles mind stupid people are. Like, expect would come this? It‚Äôs truly heading towards higher end worst case scenario number deaths there‚Äôs nothing collectively stop it. 

Well, is, said, lock downs masks determine political affiliation. Sounds white. oligarchs run governments oligarchs need proles keep showing salt mines. *Texas childcare centers see sharp increase coronavirus cases months relative calm*

Laura Nathan Tate kept 2-year-old son, Cameron, home months pandemic. three restaurants reopened, felt safe sending back daycare Rockwall facility taking safety precautions coronavirus-free.

But Cameron recently developed fever, couple rushed ER. June 13, less week returning Primrose Daycare, center told Tates staff member ‚Äî one Cameron interacted ‚Äî tested positive coronavirus. panicked, wondering son‚Äôs health many people might potentially, unknowingly, exposed coronavirus son tested positive disease.

‚ÄúIt started like domino effect,‚Äù Laura said. ‚ÄúYou start putting together pieces could happening.‚Äù

Cameron, 3, tested negative COVID-19 positive strep throat. children staff daycare centers throughout state tested positive coronavirus.

Coronavirus cases Texas surged, childcare centers exception. Friday, 410 total cases coronavirus ‚Äî 267 staff members 143 children ‚Äî reported 318 licensed child care operations across state, according Texas Health Human Services Commission. That‚Äôs sharp increase 339 cases agency reported Thursday 210 shared KVUE-TV Austin Monday.

In written statement Dallas Morning News, Primrose Rockwall said never stopped practicing emergency requirements eventually repealed June 12. requirements included pre-screening, limited entry temperature taking, among things.

On June 13, though, Primrose closed doors two weeks learning positive cases within school. Rockwall County Emergency Management revealed Friday seven people ‚Äî four children three adults school ‚Äî tested positive disease.

‚ÄúWe wish quick recovery look forward welcoming children families back school June 29,‚Äù statement read, adding Primrose stepped cleaning procedures response.

**No easy answers**

For months, childcare centers operated coronavirus cases, others voluntarily remained closed.

‚ÄúI think points many questions easy answers,‚Äù said Tori Mannes, president CEO ChildCareGroup, nonprofit operates eight centers, partners local school districts manages subsidy programs hundreds across state. ‚ÄúWe everything support sustain childcare providers, get side COVID-19, economy workforce going need childcare centers open operational.‚Äù

Mannes called childcare centers ‚Äúbackstop workforce.‚Äù said daycare workers heroes they‚Äôve gone work frontline workers could so, well.

The workers‚Äô safety requirements operating pandemic, however, expensive industry already operates razor thin budget, Mannes said.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre struggling keep doors open,‚Äù said.

In February, coronavirus hit North Texas, state‚Äôs 17,279 licensed registered child care centers homes caring estimated 1.1 million children, according Texas Health Human Services Commission. Friday, 12,196 facilities open.

Staying open deemed essential coronavirus. Texas Workforce Commission provided subsidies, drawing money programs essential workers low-income parents phased out. didn‚Äôt make facilities‚Äô revenue losses due plummeting enrollment.

**Onus parents**

On May 18, Gov. Greg Abbott allowed daycares open non-essential workers, well. Emergency requirements entry pre-screening put place, repealed June 12.

The lack requirements puts onus parents ensure kids going safe venue.

‚ÄúParents going look really closely ask good questions childcare centers policies are,‚Äù said Stephanie Rubin, CEO Texans Care Children Austin. ‚ÄúThey need understand state agency, THHSC, sending licensing reps monitor following rules right now.‚Äù

Though Cameron Tate came back negative COVID-19, mother said plans keep home least month ‚Äî possibly longer.

* don;'t think America great place live

On top job related issues insane politics, awful food (imo) overly reliant chain restaurants, weird gun culture, deal Americans every day.

I ended taking job Sydney, Australia, think best decision ever made. Quality life beats US city - Melbourne Sydney usually top livable cities indexes. Culture far like British culture - none fake bullshit get states, proper pubs, fit, active populace etc. Amazing food - probably best anywhere I've lived visited. top get paid salary US job.

My point choices give even better standard life, without American idiocy.

we see cases coming **and across land borders, community transmission**. still serve food. Ohhhhh suppressed alright fact first wave much higher would imply much lower number vulnerable people (because already got died). Isn‚Äôt way early claim US worse job handling this? still far fewer deaths per person EU. Well anecdotal see people walking around without masks, 2 restaraunts weekend grocery store saw employees turn away guests without mask. one instance, actually gave customer mask made put on.

This dallas.

So places taking little serious. think important remember lot people following rules trying things right, cannot lost hope assholes gonna assholes. cannot judge historical figures modern-day standard STICK IT!

I know people quit always glad did. Solution rich: escape New Zealand/Taiwan/Singapore wait 18 months weird part me. Cloth masks seem pretty ineffective kn blocking asymptomatic presymptomatic (aerosol) transmission. you‚Äôre emitting droplets out.

I understand rational behind side, blaming side opening soon, wearing mask getting us safely. try make kind comments politicized, shuts half audience conversation.

However, agree politicians failed us spectacular level. IMO events like whole reason Fed, State &amp; Local gov's around. can't help us little people deal things wayyy depth, good for? 

What gets me, badly handled. National disaster relief public safety parts government automatically deployed regardless who, party steering wheel.

Anyways,
Stay safe.. Free health care. good. üòä Glad I'm one! Wear mask night work, I've taken mask sneeze, bc get new mask every week. (tbf guideline says ""or soiled"" I'd rather try keep unsoiled/dry, ask new one bc constant allergies.)

Thats worst thing! first month this, let work home. sudden May locked said longer allowing working home, despite work par exceeding work done office beforehand. ability allow work home refusing. Compare excess deaths expected deaths. Coronavirus attributed half. Though issue true countries Pretty fucking loud company brought **zero** products market.  is? true. building recently opened strict mask service policy, even offer masks upon entering property there‚Äôs excuses.

You know business slowed down? 

You guessed bruh

The business mother fingering black dick US like little kid back classroom mouthful crayons bucket head. user name confuses üò≠ pms flow right me. Hospitalizations lag behind new case increases. helped, least initially, making logistics ""locking down"" entire country much simpler. Australia NZ islands way south pacific far everything - land borders tightly controlled air borders. meant could turn around cut rest world *just like that*: nobody allowed leave, new arrivals, anyone already transit forced mandatory quarantine literal armed guard.

Of course, one small part response - meant new cases get outside; plenty enough cases spreading country already runaway community transmission would quickly overrun imported cases, rendering border closure ultimately pointless. ""Being island"" help get control: fucking idiots lead psychopathic orange tyrant it. That's excuse. protecting employee's safety means sacrificing health, employer needs better security, laxer rules. Safety rules negotiable belligerent customers thrown out. make permanent. Companies willing harm community close permanently issue it‚Äôs ‚Äúsome.‚Äù Ya bout protests, eh? helps brain inflammation lot! Hope get bill.

He's utterly shit, get wrong, one thing blame divisiveness.

He create it. created it. win freak accident, electorate not, half country fact vote him. Half country thought everything said, anti science, sexual assaults, thinly veiled excuse ridden racist ""that's *really* meant"" shit **just fucking dandy.** 

What made us divisive realizing truth way things are. Even pushed one side firmly recent disaster. voted him, honest, thought dumbass world would keep spinning. Well, spinning alright - straight goddamn toilet. Thats really bad seeing 2008 2016 20 million people become eligible vote. Endangering lives nothing anything wrote. talking political strategy, jfc. death or. 

If one people deeply bothered concept death exists, I'm interested. 9/11. tons Middle Eastern(and Indian) people attacked blamed it/terrorism general. company would want work Yeah, careful. Look see state employment office policy this. say come back work afraid COVID-19, may sufficient appeal denial benefits. 

To eligible unemployment benefits, willing work full time actively seeking full time work normal occupation. could treat refusal go back work disqualifying need appeal ruling show adequate evidence willing unable work. restaurant, call center. think authors said anything bathrooms call center. Anytime lol. Brain squeeze bout protests, eh? sub counting like it‚Äôs fucking New Years. Disgusting. sure wear mask anyway, regardless whether there's 'rule'. Midwest R-state hearing school also send everyone back suggest masks. promise keep school extra clean set hand sanitizer. sick, deadly joke.  Lol. wish clever. know better. Alzheimer's brain. Plaque forms brain person longer responsible do. obvious fit care them. smack children around something wrong. problem many people like working nursing homes. sure one thing, human instinct might made patients around react fear hostility. I‚Äôm guessing thought wouldn‚Äôt enforced like it‚Äôs enforced shit ton places? would think would done first weeks daily reports knowing going get worse June 1 came Oregon like 'back normal!' traffic mostly back work almost normal. office still closed public, ever looks. someone wanted meeting showed up, still had/have answer door, let in, etc. distancing small office.

FL AZ spiking 3 weeks yet us see trend deaths. actually worked. would much worse place Huh? would one find high levels alpha defensins? government (Argentina) advised face masks stupid rethoric (i believe keep resources medical staff) almost end march. 
Then enforced it. sudden 180 spin. Anyway, even adviced use since beginning, prevented current outbreak many people live poor condition. Lmao read Public-health officials warn data still preliminary, however, protest-related cases could still rise. can't even enforce self isolation.................. Finland Norway basically residual deaths weeks despite masks. Sweden hit substantially harder still quarter peak daily deaths half peak active ICU cases. Numbers still falling. sad. need pandemic tell ya talk decent chunk friends aqcuaintences. said, people, I'm talking news, lackluster reporting individuals getting sick. Keep mind, know lot people work manual labor, blue collar, country originally, people really connection to. probably hear different mainly talking 9-5 white collar workers, younger kids, college students, however, one old jobs, sent 4 people home course last three weeks alone, small place. originally country, said, tend stick communities friends obvious something going on. Two hospitals yellow alert, one rerouting already. going day well. Obviously could anything, shooting, accident, see anything pop news.

No reason assume I'm saying ""100% we're exploding cases"", I'm saying within people know talk to, people still constantly getting sick, testing positive, especially manual labor jobs. Everyone's experience obviously anecdotal, obviously talk different people, different locations, different jobs do, unheard might hear different things. recognizing pattern, coming hard conclusions, said might coincidence, I'm saying anything 100%, besides first time I've seen two hospitals yellow Alert
The emergency department temporarily requests receive absolutely patients need urgent medical care. Yellow alert initiated Emergency dept experiencing temporary overwhelming overload priority II III patients may managed safely. Prior diverting pediatric patients, medical consultation advised pediatric patient transports emergency departments yellow alert.

One requesting zero new patients delivered hospital, again, something seen before. Walnut-brains, that's good one! true Yea it‚Äôs [50% 6 Uhm... Sweden literally lies foreign press testing protect image.
So include us list. We‚Äôre ‚Äúright mess‚Äù. economy opening people going back normal. There‚Äôs plans reopen catering steps taken told us phase us lockdown. emergency hospital put fast possibly could amount new cases daily deaths dropping.

If anything, we‚Äôre taking precautions even stricter social distancing rules countries Europe even though science suggests start reduce 2 metre distance. gov still playing safe. continue caring rehabilitating ill perpetuated fellow selfish, ignorant Americans. guy literally moron. even know point post. sounds like petty competitiveness. stupid. must thinked r clever.  Haha dude iPhone based post history. One American made ones? 

And seriously Chinese anything? beat everyone forced vaccinate order whatever little bit small rights theyre willing allot us. fear mongering tv stops. Til continue get dicked clue, thought world meter though Waves come sets. seventh biggest. truly believe people suffering PTSD like syndrome respect COVID. want regular lives back subsconciously cannot handle going world. blame them, also mob mentality. result hang ilconcieved statement belief allows pretend real. Almost like someone gone trauma, pretend happen. happening world respect gatherings freedom, racial discrimination, refusal wear masks social distance. Unfortunately, Darwin right, people maintain sanity patience survice, many cannot, die. herd immuniity going lessen virus, culling herd. Protestors included? Considering moving Texas LDR partner long-term. Please help learn like living there, really put moment!! still herd immunity? Yeah, pretty good strategy. Get protection US without taxes come along it. Babies died virus. mean... really surprised? Alot Americans spoiled idea means free without consideration masses.  spend day angrily rooting people‚Äôs demise, living life without fear without ever thinking again. already WAY many California. 

WAY many. Collapsing empires go stage near end often called ""cannibalization peasantry."" due diminishing returns complexity, State needs resources order fund inefficient bureaucracy, etc. 

Anyways, case America 13th especially 14th amendment effectively created eventuality corporate empire. ""cannibalization peasantry"" phase American empire entered, middle class working class destroyed number ways.

This ""ugly"" see part destruction: cannibalization consuming financial well-being social purpose order fuel profits, indeed extreme stage *where actually begun consume empathy, compassion, mercy, humanity.* Mentalities like consequence...

It evil nefarious conscious mindset either, rather coldness made possible *by disassociative mechanisms* manifested material social complexity. Think us poors ""disassociative black box"" dudes like levers. pull levers $$$ fed black box (as well social prestige, etc) *yet cannot see consumed within box generate $$$ black box presents.* 

I agree statement 100%- ugly ugly American gets; ugliness extreme sociopathy generated disassociative structures built complexity- effect sociopathy without guilt due system process moral laundering complexity. People colour? Really? what, transparent? We're shades orange, dude. blows mind constantly seems forgotten. keep seeing articles trying explain absence deaths light increase cases. think myself, ‚ÄúGive time.‚Äù don‚Äôt. wish wouldn‚Äôt give much damn time.

Luckily, transferred junior high elementary school thus year, due elementary teaching experience, sports much issue me. know guys used work coming worries daily though.

Right biggest concern, actually make back building, trying keep masks social distancing happening lower grades. Kindergartner first grade kids concept personal space, I've learned daughter four year olds despise wearing mask prolonged period. think 5 year old children differ much take masks understand either. people insane. seen posts saying masks reduce amount oxygen thus weaken immune system. Fairly certain true (I actually seen studies claim that, validity I'm sure about.) even true, nobody asking strap one face never take off. need wear one alone car, need wear one house, need wear one outside (when groups) gods sake long people shop notice oxygen intake getting low? wear one job even notice bit. bit fear mongering needed situation deadly virus something fear. agree people go far also think lot people definitely go far enough.

You complain much fear mongering circlejerking, doubt minds changed typing this, better play safe cause ireversable damage somebody's health.

Almost workers non-German citizens eastern Europe living baracks provided companies. makes places absolutely perfect diseaes spread, COVID first one highlight that. one reason keep eye numbers every day; I'm concerned situation want know seems like things getting much worse.  far, though, I've surprised deaths consistently declining.  

Don't get wrong, even deaths continue decline, bad enough US uncontrolled spread disease.  I'm big advocate social distancing, mask usage, on. wait millions people physically unable work

Other isolated scare porn sub, there's evidence debilitating aftereffects, usual recovery pneumonias drugs used treat it. 

Shall wait ten-ish years lift lockdowns make sure we've waited long enough assess long-term consequences?

Also, millions? Lol. Can't believe I'm saying employer definitely going extend $5 per hour bonus getting 2 months now. I'm making $840 week outbreak.

Almost everyone happy risk jumping car go ice cream. Even though action also risks third parties lives like pedestrians motorists.

If people ok assuming risk something trivial ice cream, feel people give ability earn livelihood families lower risk Covid-19, presents even lower threat lifespan driving, would say unfair expectations others. people really cared much risk life, wouldn‚Äôt driving. deaths per capita among highest world ""doing ok""; thats clear sign ""do nothing""-tactic complete utter failure. death toll 5000, population 10 million. Comparing Nordic neighbours Norway, Denmark, Finland, 244, 600, 326 deaths respectively (and populations 5.3, 5.8, 5.5 million respectively) cannot straight fucking face claim Sweden exceding 5000 death toll ""doing ok"". time! regret it. taking great step better health. No... US approach supposed ""lower transmission rate social distancing""

The swedish approach supposed ""lower transmission rate getting everyone infected lmao"" Lowest death rate day since March 24 though. ‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt care‚Äù 

Italians yes. That‚Äôs way they‚Äôre easy fine walking sidewalk. American cops know they‚Äôll get immense pushback citizens don‚Äôt want take petty bullshit. cops scared us. Your‚Äôs not.  That‚Äôs good deal Nice cool air circulated fans. World om eter, like thermometer.

Oh irony.  seen that, surprised.  I'm random dude internet, smart people seem worried Fall, makes sense could big issue, given people clustered indoors, perhaps pandemic fatigue (tired social distancing, etc). Honestly, hopefully bars see realize taking things seriously. saw videos locals bars weeks ago zero social distancing place. four months now: March, April, May June understood reference. month Easter in, again? Tomorrow's headline: Thousands Lombardy descend Novax-ers Florence beat crap them. made sure drop local record store reopened. Wichita, here. destruction near nobody cares.

Would Gwen Graham made good governor? studies level education political parties. correlation. I've began consider idea true democracy United States. give people choice...

Eliminate House Representatives, keep Senate. Task Senate proposing legislation. Said proposed laws get added ballots mailed twice year; January first, August first. American voter fills ballot saying 'yay' 'nay' proposed bill, returns ballots mail.

Let people decide directly. president acts last stop signing bills law vetoing them. Senate gets vote override veto. 

Bingo. Problem solved. Australia, Rural areas normal personal space country folk 2 5 metres. city areas, much closer like 30 cm's half metre. upbringing, DNA would suggest. stick fork Baseball, maybe even College NFL football year. kinda messed one saying masks dont work meant, need masks, selfish, like tp. Nothing. Restaurants cinemas bars remain clientele change towards crowd care catching covid19 next iteration socially transmitted disease. usa #1 made national news rehabilitation center given Immediate Jeopardy status got federal inspectors. residents assumed covid much staff well. horrible place. Itd prob effective use reverse psychology say people shouldn‚Äôt get tested. 

/s. Kind of. guess. get saying, trump decided divert billions small business emergency loans away actual small businesses, basically ensured small businesses would forced reopen ASAP. can't imagine could go wrong...if way prevent spread....... assist figuring funny that? lot issue leadership. I'm Texas abbot ready roll wheelchair bodies old folks. trump, lot elected mistakes shameful we're reaping we've sown. comfortable risk? 

I‚Äôd say individuals fully understand risk lose others. 

It‚Äôs like letting people decide whether mask not. people fully understood risks full consequences, everyone would mask every time left house. people inherently bad estimating long term invisible risks. 

That‚Äôs good pandemic management about, opposed ‚Äúdo whatever feel like‚Äù/‚Äúevery man himself‚Äù. economic (ubi) political (non-right wing executive branch)!infrastructure feasible option without massive suffering would outweigh completely uncontrolled coronavirus outbreak. ""You live comfortably min wage, except actually make min wage worry trying live comfortably min wage"" IVIG blood product prepared serum 1000 15 000 donors per batch therapy costs $5000 $10,000 US (according google) think means anything besides 'try spit people talk,' thats problem. better? terms virus spread, yes, it‚Äôs better. terms experience student, worth it? changes seem psychologically disastrous distance learning. sending back to? yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

1-5 done somewhat routinely hospital lawsuit come right? Schools never met First Responders. Teachers support personal essential workers. Let's keep way keep schools safe. person tested positive covid, hospital would even perform elective surgery. no, would counted part hospitalizations. three kinds lies: lies, damned lies, statistics. find detailed diary things seen absolutely frightening. someone else post mentioned, alone children. also alone children. Everyone take good care themselves, alternative unthinkable. Besides off-topic, article fails answer question poses headline. wear mask public places, social distance, sanitize often. stubborn, ignorant moron? 2965 new cases found New York City June 7 June 18. Superb post.  mostly summarizes feel situation.  I'm you, think pandemic serious problem.  I've argued (on forum elsewhere) also political problem, leadership really failed us (I see talk pandemic talk politics situation!).  

But glad death numbers improving week week.  Hopefully continues.  I'm big fan social distancing mask usage.  I'm lucky NM, mask usage required norm. think huge area nobody really talking about,...... virus spread. droplets,.... think many seniors spreads thru cooling heating systems Yeah, 100% saying means anything solid, really weird without major event explanation. I'm sure people want come conclusion I'm trying ""fearmonger"", I'm simply curious what's going on, cases hear rising, drastically all, I'm surprised see reflection stats either. opened since April outbreaks among staff. Yes, is. that. paywalled yet 4th, younger posts many Americans can't, willing to, comprehend public responsibility. seen vaccines prizing meritocratic myth hard work begetting success.

There countries well, countries performed poorly. mentioned countries cannot lock-down properly. true, problem needs solution. not, hope, much else. So, Governors make honest plea public, try paint people ignorant dummies avoiding masks. bad leadership. remember group project

Well, long he's agreeing sue campaign order attend rally anyway, maybe could also take pledge accept medical treatment becomes infected agree pay medical costs anyone subsequently infects.

Yet weekends still waited 45 mins seated I'm sure problem. embarrassing. hospitalizations confusing. 

10.3% general beds Harris County hospitals filled COVID-19 patients

22.8% ICU beds Harris County hospitals filled COVID-19 patients like people actually believe ""if first one end, 2nd one"" meme. first one ends, second follow. I'm glad live US. continue onto 2022 looks it. epitome white privilege kids don‚Äôt know they‚Äôll forget 3 months though. don‚Äôt blame thinking like scenario American culture/spirit handles pandemic well. Heck I'm even mad. gone way I'd seriously confused. Would like see handled intelligently? Heck yeah. Americans built this. flipping lucky ""big one"". Imagine case-fatality rate 28%. We'd super f'ed, perhaps better expression 2020ed. Everything trade off. 

* Remote learning ideal diminutive learning best. 
* Full back school possible without mass infections.

* Remote learning best way limit spread. 
* Full back school best way educate kids. 

You can't both, balance.

Getting back school dozen classmates, live teacher, etc contain spread smaller circles infection, also getting kids proper education person professional teachers. 

If option optimized learning limited spread we'd already it. would standard.

Every school district/state debating actually educate kids without pandemic spreading even more. 

You kid 15 points contact (kids adults) hell lot better 500 points contact due school back normal. still get go school, peers, learn professional teachers.

It's balance. dream scenario. perfect dream scenario. exist. what's realistic. Worldometers includes presumed cases, Freep publishes confirmed cases. Confirmed cases also see state Michigan's website. redditors said threads, seems texas actually fuck around alcohol permits. (...but maybe im wrong that) Economically speaking, completely uncontrolled outbreak would cause similar demand shock lockdown (on top collapsing healthcare killing lot people). Maybe quite bad way there. Turns people organically stop going restaurants concerts rallies, could come home lung smashing virus - damage bad obvious without media/gov't telling it. One fits properly.

The cost running restaurant even cafe high. really is. ran cafe years really well. looking books everything, boss barely made enough live on. 

As far takeout goes. think restaurants bit, don‚Äôt think hold long term. products everything still cost amount money cases even more, shortages. So, can‚Äôt necessarily charge less money, still offering less experience, people can‚Äôt dine in.

I believe Arizona/Florida/Texas reaching peak moment. fair, work pretty well. Every group rep based rallies I've seen positive willing talk others.

Careless leadership federal level why! perception biggest reason send kids back school childcare. half day work correct? 

Everything said reasonable school education perspective. wish better ideas deal working parents/childcare issue. understand unfortunately (as organization) lie people really shatter trust integrity. I'm saying organizations useful kind give rat's behind say now. go straight science trusted.

 Back early March spreading bull looking studies homemade masks reducing viral loads viruses. Even anyone realized like CDC full sh--- make homemade mask!

 Honestly think would done less damage would said Hey please preserve health care workers make homemade masks homemade masks also effective certain degree. Sure, would portion idiots still trying hoard think actually Americans trustworthy give credit. less people get Corona virus that's less people hospital less masks needed healthcare workers whole logic behind thing stupid.

 puts icing cake said wearing mask could actually dangerous wearing one might actually infect know properly remove it. Dude, get absolutely ridiculous. That's like saying wear condom might accidentally get HIV take wrong. Stupid. tsunami. forget bailout cheap. 1.5 trillion corporations? expected pony again? really one costly chance one chance only. Put aside political differences moment, top man america feels like weak wear mask. Thats sad pathetic would put supporters risk image. Yes, people cautious light serious risk vs moderate vrisk serious precautions things make china bad eyes rest world lead handling pandemic better.

I think complicated that. United States long history strong organized labor recently snuffed oligarchy Almost Brazil tropics. 

For instance, rio southern Brazil getting 80 degree farenheight highs week. we‚Äôre close peak cold temperatures mean, everything works world.

Nothing truly required. Everyone always choice. Even consequences, consequences deterrent, stop anyone anything. Like someone might believe $200 fine worth walking around without mask.

Instead, intentionally delayed lockdown effort preserve economy (which backfired need much longer lock would shut early).

I'm sure aware R rate also estimated back 1 certain regions (including one live), means numbers going back up.

Us ""opening up"" pointless, cause second wave within months. happened Spanish flu, happen (and already certain places).

You‚Äôre better that, better wishing plague death many people. get frustrated idiots, trust I‚Äôm right you, doesn‚Äôt equate wishing death suffering though.

Ground zero wearing mask remains grocery store. hate math every fiber maybe CDC never said necessary... issue lied supporting movement people murdered cops this. cops kill people protest. ideal protest can't really plan outrage.

Trumps rush cancel Chinese flights, governor led responses national lockdown probably best world. 

There demographically similar country well US - unless count China case lol mean doesn‚Äôt exactly work it? one family gets vehicle class cross contaminate anyway. factoring possible hospital bills? might hard get virology type Data NYC protests/riots - watched riot footage looters high grade N95 masks. riot cops umasked. end may hard say happened nyc regarding why, last weeks. really low risk, particularly since likely wash hands eat anyway. Also, practice, since assume personal fridge limiting diet foods need refrigerated either going require frequent grocery runs limited variety diet, come risks. math pls infected everyone already got There‚Äôs lot social distancing going town (or county matter). week alone new infections deaths 7-day period since pandemic began, that‚Äôs businesses reopening literally everyone they‚Äôve cooped long.

Except initial data swine flu much different one. google old articles early days virus estimate 1% IFR similar one. Obama technocrat American politicians universally favor economy people doubt would've done shutdowns either. commercially available test alpha defensin gives results positive/intermediate/negative (rather measuring specific levels) designed testing joint fluid look periprosthetic joint infections.

Fully agree you. needed rant.

I fully agree you, needed rant lol mask refusers petulant children can't bothered. exactly like disciplining child. Saying there's lack evidence evidence argument. god's sake, there's plenty scientific evidence. economy opening pushers, way create disaster profit it.

Here's stat drives home mean: ""One study released last week Proceedings National Academy Sciences estimated widespread mask-wearing hard-hit New York City three week period April May prevented [66,000 COVID-19 there."" precautions definitely save lives, matter there's idiots following guidelines. thanks link. study apparently look COVID-19. Looks like added COVID-19 caused rise alpha-defensins. sorry ... well, confirm don't. talking done deal. not.  Many younger people infected growing rates, idea average age dead eventually. well could shift down. 

As far death count 10 times higher end year, possible, way people acting, seems likely. would around 320,000. Fully within realm possibility.

I see saying now, makes kind sense. whereas people almost universally wear seat belt driving days, large portion America refuses take simple likely important precaution wearing mask. Idiots. Yes, thought number would way higher ""Harris county exploding"" headlines. union labor snuffed market place getting something lowest price possible motivates many buyers - retail b2b. anyone actually read ‚Äúarticle‚Äù easyreadernews.com Yes, noble cause reduce alcohol abuse underage drinking. racket all.

NYC phase 1 June 8... see memorial day uptick either... Yah honestly fucking sucks. look countries Asia like Vietnam, Korea Taiwan great they‚Äôre handling virus. goes Europe, actually followed stay home orders. 

In America? Oh fucking god. Actually ashamed born here... absolutely agree. US government responsible this. unlike CDC WHO, never trust anything administration says. Arthas: infected grain already distributed. whole city must purged! 25 million Americans tested, many Europeans tested? next week, bring far chance infecting way high, lot cases work, go hospital quite often, possibility infecting lot people.

That's going question many studies evaluations future, guess. Many factors weather conditions could play role, also wether asymptomatic highly mobile person ended 'superspreader' (those super common.) tell country, one small region (that directly borders northern Italy) dramatic surge cases, thing 2 regions directly border France. regions barely affected. #1 affected region see thousands daily visitors northern Italy 15'000 - every single day. Happening place Jacksonville St. Augustine right now. 

It's missing point whole virus vs. economy discussion. Letting virus run control going effects economy. 

Even crazier best solutions like mass adherence mask usage actually works better virus economy. Letting options become polarized huge mistake. I‚Äôve always thought general public zombie pandemic movies couldn‚Äôt *possibly* stupid. But.. Actually, guy arguing correct statement includes somewhat unusual sophisticated (for virus) error checking protein.

The problem coronaviruses general around 30k base pairs size. standard replication error rates, quickly inert viruses. So, successful adaptation getting big, terms genetic size, select error checking.

That's say error checking 100% efficient. not, different variants exist. That's say radically mutated, functionally different meaningful ways.

Influenza smaller, error checking. subject constant antigenic drift meaning vaccines effective next influenza season.

We know antigenic drift properties SARS-CoV-2. based per capita, based testing factors, based similar restrictions.

Everyone drunk fuck, partying like world ending. outside patio complete madness. made call actually close 1230 (an hour half early) nobody would put masks stay away groups. say half patrons good masks getting moving bar night went people started getting drunk went window. 

I‚Äôm saying every restaurant following protocol like would take one visit liquor board last night we‚Äôd lost liquor license 100%. It‚Äôs making job incredibly stressful I‚Äôm kind hoping told close later date, people absolutely careless it. stupid thing unless specially made mask valve, masks source control. wearing protect everyone else. people telling care care you. ""Extremely concern"" idk think fools more. Reminds Trump's response Ronaü§£ actually quite benevolent nomadic leadership standards, agreed pay tax left tf alone never bothered again. think testing increased similar pace well, could one reason apparently slowing growth rate. Hahahahaha nice Clearly depends country. Everyone wears masks live, maybe exception younger hanging outdoors pubs bars. Yeah, sort of- also Jacinda America Trump. I'd say made far difference populace/locale long run. Literally anything would better America handled \*except Brazil\* accurate ? Nasopharyngeal Oropharyngeal Swab? still get mad business lol God damn, that's ignorance whole different level. Idk say. Like hard believe tbh. Well, given ban temporary, seems yet little punishment acting citizens interests. even *all* Western regime propaganda. really **one** particular country stable genius president.

And particular country highest number cases world, still climbing. Funny works out. Australian here- Things pretty fuckin' normal. Couple cases state Victoria worry about, everywhere else pretty much usual aside continued border closure. think still 80/20 rule mostly. expect 80 percent people make effort, 20 percent still going best fuck everything up, do. US probably like 60/40. isnt happening Dallas know  really get you? ~~Honest reporting~~ __Undertesting underreporting__ respiratory virus, attacks endothelium lines blood vessels. happens lot blood vessels lungs. ICU's looking hot Texas that.

&amp;#x200B;

But keep mind, Covid records. easy break. nothing set records day long. I'd interested/concerned personal bests regarding ICU attendance general. We've lot less people admitting hospitals overall CA (because non-essential operations suspended, also lot people would rather silently suffer moment) I've never seen empty overall. HAVEN‚ÄôT flattened curve. Whattttt way US everything stop Fully agree him. R 1 plenty citizens infected start outbreak, travellers wont change much.

If R &lt; 1, infected traveller won‚Äòt able cause outbreak anyway point quarantining them.

This whole thing purely illogical driven politics countries aren‚Äòt named New Zealand, etc. Yeah, pharma literally convince people first want make money selling vaccine. guess everyone educated time.

So China less patients test vaccine, outset, looks promising.

Lets hope offer test vaccine countries like Brazil, literally battleground poverty already killing poor people. Numbers Germany good all, rt 2.8 growing CDC absolutely reckless telling people masks ineffective fact clearly are. Oh, MAGICALLY effective healthcare workers??? Someone PLEASE enlighten this.

N95 masks filter viruses air breathe in. prevent getting infected. sparse therefore reserved healthcare workers.

Regular cloth masks filters prevent lot droplets getting air forming aerosoles. already infected, masks help protecting people around you. 

And since infected people highly contagious one two days even showing symptoms (and sometimes show symptoms all), best pretend infected wear one masks precaution.

If everyone this, everyone protects everyone.  Cmon now, USA want brazil surpass them! Trump's watch! 200k soon! Beat brazilüòé Okay true probably stop lockdown since social distancing doesn‚Äôt seem much effect. Would agree that?  Jesus Christ. afford fly afford $.50 mask. Putting mask small step compared everything else preparation getting plane.

Or airlines airports handing out? Add cost plane ticket, one else notice. want second wave kill businesses good? exactly happy right ALL? Massive death disease around world, constant fear death dire suffering, death/fear death loved ones, isolation, job loss, economic loss, derailment future plans, inability anything comforting before, lack exercise, extreme inconvenience, end sight anything...

Seriously, could find reason happy now?? can‚Äôt people make choices? post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

You deserve better. Ah Madison bear garden. Classy. Riley‚Äôs packed last weeks ago too. pessimistic, video person rally Saturday said friend die COVID, friend's son ventilator, STILL thought media bias wear mask.

What seem different England infections (known) around 1,200 day, would explain declining hospitalisations loss life, whereas United States infections seem levels worst periods.

I'd guess place New York, going spread like wildfire get vulnerable ease; whereas rural less populated areas rising numbers infections necessarily translate damage seen places New York, given risk come contact anywhere near amount people. truly understand people okay schr√∂dinger politics like conservative americans perform. 

On week ""big goverment awesome, say"" next week ""screw goverment, want"".

Or something. illinois here. live close wisconsin border n people dont give fuck here. several packed bars, masks gloves distancing. sheriffs dept already said theyre even gonna anything either. you‚Äôre intelligent trust trump administration covered beginning (knew January 3rd), us STILL covering up...? think not. Ohio law store employees required wear masks patrons strongly suggested. corporate big box stores (Walmart, Kroger, Lowe‚Äôs) 50% wear masks face (as opposed chinstrap) less 10% patrons wear masks. smaller stores gas stations NOBODY wearing mask, except me. get eye rolls, sighs, forced coughs everyone.

Individual freedom include freedom spread disease. days long gone Summer 2021. 


Potential roadblocks finding way create inoculate nearly eight billion people worldwide.  Then, Americans recently polled staggering 33% would *refuse* receive COVID vaccine all. :/ I'll believe shit turns purple smells like rainbow sherbet makes sense blame reopening given fact places spiking right places reopened first, major cities saw protesting.  


Anyways, like blindly guessing. pay attention centers infection are, coming people attended protests. make store, allowed check out. Employees refuse ring accept money items assholes grab - I'm assuming they'd mad they'd end stealing could least get cops involved. Yeah, none reason halt poultry imports Tyson. make Beijing outbreak less serious. risk Tyson less previous imports meat plants suffered COVID outbreaks.

To clear, I'm saying bad Chinese people probably overreacting Chinese government perform actions purely reassure people without meaningfully decreasing risk. I'm trying explain think logic behind actions are. even US poor people access plastic.

there large segment population cannot get bank accounts. various businesses large cities tried going cashless cities shut disenfranchises poor. plague, people would scared taking seriously. 

Look Americans protested one case black death. Death count heavily dependent consider death covid, Italy chose striclty count deaths exclusion, many EU countries listing death covid helped previous serious health issue, sense non pandemic-situation (IMHO). 

Don't know what's happening USA seeing number incections probably latter. likely slowly drowning renal failure, probably worst ways go.

There's small chance get lucky get bad stroke brought clots disease. course, there's good chance stroke *that* bad can't swallow die starvation. also sucks. Upper middle-class teenagers selfishly acting privileged entitled. That's suprise. Ah, got ya. Always pleasure get insight MD here. No, that's lie tell every time. keep telling people keep falling it. Amazing It‚Äôs ending. Brazil also said heavily underreported deaths, understand.  Minnesota spike. first protests almost month ago. Cases deaths trending even testing. sound Trump he/she ignore facts L.M.A.O. Lol can't reason prejudice. logic based belief system. like STD testing cant test positive get tested. 


ignorance bliss, seriousness, USA never controlled it, contact tracing etc. Trump spoken Fauci 4 weeks (Faucie reported) Taiwan's Digital Minister, Audrey Tang, specifically said use contact tracing apps developed Google Apple. Majority people need download tracing apps effective. voluntary. chances people it. 

Cell phone location data data phone companies already have. least one article reported Taiwan's model stated approach may work European countries privacy concerns. Tang said cell tower triangulation pinpoint block person's in. GPS pinpoint exact room. less intrusion. viable response patterns we've seen reaction outbreak? mean no? average 5 days. 2 weeks longest. know I'm guy talk response mention anything said ""me.""

My opinions follow research instead reasearch following opinions.

From data collected Google's Coronavirus numbers (which said reputable) EU actually closer 1.1M infections 131k deaths quite different numbers presented. also know got US numbers from, Google's coronavirus numbers say amount infected 2.32M deaths 122K. population US also seems wrong, numbers ive seen hover around 330M mark rather 370M mark.

This leaves deaths per 100,000 US 37.2

in EU would 29.6

The USA almost deaths per 100,000 quite bit.

Even USA better 8 european countries, that's 8/27, really something prooud of.

The problem comment data wrong. USA's populations big would closer right, data wrong.

If give sources information maybe could understand coming from? right can't see got information. took consideration wear mask. Easy task. Apparently hard task Americans.. Nova Scotia, big ass island Canada population 1 million. hispanic, racist himself. idiot! there's difference zero transmission due protests lack spike due protesting. get national lockdown technically never true lockdown whole time.

What going experience future adjusted life ""rolling lockdowns"" done fly. couple states list, couple missing...like Arkansas Alabama. Reading Australia, 1800 cases day mind boggling, even 74. There‚Äôs small resurgence Victoria due international arrivals quarantine somehow infecting security guards flipping 18 cases day Could people wearing masks getting huge viral load infected? need think, understood made sense. could said non-Sundays whatever New cases won‚Äôt younger people. We're 120,000 confirmed.  


We capacity figure high actual number is.  


at minimum 120,000 killed year. That's fucking terrible. media focus many things potentially harm/kill us. make correct judgement new virus high risk factor? 

you continue waste time focusing virus. True true gist don‚Äôt really know who‚Äôs behind numbers _may_ _absolutely_ accurate? I‚Äòm shocked! I‚Äôm also sad media outlets don‚Äôt get sweet, sweet traffic. kids might fine let's forget permanent internal bodily damage increased risk stroke. think Gottleib predicted past weekend, we'd start see exponential growth.

So, guess track saying.

Yikes, indeed. many people need die realize need take precautions? 120,000 enough convince you? allow Swedes properties Finland

For non-Nordic audience, significant number people. Sweden something like 140 000 people born Finland, many family property, position inherit property, Finland. 60s 70s, significant migration Finns Sweden much better job opportunities. people retirees, suffered directly coronavirus situation. lot second-generation used spending part summer vacation Finland, visiting family. north, including Tornedalen area, uncommon people cottage Finnish Lapland, even family ties Finland. trusted government point? remember young lol Honestly, people wearing masks make huge difference making sure staters don‚Äôt cause huge spread. Sure, entire population Arizona flew Boston we‚Äôd fucked, odd mouth breather visiting isn‚Äôt going cause noticeable change. 


As long week keep wearing masks is. 3 day dip tests reported rioting labs closed due many area riots going on. promptly opened reported extra ~6000 cases make lost time. week set best tests recorded week resetting best every week since. related. Increased testing *increase* cases also *decreasing* positivity rate. still enough testing. way show grown up... understand term ""Best Case""? also saying without quarantine would seen 2 million deaths, complete bullshit. listened president's advice slow testing spikes cases... Reminds ""Mask Red Death"" Poe. second wave, USA never got control it, contract tracing nothing.. letting slowly spread without check re-opening businesses. Bought bottle Jack Daniels liquor store sale $22.  make knows many decently mixed drinks it. go bar days? went bar boston first time Thursday... sat outside table isolated tables, honestly feel safe all. None servers wearing masks properly, people getting close walking to/from bathroom, two tables next us full horny 20-somethings abandoned social distancing entirely merged big group flirt other.

Between $50 bill 2 drinks food think I'm probably going bars foreseeable future. ton money experience fun pre-COVID feel safe yet. offices open. /r/nyc post company's opening offices continue work home. offices remain closed September later 

the company work plans us go back office. office, various approvals need done beforehand leaves Alberta B.C. two provinces abnormal significant number deaths cannot explained, leaving open possibility represent undetected COVID-19 B.C., StatCan found number deaths March 15 April 25 372 higher previous five years, although 99 deaths attributed COVID-19 discrepancy even larger Alberta, 40 deaths linked COVID-19 found Feb. 23 April 11 total 402 excess deaths disparities necessarily mean either province experienced hundreds deaths connected COVID-19 without realizing it, StatCan said, factors contribute excess deaths.

Purely poor leadership. Spoiled brats. em. wearing mask? Yea memorial day re-openings going bleed protest data. area jumping cases every day since then, reason intuit might indoor areas venues shut employees testing positive second wave, wave lingering virus mutated there. +17 cases 24hrs wave Killing restaurant's bar's liquor license serious. They're gonna even worse close entire staff gets infected far, many big spikes BLM stuff. However, seen massive spikes

It helps order contact tracers link new cases BLM protests. pay it. Also, look capital flight. knowledge subject. Go r/latestagecapitalism Well, course will... rocket appliances. would know might kill someone else, accident?

The word MIGHT type emotional trick people try guilt people something due social pressure. MIGHT lot things. 

Hell, MIGHT run someone today suffering heart attack, save life know CPR. 

You make guess, would say very, low risk, around 0.001-0.01% range possibility. numbers, willing take risk.

I know trillions microbes inside body every moment, lethal pathogen organism gets close. mean go outside?

The fact say MIGHT kill someone type argument make anything. 

The fact choose bring car driveway every day drive 5 miles limit freeway makes giant risk drivers street (at much higher risk killing people carrier virus, probably, real numbers). maybe dozens risky behavior, like every human walking around.

Should live life like pious Jains go around sweeping ground step bugs? No. something originally said, walked back. outside agitators thing actually long storied issue civil unrest. power claim protests, strikes, come outside agitators that, really, everyone happy outsiders arrived.

&amp;#x200B;

Otherwise, admit actually problems people live. Ah yes texas, state there‚Äôs laws children using guns promise others also did. Welcome wet county! Population: Agreed. see data, [testing trend finally going right There's also quite lot *talk* contact tracing lately, much less evidence actually happening and/or concrete preparations made happen. 

Fingers crossed though since pretty much everyone charge least paying lip service idea recently. second wave, wave still lingering Yes, many also pride staked apocalyptic predictions they've throwing months. ask type work? type employees work equipment located worksite? #1 response everyone work home. Yeah whats really sad itll unknowingly family killing one another. Nice contradict guidelines, fact remember Trump [hashing governor Georgia following them. also supposed say virus control help rejuvenate stock market economy. Would prefer making people even less confident? show actively recommended masks instead neutral/apathetic towards them.

The blame deserves spread around here. USA averages 500 day December almost 250,000 dead year. 

they still +33,000 new infections day hit number, especially forced back indoors winter months idiot ex bf hag fiancee moved Texas. They're type people think they're healthy enough wear masks. can't wait see happens. Using data COVID Tracking Project, outlet confirmed Florida, Texas, Arizona, Utah, South Carolina, Nevada, Georgia, Missouri, Montana, California, Tennessee, Oklahoma showed rising cases results came ABC analysis also found hospitalizations severe coronavirus cases rising 17 states, namely Alaska, Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi, Montana, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas Utah. Deaths follow weeks case spikes. lot case spikes right now, sadly stay low. air gets sucked towards filters, means particles wafting around get processed. Honest question....when expect deaths start trending upward again? cases clearly started climbing look rolling average deaths continue lower scale. much lag two?

Also, say deaths continue trend cases trend up? testing? Younger healthier people getting it? Starting figure best treatments?

I'm interested see death numbers start soon. Number cases mean much predict possible rise deaths upcoming weeks. Rich beach probably little different Yo government declassified UFO videos April think? ya go. Picture thousands people touching various objects display sale hundreds different vendors. Fingers sliding countless comics boxes hunting something buy moving on. Special speaking events hundreds pack dense lines hear celebrities speak panels. Everyone sitting breathing other.

You pay go something like that. Exponential math crazy stuff. time notice trend weeks behind able adjust outcome Remember, thing stating half US states reporting fall new coronavirus cases, reopening testing more. That's good.

But nobody talk Malaysia zero death yesterday death ratio still stuck 121 since pandemic happened Can't second wave first wave never ended! Maybe people decide COVID risk worth taking? OIf like odds catching not, stay home. nuts want go crowded bar, go right ahead. know you‚Äôre downvoted ""With younger age recent infections least places Florida, expect lower death rate wave ... 20-40 year olds infected today go infect others,"" Frieden, president CEO initiative Resolve Save Lives, tweeted Sunday. 

Misleading title. Full quote context important. Uh, we're talking using public transit making babies. I'm security officer working facility researching vaccine. people pretty friendly. agree less article. basic explanation even resources governments putting towards know much disease. 

For vaccines might decades even centuries worth information available still took years develop vaccines them. unfortunately matter hard work may possible years. say impossible get vaccine within 18 months neither likely realistic. one felt accomplished yeah, care since knew like. got degree, need picture getting it. I'll still go parties afterwards. yeah Florida doesnt know count though... fact... also stupid thought getting virus opening everything prematurely would concerning normal mortality exceeded...its not. US 3-5k pneumonia deaths week, quite said wasn‚Äôt party afterwards? Yeah ones imagined. make sense offices need today‚Äôs workspace IMO requiring nursing homes take ppl already diagnosed it? See right I‚Äôm talking about. America Ivy League schools. global scale, hefty majority large public universities United States incredibly good much afford Harvard Yale education. education likely equal quality manner cases, connections get Ivy League institution sets apart.


American poverty interesting topic. poverty line different effects depending person. area rampant poverty. many people, don‚Äôt mind it. It‚Äôs obviously still bad thing, wear badge honor. Proud live trailer chew tobacco. poverty line, extremely low cost living makes still nice things live life claim enjoy.


I 100% support various measures would make America better everyone. higher minimum wage, investment education transportation systems, universal healthcare sound incredible me. I‚Äôm asking Reddit label problems correctly. issue access, actual education/healthcare/etc. right, that's makes crazy people wear mask practice social distancing. Following scientific guidelines allows people go back work somewhat safely. someone refuses simple thing, they're showing ""free"" are. They're showing little care people's health livelihood. flyover states top 10 worst affected states per capita. California, Texas, Florida, Carolinas Arizona it‚Äôs currently exploding. You‚Äôre crazy act like it‚Äôs ‚Äúflyover states‚Äù ones handling poorly. entire country been. biggest point contention also one controversial points among armchair Reddit experts (because apparently important). 

A lot people think one study peer reviewed conclusive evidence treatment works across board additional research necessary.

Novel viruses always comes degree human experimentation we're territory that's making lot health care providers uncomfortable eager are. People take another shut needed. one shot get right epically fucked up. I‚Äôm hospital architect worked bed towers - typically plan 1 ICU bed every 3-5 general. varies based upon hospital‚Äôs specialties.

People dropping product like flies put leave. glad faced backlash. Half nursing home deaths social distancing hygiene wasn‚Äôt implemented properly skilled nursing homes states like NY CA NJ can't, maximum capacity reduced seating supposed spread well apart.

‚ÄúOn CT scans, normal lungs appear black, Covid-19 patients‚Äô lungs frequently lighter gray patches, called ‚Äúground-glass opacities‚Äù ‚Äî may heal.

One study China found ground-glass appearance showed scans 77 percent Covid-19 patients. another study China, published Radiology, 66 70 hospitalized patients amount lung damage CT scans, half kind lesions likely develop scars. (A third study China suggests critically ill patients; authors found 58 asymptomatic patients, 95 percent also evidence ground-glass opacities lungs. quarter individuals went develop symptoms within days.)

‚ÄúThese kinds tissue changes cause permanent damage,‚Äù says Ali Gholamrezanezhad, radiologist Keck School Medicine University Southern quote:

On side note, chose stay NY little year ago, politics played big part decision (as family). Seemed silly time didn‚Äôt take long see really make difference. sister NC wishing here. agree imply, CDC compromised GOP.  I‚Äôd rather see CA take care itself.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-

It looks like Trump determines COVID-19 information released CDC.

- CDC new policy specifically communications related COVID-19. don‚Äôt know policy though it‚Äôs redacted.

- policy restrictive possibly unconstitutional. appears CDC employees constrained expressing personal views.

- don‚Äôt know extent control administration exerting CDC involvement Office Vice President allows claims executive privilege.

- don‚Äôt know whether CDC scientists prevented speaking journalists ""whether particular media outlets given priority‚Äîalthough know internal email CDC, ‚Äúas rule,‚Äù supposed reject inquiries Greta Van Susteren Voice America."" 

Given that, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs much suggest CDC scientists prohibited speaking media unless Trump approves content would wish interfere process natural selection? Honestly surprised Texas rules all. Good someone state enforcing them. think so? slightly selfishly pleased friends thought overreacting may get clue. Sure, agree lots people overweight America, call entire country slobs isn‚Äôt correct. live Ohio maybe don‚Äôt get enough, generally don‚Äôt see many people described as. organized crime enough population control Qatar repressive dictatorship living slave labor paid petro dollars, funding lot terror going around Mid-East. masks laws, gotta give that. Same. seen anyone wearing mask store I've around Pittsburgh. least area (Bellevue/North Hills) People neighborhood wearing masks that‚Äôs great, they‚Äôre discarded sidewalks lawns parking lot. Like... you‚Äôre missing point. mask protect germs, germs. Leaving mask wherever lands awful environment society.

The US full ignorant morons, Professor Farnsworth right... want leave planet Yeah, Italians followed social distancing regulations. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anti-science, think it‚Äôs simply American Culture engrained highly individualistic. Worry others. Protect others. record number new infections mean. Many go undetected impossible know Oh man actually hard stay home. sucks. hard. obviously early grown men women getting kicked grocery stores, airplanes, etc daily complying. dare call protesters stupid least restaurants follow social distancing. curious. think parents send kids daycare, assuming comfortable risk? alternative would give them? addition Italian warning, world's seen happening China since January FFS. got real bad North America mid-March. That's minimum 2 months advance notice. Ah yes, use black people selfish agenda. see learned nothing, could atleast pretended give fuck. Maybe wore masks tried responsible. Masks mandatory city city, county county basis, state mandate. don‚Äôt care us. Numbers lie. 1) New York 387,936 cases around 1 50 people. Arizona Texas 52,390 1 137 people 111,601 1 554 people, respectively.

2) Flattening curve prevention disease. delaying time frame spread. gotten remain vulnerable long around, years.

3) everyone must exposed virus, ultimately hard avoid long term. Again, populations exposed remain vulnerable long virus around.

The upshot thing done. quite time. one victory laps yet well policy worked years road know really disastrous less so. really. We‚Äôre still alive chugging along side US. I've seen two theories.

One higher case count due testing. We're detecting mild cases noticed previously.

The young people getting infected. They're far less likely hospitalized. Oh, want wall around Mexico to. save New Mexico, Texas, Arizona.

my whole thing vaccine, never done before. think stipualtion situation, try rush conclusions. like people cautious vaccine decrease effectiveness vaccine public, spreading hype speculation cause general public careless feel like sure thing ""cure"", causing increase infections prior vaccine approved.(yes, yes know, stances speculative). 

i'm saying want right, jesus christ want people sure decisions make, skeptical, fall things basing decisions hope only.

Upset president‚Äôs response Covid ones sucking other‚Äôs hot air protests. I‚Äôm solidly camp confirmed case numbers increasing mostly testing done, recent bump cases due protest activities.

Say yeah, Cuomo sides fence. also told reporter asking question woman waiting think two months get unemployment children say mentioned she‚Äôll get every penny coming tell get essential job needs money now. Well everyone lost jobs applying essential jobs guess may hire one two people hundreds thousands people looking. places like fast food grocery stores always say they‚Äôre hiring even they‚Äôre not. Cuomo finally locked good, he‚Äôs opening back hasn‚Äôt locked regions cases doubling tripling think it‚Äôs state money may shut back Albany NYC start running rampant Covid-19 again. We‚Äôll wait see. Phase 2 NYC opening soon. protestors wearing masks, others aren't. depends place. protestors testing positive COVID.   take couple months week, realized could quickly make burger 1/2 lbs patty versus withered little 1.5 oz pattie bunch useless bun condiment, fries cooked bad oil.

I'm thinking eating general suffer sustained decline, modicum skill preparation healthier, cheaper, faster cook home, virtually everyone forced achieve modicum. university work taking pretty seriously - in-person classes fall (mainly classes can't done online, like labs music performance such), everyone encouraged teach online possible. Dorm rooms single occupancy only, they're shutting buffet-style dining, everyone required wear mask public areas. (And students wear class, they'll told leave.) 

They're also limiting amount staff campus telling people work home can. I've working home since March, personally idea I'll actually working campus - next year earliest I've heard.

It's perfect solution, better schools I've seen, they're ""yeah, we're gonna back campus person fall!"" get it. Masks mandatory enforced live seem enforcement nose it. kick habit pandemic, easy hiding corona! Congrats keep up!

I'm going 100 days home, anywhere car house. ton us taking responsibly, seriously banging heads wall every time see news... Ok, makes sense. Sorry misunderstanding coming bit strong. Countries Asian ones already widely adopted masks. wish reporter would ask number new cases percent positive would warrant concern reverse opening?

Seriously though, never thought ice-cream contaminated. US strict all, even supposedly strict states. countries succeeded perfectly well containing virus. US particularly inept controlling it.

Really, US actually much less susceptible sort virus due way build cities. people live low density suburban neighborhoods. people commute alone private vehicles, rather taking public transportation. US's sprawling cities low use mass transit produces negative health effects, one areas US's urban development patterns provide great public health benefit. 

Yet, lead world infections. Truly combination cultural factors governmental incompetence. Yup, wait another 2-3 weeks. Yeah, countries following path spikey toy? seem gleeful? God sub full weirdos Oh got remind two weeks Sydney warns forest fires, listen.

NYC bothering, though, chance keeping numbers low, even local neighborhoods northeast NJ good job. hilarious. Especially considering arrogant ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen tremendous response‚Äù leading rally. Home boy got trolled hard honestly love everything well deciding stay safe pandemic That‚Äôs bullshit. know we‚Äôre European, (as generally, talking myself) don‚Äôt identify much it. Well, defense, couple viruses eradicate first did, pretty much every politician is. Wisconsin myth consider going weddings grad parties *HUGE* win. ‚ÄúAmericans‚Äù every person U.S. immediately considered selfish idiotic? Barr would fire prosecutors judges both. probably overreacting. overreacting probably right thing do. better keep 1.4 billion population safe. Every local lockdown costs meat plant drink uk worst per capita mortality ratio.

Obviously countries like China Brazil numbers absolute fairy tale land, among countries actually try track UK among worst. # Darwinism Progressive taxation fund - even people who's kids can't afford kind care parents own.  also big crazy nationalist 'they trying get us' narrative China this. far mostly see posts warning people buying / eating certain foods. look US, fucking madness

It's madness. philosophy.

Your country's philosophy revolves around idea human lives valuable, protected wealth.

Our country's philosophy revolves around idea human lives valueless, sacrificed would produce short-term acquisition wealth.

That's refuse universal healthcare. benefit saving lives meaningless us, profit restricting healthcare matters. That's care casualties, matter. That's going go back work, every second owners lose short-term profit, lives lost factor equation.

We workers protection, financial human rights, money talks money votes, screams louder voice. president elected people, elected financial donors, money sworn serve.

Maybe one day crash burn, yet. Right now, americans well trained begging go die profit rich further. mindset loses, going get worse. Good, they've gone lot. gains income can't taxed.
Not sure mean that. Capital gains taxed, lower rate certain exceptions encourage longer term holding. think unless past retirement age, allowed claim capital gains salary regular salary amount. would prevent CEOs claiming salary stock prioritizing short term stock value long term profitability. Idaho, Rhode Island Mississippi didn‚Äôt report. interviews ones camping definitely state travelers event...and said shit ants bring back home communities cause think it‚Äôs hoax. 

If could take guess OK natives, absolutely least traveled across state lines part rally. Mask use reduced transmission 75%. It‚Äôs significant. Hey, reliable stream income many days. Another lockdown? aren‚Äôt happening think would successful. hasn‚Äôt worked CA thus far. pandemic #1 reason unhappy.  I've unhappy past 3.5 years. definitely lowered curve significantly here. numbers way way better now. took seriously. cases confirmed. Imagine many cases mild produced symptoms severe enough even consider coronavirus. That's true all, think missed point video. Like video pointed EU also really bad situation weeks ago 30,000 new cases day. Europe also made lot mistakes like reacting fast enough news China.

The difference though happened this. number new cases deaths per day went drastically EU, can't said US. 

I think point video USA enough contain coronavirus comparison EU done show possible get numbers Asian countries different culture island nations, also countries culture relative similar US also island nations. face uncertainty protective masks face coverings are, better way risk wrong:

1) Tell people wear them, later shown point.

2) Tell people wear them, later find caused unnecessary death suffering allowed pandemic grow beyond chance containment.

Any public health official chose 2) deserves criminal negligence proceedings. thing give Cuomo credit least admitted didn‚Äôt handle things perfectly. leaders still refuse acknowledge response less stellar. M-F work week I've grocery store every then, I've staying inside. city pretending virus longer exists. 99 percent people city wear masks, claim hoax. many scientists, U.S. especially, split hairs forgotten reasonable assumptions people dying tens thousands.

Not know, could inferred reasonable assumption likely turn verifiable means transmission, knew MONTHS AGO, bases several contact traced outbreaks person two brain cells rub together could tell airborne. Way use another's plight miss little celebration could held videocamera letter. Disgusting multiple levels. Funny exponential growth works. find interesting US, every Sunday total daily deaths significantly lower general trend deaths week. Monday always far worse day comparison. think is? country solved gun violence? countries passed strict gun control seen decline cases increases gun crime post gun control. 

Just gun crime rate always lower doesnt mean solved anything. insights advice going back martial arts schools train especially indoor? Maryland allowed that, feel like I'm bit dark Jeet Kune school; comfortable clinching, grappling, getting close people yet especially closed indoor environment.

Since Trump business man people actually loved ran president decided give chance. it‚Äôs like, seriously loosing mind. mean he‚Äôs 70‚Äôs sleeps maybe four hours night taking crap pills top try prevent catching Covid. medication give way issues? test less less cases deaths. Wow, really! forget news stations exist won‚Äôt listen stupidity anymore. Someone house needs say wake up! Play back recordings, seriously hear yourself? You‚Äôre loosing voters. agree infrastructure. need new roads, bridges etc. opinion pandemic need protest congress doesn‚Äôt get paid unless work together pass bills. Test positivity rate. one things often shortened scientific literature. Dude lived NY life live NYC right now. bullshit you. know NYers like live here. someone food industry, watch closely favorite restaurants reacting restrictions- direct reflection run kitchen sanitary food really regardless pandemic. think getting away something place eating probably ingesting nasty stuff. Hmm? First off, even know trying argue arguing sake arguing? I'm arguing age. I'm calling kid extremely worked nothing. fact said ""They import karens"" clearly joke indicating Karens flock Hawaii act Karen-y towards locals. There's ton videos those.

Only idiots, disease spreading Southern hemisphere fast voices suggesting might true back then.

Really? Pretty well every expert read time said America lockdown would catastrophe. America lock down; comes catastrophe. Yeah, pretty much. There's nothing weird it. long incubation period.  thought always common knowledge it‚Äôs better quiet lie...

But guess people prefer listening lies like herd immunity/it‚Äôs like flu/go fun/mask doesn‚Äôt shit... Well shit - fucking bread circuses! understand wearing one? dissing - nice nAmerican find perplexing. Yes mean - understand rampant community spread right? Yes. That's one case. That's ""anecdote"" means. Lung scaring one first things doctors started warm people about. Isn‚Äôt kind ironic considering current state gun rights largely protected? new big pandemics. Here's nice article: ""lockdown"" new word. older term ""curfew"". People give shit left USA move El Salvador, ""shithole"", tell me. place 3 even 4 generations together worth amount GDP. Hey, dont kink shame me! insensitive others it. 

And, apparently, showing racially insensitive do. you‚Äôd rather close down, fire employees, everyone financially struggle? agree. time issue prominent society results consciousness raising social change. Oh know why.

Distraction. country planet decided it‚Äôs that‚Äôs it, we‚Äôre going pay it. amount selfishness surreal. me, would already looking new doctor. Doctors hate point laugh them. arent like Yanks, many countries already started reopening works fine. Sunday Covid takes break apparently. Half countries listed positive cases testing enough people cannot procure kits, reagent, PPE fast enough.

Exhibit A: South Africa. backlog 100k tests, growing. Two provinces seeing surges hospitals starting fill up. adequately prepared.  Blowing smoke face like haha born nice cold lab it‚Äôs adapted environment perfectly reports say non-Beijing cases tied Beijing ones. 

I idea people choose compare do, particularly care why. heard surgical masks still effective cloth masks protecting one wearing mask putting tape around mask create seal (and potentially prevent droplets getting in) help. yeah, N95s (and KN95s, brands filter properly) provide protection. Wearing face shield mask also help protect better. guys done two week shutdown across country would shut down.

Now have, nobody accept lock down, fighting masks thousands people dying daily. getting stopping thing every day. Really interesting contrasts narrative ‚Äúredneck‚Äù clutching gun. suspect ask people there, would shocked see article it‚Äôs probably far reality. Local news tends look whatever think sensationalized hit day long isn‚Äôt damaged party sue, aren‚Äôt accountable. 

 guess started genuine protest decent number teenagers nothing else desire finally leave house cited treat excuse gathering. doesn‚Äôt mean deliberate deception circumvent local restrictions, would expect local news spin way. countries either worse and/or lying numbers, according USA. Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool cool we'll keep denying it. Got it, got it, got it. Thanks. Majority East already reopened weeks ago, like Austria, Germany, Hungary, Croatia, Slovenia.  work criminal justice. clients fresh jail people probation. think ""criminals"" would disrespectful average retail customer no, problem entire month opened back people following required mask rules. mask, nicely ask go outside, fuss.

I find absolutely ridiculous clientele, supposed ""bad people"" (I consider way) respectful follow simple rules better general population fucking grocery store.

Ffs shit makes mad. stories always heavy anecdote light scientific research. I'd really like see something substantial issue. 


It's respiratory virus. unusual lot patients would feel like crap month two recovery. second wave methinks. first wave stealthy one went around Q3 2019. Vaping deaths, mysterious pneumonia cases, etc. it. Good articulation issue US today. government also encouraged protests despite higher level risks contracting/spreading Covid? Interesting, right? Couldn‚Äôt imagine people confused. http://brrr.money Recently personally forgot mine beach shorts. Thankfully managed see floating right next went ocean. surprisingly easy forget pocket since light ocupy much space beach shorts pocket... I‚Äôd rather drink, dance, fun friends family  Oh - poor migrant workers Qatar ones feel consequences this. Understand hundreds thousands migrant workers (around 55% population live labor camps) excluded economic stats, live garbage conditions. lockdown measure Qatar's way keeping poor people, live tiny room stacked bunk beds, going outside infecting middle / upper class. 

As ""containment"" solutions, fuck poor protecting ruling class. I'm sure many new prison enrollees poor people forced leave home food. hear much this, Qatar likes abuse fuck people also pretending exist.

Once again, sub showing completely lack awareness poor around world (including America) thinks Covid19 problem people face. demonstrate (Amsterdam) reason - also feeling demos foreign countries effect US.

But see upswing that, apparently surge amongst protestors US either. imagine much profit get sued ground gambling people's lives. I'm geek con... normally. chance though.

Maybe everyone Cosplay something mask :) Optimistic imo. Trump rally, BLM... add Yes, offensive disrespectful died health workers worked hard. Yeah don‚Äôt want hear deaths trending either Someone needs tell guys Lucky way NFL plays covid looked like flu within league. Also, fwiw, player positive would probably pulled 2 weeks, 2 games NFL, vs MLB NBA player missing 2-3 weeks would 10-20 games.

I support normalizing covid 'flu', fear that's things going trend Americans 'normal' lives. agree that. shouldn‚Äôt dismiss islands easier definition US like tsunami entering 2nd crest following trough initial hit.

It's like saying ""hey tsunami over. Let's go back normal!"" still 20 feet water. press. want keep selling papers/clicks, they'll report every clickbaity angle whether likely not. believe Oxford. works - that's big - timeline probably far off. vaccine manufacturers done production thing before. know what's possible.  Actually, wearing cloth masks doesn‚Äôt make sense don‚Äôt accept fundamental principles:

* virus contained way

* virus widespread (we don‚Äôt know much since operating dark without data/modeling)

* carriers spread virus without symptoms 

* current levels testing adequate identify carriers 

 person accept points, universal mask requirements don‚Äôt make sense. cloth facial covering pretty much reverse isolation protocol - little wearer wearer asymptomatic carrier, protect others. 

If means identify carriers make reasonable assumptions prevalence, could far less universal mask requirements. However, today done universal antibody testing random samples, random sample PCR tests, went testing all, testing severely symptomatic patients, testing ‚Äúblitzes‚Äù people self-selected. point using tests random samples subjects gather precious epidemiological information track prevalence. 

Right I‚Äôm seeing 7-10 delays test result, point person could easily become infected. really, person reasonable means sure infected given time. However, due terrible lack public information clear education topic, people still don‚Äôt realize reverse isolation nature cloth mask concept asymptomatic spread. you‚Äôre unaware points, people tend assume mask way protect correctly identify cloth won‚Äôt filter virus, since don‚Äôt feel sick don‚Äôt feel need wear mask. trigger? want people decide randomly. BLM protests going 3+ years, America seen kind brutality lens situation before.


Funny ignored support protests. Either way cats bag. Protests majority support reopening movements ongoing. want live hermit life advocate it; go ahead. got fired job ‚Äúperformance‚Äù EXACTLY kind situation. Still get unemployment firing real reason. today 1/2 people weren‚Äôt wearing masks upstate NY. drives insane. article (from Fox course) describes experience exactly one guy. even sure got says also works Amazon may contracted there.

Cherry picking examples like common strategy politically motivated journalism. always rely Fox tell one story supports right-wing narrative, even hundreds show false.

The real data showing cases traced protest many cases found reopening rural areas linked church also culture. plain see rapidly eroding social safety net, society lost sense collective responsibility. We, people, would rather buy weapons arm boogiemen house, feed care health fellow citizens. would people like care experience minor discomfort sake protecting others? 

Mutual trust also important value cultures strong response. trust trust leadership institutions. culture mistrust, would people like trust word experts follow advice. 

I think younger generations feeling results mindset realizing kind culture results winners mostly losers. hope moving toward sea change culture whole, even going bumpy ride lot casualties. sorry. idea depth human stupidity till twice age. happy extra ten years illusions. :-/ need stay fuck inside well.  quit job since part job going peoples houses. quit early hope things would died enough return work. Unfortunately savings basically gone things starting pick back state. I'm going make tough decision soon, either continue go debt keep family safe go back work risk getting mom sick. COPD health issues. go back work wont able interact daughters mom safe. I'm sure do. talking lack safety net people making money unemployment breath? universal healthcare paid government.

I'd say that's act things impact health.

Sure, know works, pay it, government save bucks there, waste/steal way.

Luckily seem shortsighted think long term savings ~10% dying. Sometimes selfish focus-on-the-next-election pays off. vaccine ready knowing vaccine safe two totally different things.

We're talking vaccines coronavirus never done pushed ~1 year never done before. Many using new techniques used widespread vaccination before.

I exactly plan one first line get vaccination available.  Airline companies cooperate raise prices carry luggage. able cooperate cross-company mask policy say America PTO yet [76% Also, even including sleep, you‚Äôd need work around 80 hours week time off. notion people can‚Äôt get time flat false. Otherwise moment lockdowns started March people would‚Äôve protesting. Well, media China already scared entire population Beijing back homes little 200 cases pretty much devastated domestic seafood industry. Im brit, worst country side pond. Comparing countries countries isnt accurate, case country ecomonic union.

I absolutely detest trump, everything stands kinda agree approach covid, fight it, coronavirus spread everyone sooner later, best control spread let go community rather avoid tgd spread extreme quarantine. inevitable usa would high fatalities it. Usa big country regions beginning stages it. Expect around 300k deaths done. me, basically end ""life know it"" goodbye best friends, launched different directions unknown college. big deal time lots hugs tears.

California large populous ... cops aren‚Äôt even wearing masks right expect people follow rules Google ""mask ear saver"", people 3D printing plastic straps wear behind head gender-neutral.  Yeah friend told pneumonia felt like gonna die, feeling Corona. would say main factor would majority spread occurred communities action taken. lock met compliance part. new hot spots fairly resistant preventative measures. impossible take Russian numbers seriously ... steeped Russian misinformation US. might say ""but government can't...""

they can. That's entire point declaring national emergency. allows federal government overreach normal power within reason. think sorts things rationed WWII? Especially as, unlike office jobs, eating work area avoid common spots much option Imagine reading understanding woman able tell story critical government without disappeared. serious question? Testing close contacts someone virus allows track contain outbreak. See Taiwan, South Korea, Hong King, Australia, New Zealand examples 100+ year old example simple low tech yet effective method outbreak control. 

You randomly test double check don‚Äôt cases don‚Äôt know community every while, public health official would say let‚Äôs test everyone everyday. would foolish.

I suspect assume nothing done need let virus burn everyone. incorrect assumption. virus controlled. Countries world demonstrating this. absolutely reason US cannot also this, breathtakingly federal incompetence. LoL.

Fucking slave owners talking freedom. Lol Americans called great back day airfare travel elite tv black white.

With cheap airfare prices, rise internet proved fact delusion. Among developed nations, America highest maternal mortality rates, largest number preventable deaths worst healthcare system ranked dead last despite spending 10xper capita healthcare.

Not mention top credentials homelessness, school shootings, police fatalities poverty. America great top 10% rest dreaming win lottery join them. Protip: reddit different fb. people Coronavirus introduced melatonin. Best sleep life. original intention getting non-covid patients approved covid use too. Actually, 2 things.

By going spreading Covid19, slowing spread. one less person get possibly need medical care, also one less person spread others.

Also, one less customer, making harder companies reopen, harder stay open (lack customers thus reducing pressure companies apply workers go back high risk nonessential jobs.

Companies power workers, consumers. DeVos spend money astroturf get restrictions lifted, can't make go makeup party Avon (not would, I'm boring guy, reason Avon owners want reopen economy get money pyramid scam flowing again). lot kids learn better people parents. children fair well virus.

Most do.  live adults. adults contact great many people.  children know COVID-19 experienced mild illness.

I've lost friend family member COVID-19.  underestimate harm causes.  

There's reason first thing epidemiologist pandemic shut schools.  Rates infection veer charts. feel better today even though felt bad yesterday. Although means nothing think that's common virus get worse better worse again. boss seemed genuinely concerned phone today. also tired stressed. think finally sunk weekend serious. Apparently got call kid's camp one counselors tested positive. want badly say told so. lot feelings coworker told test results surprised one them. 

I find disclosing families employee tested positive. can't officially name person HIPPA people probably figure out. defend actions everything right. Quarantined symptoms even got rapid test even though pay pocket could inform us quarantine much earlier. would gone Monday done rapid test. Almost like need fix minimum wage gap idk seems like get bad, yeah  :-(  stay healthy, stay safe 60 even 65 considered young Covid speak.

Total size Germany: 137,988 mi¬≤

Total Population EU: 446 million
Total Population USA: 328.2 million
Total Population Germany: 83.02 million

The German federal government attempting stop spread virus across 25% population USA 3% land size.

Now USA 50 states. state full autonomy Coronavirus plan. choose lock open everything up. one thing allowed stop people entering state. Florida wants let everyone get virus state right deny entry citizens Florida.

When trying curb spread across much area size population 50 different policies place going run lot issues. belittling Germany's efforts definitely poorly executed, compare two pretty wild. would compare Germany lot closer state like California federal government.

As said earlier aware government Germany structured, US states almost complete autonomy react virus federal government provide funding suggestions want. There's also severe inconsistencies people consider ""essential"" protests.

Smart, targeted shutdowns, well proper collective response populace required get control. shutdowns Thailand, opening virus control new cases beyond returnees abroad, exact opposite back home US. People stupid, new cases growing alarming way.

Sadly, vast majority Torontonians wearing masks either. entitlement denial work real, imagine globally degree. said, US response disastrous, predictably. Hope wake start tracing mass testing, best time first case second best time now. neither, Texan knew exactly trying say. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs actual term not. UnBARleviable lost license 30 days Austin. Good fuck racist assholes ah, thanks. i've never heard term before. Testing. Human trials. Tens thousands people studied years. prove effectiveness identify risks, side effects, critical interactions. Manufacture billions shots find immunity response happens 40% people lasts 6 months, suddenly people start seizures interaction allergy medicine? difficult understand. US went one overwhelmed hotspot (NY/NJ) multiple not-yet overwhelmed hotspots.

If new hotspots critical cases kept within ability hospitals cope, deaths remain low. new hotspots overwhelmed like NYC, deaths spike. 

Deaths lag behind cases takes time early symptoms develop critical state, also hospital capacity act ""dams"" hold critical cases in. We're basically waiting fingers crossed dams overtop breach. know type mask he's tried try remind people they're vastly different type maker. I'm cloth mask maker community people making extremely extremely tightly woven fabrics protection multiple layers, good even healthy person can't breathe! doubt people struggled one bad experience enough ditch altogether. saying friend done, something seen community's facebook pages example. 

The best masks start surgical ones, they're available even corner shops. Yes, Chinese population government overreacting. salmon now, people afraid eating seafood, eventhough know well, cook food, nothing fear.

I saw video ""why guys eat seafood"", interview seafood restaurant Beijing, far away high risk area, still affected ongoing outbreak. heartbreaking see ZERO customer entire day, dine-in, take-out, Never felt better honest. people assholes I‚Äôm happy avoid entirely. hear people repeating local news literally interviewing protestors Portland contracted COVID 7 days protesting. Nothing make cynical year unbelievable moral gymnastics taking place comes protests. They've given want brownie points supporting protesters. tell protesters stay home, people think they're them, want people give vote.  According sources, hasn‚Äôt caused notable stress local healthcare systems *yet*, Texas sets new daily record pretty much every day last two weeks senses smell taste?  doctor please make sure getting enough zinc B vitamins, whichever virus have. told lay politics want US bad. Anyone want take in? I‚Äôve Facebook, flooded images large family gatherings, mostly outdoors, people hugged loved ones. 10 12 people single picture. I‚Äôm worried next two weeks. 2020 feel like real life Click Bait Strong leadership would made huge difference. prolific testing early lockdowns NYC Seattle soon cases, could whole different ball game. Amen went treatment several times tested him.

[marathon We‚Äôll know it‚Äôs ready Sounds like boomer thinking good chunk population following group wear masks long think norm. 

The issue another portion population unable think abstract terms they'll believe something see it. tend break rules want even post signs making masks mandatory. 

What seeing 2nd group (the rule breakers) convinced 1st that's time go back normal. notion US given false.... certain states whose leadership is.... know. fortunate enough seriously need insurance. dad hospitalized little year near end life told insurance cover room longer. reasoning recovered point. he's passed on, getting outrageous bills every service received last year so. deductions still 100s thousands. man worked entire life, good amount money saved up, best insurance could afford. ""max pocket"" rates too. They'll claim certain services covered whatever reason . someone ran governor platform ‚Äúabolish TABC‚Äù they‚Äôd get 100% service industry‚Äôs vote lol reminds (official) attempts redefine wearing masks ""cool‚Äú ""a sign freedom strength"". It‚Äôs like trying get ill-taught toddler eating veggies. yep. social interaction friends, seen family roommates since shelter-in-place started. four roommates people over. one corona (that know of/yet), that's confirmation bias, downfall us all--ignorance, impatience, confirmation bias. country stupid. tired it. clue AZ becomes hotspot... would like rules committee protesters pandemic allowed? I'm surprised well otherwise looks like tried hit every metro area region least Could someone who's yank explain rest world whats freaking amazing graduating high school? passing bar, taking Hippocratic Oath, getting iron ring.....

I get something MASSIVE deal you, may decide put risk (and other's dick). one would assume would something significance.

As Canadian simply understand US obsession massive celebrations regarding finishing tutorial level life long RPG. Warmer weather may mean virus less severe also. Slight difference protests started. People HK protesting since well virus spreading. BLM decided wasn‚Äôt important enough virus spreading.  knew people caught it

I used hope too, see video guy rally saying friend died friend's kid intubated ventilator... still saying overblown.

I'm Houston. I'm honestly preparing go back full quarantine (quitting service job staying home kids wife works remote). expect local government catch week. they're able get away thought BLM protest, that's quite opposite. would sold better African Americans it. Yes, makes little loopy lol. üòú people read there's multiple vaccines already final stages testing already made distribute based one already years research delivery system safe already testing effectiveness. Also knowing usually takes long vaccines developed funding safety tests. thinking going 4 years one guys opinion Florida can‚Äôt relate ‚òπÔ∏è absolute worst remember woman diagnosed late stage liver cancer. husband died, family Florida, Minnesota. dying scared, one tore heart stay long wanted. nice. one alone like that. people protesting February safety precautions implemented? protesters keep crying can‚Äôt wait end pandemic it‚Äôs gone long, question could wait pandemic started. name implies---aggressive. Oh, remember someday like people describe, head start aggressive part. way people nursing homes age mostly form dementia. know nothing aging. ought ashamed yourself. Nobody saying nursing homes thing, we're saying properly funded regulated Yeah Germany example earn lot less fall ""life good"" category News Media like ‚Äúwhoops cheered protest know weren‚Äôt actually looting rioting we‚Äôll call arrest parents teachers social distancing‚Äù amazed stupid everyone arround world. contry (bulgaria) protests put Bill Gates jail. Like fuck people asking american citizen buy whole country together put bulgarian jail. yet woman screaming news showing her....  English bitch, speak Yeah something isnt really talked anymore. tons excess deaths around country 

Each state reports deaths based different criteria doubts states (Florida) actively trying hide true scale virus stupid mess TABC. TABC wants it, whatever is, they‚Äôll shut ass long takes learn mind them, still keep fvckin around, they‚Äôll yank good. long memories too. They‚Äôre like powerful insane parents. I'm curious lasting immunity without antibodies. paper article this? I'm interested reading more. Thanks! It‚Äôs curious many cases came nursing homes. Hard say many people got infected outside park mask on- comparing lawn. don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs measured. 10 day vacation planned Canada summer. Cancelled Trudeau (rightfully so) letting us country time soon. 

And again, economy would back pretty strong right everyone followed rules instead throwing temper tantrums. 

Exponential growth functions ugly that‚Äôs virus does: spreads/kills exponential rate. virus unlike virus world seen since least 1918, longer. see sub it‚Äôs always Oxford still planning September went nice place father's day tonight. walked mask on. masks give didn't. fewer tables. hosts wait staff masks, cooks didn't. asked keep mask walking around, table could course remove it. Everybody cooperative worked fine. feel like shit... 

Menu said ""$1.50 added per customer COVID related expenses."" Considering they're forcing place half empty, that's bargain. fucking crazy here. going go store today saw bunch people without masks on. left went another store enforces mask policy. really understand Americans think need masks. think rest world pulling prank America they're going fall wear mask? insane baffling. Hell yeah judge state one dude barely got re-elected GOTTEM ü§£ü§£ü§£ DROOLING REDNEX suspect cold chain contaminated.

Just suspected, tuning Beijing CDC press conference every day since last week conclusion patient zero came from. seafood market cold moist heavily contaminated salmon cutting board. 

But Beijing local authorities paranoid moment outbreak cluster may cost job, 2 Beijing district party chair always kicked office, position comparable mayor mid-sized city. 

I'm asked go get test today, 2 positive case district neighborhood 2 km away..... really think bit overkill. Yea, I'd place finished sentence. It‚Äôs clickbait hell. saw news yesterday, I‚Äôm Florence. antivaxxers protesting obligatory vaccines like also nothing Covid. white = wealthy? anymore racist? Maybe stop purporting systemic racism yourself. Still justify telling public masks work. CDC undermined credibility spouting lie. like people saying white privilege shows BLM protest would totally ok. protest, can't graduate? UK's line US Europe one, no? cop kills suspect they're placed paid adminstrative leave. company can't keep employees healthy forcing two week quarantine shit luck. went white Iowa. realize exit highway let back on. ramp barred locked. used deal horrendous panic attacks. I'm sorry hear know disturbing feel real. Hah, course Buford‚Äôs there. Except virus expelled exhaling, coughing sneezing. That's there's also 6ft distancing guidelines. wearing masks helps contain everyones virus exhaust. Vs misting everything 6ft radius.


If someone sick, without mask likely mist everything within 6 ft radius, breathing, sneezing coughing, touching every surface hands 6ft away.

I could view second video, bet kids exhaling glow germ room would way coated touch. teacher exhaling glow germ, kids shake hand would glowing much kids did.



Also people want multiple precautions. Masks, hand washing, hand sanitizer, sanitizing surfaces, barriers like plexiglass, social distancing, etc.. Lol long time former restaurant worker manager won‚Äôt catch disagreeing sound like someone who's never poured life savings business. feel bad, alone, Reddit speaking place ignorance considering certain places see packed told ""as long fixed morning health inspector can't anything"" really think OSHA caught last week. Went see friend didn‚Äôt know popping way was. Oh well. Gf got takeout parked old town couple Saturdays ago see. looked like summer 2019 there. Fucking nightmare. Except didn‚Äôt fuck up...

You guys videos hospitals overrun US do? responded ensuring extra capacity existed everywhere. issue hospitals overwhelmed virus non-existent US. 

So sure, explain country worked alleviate hospital capacity fucked one people dying hospitals couldn‚Äôt take care didn‚Äôt. Amazing. America. Yeah, take easy try avoid contact others possible. false negative rates surprisingly high PCR (swab) testing - oral swabs even less likely return positive nasal swabs.

You may want get tested trying judge contact others. Sorry hear that. Sounds like breakdown state unemployment agency. That's another issue altogether.

I know many employers hard time getting low/minimum wage workers back work they're currently making unemployment returned work. kind point stimulus, keep people home. working, another failure government. NYC protestors wearing masks. time component contracting virus. It‚Äôs everyone passed last 14 days, it‚Äôs people spent 14 minutes talking indoor setting without mask on.  narrow list possible contacts. Additionally, it‚Äôs self isolate 14 days, it‚Äôs go get tested here‚Äôs test site, make appointment you?

This learning live virus. see reason US cannot implement Europe, Asia,and Oceania figured out. 

Where live county calculated they‚Äôd need ~450 contact tracers 5000 tests/day contain outbreak. It‚Äôs impossible done. Really? Every single comment post political. ""political"" agree asshole Translation: ‚ÄúI evidence, please disregard anything say.‚Äù Abbott mandated TABC strictly enforce tho Nah TABC sucks Depends city. densely populated areas comparable population density Europe‚Äôs densely populated areas. seeing surge Missouri. said new cases could definitely pin ozarks party. would require people party admit health department. People don‚Äôt really like idea contact tracing general so.... also pretty serious heart condition. No. really isn't. worked factories never people shouting move faster  putting peoples lives risk Hawaii, we‚Äôve strictly enforcing social distancing mask requirements. Every day see tourists breaking quarantine they‚Äôre offended ‚Äúracist ‚Äú are. tiny minority racist everybody else. Cmon. Yeah, understand benchmark thing. guess hit whatever wanted (maybe? I‚Äôll look again).

What really haven‚Äôt seen good explanation benchmarks hitting means it‚Äôs safe open things. Haven‚Äôt hit staying quarantined found anywhere? I‚Äôd stop that, won‚Äôt things revert less pre-quarantine shiftiness, slightly masks? Maybe there‚Äôs scientific explanation I‚Äôm missing here, doesn‚Äôt sound right me. ways discussing balance health need schooling ""purely political?"" fuzzy juice time...... yee haw It‚Äôs real issue. need rest people need most, maybe it‚Äôs tested safe healthier people? can't America? lol

Respect. 

Take care much easily filling past capacity lol think asymptomatic aspect really critical. People can't believe true worst nightmare. example, businesses insist temperature screening go office. reality asymptomatic transmission temperature screening nothing. However, businesses can't believe/don't want believe nothing reality office concept work longer viable vaccine cure. almost great many Americans selfish infants. mention exposed one teacher. think back best teachers, mediocre ones downright bad ones. guarantee one good ones get.  might issues look to. Panic edit feel like less 5 people pointed error discounting population density NY vs Florida, amazingly keep ignoring it. Cuomo, warts all, least start taking pandemic seriously without (finally) 'sense urgency Trump's demeanor'. Matters not, despite psychic 'fistbump' POTUS, DeSantis still clue he's get state this. Proportional US population, would 1,500 cases week. America, we'd ***love*** numbers low that. suggest reading peer reviewed articles r/COVID19 

They address concerns. weekly questions thread also pretty helpful plenty actual researchers address questions actual data. Gilead starting trial inhaled version Remdesivir. interesting. results promising, could mean people mild symptoms could given early prevent disease becoming worse? remember correctly, main reason remdesivir less impactful administered IV needed clinical setting, happening severe cases. Wasn‚Äôt thought antivirals could beneficial preventing severe cases rather treating them? are. probably do, idiots. ::aim doorslam:: \#2 definitely case IMO. positivity rate NY seeing 4-6k cases day 30% 40%, 3-4x Florida seeing now. limited availability testing beginning outbreak severely counted cases everywhere.

I expect FL's new case count plateau reach current testing limit. Positivity continue rise infection spreads. think Florida bad New York positivity rate reaches 30%. Hopefully governor lockdown well point infection keeps spreading. Sure, like cops hadn‚Äôt tear gassed everyone.

Btw, reply post mods removed? got P100 respirator. They're available Amazon like $26 $14 filter cartridges. I'm young (25 - 34) healthy person. I'm arrogant ignorant, like feeling completely safe non-homicidal . worth $40 fuck's sake. return work next Monday. Yay, me. guess point avoiding COVID. point get virus HVAC technician go people's homes day long. wife 2 kids 3 home full time hope get really mild versions it. 

What fucking joke society live in. Tests per population high population country like India appropriate. Situation getting bad india specially Delhi Mumbai rests states ok peole recovering active ones. Corona badly effecting high density population countries like India , brazil pakistan Bangladesh etc. countries hope vaccine eradicate corona IL, least &lt;2.5% tests, believe goal stay 3% something nature. 10% higher I've seen IL... definitely means enough testing accurate picture health state population. Looks like Sweden almost completely solved nursing home problem, horrid predictable start. they're trying solve testing problem. I'm sure approach problem, incompetence. ever drop 0?0.o

I remember weeks ago really low.. mean still cant drop already 0???:/ ""Right we're trying save August....""

""August! Christ's Sake, tomorrow Fourth July! *will* open business."" heard people travelling Sweden (which course unreliable stereotype...), swedes reputation avoiding conflicts rather try find immediate consensus. undeniable advantages maintain stable society.      
The problem situation emergency, like global pandemic, time make sure offend sensibilities. numbers bad, strategy work, plain simple.      
But that's Sweden messed up. messed trusted incompetent, arrogant, delusional initial testing blitz tactic decrease positivity. testing admitted patients while, sudden massive amounts people tested drivethru events. positivity rate drops you‚Äôre longer testing people present signs disease. 

At Ducey‚Äôs excuse reopening case rate skyrocketing. Good thing US still long time, 1st wave. Never left it, never handled it.  Oh man. wonder whether Bulgaria boat. probably are. Flattening curve great all, maintain it. 
 
It's like getting school. Getting isnt difficult, maintaining challenge. pretty well, though suppose know watching hospitalizations down, deaths down, cases associated long-term facilities down. Florida testing vulnerable populations now.

but suppose saw news, pointing spike new cases? that's came back tread? favor go look california's numbers also spiking now. increasing positives younger folks appears next stage virus. buckle-up prepared likely see spike among youth repeat throughout country. person realizes don‚Äôt wear mask refuse leave asked appropriate person, trespassing, persecuted wearing mask, persecuted refusing leave?

And time...

People aren‚Äôt marching right get hair cut, marching friends family able earn living. really didn‚Äôt make sense milkshake stand Starbucks essential, places human contact closed? hear sleep Dude, Google Earth photos real time. Well, roughly deaths per capita US now, overtook us last week metric still growing, almost put hslt. is, really hoped lock-downs last month, numbers go down, that's case. pandemic spreading faster ever. New Cases &amp; Deaths decoupled month - take look graphs each.

We also getting better treating infected individuals. part lockdown exists everyone clubbing dining nothing happening.

This biggest problem. Even everyone wearing masks, social distancing large crowds worst thing. ""Indicates mildly effective shortening hospital stays"" really sounds like evidence weak enough debunked subsequent studies.  happens masses good leader lead them! neither sources back claim, source addresses it. certainly 500% increase, material enough change anything said first post, even assume 100% pneumonia deaths year actually need wear mask eat drink restaurants wear mask seated, take meal put back on.

People acting like shit fused face permanently okay message ""it's okay young people getting COVID dying""?

Also, where's data saying ""most"" long term effects? think anyone data yet focus is. think solution would've been? gave examples two areas experiencing hotspots due people traveling hotspots. Countries world shut borders countries exactly described - prevent people hotspots bringing virus country. controlling travel hotspots answer, think EU could've done kind influence without closing borders? think people would flee vacation Greece Croatia back April May could? exactly used except making sure one got virus danger others? Please enlighten me. still leaves 200 excess deaths

Yes, math checks out. However changes article 372 deaths, half easily accounted for. ""mysterious""? Worldometer transparent aggregator data I've ever seen web. Literally everything post documented source, almost official government health departments. expect retroactively adjusted tomorrow. usually delay reporting weekend caught tuesday. Oh sure. live radio ads continuously talk we‚Äôre saving lives. 

People subconsciously think ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù means making less people catch it. think government trying protect them. 

But reality government preventing hospitals overloaded.  travel work seen enough cover mouth nose exposed; time ends around neck. Worse morons gloves eating food. way things going virus, I'll take info real proven otherwise. Stay healthy there. Like, indisputable tried keep quiet anymore. Sure, go rabbit hole conspiracy kept lying numbers... indisputable fact less forthcoming early stages Ouch, logic, hurts! curiosity‚Äîwhat think fatality rate polio, assume accept potentially serious public health concern, is? UK like twice many deaths per capita US? preprint version. exact authors, exact name, noe mention Aluminumhydroxyphosphate sulfate. read full text? florida. Tampa Hero Hype happened 2 days ago get cancelled. Let interject real fast eat shit

Let interject point *trillion* dollar sales marketing industry exist shits giggles. 


Behavioral sociology exists reason. Businesses know nudge behavior. Pretending otherwise pointless. Sure, agency, consciously choose precise issue, willing directly contradict 'easy' norms society born in. Lying try boost stocks . . . again. virus absolutely burned nursing homes March/April. fewer older people left infect now. zero, fewer. means new infections slanted toward younger people likely survive. Especially take account lockdown less strict europe countries, nobody wears masks, Dutch known liking rules. That's big theory bc people produce mucus breathe heavy exercise. creepy? reporting issue. hope ends üòâ also lost father covid. COMPLETELY agree. see friends family member loved ones thing nothing happened. forgot friend, loved one, family suffered tremendous loss. feels beyond disrespectful. try call people see find falls deaf ears. i‚Äôm sorry loss. i‚Äôm sorry endure others selfish. feel father robbed im sure feel similarly. sending hugs. could scientists say weakening. you. anyone basing anything solely read reddit problem, people posting experiences.

My impressions don‚Äôt get biased based reddit. Yikes anyone‚Äôs does. It‚Äôs one place many read things.
Some people consider source seek many sources. pinned. someone staring obvious obvious. I'm never eating bowl pho again. needs support local leo get it? mention lawsuit judge override. Wtf? currently happy delusional?

I'm afraid true.   
But reason tell happy people... hurry least. wanna use excuse ""there's testing! course there's spike!"" I. STILL. CAN'T. GET. A. TEST. nearly 4 months!!!!! last six major global viruses second wave, several larger initial break infuriating, fail imagine country world something different tbh, ""its problem, dont meddle in"" mentality without thinking consequences norm sadly. taught kid laundry cook. KNEW husband would dead respirator. practically licking doorknobs get it. Medical officer know crazy high field, government testimony, foreign governments requesting expertise, etc, said want vaccine go catch currents attenuated form. ‚ÄúSo said people ‚ÄòSlow testing down.‚Äô‚Äù

Don‚Äôt see, incredibly funny joke! thankful ‚Äúhumor‚Äù distract us fact none grandparents survive year! /s Tbf anything improvement weather forecast smoke fire previous comment got deleted basically said group fought businesses serve serve whoever wanted. mad business refuse without mask. 
It‚Äôs thing allowing smoking restaurant it‚Äôs health everyone else. Helpless little hopeless feels... ""Insane, firm relatively consistent."" That's Florida, right. protests europe seem add surge. Moszt likely opening eat restaurants could infect anyone 30 minutes. World Health Organization Sunday reported largest single-day increase coronavirus cases count, 183,000 new cases latest 24 UN health agency said Brazil led way 54,771 cases tallied U.S. next 36,617. 15,400 came Overall pandemic, reported 8,708,008 cases ‚Äî 183,020 last 24 hours ‚Äî 461,715 deaths worldwide, daily increase 4,743.

This pretty bad, going lie. [This link disproves look 2008, 2012 compare 2016. 

You tagged instigator knew old comments shows seeing addressing main point. I'm generally pretty bullish reopening, reason open places get work done even 10% inefficiency added.. Minimize can, open rest. Wait saying pass someone virus, half second get infected? sure that's accurate.

Also, see women beach, considered #with them? likely need doctor's note based Dept Labor. are, however, circumstances CARES Act specific, credible health concerns could require individual quit job thereby make individual eligible PUA. example, individual may eligible PUA diagnosed COVID-19 qualified medical professional, although individual longer COVID-19, illness caused health complications render individual objectively unable perform essential job functions, without reasonable accommodation. However, voluntarily deciding quit job general concern exposure COVID-19 make eligible PUA. believe employer‚Äôs response possible spread COVID-19 creates serious safety hazard think employer following OSHA standards, [file complaint Occupational Safety Health  general matter, likely eligible PUA due concerns exposure coronavirus advised healthcare provider self-quarantine result concerns. instance, individual whose immune system compromised virtue serious health condition, therefore advised healthcare provider self-quarantine order avoid greater-than-average health risks individual might face become infected coronavirus eligible PUA eligibility requirements met. Right? trying ask loaded question. 4 county sheriff's CA said wont enforce masks. Since virus already rocketed nursing homes, lot people going die already died. people left virus infect skew younger fraction total population, hence new deaths becoming decoupled new cases. hear ‚Äúpermenant‚Äù health issues norm. people recover within weeks. tested positive annoying sore throat week that. ever was.

 
Same ever was. 


Same ever was. 


Same ever was. father chilean living america passed away covid. heart aches chile watching numbers climb daily. family santiago still reach every couple days say thing: it‚Äôs nothing changed. Serious concern india especially cities like Mumbai Delhi people taking virus seriously . Saw tiktok video worried seeing crowd there, posted video profile. People going work grocery etc ok people beach gathering grp plain stupidity mentioned sub another Redditor, Redditor said trust it, posters could lying symptoms get attention upvotes. people want believe long-haulers real. parents set taking family vacation Italy September (we US). Good idea bad idea? depends pharma companies pay wages tell say. rarely anything giving solid medical advice. great source. spread virus almost immediately catching it? soon become contagious?  Right know that, simply letting person know place read stories. said wish way read experiences. evidence far indicates mildly effective shortening hospital stays. evidence contrary? make sense sure man haha school system disaster forever. It‚Äôs sad, you‚Äôre right. 

When comes elite schools like Ivy League others, believe USA right. majority universities, colleges subpar compared rest world. middle schools, high schools forget it. It‚Äôs joke. POSITIVE NEWS.....DOES COMPUTE.....BEEP BOOP.....I DOOMER BOT r/CORONAVIRUS.....I UNDERSTAND POSITIVE NEWS.....END MESSAGE.... Wish could pin comment top thread. understand worry/accommodating fact people may severe long term symptoms, fact impression biased small amount people speak them. people need want go places far away? Bay Area it‚Äôs flattened gone Peninsula bit. think telecommuting option tech companies here.

More cheaper rural places coast seen homes get bought. tax payer bailouts go mega corporations. They've saying long time. they're repeating mean new. restricting movement exactly described? said people fled New York areas nothing stopping getting cars driving elsewhere. checkpoints interstates restricted travel, could've contained outbreaks specific regions US seeing new hotspots June. really matter someone flies Arizona Italy New York April - still someone fly region cases region large outbreak. Normally, 7,700 people die day U.S. 500 would extra 6% so. Significant, exaggerate it. won‚Äôt argue Thousands people gathering doesn‚Äôt increase numbers go restaurant does??? 
That‚Äôs logic. 
Do quick google search protests happened country weekend. Really? I'm eager move Sweden. idea people losing shit. Let people fun, desire, harm that. enjoy staying home shivering fear 3 months, choice yours, need freeze everyone else, mostly live free, paper, countries, freedom choice human right them. crowd obnoxious, aggressive arrogant well. impossible civil conversation it, resorted screaming name calling right get go lol. 

They sure quieted bit past weeks, can‚Äôt imagine why. least deaths still tending downwards. don‚Äôt know much longer it‚Äôll last, I‚Äôll happy trend however long does. 2021 good time purchase property... official came said ***obviously*** joking!!!! Yet another job need handled armed police. Thanks you. days question still work lot times want quit, single income household...... can't really afford that. hardly anywhere else hiring permanent full-time. 

The people insult yell making follow social distancing rules worst. even get hazard pay, people literally getting face screaming touching me. we're considered""essential"" ""essential"" enough get hazard pay.   fly family point time unless absolutely to, see many situations would happen.

I talking purely hypothetical. vaccine actually stops infection? want body. stupid pneumonia? blood clotting? quote Rocky IV: ""if dies, dies"".

You can't fix stupid. I've around long enough time firmly believe worth time effort try understand people. Yes? I'm pretty sure answer yes. new thing  almost certainly correct, although article really explain correctly, all. Perhaps writer trying relay information fully comprehend. 

The underlying theory muted virus less-severe virus greater percentage infected little/no symptoms. asymptomatic people spread less severe mutation virus faster farther, slowly snuffing original pre-mutation virus. effect compound mutations take place. US tourists yet allowed travel Italy. Given increasing rates, doubt allowed September. also still testing... friend say cases quite high can't complain ... think runs tourist hot-spot that's right fucked.. like fucked gills fucked. keeps going on. Exponential growth time exponent, R0 base. base 1 still linear, ""flat horizontal line"" constant value that's _technically_ still linear. Doesn‚Äôt even COVID. media drops ball many topics daily basis clicks/views. It‚Äôs disgusting. feel contain based performance first wave. Surely it‚Äôs indoors, right? would waaaaay worse course. stock market goes cut jobs get rid regulation, isnt really good indicator well are. like 10% americans stock. well truly screwed, least working class anyway. data worldometers got wrong? tally official numbers day released. fhm keep making retroactive adjustments. age group driving recent spike 18-to-35. cAuSe AdUlT oNsEt AuTiSm!!!!!! feel like COVID-19 really put spotlight American culture selfishness ignorance like call rugged individualism.  Fuck no. I‚Äôm SC barely even shut started. People either think it‚Äôs joke simply don‚Äôt care. yesterday idk many small churches passed full parking lots anyone else problems wearing masks long? work lately nose bothering whenever wear mask yesterday got point wher got bad nosebleed. kind mask wear sure happening scary. media hasn‚Äôt really picked up. Healthy adults may survive virus could mean needing lung transplant ffs. Like legit could done lol protested shelter like people did. issue lying BLM. Testing didn‚Äôt multiply 4 what‚Äôs excuse going be. Davidson County needs drop back least phase 2. report outline possible explanation agency state several factors likely impact risk catching dying coronavirus, report take account, including lifestyle factors, underlying diseases, structural factors access factors could include things like living crowded housing, higher proportion group working jobs require social contact cannot done home, living parts Sweden worst hit virus, Stockholm.

This part it, sure. *very* complex issue. would think another part foreign born people disproportionately affected surprising lack information official sources languages Swedish Sweden. counterexample, Iceland provides official translations many languages relatively tiny. 

Another part immigrants tend less well off, risk infection / death increased lower socioeconomic category. 

I think another part is, sadly, enormous amount reporting cases individual denied care disproportionate number foreign sounding names pictures article show peole look 'ethincally Swedeish. example: trend esp. interesting compared Denmark, [immigrants likely infected *less* like think might US citizen spending time Reddit best paint Sweden poor light, living state higher per capita death toll Sweden. wonder why. wouldn‚Äôt expect price drop all, maybe urban centers We're building wall, Yankees going pay it. Damn. 175% monthly take-home, I'm fairly well paid industry. SARS-CoV-2 actually seems spread pretty differently common respiratory viruses least now.

1. low population immunity, allowing exponential growth transmission possible.

2. Less impact temperature/humidity transmission. viruses would able spreading control India right now.

3. Spreads almost exclusively indoor environments, haven‚Äôt seen mass protests become superspreading events. hand, 1918 Philadelphia parade support war effort led sudden surge flu deaths city.

4. Superspreading events like common drive transmission greater degree viruses. instance, common catch flu cruise ship, would common 700 flu cases linked ship, especially outbreak began one infected person like outbreak Diamond Princess did.

5. Spreads almost exclusively respiratory droplets transmitted air short distances. reason told ‚Äúwash hands‚Äù whole lives: many viruses spread easily touching contaminated surface touching face. reason seems rare virus, means ‚Äúfilthy‚Äù place actually irrelevant. crowded long people stay standing near conditions fit meatpacking plants. article doesn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs problem now. says it‚Äôs investigation done Ekot (Swedish National radio). says ‚Äúbeginning April‚Äù nothing now. Essential workers need new definition. Pretty much every job claim they're essential. time Tegnell explains Sweden prepared better neighbours second wave pandemic Sweden heard immunity. second wave Swedish senior citicens lost lives reason chosen strategy. 100% death rate born. 

It's statistics taken context mean much. media covered coronavirus well, fox news. far right taken divisive issue run it. yes, least we're scary S-word gets modded sub.

Health care insurance going reforms though moving forward. temporary setback them. Victoria, Australia we're reimposing restrictions positives risen alarmingly 0.16%. Trump telling people wear masks daily. said wants stop testing.

Your response ignores reality. Yeah ive really happy state grocery store use 90% wearing masks every other. We're going see second wave soon Well hope right. find suspicious alot professionals reporting told withhold information governor downplays danger. 

Seems spike cases florida far recent comparing FL death count NY. would great 33 deaths went 330, sounds wildly optimistic me.  I'm happy bc familial relationships great, nonverbal autistic child made progress home 3 years school therapy. BUT, terrified bc high risk, son mother I'm forced go back work bartender health insurance hearing GM trying get people exposed/have symptoms come work. contacted local politicians higher ups unemployment hoping help. Paying unemployment months cheaper disabled specials needs child dependant state rest life die. need additional convincing raise taxes wealthiest.

Good luck, UK. don‚Äôt even shut down. smart. aren‚Äôt continue incompetent mayor. They're protesting fighting right PAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRTY!!! People need become comfortable tech really make difference! Please ask state country write app based system! that‚Äôs happened... totally fabricating responded early stage thought tourism large portion economy side ditch? Ok downloaded data excel filtered non-EU (including UK) I'm getting per capita 29.6 vs US 31.16. correct, data used made wrong. Ruins everything.. it‚Äôs today Imagine much better done hadn‚Äôt sat asses three four weeks. Andy Cuomo take credit terrible fucking job.  

Just ask thousands people lost grandparents ordered take known Covid patients back nursing homes example wouldn‚Äôt expect price drop next 6-12 months. home owners trying ride pandemic right list afterwards. absolutely baffling. many people know and, extent, respect for, come straight conspiracy theory nuts past 6 months. think I've pretty steady rate unhappiness years... US, odds dying COVID-19 period 2/1 6/13 were:

Under 65: 1/13846
65 over: Sadly Memphis exception rule. Shelby County Democratic County Tennessee. best, metro counties may revert considering Nashville Knoxville cruising along reopening, doubt it. He'll join you! u tell Malaysian numbers legit? me, seem good true... verifiable statement. gonna flat admit it. Lol, hilarious Another reason wish lived there. talking guy went party place breaking rules? mention president wants us stop testing Yeah, speech literally includes acts BLM time they're like graduation means something it. One small mention excuse circumnavigate rules. march protest reason wanted party. took Beastie Boys bit literal. Generally, I'd say faking case numbers pretty easy I'd really careful Florida's case totals. hospitalizations easy fake (too many presumably non-corrupt people know real situation, including families, doctors, nurses, hospital administrators, social media). hospitalizations recently started increase, early led rise deaths. deaths total I'd say somewhere cases hospitalizaitons. Florida's reporting 40 odd day, big wave COVID deaths, lots people would know we'd firm information that. always play fast loose ""with COVID vs COVID"" determination. Although even would counter information hospitals doctors, seen.

Long way saying think hospitalizaiton death stats, even Florida, pretty accurate plus minus 10%. dont claim ability predict future - guess look like, good mine..., H1N1 hit china, mask use continued exceedingly common public spaces. would surprised see happen western world somewhat run course, hence one new normalized behavior. virus obvious Italians? Utah health department hasn‚Äôt even gone bars restaurants check anything. make complaint call establishment. Good know. wondering update days. That's hell news outlet there.

Same outlet claimed yesterday R number Germany doubled 2.88. R 2.88 greater exponential growth.

Could fear monger harder? Germany 13 deaths per day, around 500-600 cases per day. They're fine.

BUT GET SCARED EVERYONE! don‚Äôt know that. entering denial don‚Äôt exist inside preconceived notions. I‚Äôm sure saw posts, happy know sold help cover costs. Fuck people like wanting save disease I‚Äôm harmed descent poverty would ever coronavirus. people try argue posting failings various health organizations. assumed same, bad. Pass meds though. kind understand already biased people copious convinced hoax...or least blown proportion....back January, even late February.....but point? asking specific group people wear masks...we're asking everyone...like seatbelts motorcycle helmets... difference masks protect person wearing them..... think that's part reasoning. recently brought back Australian rules football. got first positive test. teams next game obviously postponed. player play previous week contact number players. third team might out. whole thing mess. teams playing quarantine zones living hotels states Covid free allow visiting teams. LIVIN MURICA don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs who‚Äôs responsibilities though remind government (the US) politicalize Pandemic Beijing also flair hundred cases. looks like able contain suppress. 

It done taken seriously. Johns Hopkins Worldometer agree, nearly perfectly, close data day different time. think local government accuracy is, want promote Worldometers denigrate then, that's get data. linkable sources.  Didn‚Äôt work - Slovenian still got in. Wouldn‚Äôt surprised China sell ineffective vaccine $$. 30% accuracy test kits, make n95 masks, gowns fall apart.... 

If come one, rather wait results first. 

And besides, effective one, give population first. play politics it, sell allies. bad pissed lot countries. Going spreading virus spoiling lives potentialy ending lives sounds good you? That's literally school shooter's mentality disguise. prices always drop big economic crises. time too. Yes still get vote. register calling local board elections, medicaid every year redetermination benefits voter registration page end complete get registered way. residents want vote provided mail ballots. Residents also still eligible Jury Duty although majority request removed pool candidates Jury Duty turn 70.

Everyone hospital demoralized.

And we're seeing patient complaints Tr*mp said x can't must libs minority doctors must racist treating white people.

It's... lot. Canuck bootlickers fuck I'm sure will. lot people mildly sick think sick getting tested. Previously sickest hospitalizations easy access testing. Hopefully raised testing looks like deaths follow. 3.5 months going... We're getting caution fatigue! hard constantly vigilant alert never ending dangers.

Let's keep reminding still people fighting hard us virus. Remember honor Herculean efforts utmost keep others safe. 

We make this! Deaths keep trending downward unless truly massive spikes cases.

(The arguments dragging on, suggestion worthwhile.) Yes, actually personally, I'm China wants moratorium meat imports.

In fact many policies implemented government early days Wuhan flawed countless ordinary Chinese people, health care workers even experts took Weibo scream government tighten controls plug loopholes, fortunately government listened.

Today, number cases Beijing down, something worrying.

#Traslation:

Camouflage colored ambulances uniformed drivers seen around Gothenburg [the 2nd largest city Sweden]. exercise. Since end April, Armed Forces helping Sahlgrenska Hospital's regular ambulance staff cope increased pressure corona pandemic.

In ambulance hall East hospital emergency room Gothenburg, three ambulances lined up. transported suspected covid-19 patients decontaminated. One ambulances goes typical neon yellow ambulance color. two differ color shape.

The two military ambulances manned ambulance nurse Sahlgrenska ambulance driver Armed Forces. newly formed teams go everything except emergency priority one alarms. Ambulance nurse Christer Axelsson, usually drives alone so-called assessment car, happy military vehicle personnel supplements.

- Recently patient tripped struck. got realized patient, covid before, ill trembled. Usually alone make assessment case call ambulance. already two place could load drive hospital directly.

He praises colleague military.

- defense, focused trauma care young people mostly deal elderly medical problems. (the colleague's note) goes straight in, makes connections takes blood pressure.


Some distance away, white-clad protective-equipped decontamination workers full swing interior second military ambulance. medical soldier Sebastian, who, like military, states first name talking media, seeks get moment's rest. worked soldier six years, one nurse. Behind six-year medical education, ten weeks college.


- internships emergency care ambulance past. feel ready this.


When Sebastian gets extra time ""real"" health care, makes sure collect ""image bank"" different medical conditions look. met curious questions surprised patients.


- respond: ""Oh, ambulance staff given new uniforms?"", says.


A kilometers away, ambulance station Gulbergsvass industrial area, Sebastian's military commander. Intervention leader Tobias makes first week post.


""We defense accustomed practice and, fortunately, seldom services needed reality,"" says Tobias, foreign mission Afghanistan never participated sharp effort home. 


- first time maybe time it. damn special.


At most, four military ambulances operation Gothenburg recently decided operation last least September 5. invaluable resource according Elisabeth Hammar, head ambulance care Sahlgrenska University Hospital. turn outs certainly increased pandemic, protective clothing cars cleaned up, everything taken longer.


- Without them, patients would wait much longer. covid paitent rapidly getting worse, expectation difficult, says Elisabeth Hammar.

However, know costs Defense effort end up. may question yet clear answer.

- cost issue investigation actors involved. Right now, focus solving situations arise pandemic. next issue resolve costs, says region's press secretary Gabriel Holmqvist.


In ambulance hall Eastern Hospital, Christer Axelsson, ambulance nurse 38 years, tells us enthusiasm new colleagues spread.


- fun work military happy get work real. great advantage experience fun work them.


Almost simultaneously, two teams receive new priority two alarms - ""acute life threatening"". two military ambulances roll new missions. question whether place civil care even outside times crisis. Christer Axelsson thinks briefly answering.


- Maybe summer, shortage staff around holidays. could solution. good shit. drink alcohol... Even phased reopening, need take precautions. Maintain 6ft distance wear mask indoors outside crowds social distancing possible. Phased reopening likely still better reopening completely 100% - but- mean virus defeated - medical resources overwhelmed. Expect future shutdowns infections naturally increase reopening next year vaccine available. live lower-middle-income house $300,000. drive 25 miles north buy exact house less $80,000. DC numbers haven‚Äôt spiked, despite tons protests. doctor fraud possible? think read somewhere takes like 85% population infected order get herd immunity. 

Whoever read wrong. closer 20%, far off. Read article illuminating discussion Trump ultimate person responsible. agree, must held accountable. Yes, ones cannot get job nobody hiring many businesses dying will. oh boy happening go Debate isn‚Äôt allowed? 

You know locking country 3 months denying/delaying treatment going increase hospitalisations inevitably start treating ailments they‚Äôve neglected covid 19? Thanks fixing :) Link picture? speak Arabic, quick googling seems te 2nd one correct, acceptable worry. young daughter well. would hate grow issues long run virus people shrugging off. think that's gets most. Every democratic state pretty well. Coincidence? think not. Yes ""Eddies,"" said Ford, ""in space-time continuum.""
""Ah,"" nodded Arthur, ""is he. he.""
...
""What?"" said Ford.
""Er, who,"" said Arthur, ""is Eddy, then, exactly, then?"" Killing around personal gratification. See edited comment below... whole article questions clear lot confusion Strains - mutations - etc... US reached temporary plateau rising God still high there? certain point cases US point. US 5 percent positive test count. IVIG intravenous immune globulin therapy, drug administered mostly immunoglobulin G, IgG, trace amounts IgA avoid adverse effects. really must frustrating. Watching business die due pandemic protests allowed. Protests allowed large mosh pits business owners become business-less. like feel free move. government going govern, weirdly enough. testing negative embolisms occurred? Oh nice! 

May ask got virology degree? Damn! forgot ones developing vaccine. Congrats, took quote completely way check mass testing everyone district around slaughterhouse around residential areas workers lived.

- repeatedly forced say patients would normally accepted, says.




When [DN reported summer elderly covid patients given priority Stockholm Director Health Health denied it: ""We prioritize."" 


The region's chief medical officer told DN mid-April: ‚ÄúWe decision support National Board Health Welfare priorities relevant event lack resources. now. "" 

Michael Broom√©, associate professor chief physician Ecmo Center New Karolinska Solna, sickest covid-19 patients cared for, strongly react comments.


- **I find alienating offensive read responsible managers' interpretation current situation. Trying pretend care provided without need priorities lie. continue cultivate culture silence prevents problem solving. Claiming resources adequate also insinuates forced make priority [triage] decisions wrong.** 

The last months resembled anything experienced before, says Michael Broom√©. rest intensive care unit, Ecmo managed triple number places, 3 around 10, borrowed staff extended working hours. 


- **Despite this, often felt powerlessness inadequate. lost several young, previously healthy, patients particularly serious illnesses. also repeatedly forced say patients would normally accepted due lack experienced staff, suitable facilities equipment, says continues**:


- prioritization decisions difficult often time pressure. decisions made greatest extent possible consultation several doctors. particular challenge regard covid-19 long care times difficulties assessing prognosis disease new us. goal always use existing resources way greatest benefit patients.


Advisory talks taken place ICU departments throughout country - sees pattern nationally.

- obvious work done extraordinary circumstances level care really come normal standards.
 
Intensive care priorities set across country, according chief physician Michael Broom√©.

Fewer ultrasound X-ray examinations, occasionally handwritten notes patient site instead data records. Active humidification, inhalations respiratory care happen usual way, according Broom√©.

- Relatively inexperienced doctors nurses may take greater responsibility. impressed dedication quickly learned bear heavy responsibility people's lives. Many testify fact hard priorities forced respiratory care also treatments kidney dialysis, important part intensive care.


Even normal conditions, access resources influences intensive care priorities, emphasizes.


He grateful fellow workmates country thinks far managed prevent nursing accident saved many lives. also grateful redistributed resources ICU sites could more. 


- However, **the responsible managers failed describe nuanced way shortcomings exist. Citizens right find important social functions fail. work healthcare also experienced support top managers deeper understanding work do.** 


Those responsible hiding serious problems new, Broom√© says.


- culture silence around long time, look happened Surgeon Macchiarini see devastating consequences culture individual patients, also tendency health care staff face maladministration.


The health care inspection currently reviewing intensive care priorities region pandemic, following alarm health care personnel. welcomes Michael Broom√©.


- **I wish Swedish Agency Social Protection Preparedness, National Board Health, Stockholm Region hospital management devote time self-criticism finding causes poor emergency preparedness low number care places ICU places country instead repeating self-glorifying statements well coped crisis, says.**

#Lars Falk says 65-70 percent Ecmo patients survive.

Lars Falk, Head Operations Ecmo Center, states everyone make difficult decisions pandemic.


- Although always make priorities healthcare, tougher period. 


He agree Ecmo lacked competence capacity therefore refused receive covid disease - Karolinska sites expanded. time, says selection necessary, knowledge Ecmo treatment covid patients. Starting treatment chance, initially half covid patients survived. 


- Normal criteria experiences work. awful see patients normally survive die one's eyes. 


Now 65-70 percent survive. 


- new, complex disease. Patients multiple organs failure stay Ecmo much longer, requires good physical shape. Initially, know covid-19 differentiated patients patients. **We gradually learned select another way - not, would even higher mortality.**


#The regional management denied priorities political reasons, according Johan Styrud, chief physician chairman Stockholm Medical Association.


Johan Styrud, chairman Stockholm Medical Association chief physician Danderyds hospital:


- Absolutely, harder priority given. Especially peak load, end March-early April. 


When comes intensive care, ICU, different different Stockholm hospitals, according him.

- liberal receiving people hospital tough saying people. depend places, culture things. **But middle pandemic center clear stress would explode one would expand tremendously could put imaginable ICU.**


**Styrud believes regional management denied priorities strategic reasons.**


- political statements. Healthcare many regions hard pressed, possible stick chair with. **If political leadership said straight been, would big reaction, avoided. feel say capacity security, even though experienced something else floor outside business. think truthful.**


#Katrin Hruska, emergency physician M√§lar Hospital Eskilstuna.


Katrin Hruska emergency physician M√§lar Hospital Eskilstuna, works emergency medical cars Stockholm region. **She interprets priorities necessary, part strategy, least planning meet pandemic started late. time, also asks message authorities regional management vacant care places.** 


- **There never excess capacity - even pandemic. strategy lower quality snap entire healthcare system order keep together. gone disaster mode, would clearer priorities,‚Äù** says.

**Bj√∂rn Persson, head operations PMI, entire intensive care unit Karolinska, previously described fewer staff care patients, ""stretched extreme"" - intensive care pandemic basic normal. load high, important usual hospitalize patients greatest chance survival, according him.** 

- selected harder probably evaluate afterwards, previously told DN. 

#Intensive care sites Sweden

Sweden stands among OECD countries, bottom comes number intensive care units relative population. 

At beginning pandemic, 525 intensive care units throughout country, 91 located Stockholm region. mid-April, number doubled. strong expansion, made Region Stockholm weeks, possible glazed staffing. Karolinska, number intensive care units increased 38 185 weeks.

High school children play travel baseball couldnt honestly care less. someone explain R actually estimated? Germany's contact tracing good enough figure many people single person infects average, way estimate it? remember looking R estimates back January, seeing range like 3-7, sorta thought estimating R total crapshoot. virus may mutating less deadly.  

It could hitting younger healthier generations now, better chance fighting off.

#Translation:

It second largest support measure corona crisis [in Sweden]. However, unlike short-term permits, companies' transition support extended summer. Critics warning huge wave bankruptcy, government hoping eased travel restrictions.


The sound engineer self-employed Anders Nyberg tough right now. months ago new assignments rolled assembly line. March April suddenly stopped. Revenue fell third since beginning May six jobs.


- sales fallen 95 percent May June, company two important months year, says Anders Nyberg, works extensively live concerts.


Since Anders Nyberg runs company individual company, cannot take advantage government's short-term permits. put company dormant seek contributions instead, Nyberg absolutely want. Instead, puts hope government's so-called transition support companies apply Monday.


The restructuring aid aimed companies lost 30 percent sales due corona crisis March April compared period last year.


The support government's second largest investment, following short-term permits. organizations represent Swedish entrepreneurs critical support designed.

#The risk see huge wave bankruptcy.

One Patrick Krass√©n, tax expert interest organization F√∂retagarna. like government far chosen extend support summer months.


- Companies sales summer may revenue loss March April, fairly large turnover loss summer. risk see huge wave bankruptcy,‚Äù says Patrick Krass√©n.


Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson far extended corporate restructuring support. believes delayed travel restrictions mean many companies would otherwise extremely difficult may really good summer.



Entrepreneurs also critical support designed. According rules, companies compensated 75 percent turnover loss cover fixed costs rent, electricity insurance. two months apply, Patrick Krass√©n believes far short time. Partly documentation must produced partly auditor must hired support excess SEK 100,000 turn must also certify documentation correct. Finding accountant, Krass√©n sees potential problem many vacation full time companies' annual reports.

However, Johan Kreicbergs, business economist Swedish Confederation Businesses, critical another aspect transition support. Since support based much revenue falls March April compared period last year, start-ups fall chairs.

Johan Kreicbergs calculated much state's various aid decrease summer unless government extends various support programs. According data, median company able receive maximum 65 percent costs April. August, figure 40 percent unless reduction employers' tax extended government time adheres plan make rules short-term permits less generous later summer.


Erik Sj√∂lander, business policy spokesperson Swedish Confederation Swedish Enterprises, describes transition support shot foot.


Among things, critical government facing so-called ""restructuring support crime"", means companies submitted incorrect information Swedish Tax Agency risk six years prison.

- large companies afford lawyer already accountant help right thing. little ones huge danger afraid may get bang afterwards Swedish Tax Agency examines this, says Erik Sj√∂lander.


Sj√∂lander know anyone seeks support would recommend either.


""It surrounded much uncertainty insecurity,"" says.


The sound engineer Anders Nyberg wait possibly apply restructuring support sees things going others. Nyberg lucky get back huge slant tax year. still live smart. even difficult government extend restructuring aid.


- Obviously, really affects lot receive kind grant. day money runs out, says Anders Nyberg.


Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson (S) tells SvD monitoring developments closely exclude anything present, including extension transition support summer.


But emphasizes prospects brightened many companies following authorities' decision lift restrictions domestic travel.

- domestic travel released, many companies would otherwise extremely difficult manage summer now, perhaps contrary, really good summer, says Magdalena Andersson.

The self-employed Anders Nyberg seen company's turnover fall 95 percent since corona crisis 

Finance Minister Magdalena Andersson far extended corporate restructuring support. believes delayed travel restrictions mean many companies would otherwise extremely difficult may really good summer.

Johan Kreicbergs, business economist Swedish business community, afraid many jobs lost government extend sales support companies. scary part is, don‚Äôt know masks even make difference plane. It‚Äôs tightly packed confined space. you‚Äôre sharing space hours time. every passenger crew member wears mask, enough? prevent super spreader incidents? got ""properly funded"" nursing home money? That's part problem.

Child care another ""just cheap go"" situation. Administrators faculty unprepared move classes online, absurd. schools prepared bring students back onto campus. I've sat many virtual meetings administration various schools across US, one prepared. They're prepared shut things first sign outbreak, they're also relying upon students stay campus weekends, stay dorms classes session. unrealistic, they're primarily concerned tuition, housing, meal plan fees declining. 0 deaths Netherlands today. good news! Lmao osha üòÇ Calling experiment already showing bias even get article Vaccines provoke immune response body knows fight virus future. 

Some vaccines experimentation literally micro doses COVID. 

Herd immunity achieved mass infection mass vaccination works enough people cannot viable hosts virus.

So herd immunity exposing enough people‚Äôs‚Äô immune systems virus cannot find anymore viable hosts extant copies decompose replicating.

If people‚Äôs immune systems allow infected once, whether it‚Äôs natural infection artificial one like vaccine, I‚Äôm sure ever achieve herd immunity. true, good point! 

And Sweden currently Nordic country says expecting [second Everyone else region says expect small cluster outbreaks contained. quite ironic Sweden chose herd immunity avoid second wave, one thinks one. may responsible accurate statement. experts say we're still first wave. I'll keep open mind try research need to. find works better following popular Reddit opinion. Oh god, name üòÇ wife 5G conspiracy theorists seems like they‚Äôre good match sure Panama,the Bahamas, Liberia Marshall Islands top it. top Flags Convenience (as 2009) sure throwing massive political industrial muscle behind efforts help crews.

All jokes aside happy Australia kicked cruise ships Australian territorial waters. cruise ships want leave Australia like: sorry, pay taxes here, going help you. Fuck off. start seeing spikes next 7-10 days? Great still probably big companies government dumping large quantities ocean like always. oceans polluted long time now. forget island trash pacific ocean.... granted hough adds it.  That's much difference epidemiological times. Yeah, guess death great alternative. ... already discredited moron...  Amsterdam well. 

There people give shit distancing, many do, see people (myself included) moving opposite sides sidewalk walking towards other. see people keeping distance waiting line. see people staying far away possible trains. Prove it.

Oh wait can't high positive level means enough testing done. disappear like magic! /s Fun fact: around [33k deaths firearms USA 100k every three years. 

[The Drug War Mexico took 10 years kill amount Yes nightly news reports percentage probably covid-19 related tested based actuarial deltas ""normal"" deaths expected. see 1 2 masks whole group. Gross. possible moving much since past 3+ months shallow breathing desks? experience lifted random heavy stuff home 15 - 20 minutes breathing normal.

People telling go get xray good advice personally want near hospital times. Yes can. Viruses fail mutate quicker humans develop immunity weaken... quite opposite opinion. think country handled things well considering circumstances, exception long-term care homes (which seemed get hit hard pretty much every country). hospitals overrun hospitals around area basically ghost town throughout pandemic. expected Canada capable exterminating virus, think expectations little high.

The city live 4 active cases virus 2 deaths entirety pandemic (one took months decide whether call Covid Death due causes, I'm fairly certain person living point). I'm sure could say done good job results? Thanks, that‚Äôs I‚Äôve come expect telegraph. Foxnews banned source subreddit. treat Fox News way treat Onion, searching scientific facts... absolute tracking methods, contract tracing app [cannot used track corresponding uptick deaths though? Cases flat weeks trending upward week, theres steady decline deaths since mid April. 

Has treatment virus improved much? finding mild cases previously? states accurate/forward reporting fatalities? [Most Americans overwhelmingly back continued lockdown measures, even they‚Äôve lost major income pandemic. polling unambiguous. April, Gallup reported low-income adults still likely fear illness COVID-19 financial hardship, already become acute. Later month, IPSOS poll found high-income households 14 countries surveyed, including U.S., mostly likely average support economic reopening. poorer household, less likely respondent agree states also astro turfing. already post still carrier could pass others though, no? Wearing mask 100% safety. think disgusting Cuomo forced nursing homes accept Covid patients.

Otherwise, think response pretty good. 

I believe blind allegiance political party politician. use critical thinking skills, know concept lost many. time shore fundamentals like testing capacity. story [another people unable get tested Phoenix infuriating! numbers numbers given us.

Ghana: population 29.77 million (2018)
14k confirmed cases 
10,473 recovered cases
85 deaths

Netherlands: population 17.28 (2019)
49,593 confirmed cases
Recovered (unknown)
Deaths 6,090

I google search find information I‚Äôm write paper this.

So data given ( true) Ghana almost double population 0.74% reported deaths.( maths correct)

(I chose deaths it‚Äôs lot harder impossible underreport deaths)

Now know could underreported numbers truly know whole pandemic 135.3% deaths certainly something interesting fake. may semi-anecdotal, worth, friend attends law school NYC campus ListServe circulated several emails protest safely. One consistent points tell health provider protesting. can't tell effect statistics kind message, tell fact circulated. Trusting Google first mistake. feel second part important don‚Äôt see government relocking whole areas, least states WTF WRONG THEM

WHYYYY NYC got test City MD. free. negative. Took 45 minutes. little late that? almost like people want acknowledge happening. get - they're scared means reopening plans. reality take seriously nagging problem far longer. still baffles people pressuring power mass test dense areas. That's really solution isolate thing. must going deep enough Reddit see comments, saw anyone feed trying spread dangerous misinformation like this, they'd unfollowed. Yes, tech using things intentionally used here. Except I'm currently taking care demented parent 24/7 started dementing early 60s, parents took care demented parent till death 90 years ago. 

Now could since lot brothers sisters spouses. People 90 going 20 years. Generally phase describe 24/7 care much, much shorter.

And due little siblings point parent law going go home institution. far kept home years. real chance they'll die home quick hospital stay due general health situation. things mask virus keeping making others sick whereas fast food going make someone else fat eating poorly.

One harms others harms yourself. great. want five percent ideally want close zero possible. comparison, positive rate states:

* Illinois - 3.9 percent
* New York - 1 percent
* California - 4.8 percent
* Texas - 10.3 percent
* Florida - 11.4 percent
* Arizona - 20.4 percent 

It could much worse. testing limited NY experiencing surge cases, positive rate reached 50.7 percent. reason 10 percent concern testing much readily available fact percentage increasing instead decreasing. sure they'd easier spot brain-dead Americans. think put together decent post political guess - though, aligns sub's close-minded illusion political division.

Cheers fair, months starting reverting easing predicted Ireland well. I‚Äôm really, Tuesday picks weekend numbers. ... 4 months heavy politicization excellent article describes exactly horrible idea I‚Äôll sure share find idiots.

People claimed herd immunity best strategy India population young controlling virus would difficult. Well guess what? functioning healthcare Delhi led children dying treatable illnesses women dying childbirth. outbreak would even worse right didn‚Äôt much could stop virus instead encouraged people go lives think virus big deal see (slightly) 99% survival rate ignore horrors places hit hard through. finally deciding today unsubscribe subreddit. understand people wanna stay I‚Äôm ready tune much constant fear mongering move life (while still reckless bc virus isn‚Äôt 100% gone). wave magic wand around make food farms made! Genius! Thank God. Europe longer epicenter COVID-19 deaths Europe gone lower. killed economy almost 4 months get things control 

They killed low end service economy 3 months dick around nothing spin machine ramped call ""just flu"" despite happened NYC back first week march southern states. Literally everyone know said ‚Äúoh heat kills it, safe AZ‚Äù how‚Äôs working you?? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è apparently clinical trials read comment spanglish voice prepared disclaimer realize world counts increasing virus reaching countries populations before. Italy one first countries infected provides good evidence virus interacts humans time (e.g., months exposure vs. initial weeks exposure). Damn thats interesting. tell something else already know? somebody run years? Here's one chew on:  wait update then... So, I‚Äôm hearing seeing lot posts people suffering long-term-effects disease. I‚Äôm interested sort randomized sampling people confirmed mild/asymptomatic cases see percentage reported long-term problems weeks/months line. think that‚Äôs important thing consider, actual mathematical risk complications recovered patient is, open things Mmm.  really good mask, *are* difficult breathe in.  breathing home mask?

Also, allergy problems year, get desensitisation shots allergy specialist.  Cost AU$600 up, completely life changing. Brief summary article can't access article. tried condense important information:

As workplaces open up, Canadians faced challenge going back work told months dangerous. Provinces Canada laws people refuse unsafe dangerous work. data work refusals reported provincial labour authorities shows there's spike number people formally refused work citing dangerous conditions. However, provinces open general fear contracting COVID-19 enough justify work refusal, neither risks associated travelling to-and-from work, illustrating challenges Canadians face balance exposure virus getting back office factory floor. You‚Äôre going come home insult people read headlines?!? Yep, seem good countries I'm following personally like format use. seem use consistently good sources. Isn‚Äôt expected tho? Isn‚Äôt something knew gonna happen everything opened back up? Anti science sentiment control. That's really solid auto loan rate. experience credit unions pay staff well level, including sales people. banking, tons people getting rich - moreso others.

I take home right around $1150 paycheck. bi-weekly. jails/prisons are. track you. opt regulated well, tracks you.

Saying make true. 

Yes, Google tracking users Google Maps apps, [NOT CONTRACT TRACING APP. insist ""no, must somehow using track people"" point admission actually interested learning works. looks country starting reopen soon. best strategy world. would happen? /s Preach! Easily. Yeah morning half people train masks, chin... real point nobody checks enforces Reading another study Scripps, anecdotal, seeing damage CT scans. looking disease spreads role asymmetric people, realized lung damage issue. CVS testing locations neighborhood. But[ another Phoenix says people city can't get appointments testing CVS. confirm. dad master's aeronautical engineering also racist. Loves orange says flu. ""riots"" important story. Also 99% protests 1% riots, calling riots? Sounds like narrative push.  isn‚Äôt going take long average, aggressive best funded vaccine push ever trying spark fear question answered? virus ever leave body? something life long like viruses (HIV, Hepatitis B)? spike protein said similar spike protein found HIV. concern life long virus random flair ups. Newsom said won‚Äôt pushing enforcement new mask order. Snorlax, info collect phones remains phone. info contains randomly created numbers phones. numbers never tracked back phones.

If get infected agree, collected numbers past two weeks uploaded database. users download contents database twice day. phone checks numbers there. so, means exposed app suggests next.

No tracking, tracing, contacting takes place. Neither Google, Apple, government knows numbers belong to. damn. prices low august cruise US hospitals capacity, rises cases really bad? way thought it, flatter curve, longer pandemic goes on. handle peak seems like worst case? Jesus fucking Christ, like willing type fucking book report criticizing one source type 5 words google.

Yes, course question credibility, unlike actually live Sweden speak Swedish makes easy see bullshit. Regarding thing narrative Copenhagen clue talking (doubt give fuck itj) read Sydsvenskan. first hurdle.

The second make sure safe given situations surrounding development:

Like huge conflicts similar east TN. Knoxville managed avoid big spike (at least rural hospitals run space start filling hospitals instead), Smokies open, Dollywood re-opening, twin tourist traps Pigeon Forge Gatlinburg open encouraging people locked-down areas come let steam, big crowds wearing masks, cases spiking Sevier county. seen data people elsewhere contracting disease Sevier TN tracks cases residents residing certain county even local mayors complaining getting better data state. know economy areas entirely driven tourism goodness, re-opening free right way handle things! think way living. recently read article Korean people habitats. source article sure read:

According article Korean Japanese people go restaurant half filled reason. go quieter place. even Corona restaurants half empty anyways. could slowed spread. 

Again know article wrong know places never there. Probably let people America. üòì mean small kids, temp screening actually proven effective? things normally lots signings right? can‚Äôt imagine many actors, voice actors, artists, etc aren‚Äôt Florida wanting sit inside lines people (likely wearing masks) coming them. old normal thing past, accept 

Just hope live music doesnt die dystopian worlds. 

And administrators lay first 

Colleges stop admitting 80% applicants downsize. make degrees valuable 50 percent people college wouldnt wasnt aggressively marketed teenagers R basically ratio newly confirmed detections time yesterday 5 days ago, relative detections 5 days ago 9 days ago. think 4 day wide ranges, could also 3. 

So 44 infections 11th 14th, 66 infections 15th 18th, 19th R = 66 / 44 = 1.5

R becomes jumpy unstable low infections counts, well known. Germany 100 200 infections per day entire country now. T√∂nnies, couple days 1000 infections location get added. course causes immediate explosion calculated value. 
If widespread secondary infections found, couple days 300-400 T√∂nnies days first range, 100-200 infections second, R drop 0.3 without anything really changing much. wish could start sub reddit called asshats united. would put asshattin comments people make could laugh... would NEVER prioritize job health life.

must nice kind financial security. already have. death rate continuing decrease week week, quite substantially fact.  New Cases &amp; Deaths decoupled month - take look graphs each. 

New Cases steady since May 10th slight increase lately, Deaths gradually falling (albeit weirdo weekly pattern) throughout time period. Mira Costa top 5% school 98% graduation rate. 90% students go college technical training. hard accept high school graduation cancelled year? great achievement last stop train almost everyone attended..  Well, know eating unhealthy, smoking bad long term. It'll cause breath quicker. It'll diminish sense taste. It'll suck joy life always thinking next sigaret. smell bad. mind (or experience) that, guest, life all. 

I'm saying, take away quantity life, potentially quality too. I'd rather live quality euthanise that's gone slowly loose quality demise. TIL viruses care political agendas. Yikes. Looks like it‚Äôs going tough week Sweden planes work. Planes dont recycle air. continously vent repressurize air.

Doesn't really help much person next contagious... people rows away pretty safe. Wait, they're considering based single daily spike? prudent wait see actual trend? Sure there's common ground. called science. least used be.

But scientific it. can't keep hiding behind vague proclamations doom moving goalposts claiming conspiracy results meet narrative.

People screaming increase cases 2 weeks saying lead surge deaths. DeSantis Abbott saying won't. 

When think see increase deaths? That's rhetorical question. 1 week? 2 weeks? many deaths?

If comfortable hypothesis (i.e. lack social distancing Texas Florida leading second wave disease lead deaths similar saw New York New Jersey), fucking say so.

I'm comfortable mine (i.e. surge cases merely reflects increased testing non-vulnerable populations, virus prevalent community see significant increase deaths either Texas Florida).

Otherwise, admit interested science another political hack like posters forum. Nope, clearly result strategy. Norway Denmark also abandoned stockpiles neither major PPE shortages becuase relatively low burden COVID placed healthcare systems. relatively low burden result different strategy re: coronavirus. nations scramble find protective gear fight coronavirus pandemic, Finland sitting enviable stockpile personal protective equipment like surgical masks, putting ahead less-prepared Nordic stockpile, considered one Europe‚Äôs best built years, includes medical supplies, also oil, grains, agricultural tools raw materials make ammunition. Norway, Sweden Denmark also amassed large stockpiles medical military equipment, fuel food Cold War era. Later, abandoned dramatic increase number deaths would believe so. anything country much troubled increase fatal car accidents caused drunk driving. &lt; 2 weeks already? Shit! right repatriation sole responsibility port vessel calling ...

Having read MLC see part mentions ports responsibility. see ship owner responsible. point clause mentions ports responsibility? Might well introduce new flair ""Just wait 2 weeks"" crowd. always collective wisdom.

I agree lots *individual* works wisdom. *collective* wisdom, people. say, insatiable thirst progress, odds kind unity purpose required collective wisdom unless happens serve altar growth. FWIW, lifelong best friend says exact things does.

At moment, I've muted social media answered calls hang out. I'm super paranoid COVID, everything closed think best. said, similar pressures exist little upvotes? great news Long press sometimes double tap, weird eventually work Oooh, might new trend. Can't wait see runway. lol. one hardest years life. I'm psychiatric hospital, nothing short miracle maybe underestimated will. 

Life getting better virus hit. Even 4 year old son, special needs child got affected deeply. progressing well school sort set back. Now, knows even send back school September. already going start distance learning summer school July son capable sitting still two hours day, 5 days week. supervise every time would twice week sessions teachers online. Thankfully, school understanding they're forcing attend. 

Probably also help lost grandpa virus basically lied nursing home. found COVID day found dead bed, obviously means one bothered checking prior that. uncle contemplating lawsuit doubt it'll get anywhere. 

Oh, mention mother RN front line? really went peak virus state. Everyday, someone dying three work colleagues also succumbed virus. PTSD result can't really anything keep working. however plan seek therapy. Thankfully, one died job weeks current patients fully recovering. 

That top issues well take forever mention, roller-coaster wish badly get already! Locking entire countries unprecedented history. trust anything dumpster fire alone. Shit, post inflammatory BS, disgust doom obsessed parroting goes daily basis. Moving up.

Check cases per million state, see surprises top along usual candidates wish could downvote Yeah, exponents don‚Äôt work low baselines Maine okay.

I‚Äôm going lobster August staying family hopefully math logic stops bad people say. people start talking random people. think chancellor described quite nicely: already contact tracing system place. Every city local health authority (Gesundheitsamt) contact tracing infectious diseases. cases contact tracing kids head lice schools. Corona, simply put manpower existing contact tracing teams Every single thread current spikes genius chimes ‚Äúhey guys remember predictions less? Well it‚Äôs that!‚Äù 

Do guys sign sheet? like round robin thing? decide gets honor making useless comment? wear xray photo lungs face. Boom solved. created equally. Michigan listed one states they've largely controlled outbreak. peaked 1800 cases day, lowest pandemic 74 last week, days 200 150 yesterday. Delaware weird story. Super inconsistent testing 50-100 cases last days. really increase. Montana almost certainly lack testing. They've 0-2 cases April made way 32 cases 19 cases last two days.

My point increases California, Florida, Arizona levels.  Korea clamp hard. They're good wearing masks Everland, big theme park never shut bars restaurants still open although lot bars closed. definitely lockdown place they're strict quarantine. 

I think must something else well. Maybe tracking. few?

There never national lockdown... Lol  Thank fucking god. Tho, I‚Äôm afraid won‚Äôt last üò¢ fool! USA deaths lag week behind cases cases spiking last week (Memorial Day) means deaths start spiking week. Burpees LUNGes Good choice words worry, 4th July around corner That‚Äôs how‚Äôs it‚Äôs pretty much always US. you‚Äôll see fewer numbers Monday &amp; Tuesday many people get tests weekends. There‚Äôs little correlation deaths positive cases point US. Deaths spike starting week. people Amsterdam give fuck anymore. Supermarkets even clean baskets shit idk what's going Fords idiot, everyone knows aren‚Äôt sitting around waiting idiot tell us do. Everywhere go people wearing masks, I‚Äôd say 90% least. missed point. going supporting businesses adhere safety. ton take well buy local. bit willing mask extend problem. Businesses end close year. countries contained virus getting back building economies. behind due people like you. One big fears Trump try pump fully unvetted vaccine election cause harm give anti-vaxx people bunch ammunition. Software engineer here: time high school amazing, sometimes miss lack responsibility free time.

I used work department store mostly stood around chatted employees. I'm basically call 24/7 call center goes expected figure what's wrong fix problem right away else bunch agents sitting around nothing potentially breaking uptime agreements (SLAs) clients, costing company serious money.

I even know anything phone systems two years ago, inherited job people quit. Still promoted either (and never will, thanks pandemic making already struggling company even worse shape). consistent, across board, legal assisted suicide policy would help. remember assisted suicide national debate 90‚Äôs Bible thumpers went nuts. 

I currently 500 miles home week 3 watching mother slowly die hospice. brain bleed big enough kill big enough ensure life anywhere near would ever want. per expressed, written often stated wishes heavily medicated around clock drying dehydration. 

This humane. anyone else. pretend we‚Äôre passively murdering someone it‚Äôs, paper, OT breaking law. 

To assisted suicide, here‚Äôs thought. want want die slow, terrible death, go it. cool respecting people‚Äôs wishes letting choose want check out?

I‚Äôm Pix. get home I‚Äôm buying gun. That‚Äôs going plan last resort comes it. shelved President, pretty much allowed speak publicly unless fall line denial. far fallen Administration. We're looking impending surge disability applications Social Security system soon close insolvency. Europe can't fire someone calling sick. Calling sick may result loss pay though hourly workers. they're paid much might factor. 

Most countries safety nets place people feel need go work sick COVID though. Also Maine, I‚Äôm agreement assessment. live Hancock County (Acadia National Park) one reported COVID death not-so-close acquaintance. Bar Harbor still quiet (anecdotally, don‚Äôt go much), I‚Äôm surprised didn‚Äôt see uptick Memorial Day‚Äôs limited openings. things pick July real test. 

I‚Äôd also attribute success we‚Äôve seen far Governor team Maine CDC, especially southern part state. Here, it‚Äôs rural habits fairly socially distant nature, I‚Äôd say impact closures less measurable, detriment. really wish knee-jerk reaction ‚Äúsee? It‚Äôs bad here/coming here‚Äù lot quieter people would give credit comparatively low numbers shutting did. also grapple daily people think could come March it‚Äôs it‚Äôs summer. 

That said, there‚Äôs still much political pressure actively enforce mask mandate state quarantine requirement. believe large stores (Home Depot/Walmart/Grocery) longer limiting capacity social distancing masking seems suggestion (only indicated signage) anything. public interaction I‚Äôve complete confidence local burrito shop (Phone orders/payment required, strict mask social distance policy pickup). honestly believe first wave still come Maine, also think I‚Äôm minority believing this. Well, that's quite selfish borderline racist 1 person wearing mask. BLM protests 99% wear least. Yeah that¬¥s something people talking about. Studies say 3 8 months immunity means probably kind flu shot, take time time. Upvote asshat comment. love word use daily wife üòÜ could even worse US. worst world least forces slight attention it. Us stops worst, used victory government show things getting better. could great thing. southern state establishing precedent ""liberal"" virus. bad noone could predicted this. Noone all. Ever. Herd immunity dumb gamble. People actually downvoting post heartless think way deal virus deliberately give everyone earth. I‚Äôm sure similar attitudes towards Nazism well.

In case emphasize Norway - neighbors seem perused plan pretending virus doesn‚Äôt exist I‚Äôve make limitations ability citizens come contact theirs, calmly watching keen eye eventual decline, somewhat guilty plans profit one day. ugly place.. Maybe think. spreads droplets, respiratory digestive. Outdoor spaces much much much safer indoor. Stores, gas stations, kind travel hub, restaurants/bars/cafes/clubs etc, schools, offices hospitals spreads efficiently.

Nobody gathering together closely possible protests BLM organisers largely encouraging people wear masks, keep distance. places every aspect people's lives consistently ignoring risk see earliest strongest resurgence. No, people need earn money that. government could put measures place suspend rents, could provide food, giving everyone UBI. choice.

You need earn money order government bail responsibility. That's all. Yes, people would get sick, ""doctors"" would bleed then, making body much weaker &amp; sicker.  hate group projects. never assign one again. clicked, envisioned coming together, protesting racial inequality, end would graduation thing. relatively safe ways outdoors.

Instead, bunch rich white kids:

* Exploited issues racial inequality
* close proximity/squished together
* masks
* Hugging cheering
* Seem oblivious bad looks

If kid went I'd furious. Lmao wow people stupid can't believe people using plastic 100% time reading fine made put mask. answer whataboutism? 

You american right? seem obsessed Sweden. Don‚Äôt problems closer home needs attention?

There currently 11 US states higher per capita death toll Sweden, four double. number climbing steadily. account fact Sweden report among worlds accurate death toll US likely report death rate. example, NYS report triple per capita death rate Sweden catch 84% excess fatality rate (Sweden catch 101%). 

You like paint Sweden massive failure Sweden much better New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Louisiana, Michigan, Illinois, Maryland Pennsylvania? many states think worse Sweden over? glad sexual abuse thing isnt happening you. Shit crazy days. deep situation without heart. Keep keeping dude. internet back. like peak gov't hypocrisy. absolutely retarded trust government covered thing 6 weeks start. really trust government, they're authoritarian easy lie. However western country like US better piece crap known CCP. confirmed one strain? guy right. Qatar gets away modern day indentured servitude nobody bats eye. banned couple weeks, sure exact reason. Okay, propose a, say, child lives apartment take care surviving parent middle-stages alzheimers, poor mobility? number saw study already took account differences population density, well factors like contagious virus (and one happens high). double booking it, incorrect.

Anyway, theoretical. reality can't infect 85% population people literally hide 1-2 years avoid infected vaccine available. even actively try can't get there. mention serious moral implications willingly killing innocent people. People western nations get incredibly weak confused now, point kind home care, individual communal often non-viable. Covid discriminate based whether lawn not. recall steroids used China SARS outbreak found seem lessen acute symptoms causes long term problems patient recover compared control group.

In fact, Zhong Nanshan adamant start outbreak steroids used treating COVID-19, based heavy involvement SARS outbreak. considers usage steroid mistake circumstances attempted again. Asymptotic presymptomatic well‚Ä¶ stage start self quarantining? I'm teenager slightly average physique started slight fever morning. I'm also getting chills maybe stomach discomfort I'm coughing. extra careful self quarantine anyway?

I'm sure condition body since havent checkup ages. bmi healthy lower stamina, due unknown reasons. Sorry info dump, I'd rather ask endanger family. social pressure lol, US thing. Like many people said, can‚Äôt live safely min wage. Face mask easy equipment. sure people can't wear it. cause discomfort nuisance wear avoid potential risk. understand reluctance. 

In India people educated literate rest world see 90% ( even more) people wearing masks atleast hand kerchief can't afford mask. Stating opinion. live Qatar, mask compliance good. I've seen people wearing walking alone police bothers them. Really high fine used really make people think serious take seriously, rather actually charge people walking outside house alone. make difference Australia. wear glasses, wrap elastic around behind ears part glasses. grew rich white town U.S. exactly kind thing would done. nothing BLM. white rich rules apply people police police people. poor majority black school tried would subject complaints, threats, potential prosecution police harassment / overpolicing. folks white, rich, want graduation party, took loophole police everyone else know exactly what's going closed eyes it. meant whole virus annoying, don‚Äôt mind careful I'm 19 want life back. miss attending college, want try new hobbies unable done lockdown, want go gym, want get job, want meet people make friends start dating. I'm sick shit depression coming back slowly. talked anyone months im getting extremely angry bitter.

It's getting point I'm happy seeing other's suffer vain hope forced open everything back again. Many die I'm done this. kill keeps up, wanted happy first time fucking years stupid Chinese pandemic comes nowhere disgusting government prideful admit fucked up. mention U.S government handling situation complete joke. FUCK MAN need shame can't know everything, stop learning. Thailand full military dictatorship; authoritarian comes... want lock down, they're gonna lock down. DUI isnt something make struggle hard like Covid. little bit different. Also, everyone seems forget this, medically underserved community. look different rates death childbirth see underserved is. Look online forget heard Powerful story. gather stories I'd seen yet. reinforcing conservative approach (mask, restaurants yet) etc. shall bookmark take days reading much come back people arguing big deal cases up, Hospitalizations up, icu admissions up, everything fine death up.


Yet. scientists? cheaper put elderly retirement house care home. individualism ruins idea caring aging parents. Bullshit. know megathread r/Sweden one extreme supporters governments policy roaming sub. 

And making unfounded claims question credibility. absolutely disgraceful way debating issue. perfect example supporters Swedish strategy deal opposition arguments left. 

How backup claim showing us Swedish articles correcting false narrative Copenhagen dangerous Malm√∂? 

I pretty convinced can‚Äôt find one Sydsvenskan 2-3 days ago. obvious false claim month. wouldn‚Äôt caught like probably 100s bars Source? Wrap strings ear loops something slightly bigger spread pressure grew rich white town U.S. exactly kind thing would done. nothing BLM. white rich rules apply people police police people. poor majority black school tried would subject complaints, threats, potential prosecution police harassment / overpolicing. there's folks white, rich, want graduation, took loophole police everyone else know exactly what's going closed eyes it. Seattle Tampa worlds apart terms governors mayors. Seattle comiccon everything locking down. everything opening up. pretty sure Seattle con would cancelled. I'm pretty sure Tampa con go through. burns like SARS viruses or....any pandemic....well herd immunity. 

And everyone forget vaccines scheduled deployment October year? doesn‚Äôt fit narrative two years lockdown. Shit hit fan much earlier EU. US done bad EU, faster. Big part play those... can't say mods erase *ol*ti*s even though tightly related coronavir spikes, lol. went outside crowds bad timing care this. say blame folks they‚Äôre blame. Seems simple. Younger people getting actually doubleplusungood means higher potential spread. Younger people go concerts, champions league matches (that Italy), jobs, etc. Much higher chance superspreading events. I've read comments news article entitlement _unreal_, yo. deserved graduation disrespecting BLM, used name skirt around rules, like _bad people_! planned wear masks, she.thst lot kids conveniently forgot them. crazy thought reading troll. like reading letter dad rapist Brock Turner again. like democratic hoax. new hoax. tldr virus getting weaker reverse self selection

In 1918 worst cases soldiers overseas z brought US treatment us cases multiplied worst strains.


If sickest people go hospital weakest stains multiply public would protect people worst ones. virus getting weaker (unless worst strain dies out) overshadowed weaker strains grow faster Blame media

I still think individual accountability thing.

In rural Canadian community see two big things:

[1] young people think big deal, invincible, bother rules / suggestions. still give hugs greeting.

[2] older people tired lockdown, get used season gradually ignore social distancing. I'm sort losing faith people following rules. might take seriously unless enforcement know person dies . understand admire approach. need let affect already are. flatmate believes caused 5g can't give one solid fact prove it. 33 year old male. thing current government raking! Raking money, precise. Royal Bank New Zealand estimate NZ economy function 97% normal economic output rest 2020 long stay Level 1 (our current lowest level). critical catch cases border. low population rapidly catching change person gets sick. People strange thought process ""I can't imagine feels personal level, can't happen me"". number anecdotal stories I've seen reddit people friends/family thought hoax right got sick, minds changed. entire room around could fire they'll think everything fine skin starts charring. begin understand [what vaccine actually see short timelines quite optimistic. danger reopening lies different stages 'fighting' virus across different countries. one country might okay, absolutely natural want return situation close approximation 'normal' COVID. However, reopening might draw folks countries control yet.

As European citizen, fear moment EU decides open borders USA / Brazil  keep wondering, person gives door greeter hard time, register folks refuse ring up? arrest shoplifting whole lot easier folks understand reprimand mask wearing. lungs brave. place doomer central beginning expect endless downvotes say anything Millions deaths! Bodies streets!!! read [Italian doctor virus weaker now, think important look % deaths/hospitalizations. (simple) report this? if, if, if.... icu rates increasing states increasing cases? people covid spend fifteen days there? icu lead death many people?

Idk virus stronger weaker mutating check parts equation, one Bingo. Pence passed buck straight insurance company meeting executives March. made 'promise' 'cover' testing (no co-pay mentioned, actual healthcare costs beyond testing), instead devoting $2T budget towards federal testing procedures. 

At meeting, Pence completely hosed insurance companies passing buck (quite literally) them. buck, current U.S. healthcare structure, ultimately passed consumers (bigly). People aren‚Äôt still responsible whole, needs collective effort. government isn‚Äôt responsible either. people sacrificing *should* angry this. Meanwhile , author months ago published article NPR evidence show (cloth masks) benefit, research suggests¬†they ""may actually harmful,"" American article Sweden actually holds decent quality without usual sensationalism? course downvoted. Media careful critical

lol inevitable. sure limitations ICU, nature virus vaccine found. yes, that's nobody's fault sad incident nature. What, Beijing heavy movement restriction. Something like 21 districts wartime closed management. Taxi ride share forbidden leave city. Air traffic reduced 60% people leaving Beijing airport must negative PCR test result done 7 days earlier date departure.

There's shit load measure taken Beijing, one step short ""bulldozing roads out"" style Wuhan lockdown. Good source data agree said, believe freedom merely numbers data. Everyone definition 'freedom' ""you judge kind thing"". assure visit low scoring country like Qatar might surprised outgoing actually is. again, everyone opinion great source! Kind - herd immunity mental strategy go it‚Äôs quite bleak that; would need 85% population 100% threat one time, reality they‚Äôre 

Some particular rural areas functionally immune virus virtue natural social distancing, city areas, virus tear tightly packed areas quickly, hits effectively localised herd immunity dies able find new hosts, best seen areas like London New York; densely populated areas spiked quickly plummeted far faster surrounding areas Sunday holiday? Government would need provide food supplies all, wuhan lockdown all. gonna happen anywhere matter happen everywhere 


So yeah, vaccine best hope now. Yep ***Gross though, recently found co-worker COVID, spent weekend trying take test.***

""I called CVS cannot get appointment,"" said. ""I transportation, I'm able get somewhere. means pay test, required. One way another can't get test."" Compare Germany Canada much better us. can‚Äôt even provide healthcare do, one fact makes US significantly worse live in. small numbers sudden spike many cases (T√∂nnies) lead high R. Nothing surprising. local aswell, therefore relatively easy contain threatening country whole We‚Äôll one October. already large scale efficacy trials. 

Or listen doomers we‚Äôll never get one take years. sorry loss. 

If want better data, look excess mortality neck woods. Keep getting mad 1984 vibes slowly running icu beds? Least checked, beyond ones never icu beds, fifteen counties run out. overall percentage keeps growing plan fix Propping stock market EXPENSIVE! agree, might second waves even third waves idea nation point. Makes sense, cases hovering around 250 cases last 1.5 weeks sudden spike 800 cases happen. Simple mathematics right, deaths going down.... hospital icu rates going sky high states increases cases. That's cases matter mean countries actually something fight it? Novel idea US pretty obvious following Swedish media. say going use it! didn‚Äôt say that, act like Sweden doomed pointless Blame ""peaceful protests"", virus cancelled left. Sure, i'm gambling person. I'm VA logic pretty crazy. Liberty refused shut people calling commendable wanted get back normal quick. pretending everything okay somehow way fight it. protests riots. important stop spread virus already killed six figures Americans. exact way Nashville. Also, still tourists lining street like nothing happening, I‚Äôm sure playing huge part spike cases. Oh God someone save us bachelorette parties. Keep positive work Arnie. trump suggests travel ban...all reports he‚Äôs racist. Xenophobic. applicable name think of. Smh. That's good point. That's actually really really good point. African nations tend much much younger population along less obese population. That's good news atleast take root cause much damage. I've worked industry. think places simply fire people like, try working ""agricultural"" place, legal not, happens time. think employees money fight stuff like that? think organizations follow up, places keep paperwork such? Nah, I've known plenty people get shafted fucked over. personally fired directly getting work injury coming workers comp, despite wanting work, opting go extra 200$ ""free"" money month (I lasting damage all, something ""pop up"" later either). People symptomatic likely spread illness compared asymptomatic people, even testing done White House everyday. Dumb move. it'll ""See, even work"" one things remain ""true"" sudden find data stolen / sold / tracked anyways.

Even happened, [the data can't used track guys pay put new tariffs. China told us came Wuhan seafood market. 3 months China reported world virus emerge, incurred 30,000 deaths, US incurs 100,000 deaths 2 months China disease spread US entirely. China told us children can't get infected virus. China told us 80% infected see mild symptoms (cough, slight fever). China told us control leave China. WHO, funded China, kept calling spread instead Pandemic (which early February) need concerned. call Pandemic sometime March, countries world outbreaks. WHO, claimed March could still contained. 


China known lie us several occasions. fact keep buying ""studies"" beyond ridiculous. like getting facts known liar.

The way we'll know data good process control methods measure. Right now, questioning data China provided us? internet general makes really easy find belief bubble. belief bubble really hard break read opposing opinions. Yesterday's count 50% higher previous record Sunday - set week ago. ... parents send kid knowing that, tell you? world reopened school without spike cases. Seems like would something give another week, no? international protests take bit get full steam compared US? goes California, least sane counties. Even I'm lecturing, try avoid, I'm best 5 feet away front row students I'll bite. Why? almost 9 k dead almost 200k cases. u compare us shitholes like US/UK look great.
If u compare us RoK Asian nations terrible job. govt taken seriously could beaten w/o lockdown.

As hcw, followed since Jan 7 greatest danger relative 'success' people becoming overconfident. Thing killing young people pre-existing conditions, even weight. many older people conditions still can't categorize deaths ""weak"". Sounds like great time open Disney parks.! pessimistic? You‚Äôre probably person saying millions would die couple months ago... refuse actually think optimistically Okay, hope say happens  Pretty much everywhere around requires masks. smaller stores one day line guy goes, ""Look us masks!"" positive way. live Vermont rules strict results positive. come factually can‚Äôt swept rug. Empty, hateful platitudes current form debate, especially internet. hard facts back position, it‚Äôs downvote run. Doesn‚Äôt bother slightest. Closing border putting restrictions place definitely worked maritime provinces. probably helps less people coming us general. 4 cases left maybe? Nova Scotia 9 days without new cases. fucking true. never gotten quite strait answer immunotherapy melanoma covid.

pros say deadly combo course little real world evidence.

i practice extreme SD Sorry hands got dirty that, good moments. yes, NZ continued flattening curve. one things remain ""true"" sudden find data stolen / sold / tracked anyways.

The people talking back history kind thing, actual product - right so! come close contact president vice president still temperature checked questioned symptoms, steps longer taken others enter White House campus, said spokesman Judd Deere. Tents manned past month staffers thermometers taken Press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said last week masks recommended required West Wing, despite narrow corridors desks packed closely together, making difficult staffers remain 6 feet apart.

Nothing people makes sense. wearing masks?!?! Don‚Äôt love freedom ?!?!? Can‚Äôt breathe one fancy masks Half country refuses wear simple mask, half pushing 500 year old statues taken down, sad sight watch. live Dallas. matter Blue Dallas is, Fort Worth, San Antonio, Austin is. get voted Farmlords Empty lands. say necessarily. :p also good Monday. thing Protest led spike cases. Also agree person me, ‚Äúhow fuck protest important pandemic‚Äù, movement great there‚Äôs time place everything I'll look allergy shots point.

My breathing home starting affected good mask. worried self isolate one point family member exposed someone tested positive. anything whole time quite months ago. 2 WEEKS r/LeopardsAteMyFace Birmingham fairly sane. suburbs right around bad, that's educated people live. Go slightly turns cesspool understand state reputation. curiosity, heck secret service supposed makes impossible protect president? chance top US officials vaccine know ? understand. would divorcing gender ethnicity offensive. That's like offended called American can't deduce biological sex. sad, murder design, criminal act side state officials deliberately chose ignore warnings danger relaxed regulations order make look good. 

How many need die realize times pandemic, playing politics cost lives delay extend misery danger! think important consider cost everyday living, cost food, rent, medical care, etc, actually save money. know Asia people buy cars outright rather taking loans, seems like saving money possible. EU wore masks kinda little bit 

A little? Germany calling. can't even enter grocery store mask, yes guards. NY forcing nursing homes take covid patient March, Florida recognized bad idea never recommended opposite. Florida required 2 negative tests anyone get admitted back nursing home goal test nursing home patient staff. Exactly. video circulating bit DeSantis bragging press conference like month ago Florida hit. Lol. used work ""agricultural"" industry (They sell plants landscaping home use, really ""agricultural""), they're even testing 30 new people hired seasonal work. kinda worrying, especially since roommate works there. People would lose shit knew happenings places, plants came be. another issue lack regulation loophole laws made specifically agricultural industry.

Where am, pay overtime, benefits, follow lot labor laws, due signing ""agriculture"", despite limited issues farms have, struggle financially all. shame, industry flooded customers want good, know better. teh economy ?!1?!1 mess Texas depends live. expect definitely within Schengen see travel I‚Äôm also virologist, think mostly wishful thinking. 

It‚Äôs plausible less dangerous strain could emerged Italy (although point that‚Äôs speculation). doesn‚Äôt mean thing would happen everywhere. doesn‚Äôt mean regular version virus would disappear. Jesus cleanse blood virus! 

Law order mean nothing it‚Äôs breaking laws party doesn‚Äôt like. I've felt shitty weekend, I'm NC. I'd like go get test know whether safely report work. 

There information available get tested. Trump's google website finally up, tell get tested circumstances. containment affecting infectious disease? China Korea dedicated stopping virus.

India seems overwhelmed.

The US quietly opted herd immunity. surface, may seem silly. temperature symptoms screening *that* useful, especially considering get tested understand. note say anything news organization. response OP using Fox News source highly scientific sub. 

I wouldn‚Äôt use news article scientific source ever. shows lack education around topic. 

This response anyone may see fence Fox News validity coronavirus facts (they none). decent points throughout thread, know several nurses doctors Chicagoland area told they're also much better treating risk CV patients now. drive mortality rate well, right? Peak drop expected April 2021. going fall line ends school years people traditionally move. unfortunately can't find photo, restaurants closed dine in, restaurant put banner basically said ""fuck Cave Creek mayor"" (even though one making decision). course swiftly removed pretended happen. also watch party Tulsa weekend! ever certain clientele. Sure, separation church state isn‚Äôt thing anymore apparently south. else have? Fuck no. International travel likely resume second half 2020 growing demand 30 40 percent world's airports. Pointing hypocrisy stating topic, kid ""alt-right bros"" 

I decent response nearly political one line. identify either side, refuted one points removed reason. think pretty civil, many facts. Seems like Fox News cherry picking physicians play narrative coronavirus pandemic winding expert critical care said plummeting number cases could mean vaccine longer needed virus might never return.

The plummeting number cases also tied actions taken government people + social distancing. Also, really depends country talking about; might apply New Zealand, much think virus mutated immune system reacts virus lower viral load due lockdown, mask-wearing, social distancing**,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúWe still demonstrate it‚Äôs different now.‚Äù 

Natural selection makes viruses mutations make less infective less prevalent. statement provided without supporting like aggressive tiger March April it‚Äôs like wild cat,‚Äù Bassetti said. ‚ÄúEven elderly patients, aged 80 90, sitting n bed breathing without help. patients would died two three days before.‚Äù

Our understanding, medical resources, treatment options COVID-19 improved pandemic mortality rates drop. announce misled, mismanaged made nearly countless mistakes executive branch us federal government going end costing 100s thousands lives inside united states. Head r/coronavirusaz interested! happens individual states trying enact different plans, instead coordinated guidance federal level. states good job, states much. Depends who's leading state... outside classroom control university. 

You downvoted stating fact many Universities return fall. There‚Äôs question that. saying good idea, classroom experience much amenable physical distancing contact sports. We've higher levels positive tests age range entire time...that's literally weird things virus talked since first data came South Korea Anything get clicks eyeballs, nothing try scare shit everyone (especially waspy types) thinking riots happening every block.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* doctors worked numerous (temporary) hospitals country. wouldn‚Äôt surprised dafur lot covid 19 cases Sudan one unstable areas within Africa (especially first thing see search dafur Wikipedia page ongoing genocide) along second Sudanese civil war.

Also don‚Äôt know part reaching Africa yet, China trades African states heavily natural resources.

It varies lot case case naturally. people without masks usually go shop without mask aren‚Äôt exactly buying lot stuff back march it‚Äôs likely regarded still. they‚Äôve learnt much since then. hell, back march saying masks don‚Äôt help. Yeah, state testing dashboard indicates testing data lash 4-7 days isn‚Äôt complete, I‚Äôve seen sources data show much older tests getting reported daily numbers. state dashboard doesn‚Äôt show test numbers particular day complete fully-reported, it‚Äôs hard validate one way another many 7+ day-old tests aren‚Äôt reported yet. Politicians like see immediate payout lack ability foresight. current leading candidate, Oxford vaccine, aiming initial release early September, assuming current Stage 3 trials suffer major issues. goes well think hit mass market Christmas. hundreds thousands people congregating streets perfectly fine! think also question exactly disease spreads? 

For instance, I've stopped wearing masks/social distancing since everything lifted state back Mid May. 

I'm huge constant hand washer/hand sanitizer either. I'll wash hands go bathroom I'm someone constantly disinfecting hands 24/7. 

I've probably encountered hundreds thousands people past month. I've Antibody test done (out sheer curiosity) early June came back negative...none close family members friends gotten sick either encountered.

So part wonders disease genuinely infects someone first place. Kzoo Grand Rapids, I'm seeing less less people wearing masks, little attempts keep 6 feet. fuck protests important pandemic?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* scraping redundanr context lol, moron Many take advantage.

But caught cheating long term paid sick leave assume pay everything back? realise actually look graph would realise America spiked close level EU EU cases went right spike America spike never went down.

You‚Äôre reading data incorrectly. US never spike like Europe, shown graph, efforts flatten curve. flatter curve means infections spread across longer period time; healthcare system protected result. think remember hearing back also. supporter back then, seemed like better pick Presidents Mexico time. Boy changed mind since then, almost reminds Trump Brazil President, way dealing things like virus. violate health code restaurants. would like clarify SARS MERS epidemics ""die down"" defeated sound epidemiology hard work. stark contrast happening country today. Looks like it, $3,700 x3. douche. 

I‚Äôm irritated people taking precautions saying ‚Äúwhoops! Everyone exposed go get tested I‚Äôm fine sorry bout that!‚Äù Regardless, planned events like irresponsible people charge. states population density. Even Los Angeles, NJ/NYC though. slowed spread early on, spread more, basically everyone tried opening NYC/NJ did, disastrous. It‚Äôs clearly going right way now. Also regarding testing tracing. also massive conflicts interest fast tracking vaccine given government Head ‚Äúoperation warp speed‚Äù 10 million stock options Moderna have... sure happy co-incidence him... since appointment announced leading candidate. dumb Unrelated question: westerner, country pronounced ‚Äúkuh-Tar‚Äù like always raised pronounce it, ‚Äúcutter‚Äù like started saying local news year two ago? ask innocence raised say ‚ÄúEye-ran‚Äù ‚ÄúEye-raq‚Äù discover pronounced ‚Äúihran‚Äù ‚Äúihraq‚Äù. Honest question here. none correct, please help :) bunch healthy 17-19 year olds.

They fine.

Their grandparents though... Health insurance tied employment really nothing happened here. I'm sure would needed money employment regardless. 

Just excuse vent anger system. actually think system messed anger due particular case unjustified. folks think virus might weapon. Like said, answered question. seen country different view. even movie country children leave nursing homes ""they can't take care it"". would require giving job interests 1-10 years, disrupting children's life ultimately would become progressive commitment likely culminate providing 24/7 care vulnerable involved.

I literally collegue gave job home, moved different country could take care old father. regret one bit, think brothers come too.

 option can't finance it, maybe father live instead him. that's it. time see life people people want disrupt life. care actually. 

Yes hard, should. option inhumane. least wear stupidity proudly. Good thing we're still first wave. rate first wave ending, we've still got plenty time prepare second.
 
/s prove wrong instead weak little ‚Äúlol‚Äù?

- find fx oldest articles debunks lie elderly care homes responsible difference deaths compared nordic neighbors

This lie spread since early April it‚Äôs still repeated despite publicly available statistics pointed it‚Äôs falsehood since beginning. 

So show articles proves critical press. wear mask eating drinking? cannot wrap head around bars restaurants open dine right now. Yes it‚Äôs strange. Many professionals seem like know ignore Oxford vaccine. don‚Äôt mind think September available vaccine realistic asked don‚Äôt discuss - say take years. must aware Oxford vaccine.

On hand, Jennet Institute (the Oxford vaccine developers) pretty much top tree vaccine expertise say could ready September believe they‚Äôre right. Airlines good shooting foot cases like Mexico necessarily underdevelopment. plain imbecile, stubborn people running government. violated health code. want restaurant violated health codes shut down? cheaper put elderly retirement house care home

That make sense. explain renting space parents live expansive renting space? care retirement homes free, understand right? 

It cost thousands dollars/euros month elderly stay elderly homes. NY downplayed much possible. 

Downplaying could cause issues us future. Especially since US history ignoring history. Trump coming week, Arizona shit show. Doucey really fucked us. yet still breaking record numbers cases? Imagine shit together testing front..

Arizona's test positivity rate higher ever goal mandate vaccinations filled micro-nano-chocolate-chips lizard people secret world order recruit us mind-controlled soldiers Final War. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION!! Without significant immunity population, places constantly vulnerable waves, never able let guard down. Easily teased based post history. would strongly suggest take advice. TX bars violating health code, try stay topic kid. someone‚Äôs response ‚Äúwho cares it‚Äôs white school‚Äù say school wealthy, heavily imply white = wealthy. Otherwise, wouldn‚Äôt strawman bringing wealth matter race. 

Also link systemic racism pretty clearly supports point. It‚Äôs form racism embedded normal practice, seen fact person likely believes they‚Äôre racism yet still makes comments like it‚Äôs normal conflate white wealthy. lead issues like health care, employment, education different different races. That‚Äôs you‚Äôre link says. 

The fact school wealthy doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs ok also call white that‚Äôs relevant. know know isn‚Äôt relevant? questioned white mattered, response wealthy schools get resources. seems like relevant part wealthy white. would needed money rent anyway. Tim health benefits even tho yes suck. New York did. state risk happening due nature populated city, would didn‚Äôt. really matter time strikes POTUS, carrying like is. we'll interesting tweets, strength it. far NL.

How general behaviour people Belgium?

Here NL numbers good people street almost back normal.
No masks always less social distance, least city live. contained superspreading event.

That depend upon leaky local lockdown is.  
Many infected persons may slipped net, documentation flimsy place abode temporary, possibly unregistered.  
  
There's certainly financial incentive seasonal guest worker make scarce seek employment elsewhere. crazy might sound, well might still legal. heard example large crowds causing many cases Australia? third, 4th,5th,6th.. etc . Better get used üôà I‚Äôve seeing posts months. idea it‚Äôs actually going implemented? plane travel airports seems likely good place employ them. we‚Äôre also seeing masks going protect getting [Covid-19] yourself.‚Äù

I gotta ask, someone Covid positive comes sneezes face, wearing goggles mask situation like would significantly better wearing nothing all, no? 

I'm sure recommending goggles+full mask usage already since worst happen they're wrong nothing (which makes sense stated) best case scenario allows us demolish infection rate. K? Masks work! 

The article 2 weeks ago. remember similar news couple weeks ago. salon update customers' results? remember last time reported preliminary results 40 customers. 

But anyway, awesome news! Thanks posting. Oh. Alright buddy. point going further. He's going tomorrow visit wall, failure Incompetent leadership would rather die, case, face 99.97% chance survival, live normal life. Ok dude. using term colloquially distinguish herd immunity achieved vaccination (which 95% epidemiologists talk say ""herd immunity"") herd immunity achieved infection. two many similarities, heterogeneous nature human interaction leads massive difference. no, yeah, ignore science conform rather simple view herd immunity. Happening Orlando right now, including Disney Springs locations. Yakima rural county side Washington. They‚Äôre heavily conservative watch Fox News. That‚Äôs happening. absolutely nothing what‚Äôs happening Seattle. pissed tried cover fucked World. That's part problem since hit US.  binary viewpoint COVID-19 people brushing use. boils ""Well, people recover unless high risk category live.""

That argument ignores death one aspect this.  month two work? large medical bill can't afford? spending weeks maybe rest life reduced lung function clots body waiting make way brain? kidney damage? strange syndrome kids getting recovering? 

That's stuff know about. entirely new territory. 

It's fatality rate needs considered. say kept testing compare death curve time observed dip cases doesn‚Äôt even appear. 0 deaths, good going! would overwhelmed hospitals places back normal. Sounds like need step outside haha public wearing mask, piece shit. How's slogan. 

Wear goddamned mask. shit serious. outside alone would she? accent even trying do? daughter wait 3 days even get tested took 5-6 days results Florida. Trump told Saturday night he's told ppl slow testing, may say joking see results States....  Sweden chose different corona strategy upset Finns think many Swedes reason **have put death**

Raw translation know, describe precisely happened. Croatian, right? still spirometer hospitalization last year. Hated thing, though useful. People watcher checking in. There's maybe it. reptile brains driver's seat far likely rational brain willing admit. 

Our rational brain spends lot time constructing narratives justify reptile brain whatever hell wants health consequences damned (eating/drinking should, sleeping little, poor fitness choices, etc). 

By educating rational brain, try convince reptile brain make better long-term decisions: Defer spending save rainy day, homework instead party, get go work Monday morning, etc. 

What we're seeing areas around world (Brazil, Florida, Sweden, etc) deadly misinforming is. We've known people access misinformation use justify emotional (reptile brain) responses consistent pleasurable behavior justification past behavior. 

We foolish think cultures would suddenly become rational face crisis. 

People change behavior emotionally convinced personal outcome improved it. hard-hit areas locked earliest best compliance: emotional impact pandemic's devatstation much higher close home. people MI South Korea smarter people FL Sweden. People FL mask en masse reptile brains get board second sooner, reptile brains encouraging rational brains take 30k foot view ask lock mask there's yet hot spot cooled way. good reading enhance understanding, careful selection bias. Remember people mild symptoms minimal/no lasting effects way less likely go way post forum. people post necessarily exaggerating lying, smaller subset population would seem read subreddit. Welding doors? Thank answer. tought would like. people pretend country Europe still need wear masks restictions. month since lot people able start working again, yet people vocal rights infringed. They‚Äôve let us glance info twice. Someone posted numbers six weeks ago, recently spotted again. chart that‚Äôs available hospitals don‚Äôt make public. lists deaths year cause death yearly totals 2107&amp;2018. cdc agrees  honestly pee leg thing best analogy I‚Äôve heard far understanding masks work protect us. ( read somewhere couple weeks ago went ‚Äòoh!‚Äô). Think peeing someone‚Äôs leg similar coughing virus lungs. think pants like masks. mean, pee soak right cloth, right? 

 - pants pee leg leg get wet.
- pants don‚Äôt, pants get wet leg get damp rather dripping wet.
- you‚Äôre wearing pants I‚Äôm get soaked might get drop two pee much.
- we‚Äôre wearing pants probably won‚Äôt get pee leg all. *even though pee soak right cloth problem all* can't see bf? hospital though need oxygen?? *Some* athletes. fine. 
It's ok guys worry, parties safe! Correct. lock extremely limited muddying asymptomatic versus presymptomatic. Presymptomatic spread responsible half spread (estimates course good data US). Presymptomatic asymptomatic spread point view recipient identical. difference carrier road, irrelevant blowing viral wad everywhere chance notice.

&amp;#x200B;

People latching onto wholly asymptomatic spreading like tell either way past wad blowing stage. mean normal mortality exceeded? 

There 100k excess deaths mid  Uh since government develop vaccines? like hanging friends supporting them? said someone else weekend, hopefully fact tourist attractions still closed limit amount travel NY. Conglomerate noun. Lol pissed responding outbreaks limititing infection? source number deaths greater expected year Florida? seen that, I'm interested. bunch COVID deniers feed would like see data. inside increases chances droplets transferred people. Also corona survive long direct sunlight, decreasing amount infections outside. really dance Flew weekend. Temperature checks, masks required. flight service, paid otherwise.

Middle seats blocked off. Plane ran 66% capacity, seats standby seats assigned enforce this.

Safest feeling flight life, I'm canada. Air canada really making effort bad press earlier fucked running stuff like usa bit. It‚Äôs half measures. deliberately protect people deliberately protecting others, get bad result. Either save everyone compartmentalizing virus much possible go full nihilist opinion (preferably former admire latter‚Äôs decisiveness) fuck airlines still shipping people around throughout USA??? year, mean past three months. 120k dead quarter year. priviliged

Check privilege.

Fucking Orange county priviliged fux lol  New cases 20% Sunday since memorial day phase then, think 2 I'm currently living Korea tell wrong, even pre-COVID. Places get packed, especially weekends. However, amount people going significantly lower COVID. everyone wears mask religiously. Less days things gotten much better months ago, still. Also, contact tracing amazing. get several alerts phone everyday telling confirmed case, many people, specific times. government swoops cleans shit places person visited.
South Korea's success due combination governments quick decisive actions collectiveness culture right. good far. :) subject here: Yeah, like Florida's transparent, trustworthy website. stark contract countries judge really tells state world garbage-fire modern journalism.

Won't name specific countries start hate comment chain. Time reference anime quote: ""I find asking nicely work unless power enforce it"". Courtesy Chief Aramamki Ghost Shell. lump whole Canada together. Vancouver amazing. asian community set tone early wearing mask. Minor symptoms average 6 days, maximum time symptoms 2 weeks. would definitely seeing now. think rumor. actually known ingredient vapes causing damage removed. doubt loose jobs, worse case reshuffled another farm picnic shelters

*laughs bitterly Floridian* mean shouldnt surprise anyone. way US handling outbreak extremely poor, causing Americans much stressed depressed it. Except blissfully ignorant dont care anymore, never did. Harken, authorities desire respect: provide useful information, people take get find it.

Worldometer go-to site time. time wanted another metric, seemed appear. indispensable now. Florida lies obfuscates publishing ""resident"" cases, rather ""all new positives,"" Worldometer go reliable numbers.

So maybe ""should been"" CDC WHO. Worldometer. Everybody draw obvious conclusions that.  still hate this.

The phrasing implies worth case scenario young adults death.

I would prefer death double lung transplant.

But also think safe say, point, know fatality rate young people since young people seem likely different symptoms. Stop trying kill us. state leaders residents listened 2 months ago - we‚Äôd different situation. are.  9 Women make child 1 month Ah, read before. None works. ""UnBARleivable.""

**Time brand new record** Coronavirus Michael Scott answer whataboutism? too

That's did, *before* regions hit hard covid world similar stories. 

No comment... symptoms? Like go give details please? think went got tested. It‚Äôs week still haven‚Äôt got results back. Well, unfortunate incident happened: 

A container ship accident huge quantities surgical masks fell ocean washed Australia.

Also, amount PPE trash increased LOT hard waste removal companies keep up. frequency emptying garbage bins, sweeping public places, garbage truck runs etc gone lot places. means even people throw away trash bins, trash escapes containment. Used surgical masks particular act like little parachutes blown away wind.

The point avoid getting sick first place need monthly injections stay alive, contribution contribution. Fight club entered chat...  plus days get serious enough, plus delay getting testing results maybe closing college campuses best idea

Super simple. strategy relies virus spreading populaton going increase amount hospitalized, turn increase amount PPE used. 

Notice neither Denmark Norway PPE shortages note. 

The difference DK spread disease suppressed whereas Sweden allowed move population ""controlled burn"". Virginia. nearly 30 days since protests began MN. pretty easy get misled believe something like constantly post /r/Conservative. 

I feel man. Maybe try /r/Science something.  

As someone supported protests, pretty fucking clear would add cases lol. still borders inside Europe, epidemics localized ran bodies quicker. US freely spreads New York South West. people either symptoms mild ones. Mine I'm middle-aged overweight. 10-day fever.

You're correct minority people seriously affected, important unneccessarily scare people. shipmate mine legionaries disease 70‚Äôs, lungs already scarred. Poor guy got covid didn‚Äôt make it.

Excess Deaths data (dashboard excel file dump). numbers saw probably effort someone sort this. Hope wake start tracing mass testing,

They already increased testing massively. numbers peaked (higher April), FHM stopped reporting data thursday. good... None comments backed claiming. everyone people bad cases COVID-19? make sense all?? electronics made China, probably device u used type made China. outbreak may started doesn‚Äôt mean sudden aren‚Äôt manufacturing hub planet. examples, then:

Oh boy, imagine said school predominately black students population... honest, anyone goes deserves getting virus. decent parent would let kid go semi-intelligent human would go.

Maybe send people school learn things give recommendations someone knows works. Technically island Tantramar Marsh becomes flooded rising sea levels.  tell you

Huh?  I've reading months. Agreed, thoughts (or anyone) cases fewer deaths?

Demographics. 

Hispanics represented case counts, they're much younger average racial groups. live near cape tourists coming. one masking except going stores neighbors big cook friends. family mad cause said need stop hiding. told protestors test positive coronavirus Remember, poor kids smart white kids. world health organization also stated avoid using masks.. people spend time really researching topic . see news choose follow guidelines ignore them. uhhh going protest thousands fine. piece shit scam artists love ruining lives Secobarbital often recommended medication states legal assisted dying. signed moderna vaccine clinical trial got call today. it? many efforts track mutating strains, I'm skeptical.

Other explanations may include:

1. Hospitals better treating preventing cross-infections.

2. Many susceptible worst symptoms already seen.

3. People developed nations reduced factors correlate severity, including Vitamin deficiency. !RemindMe July 15 trust people use common sense, matter rules regulations order people give af begin with.  places, ""social distanced"" numbers go up. mean tell see 10 people day get near them, still manage spread virus? hell accomplishing that? Well, no. We've specifically told protests cause. Mentioned Monday, reiterated today press conference. They've blamed large family gatherings people getting complacent. one case link protests.  


""Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said Monday believe protest, organisers urged attendees wear masks socially distance, contributed recent rise cases. ""I think Black Lives Matter protesters contributed. We're seeing people who've clearly acquired there.""

Ignores important data like population density claims otherwise. understand science basic levels. Talks politics, uses word independent like defense. Says everyone else narrative.

&amp;#x200B;

Get internet, turn news. suck both. There's another reason, demographics. Hispanics represented case counts, they're much younger average racial groups. talked much though clearly idea talking that's OK. Cities airports. Cities require people entering city via airport wear masks. really complex. Airlines lease airplanes. require customers wear masks getting airplanes. UAE get results less 24 hours. mind feeling like death couple months waiting year lung capacity return, it. bad things besides personal death. children clamoring play ball street. die. ‚ÄúBut need muh job pay muh bills feed muh family?‚Äù everyone suffering minor inconvenience businesses forced reduce operations shut entirely. 


Have little compassion less fortunate, eh? exactly US done. things got bad NY, lot NYers fled states. example, family rural community Pennsylvania (south New York) major outbreak tied New Yorkers fleeing NYC come work factories there. tons people vacationing Florida summer likely spreading virus back home communities. trash trash end oceans? Maybe get blown wind storm drains? Yeah I'm sure /s Phoenix they're mandating masks really. wear one cop sees stop hand flier, keep wearing mask get fined. 

...But they're going tracking either never fine or, best case scenario, fine anyone without mask. answer question **vasta majority scientists world**. Six months late one, Superchief. Murphy also sent infected patients nursing homes.

That cancels ‚Äòright.‚Äô sitting stadium shoulder shoulder entire graduating class one name called time good time people? could easily speakers would spoken assembly graduation, let high school graduates celebrate instead sit hours. yeah, coming one people performed solo graduation; really outdated much better ways go it. Personally, preferred parties getting drunk it, students drink, many still liked parties far graduation itself. people graduating class actually enjoyed ceremony. airplanes getting packed insane remarkable many still try say Sweden pursuing [herd immunity there's absolute mountain evidence exactly simply willing admit loud sine term negative connotations. Tegnell Giesecke admit think herd immunity strategy, Tegnell even talks use term openly. 

Anyone suggests point arguing bad faith *or* totally unaware facts ground. basically Hispanic Uncle Ruckus?

I thought it, I'd watch that. Federal law requires temporarily laid due pandemic return work called back else they're eligible UI. isn‚Äôt political. give solid medical advice.

This. media Germany always tries make sound like R number 1 something horrible headlines 2 doomsday worry Trump give cannery money. observation compare quality life Canadian family members vs American ones. Canadians without doubt living way comfortably much less, less poverty, less student loans, medical debt, vacation/parental leave...the quality life much better ...if American.

Most rest developed world alright. idea quarantine, virus spreading unchecked population, really know looked like going overwhelm hospitals. 

After lockdown, virus much contained, theory, we'll better responding individual cases, slowing spread, avoid overwhelming hospitals. Countries like Australia New Zealand done pretty effectively. 

Unfortunately, lot states opened adequately contained COVID-19 good mitigation plans place, like good contact-tracing testing protocols. Basically, time prep test (reopening) failed study, we're desperately trying scribble notes arms. 

California done pretty good job. 40 million people 95% urban, less deaths much smaller states like New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois. people seem like actively trying sabotage reopening wearing masks following county state guidelines. Unlike States, California probably close things see continuous spikes. Meanwhile, Florida trying hide numbers. basically kid's school plan (private school). feeling pretty good it.  Congratulations long awaited pregnancy! wish baby best. Ok Liberals. hoax gone LONG ENOUGH. Seriously, knock off. /s Electric Cowboy Lewisville packed like crazy blows mind seeing Snapchat stories there. second news coverage shifted, nobody hesitated go right back whatever please used work Springfield dole, preety shitty place work, rude management, due food processing plant, already wear face masks arm sleeves, working food, likely came imported produce.

I dont think 230 workers could gotten since plant employs 400 many people would definitely read local paper. picture you‚Äôre painting, government track person‚Äôs contacts without cooperation, dystopian narrative frankly true.

You naive think every gov can't right now. Exactly, fuck them.

Public health greater ‚Äúright‚Äù fucking idiot take zero precautions public worldwide pandemic. don‚Äôt right infect everyone come contact with. fine. drank apple pedialyte really delicious idk. breathe fine aches pains. tempo slow low. I‚Äôm worried second wave may hit us harder countries people actually wear masks.

in mind first wave partly generated Austrian ski huts, carnival crowded places. addition testing much better now. able detect early superspreading events  prevent getting virus though. They're really poor so. protecting others wearing mask case asymptomatic sick. everyone wears mask, everyone protecting other. lot Americans selfish wrap heads around though. Oh god stupid fuck, bills passed still try bill estate. idea talking about. Basically every woman met. Something like 16 million descendants genes. problem consenting adults spread virus people consent.

You reopen safely, countries done it. US refuses it. many avoidable deaths. sad. sad thing NY right thing made sacrifices far longer city state. start open morons rest country fly make effort wasted.   Trump thinks understands virus better doctors US happen election pushed. talking protests, yes did. protests countries like France, UK, Portugal, Germany, etc. dog smarter halfwits. never physically attack someone I‚Äôm pissed someone nothing no, won‚Äôt like them. people acted like entire lives. think younger people crap change get old?

Also, around half people nursing homes dementia. facility worked kept separate people without dementia quite lot freedom. went dementia side started decline. worked would act violently times, lot different others.

And no, I‚Äôm really aggressive. quit told boss leaving refused assaulted work people using age excuse shitty. left knew limit exploded one them. Could imagine didn‚Äôt take seriously got friends family sick died? guilt would kill me. reasons I‚Äôm unfriending people, lol. Gonna wait see well back-peddle. Popcorn ready. Even taking snapshots racier posts. Why, idk. like I‚Äôd actually bother confronting them. I‚Äôm outright disbelief. always go current research supports. two drugs steroid UK arsenal now. would recommend then? Countless countries allowed businesses open strict safety measures spikes.

It difficult causes issues everyone, better letting people die?

Open back up, smart careful it. pretend like virus exist control. Funny parts US people wear mask pussies insane thought meant suppressing hiding data I‚Äôm making excuses certainly number issues US needs tackle urgently. 

But pointing Nordic countries saying eUrOpE mUcH BeTtEr isn‚Äôt really helping anything ‚ÄúEurope‚Äù limited countries whose population lower California. 

You want policies work scale within diverse economic, social, political context Finland Iceland have.

Germany would valid comparison, much larger population, significant economic divide West East, Lands similar States, etc. East Bay-er here... Safeways I've ( College Ave, Alameda N Out, Pleasant valley) full mask compliance. There's reason believe either drugs anything, right? money-making enterprise? gosh lost her. beautifully talented soul. RIP Potential goldmine he's way proud start wearing one now. He'd admit wrong. would short circuit explode. I‚Äôm one saying health insurance bad. You‚Äôre literally trying say good/bad insurance based experience someone else. That‚Äôs fearmongering 101. really think burden proof random redditor person 10+ years experience insurance plan, well start talking wall. 

Also fun fact, children aren‚Äôt responsible bills die. stop fearmongering too. 

You know best part democracy is? shows people really feel want feel. Look happened Bernie primaries. we've gotten rid anti-mask league. Oh.. wait.. that's 1918 version what's going now, bad.

Seriously, people need try learn least basic medical lessons past, nothing else. disagree this. think know way 2 months ago deaths worst. also treatment options back April.

Furthermore, I'd like see data age groups making new cases. younger people, think huge spike deaths. law people wear masks, Wal-Mart breaking law customers don't. individuals wearing masks. That's Wal-Mart's responsibility enforce.

If Law make illegal allow unmasked people store, enforcement could laid Wal-Mart. Spanier here. grandmother lived nursing home last years. died 101. used live mother 95 taking care home wasn‚Äòt doable more. spent 6 years nursing home, weren‚Äòt bad all. Spain nursing homes longterm residents. Minnesota closer 80% Even get past physical stuff imagine much shit costs financially twice worn mask now. Yesterday Praxis last week BLM demonstration. all, would say masks turned tide Netherlands interesting look back incident.  1 case literally shut united states. 

now there's shit ton more, team sports supposed start next month. much ahead remedy (maybe) STONKS US eons away herd immunity. looked up‚Äî[only 5% Americans according antibody studies. makes sad. can't stand bright brains die young... lost life, we've lost potential contributions science. kids getting free lunches complaining kids want free lunch. what‚Äôs worse Curry seemed FIRST like going take seriously. guess someone got him. watch cnn lol Yes, course. still law dictator decides is. Yes, flies face agenda. Wait.. Morrison responsible now? happened?!

Wasn't yesterday firemen telling eat dick? Trump asked less testing, there‚Äôs actually way testing. Governor DeVirus blaming immigrants partier‚Äôs. grew Florida honestly half state totally backing him. Even folks thought normal.... Please stop indulging idiot.

I know it‚Äôs hard encourages ignorance. Thank you. I‚Äôve seeing lot recently don‚Äôt know everyone can‚Äôt seem understand difference. It‚Äôs like. Sad. feel fucking ignorant? Kind of... afraid call friends family wrongdoings. falling friendship/love better watching love die something trivial staying good terms. Wish would happen Nashville. Place free-for-all.  Take care damn parents.  run capacity required, might well close. Bars depend numbers. packed house paychecks are. going lose business one way other. Lose lose situation, prob figured gamble save livelihood jobs employees worth it. fair, sentiment countries, back then. Everyone underestimated masks could prevent infecting _others_. countries able adapt changed messaging without throwing fit, though.

The Surgeon General posted mask making tutorial April 3rd, ages ago. amount deaths could probably halved, curve started flatten properly. political post. complains politics, actually. Oxford clue long takes vaccine developed? I'm gonna listen literally one prestigious institutions world instead random redditor likely know shit. state reopened, city. doubling daily case counts every days not. Hospital ICU beds rising. Many die. OK people dying want beer?

Please wear mask try maintain distance public. likely kill could pass folks kill.

Before say old/high risk people need stay home. , still need eat run basic errands. OK getting sick $1 mask much you? mean one trial 60% success rate monkeys, haven‚Äôt started testing humans yet, come said probably won‚Äôt available till next year publicly? mean Oxford. 

Did read results? sensationalist headlines they‚Äôre ‚Äúbounds leaps ahead competition‚Äù Cuomo. Get reddit job here. pandemic least know one favorite cousins growing up, made curious remarks vaccines holistic health past, went full blown anti vax conspiracy nut COVID masks. Really makes think. Literally opposite U.S.  Also, school MONTHS said would graduation ceremony. suddenly, June there's in-person one invited attend (as teacher). Uh thank you. Stupid people. stupid Lose* God, must devastating. Oh goodness. even want imagine. Yikes. üòû US 366 deaths per million. EU 297 deaths per million.

It depends zoom at, disaster areas (though NYC really far worse anything Europe, Bronx 3,200+ deaths per million, Lombardy 1,600 so) peaceful areas.

Real problem June far US adding 3.7 new deaths per million every 1 EU, new spike make situation materially worse.

It seems fair bet end August US good chance hit 500 deaths per million EU almost certainly 400 deaths per million, 350 deaths per million. still law, right? Funny different people interpret things differently. dad TX talking new rules fuck around they'll pull license real quick. Guess true. Even great news! really, using pooled testing, works infection rate low, otherwise every pool positive, test sample. sure EU countries, SPain France share worker scandals Moroccans guess problem systematic. 
Meat general food prices super low EU stark contrast e.g. rent prices estate prices general, increases ~100% last 10-15 years occurred come somewhere. Good GAWD! now? Please. Yes, thats voluntary. state mandated. Oh yeah mask ban. didn‚Äôt last long hit. 4/20/69 Angry stupid people great numbers need taken seriously. hurt themselves. Unfortunately, education make people change minds. knowledge issue, emotional issue. society promoting unhealthy dynamics block fruitful discussions trust. support fascism, course, think people need trained better good citizens democracy. extend media political organizations well, that's people learning bad habits days. downvoted pointing protesters wearing masks social distancing. People nuts. Scream protesters (very compared BLM) asking jobs back, OK current protests. get it. hear this? bad news reinfection? police hard hit European countries enforced lockdowns, curfews, etc. enforce something police it? losing battle US turns well.... maybe people police civic duty. That's big fuck lol. We're doomed. work hospital.

It happens least month. always sex toys. Sometimes animals weird sex goals like sex tree. Beijing, virus strains found ice blocks used seafood cold chain. sarcastic? that‚Äôs what‚Äôs actually happening COVID deaths US going average 16.5% (week week) last two weeks.

I've following worldometer seeing pattern referring to. compare day week ago see today ""good day"" meaning less deaths today one week ago. we'll rejoining guys soon. safe say technically death camps? Nope, absolutely none. time Price Charles recovered majestically quickly appeared Trump longer concerns going public. He's president united states, know got it. obviously something would advertise would private health information. doesnt need polar decision. choice full lock full economy opening. shades between. Everybody wearing masks option. Somehow always either program ofr it, polar response reality always complex. dont align ""its end world narrative"" time doesnt mean align ""its little flu narrative"". debate whether infected people coming contact uninfected people lead infections (not really debatable imo seem think maybe is) highlight decision made want bring attention post yours?  Germany here. U hear (stupid) ppl bitching abt lot. fines work. really do. Rarely anything ‚Äúsolely caused‚Äù. This. Even shutdown businesses per health code it‚Äôs way harder enforce people beaches throwing parties, etc. would require law enforcement nobody wants get police enforcing current climate. done extensive research it, sounds like well received far pretty safe. still risks sure, would probably it. good cause apart of. Thanks part, choose. it‚Äôs short minded people are. 

if able show everyone would happen family got virus, bet lot would rethink decisions.

but again, people pretty ignorant even might work. Unfortunately honest question came insincere. Hope tide turns. REMOVE **ARNOLD'S** COMMENT! begrudge reopen protesters.

I stand BLM protesters. I'm sorry able correct hour ago got flurry downvote people failed keep w/ news: Andy Borowitz
June 17, 2020

If listened pressers, also know also ton concentration camps ok matter justify protest course, excuse wearing mask ignoring social distance, say looting rioting. care many downvote me, still say feel sick people. donot think one here. Denmark population 5.8 mio, Sweden 10.2 mio. friday monday afternoon Denmark 136 positive cases 34.647 tests. That's 3 days.

For week ended june 14 Sweden tested 60.678 citizens. That's less ¬Ω compared Denmark account difference populations.

June 18, Sweden reported 1.437 new cases one day alone. 

So can't say due testing, also virus way prevalent Sweden Denmark. factor 30 times prevalent. coincidence, states south! state ain't one them! BOO YA! üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ üá∫üá∏ 

*^(and i'm happy....     Kazoo)* Good know. always thought meant yesterday. tought something new non native English speaker. Serious question - without masks, getting away this?

Other countries gone route seeing good results, understanding would dramatically opposite. not? chemical leak office might floor, boss opened windows weekend make dissipate slightly, deserve say working? 

Especially since average median incomes Canada far exceed CERB, people staying home incentive work; they're staying home probably see South Korea infinitely better containment second wave, China strictest lockdowns world still deals viral pop ups imports neighbouring countries, Sweden refusing properly close manage virus lead seeing little progress defeating virus massive death rates compared neighbours. 

If work make $37000 $55000 $110000, lazy refusing work $2000 month -- actively giving $13000 $86000 year keep safe. 

Not say people forced go work, need acknowledge two elements: 1) lot workers businesses complaining citing CERB -- they're work home. people want stop work, want option work home, keeps business floors overcrowding limits everyone's exposure risk. 2) lot people citing work safety either high risk themselves, partners high risk. personally two friends whose partners high risk, either move home, find small apartment, go work, stay home keep partners likely death. 

Don't blanket assume people going work lazy incentivized. might people category, workers eager things open get back jobs traditional salary ranges. people refuse blatantly unsafe work, absolutely deserve lose government safety net, especially since us spend whole lives paying EI never claim it. 

And need someone circumstances understand needs people. actively looking get back work via temporary work current job pause September, still understand hundreds valid reasons refuse unsafe work way around DFW don‚Äôt really know. explosion cases happens slowly might think would. happens over, every single country. imagine young person gets disease denial wouldn‚Äôt go testing week even get symptoms, sick enough present hospital two weeks in, point parents would already week infections possibly two weeks death?

It‚Äôs difficult think COVID epidemiological sense happens depends entirely people DO. always maintained everyone behaved absolutely everyone everyone else world might kill ~three~ weeks problem would mostly go away. Either way countries done well!

( didn‚Äôt mean steal anyone Netherlands thunder, sorry.)

This definitely something proud about! think anyone panicking, except people freaking asked wear mask get thing figured out. high temp day test Phoenix, Arizona 106 F, 41.1 C. headline bit misleading. ""dangerous new phase"" second wave much world seeing, border measures taken New Zealand. see nothing wrong forcing returning citizens quarantine hotel two weeks. agree move make citizens pay themselves. seems like unnecessary barrier New Zealand citizens returning home. school shooter literally wants kill people. harmful intent here. disease spreading get us. point wasting numbered days Earth fear, isolated, depraved social life. It‚Äôs wiping out. Influenza marching protesting today due human shortages. Mind blown.

(imagine mind blown gif I'm lazy) lot research said reinfected. sub won‚Äôt hear though Sex toy accidents...seems oddly specific... Arizona reported 1,702 people currently hospitalized seven-day average, near 29% increase compared week ago. Saturday, Arizona Department Health Services reported 83% inpatient beds 85% intensive-care unit beds use. That's UK started they're really paying price now. realised mistake little sooner though, started rectify bit. summer places guess. city we‚Äôre new cases daily ever. early opening going exactly everyone said would kill thousands thousands Americans reason. first wave didn‚Äôt really end second crept slowly here. Americans culturally incapable flattening curve like Japanese Koreans. Buy us get much richer bury aunts. Scary accounts seemingly legitimate folks. Thanks sharing. surprising either, witnessed Wuhan China, Northern Italy, Iran. People objecting term 'alien' per se, use ""illegal"". Even though conspiracy nut, see easier believe virus fake tsunami destroys whole villages. destruction much sudden obvious. would agree others intentional. San Francisco, easy get day test results within 24 hours. access, daily percent positive hovers around 2%. Yeah. They've done couple people worked well. Granted, kids work hard, going mention them, eh. happens way much, unfortunately is. People either work together fight it, individually get taken advantage of. People seem keen working together though. Yup.

The donor class political leaders fail us again. protests starting people reddit/Twitter/whatever else we‚Äôre saying wouldn‚Äôt spread coronavirus wearing masks standing 6 feet apart. lot research said not. sub won‚Äôt hear though  is, long China approves. told surge cases young people need hospitalization. would reddit lie like this??? ruling party oposition using situation

The left: Listen science.

tRump: Nah, flu bruh. 

Yes, couple *users*. even still stay-at-home order live? Data tells different Story. never abuse shelter contract. certainly trying. friends Facebook past month I'm pretty positive I've seen least 3 restaurant check ins, 3-4 person group trip beach, road trip another city state (8 hour drive restaurants end). 

They need vaccine rate. Either die ride out. Millennials, Gen Y, born 1980 and1994, though extend 2000. doctor, sounds like modified existing process creating vaccines create one COVID, instead creating new process. know process safe, concern resulting vaccine whether provides partial/total protection whether temporary/permanent. Deaths lag infections period time. Good Norway far fewer deaths Sweden. many fewer? That's social distancing.  


A guy reddit open er agenda state 4 months Chinese doctors seeing dissipation GGOs ... also still know want roll dice avoid them. confirm. drive around 3 hours find place would rapid testing spot. 5 days ago, still results. Shut fuck obviously don‚Äôt kids Also 2008, private equity firms started buying billions dollars real estate. enough capital ride depression everyone access Trump's ""joke"" intentionally reducing saved hundreds thousands lives get hit like we‚Äôre terrible. we‚Äôve done ventilators medical equipment. testing, know, testing double edged sword. We‚Äôve tested 25 million people. It‚Äôs probably 20 million people anybody else. Germany‚Äôs done lot. South Korea done called me, said, job you‚Äôre ‚Ä¶ Here‚Äôs bad part. testing extent, you‚Äôre going find people, you‚Äôre going find cases. **So said people slow testing down, please.** test test. tests people don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. got tests, got another one here. young man‚Äôs 10-years-old. He‚Äôs got sniffles. He‚Äôll recover 15 minutes. That‚Äôs case, add it. That‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs case. actually nice man, good man, even though he‚Äôs liberal, Governor New Jersey, right? know him? listen, said me, something that‚Äôs amazing. New Jersey heavily hit, hard hit, thousands people. said thousands people died, thousands people, one person died age 18. Would believe that? tells one thing, kids much stronger us.""

The video makes worse, better. context makes worse, better. joke asked testing slowed, even 10 year old boy ""the sniffles"" counted positive test shows positive. joke lot positive cases severe.

The real joke we're stuck guy figurehead pretending leader. can't spell facetious without spelling fauci. always got back pocket ever need it. Eh... that's probably going biggest factor. think we'll hit burn point (from combination herd immunity infections, vaccination, behavioral changes, functional governance, etc) within 5 years.

We're probably one best states US too. Chinese said vaccine public good. wait see. possible considering pandemic greatly exacerbated shortage nurses: think people misinterpret comment completely. expressing shock also got different virus returning work. 

I figure home 3 months going among people. Immediately got sick. Fever, cough, vomiting ECT. 

Got tested. Negative. Black screens, thoughts prayers, face masks. Simply ways get pedestal people notice good person are. care much. Everybody thanking you. heroes wear capes.

I mean look comment. seems entirely pointless face value, point kiss ass hopes get pat two back... easy considering rest room heads near asses well. 

Remember, farts oxygen, need come air occasionally. lol Yes - agree - real homeschooling put quotes. :) drop 2k/mo everyone november, sell MAGA masks, shit like that. 1.5 trillion (just perspective: that's thousand billions, plus another 500 billion) disappeared stock market early on. lot stimulus went big corps. 

It's insane, completely squandered easy win greed stupidity short-sightedness. ""Wake sheeple"" massively misunderstood point protests. probably money got selling lives could host rnc. 


on top that, school starts week week k-12 unis (at least unf). we're pretty much royally fucked yeah, that‚Äôs right now. imagine another 4 months. Combined lack critical thinking skills. That's interpretation article June 11, think wrong interpretation. think latest months context would mean June/May healthcare workers complaning continued lack PPE article, groups express critically. 

So, again: think healthcare workers complaining lack PPE heads? calling crazy and/or liars? live Phoenix exposed 10 days ago. easy get test right away results back 5 days later.

Now it‚Äôs totally different. think NYC already done plague pit. might want check sources. spreading faster testing different demographic pin pointing better previously. 

From understand, median age eating considerably lower 2 months ago, think less 30 years old. they‚Äôre testing people would never tested beginning better job focusing testing high risk professions group. low risk people rarely die. Compared April, hospital beds available less covid patients icu, supports theory better job finding covid cases actually more. 

A positive pregnancy test doesn‚Äôt make anymore pregnant before. I've fly 8 round trips since US lock-down. I've flown big 4 US airlines regions different levels concern corona. Almost people seen airport wearing masks also seem taking way precautions general public. observations one guy flown unusual amount since kicked off. I'll leave decide make it.  feel like America saw/heard Europe went lockdown able stop (relatively) wave 4 weeks. 

We expected result reality Europe far cracking mobility 100 times severe pretty much anywhere States I'm aware aside maybe NY. naive think limited shelter orders people still going fairly regularly holding get togethers going come anywhere close stopping initial wave. They'll react acting like little babies cant find binkie. pathetic. strong relationship situation.

Or boring enough people lifestyle change :P 

Not strong relationship, us literally change lifestyle going dinner every couple weeks postponing particular trip take every year fall. already worked home full time, already worked home several days week - I'm fulltime work home, different. Instead going public hiking trails parks work garden ""outdoors time"". We're software engineers gamers, friends, we're playing games online socialize. 

So anyway since much change lifestyle pretty much usual. Heck, years ago similar lifestyle living together studio apartment, guess got well prepared this! Yes. Anybody acting surprised either uninformed likes sensationalist. Covid-19 isn‚Äôt going anywhere. US shitty non-existing contact tracing program. Would specific example make feel better appreciate comment. people seem think mask allows spend much time inside indoor busy public spaces without issue. tapes ruining lives it‚Äôs racist views lack self control act them. things open back anywhere without adequate testing availability? 8 weeks antibodies fell undetectable levels aysymptomatic That's leadership becomes even important. trusted respected source providing instructions much effective rather useful pertinent information multiple sources. population able combine information multiple sources make correct decisions. /r/ihadastroke Anyone wants go cruise right moron. Cruises literally perfect venue infectious disease spread. completely retarded what?  sure true, reports hospitals using c19 post mortem diagnosis order get money

There zero chance happening sort scale matter. Doctors would risk career beancounter's request juke revenue. Doctors typically hate administrators hospital admin said something even approaching ""Hey, it'd benefit hospital covid patients, *wink* *wink*"" would result many whistleblowers. Prove wrong. Already proven. Via hands Shrooms? opposed US? US PROVEN to, without doubt, lying deaths infections. US also attempted
to cover beginning forbidding scientist testing SARS-CoV-2 forbidding releasing said results. fact went rogue reason found Covid country. 


Did China unethical things? Absolutely. (and currently) US LEAST many unethical things? Unquestionably hate tube best times, want use :(

Hopefully tfl etc. step safety attempt control crowds bit. That's erroneous conclusion. researchers study go way avoid making claim. argue makes antibody passport useless, that's all. live Nurse (Wife) adamant reacting. society nothing left us smart. hard live idea get anxious everything. says (Ohio) smashed curve. skeptical watching States balloon cases makes wonder States turn. One possible reason/ hypothesis:

The people protesting younger demographic mild/ asymptomatic infections. Many go get tested unless illness gets bad enough. still spread older vulnerable people around them, could tack another week two noticed incubation periods.

&amp;#x200B;

Just 2c I'm expert. Right work states mean fire without giving reason accuse firing illegal reason, claim another, as: ‚Äúsudden drop productivity‚Äù. similar sentiment. vague merits. voted [this in, tells need know Florida. would take response people adhere guidelines. Everyone states...well, know. It'll matter time cases exceed capacity Arizona start tackling soon.

That surge probably already guaranteed there's immediate unapologetic action. Here‚Äôs something cool-

Using phylogenetic bracketing (inferring traits organism based traits closest relatives have) infer it‚Äôs likely COVID-19 produces lasting immune response (SARS MERS, closest relatives, do).

It‚Äôs possible COVID-19 differs relatives way, it‚Äôs likely shares characteristics closely related organisms. Dimitrov rest still fine. went wanted so. free remain perfectly sterile enviroment rest life. order go nightclub, neither someone order masses go. rooting it. Can't wait dramatically spike spike move next goalpost we're doomed fair new. never thing GOP guys sacrificed ton try literally eliminate virus 

So yeah, traveling fucking wasting everything did... 18 cases worth flipping for. 

US never tried stop it, slow bit. bleeds leads. always way. shocking conspiracy anything else. Everyone vulnerable certain degree. may result death may instead result reduction quality life. leadership doesn‚Äôt take seriously stops trying live fantasy land virus miraculously disappears, continues get worse. lot worse. 100%

I work New Braunfels/San Marcos server. say following social distancing guidelines. not. single bar restaurant work frequent following sort guidelines. 

Sure. security theater. checking employee temperatures, even though spread Covid weeks without symptoms. require employees wear masks one wears properly usually take pull around necks 70% time. 

Some removed tables. still allow standing room sell bar capacity.  putting ""entrance only"" ""exit only"" signs promptly ignored. 

Even state shut people getting around it; restaurants saying take asking came pick food wanted dine in.

None kitchen staff wearing masks making food. 

It's security theater. 

I can't even completely blame them; LOT restaurant/bar owners lose businesses complied. margins thin work 25% capacity. governor says open they're gonna bailed capacity choice open Ignore rules. business close lives (and lives employees) ruined. 

You can't expect restaurant function 25% capacity. impossible. Either give money stay afloat surprised find loopholes keep business running. badly ventilated White House come legaly licensed epidemiologist Reddit School Virology, informed 'wait 2 weeks!' longer valid.

Therefore, possible conclusion must wait 3 weeks! think part reason spread south people take less seriously there, they're also cocky think houses apart translates less likely get virus.

These two factors together may rural areas hit way harder metro areas over. could wrong, though. We'll see. ok well fun inspecting puddles abstract calculations suggest herd immunity SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% population immune

but referring naive equation based HI achieved vaccination. body work gives estimate true CV estimates comprised 2 4, range naturally acquired immunity SARS-CoV-2 may place populations herd immunity threshold 10-20% individuals immune. wrote lot words avoid write ""I can't find any"". wanting OP punished - saying expectation sue others country everything, maybe consumer case take personal responsibility cancel non-essential vacation.

I still think is. again, read post, guy that's flight fun. guy that's flight work (there post long ago doctor flown NTC help, disgusted return flight capacity). woman go back work bar take adequate measures protect staff (or customers), student whose classes moved offline prematurely, causing outbreak. lot people real choice exposures. ignore them.

But position even people exposed connection voluntary actions still consent businesses behaving negligently. consent food poisoning eat out. need take ""personal responsibility"" medical bills restaurant poor hygiene practices?

Or virtue ""personal responsibility"" applicable places already made decision ""reasonable care"" is? Places content decision made jury representing community, feel like decision made consumers able sue business contract coronavirus from, ton places would going business.

Yes. That's less said originally. 

The normal standard would business take reasonable precautions prevent obvious hazard, would subject lawsuit. **Usually, can't run business without killing people, can't run business.** likely going permit businesses skip reasonable precautions. Sometimes, makes sense. However, case, government made clear populace protected normal legal expectations. 

But taking step back, lawsuits integral part consumer safety US, design. Consumers, even thinking things way, benefit dynamic. customer usually assumes business knows shit, business acts way harm customers customers would sue would go business (reputational concerns factor well). fact business open usually evidence decent safety practices. get food poisoning restaurant, sue they'll change practices still can, they'll go business. serve food I'm allergic to, even though requested not. roller coaster fails lose arm, sue. system works allocate risks businesses.

But business take adequate precautions prevent getting potentially deadly / debilitating disease - likely able sue. Businesses savvy, know can't sued it, much benefit thorough countermeasures gone. need it.

This whole process known (in business law) ""risk shifting."" described normal expectation risk business transaction falls. criticizing we've likely abandoned normal mechanism, ultimately foundation America's less-invasive regime regulations (see Europe other, non-litigation centered approach, results far, far regulation). risk likely shifted consumer, without consent, without letting know.

Did realize arguing invasive, European-style regulatory normal circumstances, someone sue coffee cup say ""hot"". think aspect legal system ridiculous.

Are familiar McDonald's coffee case? coffee hot nearly killed woman, requested $20,000 settlement McDonald's rejected. jury saw extent injuries (google photos skeptical), convinced McDonald's practices unconscionable, gave punitive reward, intended punish McDonalds much rewarded victim. 

McDonalds since greatly reduced temperature store serve coffee at, caused less harm customers little cost company. exactly supposed work. Dangerous practices cause injuries result lawsuits, juries determine whether practices unreasonable, safer practices result.

So aspect legal system actually finding ridiculous JURIES. made decision, make decisions personal injury lawsuits. put place ensure community say constitutes reasonable behavior. role legal process ensure community values reflected ballot box, courtroom go gym restaurant right now, taking calculated risk. business put place tons precautions, still chance could get infected.

And again, trial, jury *a legal standard reasonable care*. convince jury took reasonable care, lose lawsuit.

It's efficient system, maybe. designed fair, balance business interests people's safety. Lmao First fuck you. Second, kid rather keep home attend classes remotely send school middle fuckin pandemic. Yeah, get big fat case lobbying. 

I nothing US political system mess opinion.

Stay safe Corona Americans! Give freedom safety freedom taken back, take freedom lose life, lost.

Nobody taking shit seriously anymore. company told us gotta wear masks now, gave us signs hang door saying masks required customers, ALSO told us can't refuse business wear mask.

I large sign hung lobby saying masks required (and provided) since literally nobody reading signs door got told take down.

WHAT FUCK POINT SAYING THEY'RE REQUIRED REQUIRED. They're worried losing potential business actually caring health wellbeing employees customers. infuriating. town suddenly spiked numbers 2 weeks ago- almost ten times usual number cases. realized probably reporting properly time suddenly reported everything 1 week. So, would interview status would go days, without politics? No, think Fox News less ridiculous actual news reporting NY Post. Post worse that. definitely lower high altitude.

Even quarantine, less half people saw places like CAL Ranch Lowe‚Äôs masks on, many violating social distancing, many older folks openly coughing near employee, store items, self-check equipment. say, generally speaking, part rural America taking COVID seriously hasn‚Äôt hit us hard yet. simply give fuck. really see countries good leadership response containment virus. even need close down. like korea, germany, taiwan etc. Literally argument floridian grandpa last night insisted FL case rise ""all new yorkers brought here!""

There's need die dental pain. entire thing started ripple. again, completely missed point. google ""covid test"" first thing pops up. Pretty much universally tells stay home self quarantine 20 mins got results 2 days later online. Shitty canadian healthcare system. little background info outside Texas:

* Governor allowed bars reopen 25% capacity Friday leading Memorial Day weekend.

* recently, Reopen Texas plan moved forward phase believe bars open 50% capacity.

* Numerous counties cities recently (like last week) issued laws require businesses turn aside people mask up. That's right, laws require people mask up; require *businesses* (such bars) require customers employees mask up. (I go reasons why, they're complicated &amp; chock-full political fuckery.) That's giving interest free loan 90 days  also Governors claiming Federal level would say sending X would receive Y. Illinois Governor said one point promised N95 masks Federal Government instead received surgical masks number surgical masks well number N95 masks would received. get wrong PPE got much less expected.

the riots, good thing. yes masks running, getting tear gas fired you.. taking masks get fresh air everyone coughing. ( every protester rioted ). 

not good thing

cluster hangouts friends, chatting, coughing water went wrong pipe werent symptimatic yet carrier 

not good thing Arizonan, exhibited symptoms, isolating family since Mid-March. going stir crazy drove visit brother Colorado.

Still symptoms.

I bought bad burrito absolutely flavor, told brother‚Äôs wife could taste understandably upset. able get test next day (this last week).

I told wait 3-6 days, depending results could travel again. Two days later results came back negative.

Colorado handled pretty fast. love constant simplification statement effort demonize another person. part group claim ""All people want reopen economy care old people die."" Like much complex that, boiling offensive arching comment goes show interest listening anyone else's point own. gotta source something better NY Post though. I‚Äôm shielding myself.

Odd aboriginal people north america building statues honor war start another 345 years, society responsible genocide...

Friendly reminder vast majority civil war monuments/statues built first half last century rebuke end segregation / civil rights advancement. Yeah thing Reddit u can't say anything political. truth probably something political related crappy response virus. data could ever want, county level:

 alls input concerning news? think doom gloom, is. think supports notion short term investing therapeutics. grew NC live Los Angeles. kid, NC lost lot textile manufacturing business, lost furniture market, smoking declined tobacco cash cow started making less less and, finally, ""Bathroom Bill"" convinced bunch tech companies open shop there. state great shape economically politically. Still, everyone grew shits California even though 5th largest economy world, Silicon Valley, Hollywood, aerospace, agriculture, military. 

Denial way life South. insist way better, right even gently trying point reality met hostility. That's mentality. 

This situation going end well. Troll. 8 days old, says dumb shit Here's latest chart cases/deaths running averages North looking promising. Cases bad, especially they're asymptomatic affecting young healthy. I'd worry deaths hitting record highs. real patriots shit  3 grandparents alive beginning year. excited would get attend wedding. postpone due virus. One died month ago virus. Another way door. looking like none get see wedding day. sell now. Buy back 5 years profit. Brilliant. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* bragging high quality decisions Florida making pointed one made months ago related recent surge. way indicate internet, drop /s end disappointed lot people weekend. laws pool gathering (8 9 people) Father's Day, stayed behind comfortable. spouse still went wore mask said one person family wore one even asked to. went dad's house refused put one saying ""No! little flu gone! even around anymore""

I feel like I'm Twilight Zone episode. Well Florida 3 months pandemic well country death/million average think impetus would critics explain decisions actions aren‚Äôt proper. it'll gone 15 minutes I‚Äôve seen tape floor literally everywhere I‚Äôve gone (liquor stores, grocery stores Home Depot sub place). 100% mask usage indoors (well 90% people wearing mouth nose anyway), people serious social distancing strangers. think people relaxing bit around close friends family probably still reasonable enough keep virus check People lost jobs disproportionately renters office got work home beginning. Since June 1st, ordered 100% return work (zero remote work authorized now, despite childcare issues, health concerns, etc.) Probably people supposed to. 

I'm fearful catching COVID office now, sigh. probably safer everyone get tested. I'm sure situation is, youre going work youre everything remotely seeing friends/family person. anything pose risk anyone outside home, really get tested. coronavirus sub... I'm talking double standard following protocol guidelines... nothing politics protesting, whether support them. Essential employer first us rolling lockdowns. Work 5 days, 9 subsequent days. two months. Overnight changed 100% must comeback reopen office more. done three weeks nearly 20 people combined offices got COVID. 

So back rolling 5 on/9off lockdowns office. one dies virus. Complications virus? Yes. 

Not sure get point. That's true basic disease. Ebola, instance - die general organ failure.  need include deaths can't reasonable conversation effects illness. We're fucked. Makes sense me. never gain weight get scale, right? Ahhh. makes lot sense. 

Thanks! Seems pretty slow That's tough one...looking average several weeks adds lot variables. think reasonable graph face. Weekend low normal. Looks like easily keeping tests, get lot weekend backlog Monday. next weekend backlog comes. certainly alarm me. Perhaps treat people like criminals? Maybe pay decent wage give path citizenship? 

In experience, always good idea treat people handle food well. found 14 billion Corona aid unused Trump due testing slow initiative admitted rally. site nice quick overview state doing: look state‚Äôs percent positive rate. good indicator whether increase testing causing increase cases. I'm glad see someone taking risks sex toy accidents seriously once. believe average person take completely seriously directly affects lives whether he's someone love care getting sick something else. Oh god. It‚Äôs bad cannot simply patients tell lol Mississippi reported COVID-19 number almost week. States technical issues. Cant imagine China less anyone else tbh. Right I‚Äôd look traveling places region low case numbers. there, take advised precautions.

I know Southern Ohio Allegheny Plateau, course east ridge valley mountain system. good option great summer getaway can't use contact tracing app without turning BT, therefore location services. see articles composed yahoos websites zero credibility shared people Facebook, many people taking content gospel. It‚Äôs fair discredit media outlets actually report facts many shoddy websites reporting news actually nonfactual. 

I don‚Äôt blame media entirely. good, factual reporting going there. believe people would rather read something shocking (like people protesting mass wearing masks) actual research PPE effectiveness. That‚Äôs right. 

I guess point is, it‚Äôs shame media driven catches average ape‚Äôs eye, opposed factual possible. none regulated. New Cases &amp; Deaths decoupled month - take look graphs each. 

I've taking evidence death related numbers manipulated. best evidence severity point probably hospitalizations affected testing numbers easily falsified/erroneous deaths. Yep. wonder many back admit wrong undocumented alien/immigrant. unauthorized alien/immigrant.

I understand say, I'm asking consider want say implications behind choosing ""undocumented"" ""illegal""

I absolutely would use term illegal driver someone driving license illegal substance user someone taking methadone without prescription. want call someone undocumented drug user? meth dealer undocumented chemist? use term ""undocumented"" illegal activity sometimes legal?

Why would call immigrant who's status immigrant illegal illegal immigrant? would consciously go way avoid terminology? Average age death 82 multiple co-morbidities. set mind ease Even outdoors people wearing masks. Went hiking last week good portion people would slip mask passed someone trail. Probably completely unnecessary forum nice see people taking seriously Nothing else do. decision made. Omg thank much mean imply matter he's allowed it.

I meant say literally told random people vicinity probably dumb enough think would happen. people actually charge reach. Damn read references. say exact opposite you‚Äôre saying.

Maybe stop smoking weed yourself. Thanks helping everyone stay safe. Safety politics every time. trip Amsterdam July booked last year still on!? surprised anyone decides work unsafe conditions. flu killing more

Nope. 2019 flu deaths estimated around 24,000 - 62,000. Best estimates Corona puts around 200,000 EOY. hope Corona silverlining turn things arround guys. 

If pandemic cant change things dont know will. really think solid proof? Maybe give proof much credit on. equal date publishing happened grammar? sounds like WANT believe something. Look ye shall find? Immediate, almost impossible. medium incubation period 5 days people start becoming contagious 2 days prior symptoms onset, average people would become infectious 3 days exposure. America *given up* problem - largely, never tried seriously first place. never semblance actual cohesive effort combat situation honest think ever would been.

The US never faced war soil, never mass tragedy soil, grown become largest consumer-driven nation full spoiled brats world ever seen. entirely materialistic anyone under, say, 50 years age (largely) never told word ""no"" wanting do/see/get something. I'm sorry, (again, largely) harsh truth.

Another Memphian here, don‚Äôt think really giving whole perspective. right‚Äî people don‚Äôt care, however;

Yes, lot businesses open, lot still closed open pick-up/outside eating. open, ZERO requirement wear mask eating, it‚Äôs difficult thing do, obviously. However, news group went around town found restaurants bad job figuring employees properly masks. Drive area patios look patrons clumped together appearing give damn proximity others. (Second Line, I‚Äôm really looking you, single table looked removed occupied mask sight, tisk tisk!)

While yes, less likely contract virus outside, doesn‚Äôt mean going get it. 

And then, let‚Äôs chat folks waiting get seat restaurants. drove Madison way home Saturday around dinner time, MANY PEOPLE cavalier grouping talking. 40-50 people waiting waking outside, saw 2 separate couples walking away area wearing masks, along protestors front PP. one employees (and aforementioned) wearing masks whole Overton Square area. 

Most grocery stores aren‚Äôt enforcing use mask. home improvement stores aren‚Äôt enforcing use mask. Walgreens isn‚Äôt even enforcing it. good say, need let businesses open better? That‚Äôs statement half-assed it‚Äôs like Trump saying test less, less cases. Seriously‚Äî NOTHING expecting businesses enforce masks issued ordinance, you‚Äôre right, it‚Äôs going HORRIBLE nightmare enforce, going it? excellent point.  someone link research article? placed ban testing? actually told CDC official statement, ‚ÄúStop making tests numbers high‚Äù? that, actions aren‚Äôt contradicting anything. says guy made assertion June 1 article, I'm sorry T-D-S.

I question vaccine, since it‚Äôs completely new method. lot news reporting vaccine available end year purely drive stock prices certain companies. Vaccines develop research safely historical taken 40/30... 10 years develop. 2%? 80's? means definitely true, right? People's personal stories worth listening case studies completed yet. /s True, bit know low accuracy enough testing I‚Äôm sorry :( lot take on. Yep. CMS requiring stricter reporting &amp; inspections nursing homes, threat withholding Medicare/Medicaid funding, states mostly gotten acts together nursing-home front.

i wish would/could randomly test hundred thousand people per day, split zip code demographic like political polling give us idea antibodies and/or positive tests. use bit way find outbreaks fast 7th/8th highest deaths per capita?

They can't stay closed safety without losing business. can't open business safely within guidelines without ALSO losing business. 

Not mention attempting follow protocol quickly overrun customers; because, news flash, business owner keeping place open, customers. 
 
People FLOODING businesses. reached 3 different managers bars restaurants see could come work. hired text message customers going droves. 

I'm sick people blaming owners servers. customers dont care wellbeing, customers keeping places open, government making impossible safely close without costing jobs livelihoods millions.  could always add like, like they're hiding asymptomatic carrier count.

TBH know factor testing cases actual cases - early estimates 10 actual cases every confirmed case. suspect somewhere 6-8 actual cases every case tested.

But agree number one factor, percentages look reasonable. happened anything ever? No!!! Stay inside FOREVER!!!!!!! posted above, people checked damage?  entirely possible long term issues like lung damage vascular damage even without symptoms mild symptoms.

""I feel like before"" really proof anything. guess going learn it‚Äôs hoax hard way. Europe public sector unions issues unemployment system hard hit this. Probably could people answering phones, legitimately. Looks like it. Looks like it‚Äôs adjusted Far southwest? NW Arkansas huge outbreak ‚Äî bad enough CDC sent staff attempt slowing down. think little much focus immunity aspect sorts findings. well established studies mean people become immune, stay immune.

But overlooked affect antibody testing used determine prevalence. 1 10 people antibody levels drop undetectable level within two months, kind antibody testing done miss 10% infections.

Those people know ever SARS-COV-2, thus assume still susceptible. Absolutely get tested. funny PRC count asymptomatic patients coronavirus count. No, there's timely way tell asymptomatic presymptomatic, yes there's way sure infectious asymptomatic carriers assumed treated presymptomatic.

I think countries count asymptomatic carriers separately confirmed causes, time good test determine asymptomatic presymptomatic, would make sense either three different classifications, count presymnptomatic confirmed cases keep asymptomatic carrier separate category.

And no, indication pointing true asymptomatic carriers infectious. problem is, problem difficulties telling asymptomatic carriers apart pre-symptomatic infected. forget regular Corona lime thought anyone understood dangerous ripples growing exponentially, clearly wrong. clear, Mira Costa LA County serves affluent beach community get apartment right around $1m. I‚Äôm AZ, city rapid tests typically wait 7-10 days get results. that‚Äôs top waiting 3-4 days appointment get tested.

I grew Howard Co Maryland. public schools fantastic well funded, national test scores coming Howard Co always good. great teachers.

Next county Prince George's Co. schools, like entire county itself, struggling money. national test scores reflect that. Sure...  guess weird way feel kind insulted condescended even tried. seems like thought figure truth would conveniently let slide many flaws Americans have, one good thing us question taught think critically. Americans enough us make difference. Schools teach us think critically. know took us for... 

I really expect lot ministration political side. expected people claim scientists higher amount respect world science world politics beard think that's also POed. lot people still deny science giving fuel fire. Im disappointed organizations. feel need extremist: perfect think none be. support people, companies, ngos etc (to knowledge) scummy things think wrong.


I belive could work right world interconnected interdependent: enough people act following conscience bad apples could least minimized.


Maybe fantasy. Maybe not. Certainly wait others think done partake actions think wrong: wait official lockdown shut business (and particulary virtuos: almost everyone live same) time think authorities keept business shut long. It‚Äôs cool. common misconception. didn‚Äôt know lived there. lot media far right media. world available information. literally months behind something? ‚ÄúI said two weeks ago trend here,‚Äù Ducey said June 17 presenting chart daily new cases across state. ‚ÄúLooking last two weeks data, trend. trend headed wrong direction actions we‚Äôre going take intended change direction reverse trend.‚Äù often get number later next day might still some, looking graphs vsry comforting. I've feeling anxious us wearing masks reason guess we're something right. seeing massive spikes Pennsylvania New York then? That's even difficult explain. non n95 better mask wearing help directly nearly much people wearing masks do. extremely difficult understand half population 100IQ less, that's care enough others.

This I've told keep repeating..

The virus mostly spreads aerosol, needs get away face that, aerosol form air totally pass homemade masks much faster n95 better mask would allow. 

Do right thing. recommend getting interested grad school unions, going need them. Let's hide deaths instead addressing problem I'm starting truly think officials like forcibally removed office endangering welfare citizens... state business got trouble requiring workers still go work even tested positive. said workers need wear mask everything fine. many dumb people. immune mean capable spreading around. Virus organic living. here, level productivity night day. children home, colleagues... organizing meetings trying accomplish things team nightmare. office everyone part focused getting need done overall much smoother. thrilled back office. death numbers are?? You‚Äôre welcome. Oh paid sick leave. stay home could. That‚Äôs really Dutch mentality. used go work even could. now. work stay home. feel you, mom also working hospital. beginning pandemic uncertainty quite stressful. Fortunately know virus effective ways dealing it. Wish best, hope find peace mind despite shit show around. Update story... coming soon r/LeopardsAteMyFace I‚Äôm saying people aren‚Äôt dying it.
I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs crazy they‚Äôre adding deaths ‚Äúcovid 19‚Äù died causes. 

Around atleast. 400 500 deaths. Came nursing homes. hospice centers, obviously hits vulnerable areas. It‚Äôs gonna damage. overall. wonder many deaths listed covid. actually died stuff. I‚Äôm saying. support roast. hate people risk?! /s

I‚Äôm boat, like rewrite comments read elsewhere hear. People need chill virus let economy go safety precautions place that‚Äôs it. lockdowns. world quarantine entire U.S. Brazil. Problem solved. Shit like law. Obvious conflict interest catch 22

Fuck catch 22s purposely create inequality society Protesting get killed vs ""protesting"" order graduating ceremony wildly different end goals. Plus BLM protesters best mask socially distance, unlike graduation class. You‚Äôre comparing Korea country one worst responses beginning. countries around Asia like Taiwan, Vietnam, Myanmar Thailand done much better, eradicated close eradicated virus. 20 states last week 10 got better sudden? truly dont know believe anymore. Big whoop. Let people enjoy summer Philly can‚Äôt go Target grocery store without mask. travel work see Targets states signs ‚Äúsuggest‚Äù wear mask. Philly says order health departments, must wear masks. It‚Äôs stupid anti-government people feeling like death camp wear mask. FFS.  question... people die home (not elder care facility hospital) counted stats? I'm trying find exactly count COVID deaths, found anything yet. wonder come across official definition?

The reason ask is, articles linked seem suggest quite people might dying homes, wonder telling people stay home affect reducing official death counts...

The closest got statistics show number people confirmed covid-19 died, regardless cause death. 

 

I would suspect people died home would tested thus would show FHM statistics COVID-19 death.  Totally agree, location services would fantastic use modern technology public health sense. However, issue becomes muddled world HIPAA privacy issues. I'm saying midst pandemic time attempt retrofit system needs. Lacking appropriate infrastructure onset major reason mess begin with.

If effectively contact traced beginning, conjunction widespread border closure mass quarantine efforts, would mitigated spread. that. house parties, PACKED BARS. LOL. time go home Thanksgiving give third wave relatives. Right? full fox news rhetoric. cares virus long blame liberal elites! bet certainly didnt help Spring break helped out. said thing [in [in People comparing car crashes global level compare this. think vaccine significant treatment likely. point surface transmission unlikely, means wearing masks best way mitigate spread. many critical cases requiring medical treatment would good data accompany spike cases numbers. kind go together changes and/or increases testing could make positive cases increase. Well, I'm right stay tf home, guess. Dark orange, miles red.
And hardly anyone wears masks. saying 1/3 far asymptomatic, guess sounds low bad....but 2 million tests theoretically 40 million infections i'd say least symptoms lol

i'm sure serology pointing since cdc would indicate 10% US infection serology tests truly random come close that, even worst hit cities close that, generally testing blood donors about.  please tell idiot re-election year florida get rid him...please...... Great thing higher brain function ability override instincts. things like make wonder majority humanity actually higher brain function we're mostly still dumb apes. Born raised Miami didnt realize distinction right now.

Granted, I've always hated going beach almost never went there, moved God forsaken city soon could graduating high school, still. God damn. Unfortunately people wont change less respectful position challenged. That's happens statistician make graphics instead data visualization expert. went six cases per day 2000 tests 130 cases per 2000 thousand tests. 

It's purely hypothetical say rise infections anything this. That‚Äôs happens there‚Äôs art class since February

Collages suffer Ohio's numbers came significantly average 700 new cases today. marks fifth day row average case counts Ohio. turned hospitalizations yet, I'm wondering start Ohio joining growing trend increases around country.

With long open surprising tame thus far. Here's hoping I'm wrong! It'll last long enough create huge increase cases real benefit. We'll end right back started nothing show it. Pretty much like half assed, rushed plans. success shooting kind logic relative wanted things open back (didn't change mind opening up, got stop repeating infuriating line thought) asking want open up? Worst happens lose house, become homeless, die streets - that's fate there's nothing worry?

You basically stop caring argument making much sense want use ""logic"" them. Sharknado glimpse future along. they'll feast! Everyone get Ian Zierings chainsaws ready. happened demoralized people. Mass shootings proved this. would think pandemic would changed people's mind even though two significant endemics like Opiod crisis mass shootings. 

We made bed going sleep it. Pretty cat pretty cat.... Yup, sadly big numbers hard humans comprehend become statistic. Like quote goes, people dying tragedy, million people dying statistic. mean patients vents then? Remember end day decision take visit. husband chosen side this. Lots families seeing eachother right without problem. furious want, control person planet besides yourself. choose keep daughter away grandparents went lunch, choice. personally that. 

You've set fierce limitations. decision make. remember made end day. 

I know CV sub, guys circle jerk shit extreme, is. I'm PA we're green declining. Lunch ridiculous idk are. works decades, think accelerated around 9/11 around Obama's election blowup smartphones. That's country developed ravenous appetite constant news, leaving us ripe manipulation.

Just take Oh! That's great news. came New Yorkers, Floridians totally hook. relax. *They* bring there. /s That‚Äôs fine choice right there! Indeed.

The rules sub continue suck mods made clear democracy. cannot vote it.

And made case repeatedly dangerous prevent political discussion pandemic systemic response implemented politicians. Systemic responses policies.

We're subjected dozens articles political leaders failing even quoting articles violate sub rules.

That's dumb rules are. I'm essential worker Florida...... Help. work SyFy? EU countries much like US states, especially given US federal government much.  Ha! Ya right. I‚Äôm waiting 2 weeks 4th July. Y‚Äôall know it‚Äôs going bad then. friend,

Everyone father, mother, daughter son. every single one left someone mourning. second wave going brutal. would stand gain make decision think compelled government anything bad wrong evil, even literally saving lives minimal effort. Ouuuu 'soup√ßon' nice. guys use English too? That's cool. article says doctors believe virus dormant re-emerged (I.e. wasn‚Äôt fully it). may really catch twice. point rarely reported suggest result false positive one end other, dormancy. agree would take extra effort children uneducated parents reduction physical location costs think could afford improve student teacher ratios. would nice see 10/1 classroom size. would allow lot personal help needed. 

What did, looking teaching styles, walking things questions already much kids receive standard school setting country we're already falling far behind rest world. agree everything said, ‚ÄúCampus Plague‚Äù goes around yearly atleast freshman year, think basically everyone floor got missed week lol. used sick one week semester (if more). think flu freshman year, strep throat sophomore year.

The question sick long college aged students getting covid sick? So, intending use CDC ""best guess"" official capacity suggest know therefore basically everyone NYC exposed. know anything, interesting numbers match well explanation seems like believable one - - rather lockdowns finally saved them. 

The U.S. 50 states take 50 different approaches virus lockdowns. dust settled, analyze suspect find things wrong things right things ultimately help - think sure know yet.

As lab results study presented would 5% fatality rate, would suggest - again, expert - would likely get tested likely serious symptoms. people also likely associated way higher risk. likely tested someone got sick got never got tested, less likely find someone dead seriously ill hospital respiratory disease go verify coronavirus. is, way people tested confirmed cases tested would always include worst cases never mildest.

I know lot people say testing would better numbers, honestly know supposed pull affordably without introducing risk accidentally seriously spreading disease. Yes, agree.

Overall, agree people risk low. many many people contract it‚Äôs through. also exactly linear given resources available hospital space.

If 500 beds go hospitalized 100-200 cases, deaths going double. 500 beds go 400-800 cases, deaths going explode. China well according China Proof virus give much shit ones age.

Unless wearing N95 mask stopping virus coming system people around you. mask still greatly lower distance spray sneeze, cough simply speak leading much lower chance infecting people around you. everyone needs wearing them. 

Now said, polyester vs cotton. personal opinion: much likely wear mask keep wearing comfortable wear easy breath in. wearing polyester mask face constantly sweating, find hard breath..ext much likely wear take thing much sooner should. rather everyone wear cotton mask even alittle bit inferior someone wearing anything all. remember everyone saying ""we even hit 60k deaths, even bad flu"" changed ""we might hit 100k end year worse flu, comparable, old people dying"" currently ""it's going 150k end year, look deaths lockdowns caused!""

edit : unless get sack.  think many.

I think they're mostly fake astroturf accounts. really. Ducey piece shit want anything. say cities decide wanted mandate soon cities jumped board mostly realized happened weeks/months ago. 
 
If actually cared would made mandate state wide. Instead let cities works take credit saying made decision, say ""don't look me, mayor's decision"". people still legit believe Coronavirus hoax made dems everything happend Italy, Spain, etc fake news. dumb He's not. are.

How tell us think goal is?

We know ""slow spread"" part...but that's get goal, goal itself.

What is/was Tegnell's final goal? ""end game""?  So, people die Sweden, prove right belief acted stupidly made wrong choice? 

Wow. Upon admission, chest computed tomography (CT) scans showed focal ground-glass opacities 11 asymptomatic individuals (11/37, 29.7%) stripe shadows and/or diffuse consolidation ten individuals (10/37, 27.0%), whereas 16 individuals (16/37, 43.2%) abnormalities Five individuals developed focal ground-glass opacities stripe shadows chest CT within 5 hospital admission. pleural effusions, air bronchogram signs enlarged lymph nodes, typical changes seen critically symptomatic patients

I‚Äôm sure would even close then. hardly closed first place. would know pandemic here. paleo subreddits anytime discussion came gmo crops (like Roundup-resistant crops could sprayed kill crop) Maybe keep COVID people isolated single area hospital instead spread hospital. Since require ICU go ICU, need level care use facilities ICU provides use like regular bed.

Seems fishy me. DeSantis implying happens like they're ICU matter convenience, necessity, ICU bed needed guess could put somewhere else.

Given DeSantis 0 trust built reason believe he's telling truth. I'm arguing that. argument herd immunity achieved, COVID capable it. simply calling bullshit think 2 million dead realistic. reach minimum requirements herd immunity means 1 million dead US alone. What....ho.....???

I'm tired avoid talking certain things people afraid assholes get pissed off. first one ever end States? one discussion started abortion discussion someone mentioned Monsanto tangent. 

It like, ""Oh, another clinic closing Texas.""

""But still use Monsanto.""

And like several random accounts immediately swarmed thread say, ""Do know Roundup safe used properly?""

They bots clear job.

Entire sub rules changed that. didn‚Äôt cause spikes DERP DERP.

People U.S. dont seek medical attention tests moment get sick like might countries. delay, delay, delay. extremely sick getting better. 

Consequences broken profit healthcare system. moved universal healthcare like entire rest developed world. U.S. government screwed us opening early. plenty money could helped Americans till virus died more, no, wanted everybody back work. Think people died social security, disability. much money think government saving people dying? believe everyone U.S, tested, whether money not. virus done got hand, thanks Stupid President, making people believe big deal, wear masks! know understand, kept getting virus many people around gotten it?

What cars this?! overblown protests too, seems like outdoor transmission extremely low regardless you‚Äôre doing. Michigan protestors weren‚Äôt actually killing grandma. Masks also worn protestors, health reasons, anonymity/protection. know one thing it‚Äôs masks work. People packing bars restaurants (indoors course) wearing masks, different outcome.  MAKKERS! TREKT DEN STRAATEN IN! Ha, imagine thinking ""rite passage"" protest systemic racism.  [Data Texas‚Äô cases, hospitalizations, positivity rate, daily testing capacity, deaths increased 100% since Memorial Day, definitely worrisome trend. So? goal ""flatten curve"" allow hospitals reach capacity ventilators. never happened. gives shit we're moving towards heard immunity bad want be.

Literally everyday wish people would die Covid say told justify living little fucking bubble media made you. happening, people want live. dad 60s wear mask give shit thinks corona bad, wants live. going die one way another might well enjoy rather live bubble never experience life that's death itself. says, he's 60s could die tomorrow heart attack anything, spend full year living may many years left? can't really argue viewpoint all. Gotta manipulate numbers I'm working home right refuse leave house except groceries maybe dates. plan financially support places reopen safe. Hopefully companies open soon go bankrupt companies intelligent remain next year. Exactly. actual city small party city 4.5x times population pollute slightly US.. weak take. also literally tell population ‚Äòfrom pollution‚Äô, they‚Äôd it. It‚Äôs far less gradual process democratic countries.

Furthermore, accept climate change real, think it‚Äôs unfair stop industrialisation whilst west could whatever centuries, signed Paris accords. 

The US shit without china. Let‚Äôs it. Let‚Äôs show better. definitional change seems like wink-and-a-nod reporters go ahead fudge numbers needed.

EDIT: even done good reason still sus stupid switch metric halfway spike lol Nice way around. Classy even. would argue South Korean policy good, second ""wave"" (which much sea) result fact virus contagious going see single linear fallback complex system heavily hit country manage completely erase virus. still significantly mitigated South Korea. wave much manageable context likely become period heavily uncontrolled spread ala Lombardy, NY, London, Madrid etc.. stupid are. 

All federal government press pause 6 months. 

And people stop shopping crap 6 months.

Instead mess 3 months. official. Society joke.

Simple activities easy teamwork became desperation, despair, complaints. believe really complaining wearing mask? Every freaking Winter wear something around nose, hands, face. mean offend intelligence, time, also care long googling fearing virus early got masks cared ""before cool"". 

Calm second think, overall, saying thing. stupid stupid make broad statement position.

Yes.

I criticizing S.G. used short-form social media make announcement think saying whom... Trump-vented immediate anger thoughts running head. also criticizing dangerously media outlets continue let misinformation echo order get reaction people, regardless whether could literally cost real human lives. pick post, entirely point. sorry confusion.

&amp;#x200B;

I commenting add clarity intention not. calling personal intelligence, whoever are. 

The SG described valved N95 masks pissed different variants, come fitted sizes intended one-time use. real use-case difference valved unvalved N95 masks medical masks old face covering. get much cheaper equally effective masks, even reusable ones wandering around outside public. suggested alternative face coverings assumed people know cover mouths noses concerned germs. think still spreading information know it. People STILL TODAY idiots this. 

He probably done LOT differently. didn't. another human stressed pissed people selfish shitty time. never intended explain people ""face-covering"" works, probably never thought needed to. wish lived world still need someone teach us basic thing. 

You least see ridiculousness here... people plain thinking saw outburst Twitter (or likely news story tweets) figured suddenly bad idea cover mouth nose order help curb spread germs/bacteria/viruses coming going to/from body... something teaching kids universally decades. 

&amp;#x200B;

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

...But really truly want make personal reason, seems might:

 were/are hoarding valved N95 masks bulk sitting waiting world end, wearing grocery store could worn literally face-covering, bandana even, order safe, local hospital friends, mom, brother-in-law re-using masks, forced wear far less comfortable masks entire shift able wear masks screening angry, fevered, sweaty, coughing people COVID-19 sleeping break room couches friends places bring anything home kids... Surgeon General yelling specifically you, even yelling belligerent incomplete grammatically. cooler buying masks need others did. stand behind that. cool take poorly place broad statement word word literally create anger him.

If that... talking you. I'll never know. medical professional ever intended person covering face prevent spread germs. EVEN someone truly mean say this... absolutely know better enough ignore quickly blinking.  exactly outcome warned about. Pre-print here: Probably first three along bathrooms retail stores. doubt many contracted actual beach, dozens places may contracted it. Yeah, get lot worse. used RDT tests (BioMedomics particular used high percentage tests, 90% specificity poor FDA revoked use). ELISA tests (MUCH accurate) used significant quantity study everyone quotes ‚Äú25% NYC infected‚Äù. Anecdotally, least dozen physicians work tested positive initial tests antibodies (for study). Upon re-test another type test (ELISA), tested negative. could right. Masks 100% preventative. need take account people entire states gone back ""normal"" soon. second wave coming. What?! Florida Man evolving! FWIW, graphs consistent US flattening curve, Europe failing flatten curve (that lower peak).  


As recall, stated goal never suppressing virus, rather flattening curve avoid hospitals overwhelmed.  


IF hospitals overwhelmed end game get herd immunity people dying possible, US graph acceptable. everyone work home. small businesses employ lot people. Huge protests thousands ok opening small businesses not? boredom, paying bills food.  hear next wave layoffs white collar jobs. 

Can‚Äôt shut economy months without consequences. already flatten curve enough give time hospitals prepare can‚Äôt stop it.  way stop spread without vaccine. least 18 months lucky. 

Great Depression here. unemployment PPP runs out.... layoffs bankruptcies. job safe. New Jersey alone tax revenue collapse 30%. Going get worse. appears need restart elementary school one sentence coherent thoughts make sense fortunate group negatively affected (yet). Husband works home now. I'm introvert loves big social gatherings attend year. used extra time home learn bake bread cook new dishes. learned love cutting kids hair home think looks better take hairdresser.   

If husband lost job someone love lost life virus would obviously fall unhappy category far empathize have. breaks heart read lives lost horrible virus. worst part personally single date night babysitter 100 days really cant complain. many worse situations. Love kids try cherish every moment them. Plenty mild cases hospitalization long term symptoms. See subreddit r/covid19positive  would think depends experiences age. many/most ""normal"" isolated estranged.  understand happens hospitals fill right? politicians know people dumb still opted herd immunity.

Get past fourth-grade reading level won‚Äôt. seems like bad contract. lie. Belgian wish people common sense have. Countries gonna stay semi-lockdown months stupidity youth. Telling Joe Rogan even turned wearing mask issue masculinity manliness. took Bill Burr calling BS. forget elk meat! fact every where. source article (WSJ) used data 11,700 tests Minneapolis, NYC, ‚Äúother‚Äù areas. walkup sites, self selective. NYC tracers cannot ask person attended protest also said people hesitant give personal information around. saying protests lead outbreak (more already occurring), studies indicate won‚Äôt. United? Hah.

Its 50 seperate states tied together string always been. like someone told people slow testing..... Hmm heard recently.... So, T's plan slow testing, actually desired effect, reducing number cases get counted. /s

Too bad virus know count.  knows multiply. ""If second wave coronavirus pandemic hit tomorrow""

She lost credibility first line. really shit editors try pass lead nowadays? really think one day second wave show where? joke. way supposed work. Re-open stages go back data suggests problem. Wearing mask difficult anyone, consideration part Americans trouble with. I've basically grocery store runs occasional march months now, people ""essential"" must protected, there's way I'm expanding upon self lockdown anytime soon. getting ridiculous here. horseshit, even hunter gatherers live around 75, mountain easily researched data proving this, simply google search turn plenty easy-to-parse results. living gold age conquered aging point extended human life span. made early teen years, mostly fine. Trouble is, selected mostly healthy people, sort serious illness early life, survive. refused anything enclosed spaces least past three months. soon cleared work home, also stopped going grocery store. didn‚Äôt jack shit anyway broke. first month notched shown spread mostly others much spread touching objects. ive I‚Äôve actively avoided people. Getting groceries delivered, working home, eating out, getting food delivered. exception called work hospital processing covid tests peak here, last peak guess (Florida). Two days past three months I‚Äôve contact husband pretty much stayed house. really hope I‚Äôm extended work home indefinitely. can't tell serious Right! might think get tested!

You look computer work hospital though. There‚Äôs weird wall silence. It‚Äôs secret info took offline. reason. Israel. think used R words explain political. Deaths aren‚Äôt increasing California. They‚Äôve going down. 

This increase positive cases mostly coming Los Angeles. LA hasn‚Äôt opened bars restaurants like parts California. positive tests likely protests last three weeks. it‚Äôs mostly young healthy people. think it‚Äôs silly word , Hispanic Latino works fine , reason create new words people end using google figure . And? Lower antibody titres suggest reinfection possible. authors state explicitly. agree seems late turn back now. federal many state governments failed terribly, irresponsible populace (not everyone sizeable). going ride virus. cant shut things back down. country already disarray economically unemployment, civil unrest etc. get saying, 10 percent way high. Even hospitals overrun death rate reach 10 percent population. That's sad state affairs couch sentiment watered language fear banned, especially want people endangering vast numbers American lives unable endanger more. seriously feel like lost brain cells reading brilliant plan there...nothing makes goddamn sense Well protests probably lot spike City near Rotterdam. Yeah directly address people violating rules, gonna get backlash; that's cultural thing think, people like act up. 

On hand, actively give shit measures, people definitely judge (in typical indirect Dutch way) 250k dead election Nice trap there. This, current state politics. politicisation EVERYTHING, including fucking VIRUS, done horrible things country.

Coronavirus politicized second president spoke it, media exacerbated inflamed it. need rethink incentive structure mass media, getting paid attention makes seek attention honesty 500 new cases San Antonio today. numbers right. record, hilariously stupid slapfight I've read long time. late always impossibility election year. bought new construction home DFW. started looking used homes selling within week. inventory bunch buyers. Exactly. people want work here, work hard net benefit economy, documented probably would pay even taxes (they actually pay lot now).


Just make citizens. thing way nativism. 'do harm'  That;s dont believe studies virus that's three four months old may surprise, patient ICU bed, require ""intensive level care"".

I sure hope someone makes point loud clear press. appreciate trying play ‚Äúwell actually‚Äù it‚Äôs really NEEDED here. Thanks! interesting case study much random chance affect outbreaks; part problem Quebec's march break earlier rest country's, people really knew covid taking precautions. everywhere anyone's even realised problem right, beaches served safe place allow people moments outdoor activity county. Except crazy spring break type activity limited problem spots, beaches great safe way make life little better time. simply say, we're exercising right peacefully assemble celebrate high school graduation, party guise protesting basic human rights? ICU beds dont need need Intensive Care? literally name unit Doctors- ‚ÄúSweaty think admitted ICU‚Äù information found twitter news articles yet written this: idiots get sick result stupidity carelessness infect others including doctors nurses still try save lives. agree others described parts similar nicely detailed. guess part don‚Äôt fully comprehend US government used emergency powers modify/change existing infrastructure negotiate additional/alternative resourcing

That is, PPE appear high priority US government one might hope. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs many details I‚Äôm aware of. average lay person, like myself, wonder response seems lackluster. keep reading PPE shortages see little reporting solutions put place increase PPE. you‚Äôre Florida right it‚Äôs good idea start locking much possible Even Arizona went another harsh lockdown today, they‚Äôre level cases community spread they‚Äôd probably still end capacity. NEVER said thought virus would go away. made gigantic, wrong, ridiculous assumption. common cold coronavirus. Coronaviruses don‚Äôt tend disappear. 

We do, however, thing called SCIENCE. We‚Äôll vaccine least find way ameliorate severity covid. meantime, everyone‚Äôs behavior change. wear masks social distance aren‚Äôt home. different wearing seatbelt driving drunk.

I asthma. I‚Äôm immunocompromised. LIKE alive. don‚Äôt leave yard right jerks refuse wear masks social distance middle pandemic.

People freaking consuming horrible news endlessly, that's message, nothing wearing wearing masks.

At least see 80% population wearing face mask. clear, europe counted single state, like USA, (Europe) would far ahead first place run. Thanks reply. Busy day can‚Äôt keep going here. good one. Yeah 2 huge countries shit bed re: corona control eventually affect rest world given enough time. definitely wish US, can't pretend problems become world's soon enough. kinda hard say point.

This disease causes pneumonia, people get pneumonia, feel effects months afterwards. pretty normal. order refute premise OP article. Many, enough. BLM protest past Friday. 25% masks. Thousands people literally next other, people sitting shoulders, etc. So, yes, words they're brushing under.

Thank confirming it. good one. live? I'm amsterdam experience, 'karen' gonna scream people keep distance. Also cite source numbers... shit graphic overall may state opinion. Mouth Sorry think thoughts pandemic summed 3 sentence comment reddit.com furious. 6 month old hasn‚Äôt seen grandparents since February (we live town). made plans go visit next week long precautions put place her. haven‚Äôt left house except essential items, asked 4 grandparents same. said absolutely, whatever see her. dad big card player, buddies asking come back since things opened keeps telling wants see granddaughter. mother‚Äôs friends meeting go lunch hasn‚Äôt taken part knows it‚Äôs important us keep baby safe.

Well, today daughter wearing new outfit mother law bought her. husband working home break meetings, called mother show outfit. didn‚Äôt realize FaceTime call (she held ear). swung phone around, saw lunch sister, cousin, two friends. 

My husband furious got phone said can‚Äôt go. I‚Äôm really pissed disappointed trip got ruined. feel awful daughter isn‚Äôt getting know grandparents. feel like she‚Äôs missing essential social experiences important development. don‚Äôt want end scared people ever parents since 3 months old. imagine she‚Äôs going say tonight husband tells we‚Äôre coming.

I‚Äôm frustrated this. We‚Äôve everything way we‚Äôre supposed to. covid largely news everything opening back up, people throwing caution wind acting like it‚Äôs ok. cases spiking we‚Äôre going get second wave. we‚Äôre gonna get hit even harder. probably won‚Äôt even get go home Christmas it‚Äôs certainly going gone then. 

I‚Äôm angry sad didn‚Äôt know else write it. really pisses hell money going, staffing training. think problem would bad leeches system siphoning funds. I'm industry, though, know fix it. opinion gotten tested &amp; cleared negative hopping plane. especially true 30 likely asymptomatic. States trying control spread, really hard open interstate borders. individuals part make sure introduce community spread another state, particularly rural small town limited hospital resources. constantly move goal post. Personally thought 100,000 considered huge failure. guarantee million people could wind dead retort going tiny fraction population old people.

They give damn someone close dies. Thanks shutting ""all lives matter"" esque comment down. see. Still, imagine number people sort keep phones locked even use bluetooth headphones would change settings specifically enable contract tracing. Even knowing Google Apple tracking us much possibly can, think specific app sort trick Google Apple get slightly tracking information. Sounds reasonable.

I tickets big festival Netherlands year called Defqon.1 got postponed next year. really hope Netherlands control virus party next year. safe fly without masks, safe fly them. mask obsession gives people false sense security read stories infection people wondering ""but everyone wore masks, happen"".

I used fly ~30 legs per year, planning flying pandemics over. I've seen photo never noticed person second left covering nose mask, making whole point wearing one completely pointless. Get fuck saying don‚Äôt understand this. I‚Äôve following since December, actually got N95s MONTHS people gave shit know exactly said did. stupid stupid make broad statement position imagine kids wouldn‚Äôt vegetables. LOL I‚Äôm alright home cat guitar. TIL ty probably encountered hundreds thousands people past month.

As all. sure point is, describe luck. virus different respiratory transmitted virus, nobody immunity exposed, spreads easily. Yeah, seem like it, sure better info somewhere. says updated June. good news? remember thinking originally loss smell could indicative neurologic impact Covid. wonder Keep feeling dread, best motivation keep behaviour safe. I'm terrified disease sheer terror keeping elderly parents behaving safely wife wearing N95 mask public well. cases city last week.  First thought said Lisa Kudrow wondered wth knows coronavirus. What? I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre best rn I‚Äôm impressed waited whole 30 days respond comment! 

If good talking 3,100 deaths Florida vs 30k deaths NY? 

Sure cases death rates haven‚Äôt gone all. Plus since younger people main ones getting infected I‚Äôm worried spike deaths this. 

That younger infected smart enough stay away elderly population Like said, googling. case others widely reported. ‚ÄúGreg Abbott, governor Texas, said last week people 30 made majority new coronavirus cases several counties. ‚Äú Maybe different region enforced overall. area, masks required public awhile, protesters also wearing them. go work, (4 hours home) nobody wears stores, even though supposed to. many protests area BLM, can't really say wearing them. 2A 'reopen state' protests explicitly not. reasonable? Hard speak smaller companies know really leaned towards playing safe. I‚Äôm referring past month protesting it‚Äôs likely even masks on, people exposed virus due close proximity marches. LA indeed opened restaurants dine-in service! vast majority spacing tables far enough apart, require servers masked. county health department admits problem time &amp; eateries come compliance new health ordinances become norm. Unfortunately, allows virus explode mean time. expected people frequently young people Can't second wave first one never stops. gonna big numbers finally get working 200,000 people died already Florida 2018 200,000 died whole year? gotta slow testing! know many lives would save cases would find spent much! need save money spend wall! Inject bleech! Shove UV lights ass!  people subreddit think 7B people Earth second? disease spreading wildly many populous countries like Brazil, Mexico Pakistan. usually around $100 per shot  first wave turning tsunami. Prisoners jobs. Staff repeating president saying. sure enough Virginia either, nice knowing distinction. :) reliable source? linked propaganda website Total cases USA ‚Äúspiking‚Äù deaths continue decline. spite increased testing. data trends decades tracked CDC.

So would say empirical evidence. Rarely fatal flu like symptoms happen every year. Ask Enron predictions worked out.... thanks venting. relate somewhat, kid seen one grandparents this, can't imagine grandparent side things willing something simple stay home sad situation. *Spews bullshit try calm panicked investors* Austin, TX, quite dramatic spike.

Up middle last week, number cases per day growing, slow steady growth. generally ranging 75 150 cases per day.

Then one day 200 new cases. days later, 400 new cases. yesterday 500 new cases.

So basically, less week, number new cases become 3-5 times was.

(Data  Get N95 mask P100 respirator, prepare feel silly wear keep safe. course, old give damn people think maybe easier say do. Hans gets it, spread word! Misinformation killing us! god save them... worry all... Also jesus christ white house put spike crown.... refused testing team said tennis tested returned home Serbia.""

I feel flight crew. Article post see photos Air : ‚úîÔ∏è

Hot : ‚úîÔ∏è (seems sunny videos)

Mask: ‚ùå (very few)

Social Distance: ‚ùå(Except guys front, none enforced, medium packed)

Transmission: ‚úîÔ∏è Likely.

&amp;#x200B;

So make calculations types events. spikes would've started 3-5 days ago.

Most people protests wearing masks greatly reduces spread, meanwhile 12 states mandatory mask policy.

Otherwise we'd seeing massive spikes directly big cities protests happened, far data show all. definitely resonates we're seeing. actively looking first house right now. 

In 5-6 neighborhoods really like *zero* listings. houses we've seen liked sold 1-2 days listed. 

Our realtor tells us lot homes pulled due covid, come back soon. Denver saw pretty big protests seem absnormally affected, everyone saw wearing masks. may reached 20 percent confirmed cases, 20 percent towns population. That's different. would rare circumstance 10 percent town died Covid....it would need old town virtually hospital care. every single person get virus, children part spared. Death rates 50 extremely low. get wrong though, think right rural American towns lack old medical care could get hit really hard! 3-5 percent town dying horrifying well. Cape Cod missing its' tourist dollars. wants back ASAP. care die. wants money... every care home ever inherently abusive? Well, hard hit areas like NY places reported upwards 30-40% antibody rates.   late, shut China banned travel. that's right China head pocket... person feels endangered, free use mask limit contacts. taught young protect myself, one care well could. example fear snakes, result barely dare venture tall grass. car accidents, tend go 110 km/h start drifting, attempt handbrake turn, street race, etc like peers. Spelling sweetie sweaty meme, whenever see person wrote comment probably spelled wrong purpose DeSantis really shit brains. 100% Trump received plasma serum somebody antibodies. okay care more.

I'm actually President special protecting treatment. (I mean army personal bodyguards even best times. protect President.) particular one, protected, stops protecting others... problem. Oh I'm tracking. recognize can't recall them.

But bet went back time reopen protests, find several. live Georgia work, 7 confirmed cases last couple weeks. Carpet mills gotta keep carpet milling though... China commendable job considering everyone else fucked up. auto insurance companies refunding premiums nobody driving overall risk reduced. Fewer accidents means they're paying less choice - profits significantly beat expectation generate good returning excess premiums still meet profit expectations.

Health insurance? Workers Compensation insurance? They're returning premiums anywhere see. fact, WC companies work busier ever. ""No second wave coming."" Ffs. Plus we'd thousands health care workers getting re-infected. Second warning trolling. Third time ban. honestly would best case scenario right now, antibody tests bear kind story right now. guys reopened lol measures actually followed quite well while, gatherings two people, stay home work home much possible, bars closed, gyms closed, schools closed, et cetera.

And started following less relaxing rules, weather nice people mostly gathered outside, inside. seems virus spread much outside. lucky. Nobody quite sure numbers _still_ going down, think. Streets look mostly normal.

Overall went quite well apart fact completely fucked homes elderly. Protecting whole point, allowed see family anybody all, caregivers protection lot deaths. shame.  Agreed, that's self quarantined back March 11 GE aviation hooksett nh. Havnt back since... kids wife health important making asshole even richer already is. think idea somebody tests positive find test contacts. get positive rate less 4% done good job finding positive contacts positive contacts. high positive level tracing deep enough get infected contacts. absolutely crazy would cause way deaths exiting lockdown safely possible. That's true all.

Schools give students take it. Evaluating credibility sources part every English History curriculum. teacher can't make person learn want to. Illinois done. 49 states. RIP Illinois. I‚Äôm Florida we‚Äôre continuing break records terms new infections day, people don‚Äôt seem care. (Almost) Everything reopened honestly wish DeSantis took far seriously did. Cant tell sweh-ty swee-ty. Guess works lol average means alot folks younger 82? right? maybe 100 people 82 10 51 scattering everywhere else. maybe one person 500 years old everybody else 51.

&amp;#x200B;

iow 51 co-morbidites act like life depends SD listen people play fast loose stats. What? what's point contact tracing? point quantify virus spreading. 
I'm BLM(the movement, organization) ridiculous exempt tracing efforts. still know long term effects getting virus are. ""99.5% recovery rate"" completely overstatement. 

No one *wants* lockdown another six months. compared alternatives... Insurance companies interested learn numbers different based this. almost brainwashing half population believe facts science instead engage magical thinking could....backfire? amazing news! glad hear it. Stay safe! Novax Djokovic counter would symptomatic, coughing whatnot hopefully would know better around people, people would hear/see coughing back away. Asymptomatic presymptomatic: yo grill know they're sick. 


But, yes, theoretically guess symptomatic people better chance spreading. There's study China early days. Also new occurrence restaurant transmission despite brief time span SK. article sub. I'll try find link you. Ozarks...where many go relax get away, party. also politics.... even mentioning certain country name smells like politics well. mentioning country name seems political membership itself. could even discuss certain country membership can't mention name? actually know wfh people wanted reopen order go office wanted reopen bored work wanted people give them.

You're suddenly forcing bunch people back work order feed people entertain people even leave house. hah enjoyed lunch. Cool cool going falsely inflate number available ICU beds totally make hospital overflow problem go away. best try. agree. watched happening Wuhan January... Italy... NYC... people refused listen. Normalcy bias. think won‚Äôt them. think lot leaders country saying different things... squabbling... double standards... crowds okay aren‚Äôt... states say wear mask risk nobody else needs so... even though non-n95 better masks isn‚Äôt protecting wearer- it‚Äôs protecting people wearer. 

But know people careful... also see threads like this... keep realistic listening know rational. It‚Äôs hard. It‚Äôs hard seeing coming able change it. needed leaders page. crazy think *way* people America think? extrapolate CDC‚Äôs mortality rate (.26%) puts US 50M cases, seems reasonable considering it‚Äôs lot longer previously thought. putting non-icu patients icu beds someone job right Open windows possible. 40% demanding go back work anything relieve lack comfort fatherhood outside ""the provider"". mean logical extension already observed bots trolls infiltrating twitter sites. want sow discord within US. Someone russia sitting behind VPN going care caught making threats. went outdoor graduation least thousand people. single mask worn, lol. imagine 100 little pool gatherings taking place around stadium. 


Hopefully flu, got fingers crossed reddit's grandparents. could also mean hidden / unknown cases fact big. I've never dinner party thousands people. I'm Dallas. glad decided continue shelter place go back gym interesting graph Illinois governor tweeted. wonder data source since doesn‚Äôt match Florida department health corona data posted today. Florida averaging 37k tests per day 1700 tests per million. MAH RIGHTS!!! DA CONSTITUTION!!! GUVMENT CANT TELL DO!!! LIBRUL MEDIA LIES!! HERP DERP! 

Normally think fuck stupid people - want...but case they‚Äôre actively killing people. 

We need virus attacks stupid. would nice. prolonged ‚Äústupid cull‚Äù would perfect! interesting see happens government reduces 2 meters 1 shortly especially face coverings still non existent despite 'mandatory'. teens attended several crowded gatherings Rehoboth

Yes. we‚Äôre talking cartels armed advanced weaponry like grenade launchers, military rifles, body armor, give hand gun citizen that‚Äôs going take violence Mexico..okay, man Florida always crazy? won‚Äôt. key data point missing many critical cases states changed. US cases continue climb, critical cases decline. wish stat individual states, seem do. FYI, source information worldometers' coronavirus page. list critical cases number changed, I've tracking it. So, example, past approximately 22 hours, US active cases climbed 1,250,511 1,265,330, critical cases dropped 16,502 16,472. big drop, certainly increase. bit down, trending sure. example June 12th saw number 16,827. Looking actual new tests, added 18,191.

Note someone gets tested last week negative, gets tested yesterday count new negative test. reported ""new positive cases"" lower new cases / new tests. 

However, 7.74% correct, would needed total 37804 tests. Meaning 19,613 people got repeat tested. 

So certainly lot unknown there. maliciously trying game system, certainly one way would keep testing people fairly sure clean make ""new positives"" rate look lower actually is.

Would interesting know many 2,926 people tested positive first time new tests vs many tested previously. even English? fda standards? live near Seattle 99% peaceful protests.... Stop letting media control fucking brain 70s underlying conditions? seems case looking records county's medical examiner.

Small comfort though since type 1 diabetes. tricky figure out. lot variables. One factor could reduced viral load cases spread summer weather. Another factor could disproportionate number cases younger people, what's happening states. maybe I'm essential worker who's working 4 months without contracting Corona wearing mask unless mandatory I'm completely fine. Shutting economy months stupid. sure, I'm dumb one How's weather high horse? explain covid patient could hospitalized respiratory illness require intensive level care? far I've read, main reason covid patients hospitalized need supplementary oxygen potentially ventilator, would fall definition intensive levels care. well geez downvote wo/man knowing, damn. guys correcting actually great source information, literally know % good bad person openly stated thoughts. mother apparently well respected ICU nurse hospital system mom works for. wonder they're talking all. aren‚Äôt going.

You take tests people, though. Pride parades happening right now, I'm reminded every time there's mobile HIV/STI testing Pride event, way people get tested ever planning to.

You commercial shopping areas starting get traffic now, popular places outdoor activity, give employers tools test workforce (I know barbers/stylists these‚Äîidk condition opening they're careful) dont wear masks survive round 1, lung scarring increases probability round 2 fatal continues increasing damage lungs continuously increasing chances fatality coronavirus. Smoking compounds effect. Seeing .5-1% nature within week ago. Again, think important emphasize dynamic ""the flu."" remember early grad school norovirus spreading around campus. never missed single day point infected this, wiped days. set back research bed ridden. never happened again, would want wish anyone. tell right went vacation somewhere work would give two weeks quarantine upon return. shit really worries me, even though live Washington covid stuff going generally well, still feel like fellow citizens don‚Äôt give enough shit it. Every time go out, it‚Äôs oddly terrifying *and* comforting much normalcy see. Part goes ‚ÄúOh fuck, many people going get sick here.‚Äù another part feels almost reassured people get sick, maybe actually safe since I‚Äôve taking quarantine seriously. Nah selfish one. selfish ones Karens take actions considerate others.

You're taking action mitigate spread others, upset others reciprocate action perfectly justifiable.

I'm sorry stuck situation :( many asymptotic? Willing bet it‚Äôs majority. Lots people say people problem wearing clothing made super uncomfortable fabric day, personally think they‚Äôre full crap that‚Äôs accepting fact things known true yet... peer reviewed studies solid data showing case, happened.

The reported fatality rates dropped, honestly done so. fact, there's apparently relationship currently reported death numbers confirmed infections... that's really possible statistically we're seeing good data. Peak flow! go. Haven‚Äôt heard term while. asthma control years loves flare get cold confirm. surrounded imbeciles. Don‚Äôt worry virus informed legally cannot infect BLM protestors. No, he's applied standards allow put political pressure people want assistance/aid federal government. made sure signature stimulus individuals far. I‚Äôm sorry, exactly would mean ‚Äúhigh risk categories‚Äù? Cause know whole preexisting health conditions, perhaps coming close contact others else could considered ‚Äúhigh risk‚Äù?

By chance, know airborne? Wym we‚Äôre at??? entered phase 2 TODAY ""coincidental"" flu immuno-compromised deaths, let's forget respiratory well, closer 200k.

You spikes related possible deaths time chalk coincidence. Yeah it‚Äôs outside. Bonfire. i‚Äôm majority people leave 11. We‚Äôre camping outside mom doesn‚Äôt want friends house stay safe Well, true. number ICU beds available completely different metric reported separately. change impact number all. Odd Americans notoriously ignore things really *really* bad: covid, climate change, guns, many others. Shithole country think fact protestors wore masks marched outside really helped lot. shame feels like hypocritical defense (I see think way do), that's mask-wearing actually effective precautions politicised. long they're burning COVID victims bear suits... That's true, think it. Still easy catch mask. Especially people don‚Äôt wash hands often. You‚Äôre right party isn‚Äôt like emergency situation, it‚Äôs definitely riskier seem believe is.

Nevertheless, there‚Äôs lot ways make less risky- Stay outside, yard games instead video/board games, wear masks, etc theory virus = stronger immune response sickest Covid patients recover getting reinfected. Many ‚Äúreinfected‚Äù patients getting discharged hospital (so moderate severe) experiencing resurgence symptoms. reinfection suggests vaccine would ineffective dose. 

That clinical trials thus far demonstrated understanding. Social distancing still thing Define ""proper"" air flow. long people direct contact tested, he's fine. testing tent public view White House goes push get people test. Fewer tests lead fewer positives. masks means faster spread, sooner reach heard immunity, sooner things get back normal. Bro. mean ‚Äúcorrelation equal causation‚Äù. 


?? lockdown effective... Get N95s least better protection. hard wear mask ? think evidence experiences age anything it. Neuropsychiatric side effects well documented antimalarials Larium Malarone. Personally, avoid reason. aware issue hydroxychloroquine apparantly is. US military largely stoped using Larium due _mefloquine psychosis_ posibility real permenant neuropsychiatric damage. important know about.

This paper discuss dexamethasone begins used non-sedated patient another treatment possible psychiatric implications. Corticosteroids cause exacerbate depression, anxiety, insomnia, mania, psychosis especially psychiatric illness includes symptoms. Fortunately believe psychiatric effects corticosteroids permenant. Martin Luther something say attitude:

""I shall ask God mercifully protect us. shall fumigate, help purify air, administer medicine take it. shall avoid places persons presence needed order become contaminated thus perchance inflict pollute others cause death result negligence.

See God-fearing faith neither brash foolhardy tempt God.‚Äù Meanwhile UK getting rid 2 meter rule. right thing 2 months, may need 2 years. 

I know quote hackneyed, sum times succinctly. best lack conviction, worst full passionate intensity.
-Yeats ""They"" ""Them""

Local schools run locally. Neighboring districts different approach application. Even PTA little neighborhood elementary school makes big difference.

This ""We"" ""Us"". ourselves. need failure take steps fix it. Almost everything comment wrong. Fatality rates dropped. use blood thinners holding vents using high flow O2 universal, widely adopted shown reduce deaths. Please post it. Car crashes exponentially increase one person gets fender bender think problem learning. much info head overthink things causing self sabotage. case heartbreak. know much matter, romantic connection evades me. want someone ride pointlessness life make little bearable. US 10 x tests Brazil , 2 x cases found compared brazil. probably Brazil already ahead US.

Russia 3 x tests India 1.3x cases India. probably India ahead Russia actual case count already.

It makes sense China either faulty tests massaging data (a lot) release. probably using opaque govt controlled media control perceived image. stay healthy... eat organic foods drink less alcohol... gotta stay fit sharks feast us soon? point less severe cases. 

Again I'm defending it, like said first post seems like opinion one guy seen mixed reports going go version suits you. going assume can't spread asymptomaticly.... seen mixed reports. going err side caution assume spread it? seems like social responsible course. Even choose travel, responsible way act contagious. Wear mask social distance much possible.

Now also thought experiment happens pick flight there. plan use rest stops? Go stores? Interact anyone? prepared isolate 7-14 days get home? plan may low risk, inherently risky travel US right now. Except May CNN article showed 2 7 largest government contracts PPE cancelled due failure supplier provide numerous number reports failed contracts, pushed delivery dates, questionable quality product across FEMA, National Stockpile, etc.

Not even including OP article explicitly states supplier issues, attempting ad hominem detract issue. 


But let's look FEMA numbers reporting. 
  
They delivered / coordinated 62.3 million N95 masks two months leads 1.04 mln day. VA article states VA system needs 250k day. Doubtful hospitals, let alone jobs need PPE could met 1.05 mln VA system alone needs 250k day. Sweden next it‚Äôs neighbours close get double-blind randomized trial pandemic. could argue slight difference...but Sweden like 4-5 times Nordic countries *combined* know results must carry significance. 

Lockdowns work, that‚Äôs scientific fact. however work best instituted early. 

Now, lot thing went wrong Sweden...namely lack qurantine travel, lack test-trace, late closure resident home visitatations, lack protective gear, lack guidelines use retirement homes. 

Finland, Denmark Norway open relatively freer Sweden 2 months now. second wave happening...while Sweden isn‚Äôt even passed first. could wrong here, seems cases going deaths going down. COVID-19 ALREADY raging ' like forest fire' unprepared America, simple Reddit user warns. Cool, thanks info. see coming hope right death rate lower even 1%. 

I'll keep mind future discussions too; raised good points. Incorrect. Antibodies always short lived. True immunity comes Memory B Cells. large majority hospitalized Covid patients don‚Äôt need intensive level care. you‚Äôre respiratory issues, doesn‚Äôt mean need ICU receive intensive levels care. ""Lemur extraction #17 year."" actually lol'd American standard, incredible, amazing, unbelievably well.

By Asian standard, bit trouble.

Just imagine Korea Asian kid coming home A- math exam, understand headline fine. Probably checked, many diseases infectious Covid-19.

Covid-19 happens combination factors:

* pretty deadly ‚Äì nearly much Ebola previous SARS, still pretty deadly;
* pretty infectious ‚Äì nearly much many children's diseases, way deadly diseases above;
* often asymptomatic ‚Äì makes much harder trace back patient 0 delimit clusters diseases above;
* grave enough many infected need go hospital ‚Äì means quickly going saturate hospitals regions fail contain also loose, many infected able work, even many going survive disease.

In fact, understanding hospital saturation loss work power actually worst risk. hospitals country saturated Covid-19 patients, who's going take care diseases accidents? everybody sick, who's going take care nuclear plants?  yet. AZ 85% got half assed lockdown social distancing. double cases, even half young asympthmatics mild cases 50% not. Eventually fill up. need go surge capacity means lost. didn‚Äôt control spread. 

Deaths won‚Äôt spike like Spain Italy go new cases keep pace pack boys, second wave over!! Thanks! Thanks! Yup! pretend symptoms aren‚Äôt bothering corona get bored start bothering someone else. like bully is. need PSAs say sticking something butt, make sure flared end. understanding saying? RDT brand, it‚Äôs type test. 


However, use one test study. One test sites institution work for, literally part study paperwork. find get home post it. Yeah, I'm confused too. ""Nah, really need care...I like tubes wires running every orifice body...."" Robinette respond questions concerning number patients staff members came contact whether patients would notified tested

A little worrisome avoid basic question. basic tracing, point ASSUME done. even ask point time. highlights far behind US testing contacts, even informing contacts exposed. We're allowed technically receive masks encounter PPE shortages.

We anticipate we'll July.

We know enough stockpile know supply chain issues going countries face resurgences. lot products come India, Malaysia, Japan, China, Vietnam, etc.

Unfortunately, important thing staying home much can. safe can't. Maga trumpet needs moar downvotes Arizona 84 percent capacity.

Can't find Texas's capacity data 6.9.20 2,056 hospitalized cases.

Yesterday, 3,409.

Texas reporting 14,316 available beds, 1,493 ICU beds.

Florida's 73 percent ICU capacity.

Hospitals filling up. Texas slowly two. Taiwan swastika normally represents Buddhism. They're everywhere. also used designate vegetarian food. would mean something else anyway. might true make sense. Unless negative pressure room, risky put patients, especially COVID patients ICU patients.

2. ICUs usually easier isolate...fewer entrance/exits. Many also controlled access...i.e. key card.
3. One unit minimizes number staff interact COVID population
4. Resource utilization vs medsurg bed different. Even though patient ICU, receiving constant one one type care. Also Arizona. Mesa started mandatory masks today 8am still saw third people wearing masks work today. Please send help. Depends badly need chemo. chemo give someone almost 100% chance death, getting chemo increase chances dying catch COVID (which guarantee, cancer continuing spread sure is) think people would choose move forward chemo. Also infrared touchless forehead scanning thermometers [have false negative rate fever detection around 28% (meaning every 4 people fever tested, likely 1 falsely told fine).

ETA: good evening you, we're done ITT. lost 60 million dollars building it. sure took down. According chart Texas Medical Center Houston fine ICUs right now. Nothing really makes sense anymore. bit complicated sharing information. vaccines monitored testing believed best ways induce immune response virus. I'm familiar two: Oxford vaccine Moderna's. Oxford using common cold virus engineered able replicate within human body spike protein information attached it, would allow body defeat easy intruder learn battle novel coronavirus already understanding protect spike. Moderna using newer technique vaccine, called mRNA based. done synthesizing viruses RNA synthetically, instead coming contact spike protein itself, body already come contact RNA virus would try cells replicate infects you. simple sharing research other. think better think us seeing spaghett sticks kind phase want vaccine development.

This exactly fucking CCCP worked. let people's questions interfere fruits labors. Leave state's business state.

Everyone needs keep facts clear. 

Florida, along essentially every state, opened business express directions scientists. Absolutely pathologist epidemiologist agreed opening certain criteria met none was.

Many businesses providing basic safety equipment. federal oversight anything. States bidding testing materials PPE. safety good mayor employer. 

The government exclusively cater kleptocratic string pullers. need cheap labor force back. care people get sick die. want open business. government champions cause. lot people get sick many people stay home while, numbers go go go back work, go high people stay home Perhaps weakened, vulnerable seeking best shelter can. guess. Could + cases among less vulnerable people.

I expect increase though. comparison made. comparison cost lockdown compared cost dealing ongoing covid 19 cases. Currently, average OECD nation loses 10% gdp growth per month that's even accounting ongoing spending reduced tax revenues. 

Again, cannot infinitely spend though nothing bad happen. appropriate tradeoff realize diminishing returns lockdowns economic cost exceeds economic costs managing virus less intensive lockdown. key continued mass testing coverage adjusting local areas intensity virus reproduction rate. Otherwise, taxing spending economy continues produce less less.

Edit:

Get idea? not, economically illiterate schmuck fails see life series tradeoffs. Everything tradeoff, far lockdown's tradeoff safetyism economic activity makes life possible worth living.

The feeling state federal politicians leaving us unprotected clean mess made.

Like always.

But unlike poverty, lack insurance, systemic violence... COVID-19 actually extremely dangerous health care workers. Id rather say mass. friends CT new jersey said similar things Netflix's info-series ""Pandemic"" - came went wild - good job following strained conditions rural hospital operates simply flu season... part make point vulnerable corners healthcare system are.

It well-done probably seems horrifyingly prescient -- covering NYC's surveillance response would escalate, would happen India, US rural healthcare issue. Would recommend it. ...and? That‚Äôs great kids effectively risk neither parents see sweet sweet growth? Lol nope. freedom rights amendments? 
In country it‚Äôs much better think. Lockdown almost one wearing masks public. honestly don‚Äôt find big deal wearing one. international standard wave. think use phase refer tactical reaction, CDC Korea say second wave, else authority say not?   tracking.

Thanks man! merely comparing Asian countries, done well. mean comparing state US makes sense given awful it‚Äôs handled there. Speaking context, understand daily cases doubled compared last month. they‚Äôre category countries close, unfortunately likely restrictions foreseeable future. Smart parents move kids home schooling Pretty sure that's ICU means, governor. Regardless stand politics, all-around bad idea record, white house see data can, right? Way good souls that, agree. called dog friend highest compliment Reasonable people: ""We need something extreme change virus spreading""

White House Monkey's Paw: Wish granted wrong. started referring patients experts geriatric sex.

Apparently, goal low impact fucking. Well shit Sherlock whose fault reckon Seriously, follow FL plan NY, would catastrophic (beyond original nightmare) about, hope everyone gets exactly coming based decisions they've made? time I've ever interacted mod threatened ban asking questions certain political comments removed others remained.

Someone PMed look subs mods visit became pretty clear asking question resulted threat. came say thing response quote article!

Even knowing asymptomatic exposed many innocent people, continues think *personal right* **inconvenienced** greater public's right life. 

People *know rights* seem enjoy loudly asserting costs, ignoring impact might others. rights exist protect individually, protect us collectively. (Staying inside might 'infringe' someone's right X, Z, constitutional necessary protect public health)

SMH. Great. Let‚Äôs let get worse instead helping stop unnecessary cases deaths. Methanol bad consumer products m'kay, kids?

Isopropyl ethanol Can't believe western country covid-19 situation especially USA bad. guys suppose developed advanced country. Covid situation Asia much much better. Life Taiwan Vietnam Thailand slowly coming back normal now. take 1-2 month lockdown ppl wearing mask. Like hard american wear mask stay inside month two... Three restaurants town closed yesterday due employees testing positive covid. (Louisiana) long doesn‚Äôt mind mormons white supremacists. Also we‚Äôre starting get spikes.  please ask speak Mr. Trump. Dooooooooo, dodged beating right there! ask... ex Tiger Woods?? studies hint damage possible nothing looks irreversible high % time takes get tested longer time period people become sick shedding virus most....great. Yeah, heard stories PPE lacking lot non-medical industries everything rerouted medical use. sure much truth stories though. see tons people protesting wearing masks, bot. Again, hypocrite I'm sorry unable comprehend b/c rather easy. Move Canada. really close already. it. Expats know flew another country weekend celebrated arrival pub Vilnius. necessary travel.

I extremely disgusted behaviour comprehend it. live... oh ya... hell, get mad wear mask workouts. say I‚Äôm trying scare kids liberal fear mongering. head coach tells ignore them... that‚Äôs state live in. least helping. Even nonessential still forced work right now. Underrated comment. There‚Äôs nothing funny this. Clownish though is. do. well known happen that's one example.

It's early history virus predict badly could affected re-infections, already know happens. Unfortunately research conclusive shown reaction different reactions pathogens Maybe they're biting people because... detect Covid-19!

Brilliant. Get rid Coronavirus-sniffing dogs use sharks instead. Simply people swim near shark eat got disease.

Wait. There's problem idea can't put finger on. I'm desensitized bro. tons family Korea constantly contact following situation Korea East Asia closely. director saying stop Koreans letting guards down. reality 2nd wave, matter slice numbers. 11 domestic cases lowest like month seriously talking 2nd wave lmao...

If want ignoramus guest bother responding something intended educate can't even review it.

You sheep brains ignore =

Teachers already overworked underpaid people American society, also high risk COVID complications. teacher would strike indefinitely. study popped b/c 2 soldiers testing positive cleared virus - cases follow ""re-activation"" idea recently floated. 

I say gave ""insight susceptibility reinfection"" said another study know hard possibility re-infection. 

It also another long line immunity might last long. That's point. know, lot ""it's possible"" conversation accurate either. know. Wait protests. fun sit back /popcorn.

If everyone government page scientists, happening. born, raised North Miami area. Never liked still here! almost never go house point rampant stupidity. Exactly.. this. School isn‚Äôt daycare fucking raging pandemic. jobs pay low wages one wants them. suuuck. Sacramento? Nah like 1700 cases total. definitely mostly Call. AFAIK every government same. openly admitted reason recommend wearing masks prevent complete collapse supply medical staff. hid behind pseudo explanations effectiveness lack wearing masks.

The recent decisions purely political economic. government's Covid-19 task force shouted press weekend way early mistake. 

It's interesting study mechanisms successive waves Spanish flu pandemic. Humans pretty dumb species. many species know can't learn mistakes? 

So I'll continue wearing mask bit. knows. Maybe save someone's parent grandparent. know Florida something going surgeon general tell wear mask. There‚Äôs direction central message everyone fending right now. many conflicting policies, goals, messages one buying anymore help prevent spread COVID. quarantining help prevent flooding hospitals find vaccine? masks mandatory not? cancelling large public gatherings still allowing large gatherings BLM protestors? think ""reversion mean"" effect. dig bit, states ""improving"" ones got hit hardest early (NY, NJ, MA, MI, IL, etc.) states seeing ""spikes"" ones get hit hard beginning, seeing spikes regardless controls still place (CA, WA, ID, SC, TX, FL, etc.)

On per capita basis, think we'll end finding number cases ends similar regardless lockdown - lockdown slows things down, population density speeds things up, end day probably around number people get sick. remember many many references Sweden... longer model country although haven‚Äôt caught Italy yet. another note, anyone else feeling really, really deflated? happiest time life - graduated, remote internship dream company summer, life good. I've super unhappy, irritable, unmotivated, frustrated lately. mention constantly worried sick family friends. feel emotionally crushed I'm really sure deal it. Infected asymptotic? Like people apparently?... asymptotic patients can‚Äôt even transmit virus. American Exceptionalism! girlfriend positive test result never showed symptoms? Yep, especially country crap social safety net like ours. would viable, people would adhere it, full wage replacement. don't. thought market cornered it! Stupid people pressure put Herbert. initial intention move whole state green numbers already started spiking around time. already posted above, yes may:

 Guess end Western Civilization, shit reverse parents immigrate South Korea chance better life. Maybe Dr. Trump right tests mattering. also mitigated going out.

Most protestors wearing masks socially distancing. someone who's general favor automation manual labor, there're still crops cannot harvested machine yet. Anything soft watery requires ""picking"", like fruits, can't harvested machine industrial scale.

That said, whenever encountered bigot complaining illegal immigration, would always say best way keep wall, ""build better Mexican."" Well know got tested quickly. Thanks chiming intentionally obfuscate conversation Thank you. :D *shocked pikachu* July 4th going fuck us hard. bad way. shifting demographics. early phase disease, many deaths due elderly. hospitalizations shifting younger people, die less frequently. 

However, frequency sequelae important look going forward younger population. surviving, permanently maimed Big difference Yes, even rules, death rate still is. notice don‚Äôt shut driving. 

Wear seat belt, wear mask, don‚Äôt shut down.

Maybe get charged infect someone following rules. case HIV. bit harder Covid though easily spread, harder prove came from.

I don‚Äôt know vast majority US, haven‚Äôt traveling lately due obvious reasons, done lots live. Mask wearing inside 100 percent big box stores, pretty decent everywhere else inside crowded, contact tracing thing, loots changes made, overall, deaths per day going since started gradually opening mid april. That's really kind you!

I'll around start accepting donations still capacity time, hospital would happily pay them! mention local community impact. 100 deaths day NYC tragic 100 deaths small town probably worst thing happen town ever. Nodding sagely saying ""shame"". Fantastic. May well press ""F"" go whole hog. see work everywhere. gym (well, seen since March, guess still gym), addition 24 hour facility staff many hours rarely staff front desk (so would safety concerns leaving doors open) also located area climate would conducive ""fresh air"" i.e. -20 -30 C large parts year people going gym. People go gym ""fresh air"" bit fresh... 

In areas, outside area may also worse health indoor (i.e. areas smog/pollutants high). need feed kids. majority workers color, wonder one protecting them. Remember go store. sad threatening people dedicated life trying help people. IMO like threatening doctor Mother Teresa. r/thatsmyfetish

Edit: Corrected MBS's initials. Beaches hotel rooms, bars, restaurants, etc. Masks useful still relatively limited value. change nothing give small window time. 90% ICU beds COVID-19, would 10% matter? sure 10% hanging hospitals routinely put lower levels care expensive beds insurers ask validation service level, therefore reimbursing lower rate. Wise strategy hospital‚Äôs part. Nothing like ignorant politicians manipulate data make look better. Seems national strategy virus. Yea, that‚Äôd try lot harder live county think referring super disheartening see things going last 3-4 weeks. definitely think going get worse gets better. relatedly diabetes. Yes, work healthcare. fact go buy groceries week touch mask. Note: 1,000 tested positive **either** virus antibodies. lol media reports ugly. sheep He's upset spreading he's still stepping leader damn thing it. Experts screaming him, he's listening. safe Texas. I'd give anything back working home. soon lockdown ended, ordered back work, we're ""more efficient"" there. boss, course, show face office okay rest us die. I'm 28 relatively healthy (I think; insurance, check years). every morning, take vitamins C, D, K, Zinc, wear mask, disinfect work area, wash hands every 15-30 minutes (soap water sanitizer; whichever easier), try keep distance. fun waking everyday wondering day contract virus may kill leave permanently disabled. Yeah. going ongoing problem one country states can't really close borders states. Rural hospitals get little attention communities serve ton people.

""20 new infections"" seems like small number would take less collapse many rural hospitals.

I wish news stories better job reporting capacity headline. US getting 30,000 new cases daily. one cares 20.

But collapsed health care system death sentence many people regardless COVID-19 not. think Task Force ignored supplier? kidding me? mad sprint PPE anywhere, Fed States. Don‚Äôt forget every time mentions low numbers, also mentions they‚Äôre low ignore South Florida. tell difference Covid allergies? sore throat tight chest common summer allergies went beach last week anxiety making think contracted covid even tho everyone quarantined social distancing. looking get tested however station near didn‚Äôt recommend since don‚Äôt symptoms. know ways reduce anxiety this? simply true. tens countries cultural structurally prepared Corona crushed response it. ""people wired"". Americans culturally conditioned. Many people flouted lockdown standards best practices beginning *politically motivated*. They're fatigued getting 'lax'. never bought in. NOTHING response America 'inevitable' 'usual'. countries prove it.  actually pretty blessed this. wife lost job, interview next day, hired elsewhere. definitely impacted ability buy house (it moved closing date, minor inconvenience. continue pray situation improves us. blame epidemic ‚Äúmy feelings important trump logic, science, strategy basic human decency!‚Äù

Sacrifice ain‚Äôt cool thing right now. PetriW said deaths counted Healthcare, publication year 2020 Data deceased laboratory confirmed covid-19 (Public Health Authority) statistics deaths presented Public Health Authority consist persons received laboratory confirmed covid-19 diagnosis reported deceased SmiNet database.

But wrong significant excess mortality probably COVID-19 related, least according two almost certainly case many dying untested (at home elder care facilities) therefore counted. excess mortality rate declining lately, still present last report Swedish Stats, would wager excess deaths higher done prodding late. iOS 13.5 way forced treated different previous update.

Is concern trolling hobby actual thoughts? curious.

New APIs normal part OS updates. Calling contract tracing api ""authoritarian overreach"" definitely dumbest thing I've heard today. mod? PM wanna say took photo post. tell 100%, nobody anything wrong wearing mask. People trying sooooo hard make race article wrote misleading information pretending ‚ÄúBLM protest.... simply wasn‚Äôt. mob mentality misinformation eat detail run cancel culture wins. Wow big surprise. protests states opening back early, expected  three week explosion even close Texas He's cult leader point. Red hats=red kool-aid? Mmmm Josh. figured much. 

I promise you, don‚Äôt think isn‚Äôt right left problem. It‚Äôs American problem. flip side we're seeing exactly bad things get people survive. Oof. Even ""mild/moderate"" cases terrible. still want nothing that, I'm going keep using mask keep distance much possible. virus learned Abbott's displeasure decided spread acceptable rate only. Worked amazon another state. It‚Äôs cesspool fairness USA doesn‚Äôt social programs sustain implement true lock down. countries successfully contained, paid people month livable wage, cited people going outside.

One cannot realistically expect people US stay shuttered also going hungry. America‚Äôs economy f*cked, getting worse day, makes sense people respond way do. One cannot expect compliance without social service safety nets. Chinese suppliers, likely, vendor either incompetent plain immoral.  predicted started may people would go back normal around memorial day regardless virus. People take much decide living normal important them. happen lot? People abandoning homes 60 days (waiting hurricane never comes)?

And it, well, I'm 34 year old chronic lung disease pretty unsafe go health care centers reason.

And doctor's inclination transplant cancered organ means anti-rejection medication midst pandemic.

So I'm probably dead.

But everyone else gives lot varied answers. actually CDC. recommend wearing masks. put link could check out. think numbers using justification shut society studied every granular detail? think make assumptions attempt act late? Yeah lumping Canada together ridiculous. Atlantic Canada basically verge eradication moment. Pretty sure Manitoba Saskatchewan handled well. Alberta BC got hit lot cases, surprising considering population great job suppressing it. really Ontario Quebec serious trouble.

My province like 75% cases one super spreader event. insanely unlucky. something stops person going funeral, would less 100 cases. maybe scared population taking seriously. weird sex goals

I read ""weird sex goalies"" reason immediately thought Chico Resch. close Texas virus him. There's evidence anywhere close six million.  Wait... they‚Äôre using methanol? What‚Äôs hard using normal isopropyl?!? fuck Funny every government refused implement controls early stages winds place.

I wonder could something epidemiology established science causes effects clearly identifiable Oh, penalties!

They inflicted government, though. vast majority people experience slow painful death neither loved ones. Statistics favour fearmongering.

Being able quit working America length time makes one privileged Americans certainly almost everyone else earth.

Sorry don‚Äôt like it, that‚Äôs is. course sub like reality I'm surprised. seems like good reason require masks, shared indoor spaces.  Distance helpful, masks much likely prevent transmission. 

It also seems like good reason avoid going indoor places, Oh also, sometimes downvotes ""reversed"" quickly users content post seem provide rational basis downvote, time sequence like 1 point 0 1 2 points common. 
Same. I've saved money last 3-4 months sometimes better part year. Lol, wow 2 2 delusional teenager quality comments! virus epidemiological outcome give fuck maximum potentially is. active measures take. read supplemental material study, type AB 39% higher risk. study authors mention main body paper, probably result statistically significant due AB rare type. think rh factor used types, thought four groups, I'm medical field idea. I've never fucking disappointed citizens, tall order 2016. pat us back yet. plenty idiots here. sex trees

The new Anne Heche comedy! Thursdays 9 CBS! USA lot Western countries (UK, Spain) lots functional elderly people thrown forgot nursing homes.

That's simply true username about? Reason ask I‚Äôm Buffalo.

Your glorious Messiah Orchard Park. think comment wasn‚Äôt directed sub well, made clear

It really, really rare see type self-awareness sub all. you, like, read it? picking useless fight make dick hard? steal less life average victim car crash. steals less life Americans overall car crashes. important I, like people think, would rather live life die, regardless kills end. think he's saying girlfriend kissing boss. content keeps coming back more. Pretty easy remember fart molecule least 100x smaller. interest rates low lot people sort buying buy decent investment.

Honestly, properties seen, would could afford it. know I'm surprise looked country. hard think irresponsible one reason getting hand affecting life. thought shit turn one best along Taiwan Vietnam (I live Thailand). many country Asia great compare number west. I'm LMAO right crying. lol. one even remotely suggested breaking law.

You information making choice. Saying conscious clean bit premature. actions may consequence all, could directly responsible killing someone. ability minimize risks others, even traveling. That's choice have. 

As aside, dumb shit I've done life completely legal. still live consequences. Pretty sure keep thinking creating sub time that, realistically. totally understand theres lag new cases corresponding deaths. like said previously number new cases plateaued weeks ago started climbing again, deaths continued drop. 

For example May 16th average number new cases 23500. June 16, full month later average number new cases was... 23500. 

Yet 1 month period daily deaths went 1442 per day average 712 deaths per day still trending downward. currently 627. 

So clearly isnt lag, number deaths/cases dropped. I'm trying figure why. contained 1st wave. contain 2nd wave. 1st wave 12k. second wave hundreds. Even second wave 30k try contain think succeed.

It sputnik moment. East Asians seemed impossible societies. OP forgot there's actually type AB. there's actually 4 blood groups, inference still same. unemployment is? Nice make choice can‚Äôt. Leading causes death Florida normal times:

(1) Shark attacks

(2) Alligator attacks

(3) Burmese python attacks (had imported side world - worth it!!)

(4) Florida Man attacks

(5) Florida Woman attacks

(6) Combo attacks (e.g., alligator + python) grand view world case. Many people going wear masks. fact. question plan deal following:

-Many people wear masks around you.

-There well might ever vaccine one may take 5+ years proven.

-This never go away entirely

How plan live life based 3 facts? Hoping best you! States voted Leopards Eating Faces party shocked find faces eaten leopards. listening heads hospitals man....o think know inventory. Stay safe there. first ""novel virus"" ever encountered? dont remember kind response virus before. say North Carolina;

""Shit fire fall back it...""  Yeah started mostly airline hub cities I've watched spread interstates highways. pretty obvious would follow travel patterns. thing rural areas worse hospitals many closed last ten years so. also worry get attention deserves total number cases deaths seems low percentage population often higher urban areas. (Those gotten slammed like NYC anyway) That's awful. Covid used opportunity crack undocumented immigrants. invested $40 hit $. 10 per share... would've made hundreds got bailed out! know what, pants infringing muh rights, boutta go protest governor's office it. anti-pantsers encouraged join. Leave pants home! Lol dad one dumb mother fuckers frustrating. reckless careless actions could get sick could spread mom live together I'm 100% type would place every single ounce blame square shoulders let forget reckless actions caused (stupid people need reminded stupid actions consequences). 



For last week he's talking going Europe Summer Fall!!!!! mom told he's nuts told he'd spend month quarantine (14 days arrives 14 days gets back) laughed like oh he's going follow quarantine procedures üôÑ Sometimes construed hoping people get virus result ban. Chicago too, 99% protesters masks. Real world example effectiveness:  I‚Äôd 80% WFH pre-pandemic work moved offices commute tripled. 

They‚Äôre reopening offices splitting us 4 groups assigning week every four we‚Äôre allowed in.

I plan go long enough get stuff desk that‚Äôs gonna quite long - they‚Äôre still telling us they‚Äôd rather don‚Äôt come in. like 3 months late can't wait move beach mansion population goes down. trying hard useless unless Governor supports him. Governor nothing. wonder agenda try herd immunity? known well-before time reopen communicate going now, made decision try get everyone become infected deal situation. can't speak Switzerland government US government evil sense would push political narratives personal purposes. like January/February, US proclaimed, ""Don't wear mask. harm good"" now, ""Wear mask. prevents spreading disease"" reason lied beginning people trusted them: admit plan stockpile masks available. save butts, lied public. part everyone know still working home. curious see specific type industry company size planning bring employees starting now. think blanket everyone coming back. Abbott said briefing plenty hospital beds! lockdown. think could probably give weeks. Kids gone back school quite countries coughing

Which symptom. coughing sneezing may think allergies. guess settle - actions consequences.

Well, case would say inaction much greater consequences.  scary thing practically stopped reporting covid deaths. early pandemic excess deaths 50% reported deaths, much 100%, least several states.
Looking excess deaths painting completely different story compared reported numbers. Arizona started testing 10k per week like 2 3 weeks ago. think they're 81k total since start. Michigan around 14k per day 10% infection rate. Arizona meet minimal testing requirements 10k per day still opened up, think several hundred day. Big yikes sure think biggest problem USA uncoordinated. state sort left thing. article find evidence urban protests reignited COVID-19 case growth three weeks following protest onset. really follow exact pattern every time. Death rate starts jumping 3 weeks exposure point. Deaths seem really begin 10 days post-exposure.

I aware doesn‚Äôt match published data incubation times. I‚Äôm seeing thing parent comment. It‚Äôs repeating pattern seen everywhere. course exceptions. HOLY SHIT passed onto ED.

Thank say mounting evidence months ago Funny chose reply. predicting 190k deaths August? 2 weeks ago averaging 1000 deaths per day. number dropped, prediction unlikely point.  


BTW, deaths still dropping Texas despite spike new cases. there's new cases ""it's spreading around!"". Houses 100 160k range super hard find right now. First time homebuyers small town pay (at least, experience, lower violent crime, better schools, houses features/character cookie cutter), especially approved (often afford, instances, approved could loaned nearly 25k could afford borrow, know, 2008 II, eletric boogaloo). reality is, city living sucks, renting silly, time, real estate prices drop easily unless number factors occur, being, sudden rise crime, fall schools, rent control. live country even community homes less likely rent controlled, then, 9 times 10 real estate value change much, even new homes built (because new homes often depreciate little bit appreciate) new homes rarely character many older homes have.

I'm beyond thankful paid asking price got appliances. move fast. People snipe like that.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry one point, median house value town grown 40k 4 years. median house value, including homes land, etc. $174,500. That's could afford working (and suspect many people early 30s baby could afford). So, project continued 5% growth March April next year, suspect turn market 0.7%. means, March April, suspect market stay ""Very Hot"" fall minimally next year. bananas man.

Rent shot since 2019, $650/month 2-bedroom decent part town costs nearly $1,000/month. That's bad shortage is. breakeven horizon, makes sense buy rent paltry 1.5 years. I'm Canada, found P100 autoparts store. got masks early though, things getting worse people starting realize masks work sourcing probably getting harder, sorry. mean, seems like splitting hairs saying covid patients admitted ICU respiratory support/monitoring count ICU patients (yet) need ventilator. you‚Äôre ICU bed, it‚Äôs pretty fucking serious. actual study literally mentions stuff like possible reason increase social distancing behavior. Wait what.. ‚Äúbrain stab‚Äù??? may something massive protests 2 weeks ago. city protest where? I'd like look pictures online confirm saying, that's fine. coronavirus ba sing se. important maybe important. example, give idea disease prevalence rate community spread. important indicators prepare situation hospitalizations increase. It‚Äôs they‚Äôre fucking retarded. Weapons-grade, pants-on-head retarded. It‚Äôs really simple. weren‚Äôt tricked, weren‚Äôt duped, weren‚Äôt lied to, weren‚Äôt manipulated. retarded know exactly they‚Äôre single one deserves another molecule oxygen. Driving kill others, including someone‚Äôs grandma even small child crossing road. us seem ok risk driving even though risk yours. even happy risk putting children cars even though choice matter.

The average age someone killed car crash 38. 38 40.37 years lifespan left according actuary tables. average age someone dying Covid-19 78-81. Let‚Äôs use 79. 79, average lifespan left 8.82 however, unlike car crashes, Covid-19 typically kills co-morbidities wouldn‚Äôt typically lifespan others cohort. Conservatively, say average 79 year old died Covid-19 4 years life left average. Covid-19 death represents ten times less effect overall average lifespan typical motor vehicle accident death. threat average lifespan motor vehicle accidents, death count Covid-19 would ten times higher. isn‚Äôt likely year‚Äôs end. Next up; Stop reporting deaths report require ""have stopped living"". **Did Trump Call Obama Resign Ebola Doctor Returned **TRUE** working ICU unit summarizing news?

I'm asking get sense logic behind converting entire ICU ward Covid area.

Say one ICU ward 20 beds. propably lot intensive care cases justify converting beds Covid. Either many ""minor"" covid cases (that could progressively get worse) justify overflow rest Covid patients ICU beds. Either way, non-intensive patients can't many ICU since spare beds real intensive Covid patients coming future. Feel like big hospitals +100 bed ICU this. this, preparing worse. cannot speak hospitals. experience one.

Consensual sex trauma occurs cycles here. cold anything outside, rainy, riding hurricanes, etc.

Florida lot sex trauma broken bones. Elderly people fuck like mad. libido thoroughly supported pills supplements.

Less frequent sex toy incidents primarily anal play. People want experiment butt stuff butt stuff toys pretty expensive something might into.

People get creative. Cucumbers, carrots, knitting stick things, butter knife incident.

... we're metro area. There's lot do... Yeah sounds safe Yes, that's correct.

About points. Utah testing down, cases we're still 155ish deaths? think spike cases, deaths increase takes time kill people. Jesus fuck, that‚Äôs hot shade. area hit hard others still psychologically tough. 

Empty roads. Dark storefronts. Eerie silence broken frequent ambulances flying by. I've never heard seen many ambulances hours.

I wish best even brought upon themselves. Guess see headline often now.... cant imagine 8 trying online school year. could really detrimental effects ones education also social skills emotional growth. 

It's tough situation schools top list things need reopen. Yeah. Honestly feel like additional reason heavier FOX News regions getting hit worse. think even Stay Home orders help. People take things bit seriously Governor Gov telling health risk. numbers still lower ours. keep wondering see spike people stop wearing masks, least outside, heat.

I keep waiting bottom fall still trending down. could happen?
Cross-protection prior infection another type coronavirus? Western New York South Korea second wave. People always dumb, get barrage information wasn‚Äôt previously available world  Speaking critical thinking, Florida's death rate around 40 per day. Peak NYC/NJ 1500 deaths per day (i.e 40x bad). Georgia, Texas Arizona also low death rates. So, pushing narrative fucked death rates low?

Do scientific study shows fucked FL, GA, TX, AZ really is? actually super confusing. would put workers risk? can't wait cross what? haha! believes trumps twitter! couple places look positive percentage great track daily percentage rates (manual math still required)

Then overall positive rates - last checked percentage still good Ohio (3-4%) uptick. Curious see today's results. them, however, sort positive seen dangerous. 

To us, we're arrogant ignorant laugh. 

Please considerate. might get sick, many people won't, better sick kill family result bringing them?

Use noggin. agree. we're 5 months NIOSH approved masks still expensive difficult find. Despite fact nobody wants wear them. *some* Americans. ok group *all* Americans one bucket something negative totally unacceptable group. There's millions Americans, included, trying right thing. We're asking recognition we're asking stop defining us worst examples ...but why? Yes. owners know large amount customers give shit rules support stay open. Abbot said plenty hospital beds state wide. good.

Keep catchin rona yall. guess 9/11 wasn‚Äôt mass tragedy either??? ü§î non-contact IR thermometers worse useless. quote statistic though people gunshot wounds got classified corona death tested positive. Sheds huge negative light lack confidence numbers thrown around. South Carolina here.

The curve never gone down. Ever. up. areas heavy sustained protests. protests spikes would happening anywhere else. Boston NYC pretty solid examples 

Why want badly protesters people refuse wear masks public?   probably best news we‚Äôve years. see example, country deal pandemic without masks, still continue disregard favor carefully cherry picked ""recent studies"" prove otherwise, confirmation bias, useless one here. NYC? people believe science here. guy underground last 4 months? always... clubs/bars places bored people go try feel important, get laid, and/or feel like someone wants f@‚Ç¨k them. AKA - socializing ü§£ Well, quit, what? hiring economy? protestors get Coronavirus. mean get serious comment (hopefully). polarization ridiculous right now. sake angry bit rational please try spend little less time echo chambers. Honestly got people going fucking crazy.

I'm pretty sure sarcastic remark aiming denialism protestors getting COVID causing current spike. People keep blaming spike everything else saying things like ""but masks outdoors, spike"" spike showed ""that's re-opening!"" even though re-opening already spike. even saw someone blaming town tourists lol. y‚Äôall think high school football happen?

Edit: gettin downvoted literally asked question shockingly similar experience North Georgia. forced. 

from PPE testing, successful management Pandmeic requires national program Oh, not, all. one is. We're headed right global warming top speed we've already blown past points return. feedback loops already active, see craters exploding methane Siberia due melting permafrost, holds gigatonnes greenhouse gasses far surpass humanity's emissions combined.

We're completely fucked. think many billionaires enthusiastic building space ships Moon Mars colonies? physician work taking recommended well long I'm risk exposed COVID. said long term use get form treatment plan going. Muh Freedumbs! Sure, fixed, willing consider happens, hell vulnerable people. would non-profit starters, otherwise, never fixed. believe /r/idiotsincars fresh way. next step putting decision individual cities far late. Taking trump playbook. sad. Cole county (capital home ) second death today yesterday. 
I've hearing lots rumors cases deaths hidden. scary.
Rural areas think masks joke fake. Yeah I'm surprised guy dialed hospitals texas let know hey blow soon, covid better car crash, would ecstatic know Peninsula effect. novel viruses rapidly spreading pandemics killing hundreds thousands infecting millions relatively short amount time spread countries world. Ebola isolated vs covid 19, even sars wasnt bad. needs work Nov. 3rd.  r/wcgw feel that, bud. really fucking do. I‚Äôm sure want stay country now, even Biden wins get place back track. pure selfishness general population stunned me. I‚Äôm genuinely hurt this.  Thanks suggestion. search SFL SFW? There‚Äôs things can‚Äôt unsee years. Mostly non-consenting animals. 

One... can't remember cow think large farm animal. Dude climbs ladder mount animal gets bored walks away mid thrust.

Dick out, dude falls ladder, lands hard knees hold up, dudes penis gets covered animals shit.

He tried lie ER extremely difficult explain injuries. Protests. Even though increase started soon scientifically protests. Increases cases blamed something happened day two earlier throughout pandemic. JFC, sheer incompetence companies leads believe fail fade memory. bit topic...

 Temp checks work, test likely testing close contacts. given plasma Trump would this. president would I‚Äôll keep using mask used rated 4 hours max 72 hours like I‚Äôm told lol. Thanks well wish though. Hope I‚Äôm strong enough much issues if/when get it. comment CNN, 2 staffers rally. 1st 6 discovered prior attend.
6 + 2 + 2SecSer fair, problem there's alcohol. always, want see difference deaths report date actual death date Sweden, check out: big report bump Wednesday, actual death rate probably way 3/million now. initial response certainly perfect. virus came absolute unfortunate timing; country still 0 (known) cases, southern provinces celebrated Carnival. absolute perfect storm SSE; loads drunk people overly crowded bars (mostly inside, winter). 

How numbers cases decreasing consistently since peak? honestly know. No, coma. way could get subconscious. Wake up! Please come back us! miss you! I've saying, ""they need slow airports 1 .month"".

Seriously, president, would make happen, force everyone wear mask public. Also, I'd try provide free goggles mask/goggles would almost entirely prevent spreading public. would done shit now.

Please vote next election. Poor leadership led us dark place. ""heres muh math estimations ballparks tho"" true happens germany too, certain politicans using reopening stores advertize ""people saviors"" T-cells permanent body T-cells, yes make immune system memory. question long strong immunity Covid. Hard test early juncture, impossible know exhale virus laden micro droplets, mask catches - wearing one. someone wearing mask, virus laden droplets *evaporate*, leaving behind nuclei loaded virus remain airborne.

I believe logic cloth mask particularly effective preventing floating droplet nuclei reaching lungs droplet part evaporated.

That's far get line reasoning. idea get ""I bother masks protect me."" me, logical conclusion ""if put piece electrostatic HVAC filter cloth mask, protect others first, protecting others becomes secondary function mask."" True would think one would try preserve limited time instead encouraging come early. knows still live past 90! remember 9/11 though? remember time parents able get internet. remember thinking cool exciting computers 2nd grade, lol. Listen, simply asked graph. sure answered like nutty. literally nothing simple question asked. wrong lol? we're trying get accurate level patients actually experiencing intensive care, nuanced?

If put wheels grandma ain't bicycle, still grandma. youngest turned six can‚Äôt believe little goofball she‚Äôs turned into. She‚Äôs gotten much taller. best part pants turned floods couldn‚Äôt get new ones. It‚Äôs wild. amazing experience. Glad I‚Äôm tortured interpretation QALY ever seen. Typical redditor enlightened intelligence I'm mandating Texans attend mask less rave poorly ventilated warehouse. course people traveling lot areas hyper vigilant virus people taking might normally might think cold seriously maybe beginning pandemic (before lockdowns) weren‚Äôt. 

And I‚Äôd still consider areas refer ‚Äúpreviously low risk‚Äù low risk. Sure may travelers coming could potentially infect people, that‚Äôs much less risk felt back beginning April barely testing.

But point, I‚Äôd stay away tourist-y areas exact reason. Luckily I‚Äôm suburbs major city people wouldn‚Äôt even think visit family I‚Äôm worried tourist aspect area. wait somebody know sick take pandemic seriously, late. Unfortunately, far many people realize this, even otherwise believe virus real threat. ever see pushing garbage posts? Hospitalizations skyrocketing youre ""this disease affect less car crash"" like two things even fucking universe. wonder why... Awwww sucks one could saw coming Wtf... anti science people going shunned. Yeah, Washington represent! even able get free testing result less 24 hours applying appointment. Glad Mississippi. He's Arizona sheriff, tracks. Everyone care anymore discipline whatsoever. Ridiculous whine much cannot take 1 month wearing masks limited shopping options. yes! point push came shove, could house covid patients non ICU setting. type consideration important trying get accurate reading situation. places still open means people still going there. 

SMH. Darwin anticipated this. inside car always know driving safely. covid 19 never know late damage already done. look grandma passed years ago. think he's excepted death part life. go point, enjoy time have. Miami state mind! Wrong shit. problem 75, 80-90 years'old. present challenge even medical professionals. comparing Korea absolute best countries handled virus. merely responding statement 'They really well too', imply longer good job, bull shit implication. adding context discussion. People read headline, see post, think Korea explosion cases something, reality 11 domestic cases yesterday, around 30-40 domestic cases past weeks. comment lacked context. Let em get hit hard take seriously, way anyone learns something anymore Let's keep catchin rona then!

We plenty beds available.

Let's spread disease around. Plenty beds fill up. No, safely say based given info. afford quit job potentially go without income months extremely privileged.

For huge amount people choice risk covid able feed children. High-risk categories broad, general refers older people (especially 65+ years old) pre-existing medical conditions especially relating respiratory systems (asthma, compromised lung capacity smoking, etc). believe studies also linked obesity factors higher percentage severe cases. consult doctor details.

Studies whether it‚Äôs airborne seem inconclusive. Experts largely agree mainly spreads person person respiratory droplets released person virus coughs, sneezes, talks. studies suggest simply carried air. novel (new) coronavirus, it‚Äôs hard definitively say one another now. mentioned antivirals worked well remember reading American couple India February treated HIV medication recovered lot faster most. Anecdotal evidence point. interesting haven‚Äôt read much use HIV medication treatment like February/early March. mind understand HIV medications awful side effects. Could reason why. actions, tool. two year old account posted first comment two months ago.

It took 5-10 comments first start talking lockdowns create mass starvation throughout world best stay open elderly get sick die.

Also, posts l*beral countries like Denmark bad.

60 days ago, account started posting, Governor Kemp made news opening state early, states followed suit doing.

Not coincidence.

Astro turf accounts bad. Testing didn‚Äôt cause spikes DERP DERP. I'm sure point then? people stayed home protests, cause much spread? matter?

My point whether protests proved spread happen crowds, possible. point overall spike cases explicitly caused protests. supported data available locales. possible, rare. Finding homecare lot difficult signing nursing service. eventually gave up. aide couple times week sitter week toddler catch house stuff. can't afford pay someone 30+ hours week find people help regularly aides interviewed would trusted all. nursing service giant clusterfuck itself, though individual nurses almost great. year half Mom suffered neglect home short stay post surgery . I'm sending back easy see option everybody. life. can't make friends. hardly ever full hour concentrate hobby. effected health, marriage can't everything son wanted age.  basically, says shutting businesses last resort. Yet, reopening businesses caused drastic increase cases. would like turn faucet water comes say, ""we stop water coming turning faucet last resort.""

Does position state Governor require high school diploma? Go back read media statements first quarter. cut dried seem think.

BTW think people continue become infected either reach herd immunity, like 200 million cases counting asymptomatic ones ones tested, vaccine widely used.   

You lock quarantine much long. Flatten curve mean eliminate curve.  

Yes, wear mask, social distance, stay home much possible. K think it‚Äôs hasn‚Äôt affected lot people personally, based social circle people think covid February probably incorrect He's never eaten cop life. Unless count one time truck stop. Great question, don‚Äôt know. Maybe someone SARS MERS blood tested blood, maybe it‚Äôs missing SARS-1.5, maybe ducking Covid isn‚Äôt novel.

The real answer idea baffled, it‚Äôs 1 time thing, seen others well mean works pregnancy tests would Haulover beach Florida, lol Looking crowd, lowest risk dying COVID-19. fact backed death data country planet. carts easy way count....

&amp;#x200B;

Those stores allowed X floks based size. allow 60, make 60 carts available done could batch testing.  dont understand comment. implying Canadian federal government overreaching travel ban, closed borders asking people stay home must go somewhere, wear mask order flatten curve?

Edit: wait, minimally fatal? 100k died covid 19 us far even Canada killed thousands, infections slowing provinces. don‚Äôt know me. Family health comes anything else. HEARD  Trump? Really lol? Get Yup.

And CARES Act provisions expiring.

Those million dollar medical bills people pay?

Disappearing. ICU care involves much close monitoring care care team...more frequent rounds MD's, checking nurses. much labor resource intensive. Nurses typically one two patients require intensive care whereas assigned 6 8 patients require intensive care. goes way beyond respiratory needs. 

The patient may ICU bed require ICU level care. many reason discussed posts. can't imagine might be. . . Screening temp checks half measures, testing everyone gets near president. honor the, though? Yeah sure people meat plant Mars. always center outbreaks. Important point controlling it. 

Wtf offended btw? didn‚Äôt say anything negative. Maybe ask corona behave accordingly order stain ur countries name. Hope magic good news, make sense.

This also problem reporting daily information. Monday data always suspect weekends entirely variable. Staffing different everywhere. Trends time really matter. hand people die year(and maybe next) statistics going forward...  honestly feel sorry people. selfish, self centred also *un*centred unable deal life without usual distractions keeping ""busy"", usually amounts running around unnecessary bullshit. Eating restaurants time. Shopping recreational consumerism general. Even approach actual recreation like hiking sports whatever, it, usually based around consumerism distraction. 

I feel like known many personality types almost seem need feel important busy, actually important busy. theatre. 

I mean, holy shit much life running around circles nothing. slow fuck down. whole thing showing people concept simplify even little bit. even mean like, going without electricity something, mean slowing little. Wonder one things son law thought belonged federal stockpile. 

Wouldn't surprised white house policy exists gather antibodies soon possible contagious illness president... 

Makes sense gather many antidotes poisons etc too. wonder freezer full Ebola antibodies case attack epidemice spikes cases continue testing. bet reduce amount testing amount cases also reduced.

\-Donald Trump (paraphrased) Repubs assholes.  Following month‚Äôs headline: Raleigh BBQ owner dead ventilator several weeks believe that‚Äôs cumulative weekend today mainly central southern counties listening begin with, yes extremely blue holdouts red happen center recent outbreaks... Yes, freezing virus samples preserve virus.

Freezing kills bacteria parasites. effect virus. Cuomo made fair share mistakes, üëè also live essential workers become one myself. I'm 19 January moved mom's house cramped apartment friends abusive, though asked come back months trust stay safe. course became miserable went back poverty get away her. Although worried friends insisted needed job anyways enough, here, simply need one we're always struggling pay rent bills. Either way, I'm forced putting really be. can't trust public (and let's face it, can't) I'm relying chance. Old ppl higher prevalence vit deficiency.

Old ppl also grey hair.

Old ppl worst outcomes.

So ppl also dye hair?

I saying vit def shouldnt corrected, think jack shit abt covid specifically. It‚Äôs nearly month since protests started. Early data shows hasn‚Äôt increase among protesters doubt significant increase alone.  didn‚Äôt get sign door all. school janitor shortages year could barely keep up. never mopped floors wiped tables. wipe tables myself, started using bleach cleaner March spring break. never soap paper towels teacher bathrooms soap room bought myself. Ridiculous. know fact actually mentioned shut sorta kinda reason optimism. 

 ""if start wearing masks slow spread covid-19, could result \[businesses\] actually close back down,"" Governor Abbott said. 

I can't stand Abbott, maybe maybe he's total moron. week after: Big Al, took crap one, missed. school (texas), one math teachers period 39 students. Needless say, angry parents got classroom size 30 still.  Yup. 20-somethings lingering symptoms. immune? long? lingering symptoms last. Second wave, they'll immune compromised.   F man sorry...I can‚Äôt imagine Well, lot southern/midwest residents believe life death true, they'll learn then. sad get see faces, oh well. feel you. Even things still go initially reaching MOH think postponing. Especially since majority people flying (me one girl driving it‚Äôs far us). I‚Äôm planner it‚Äôs hard know keep asking thoughts. Florida. one person mentioned. passed responsibility state make decisions, absolving himself, even though individual states resources respond pandemic way federal government can. Meanwhile, many state governors gone extreme lengths order fall line whatever says. says slow testing, slow testing. says reopen, reopen, regardless number cases cost human life.

It whole movement policy makers - especially certain party cannot mention - unwilling make data-based science-based decisions control spread virus. actively deliberately things produce data want see order support reopening.

For example, Arizona almost testing capacity April. tests prioritized hospitalized patients intensive care. May, university's epidemiological study cancelled, tests used ""testing blitz"" - essentially, testing many people possible. went specific testing target patients likely infection, 10.000 people tested every day symptoms. obvious reasons, % positive cases test decreased. Arizona governor used basis reopening claiming outbreak ""over"" reopened May. one highest rates world.

Also - say name without word filter removing it? Lucky you. got laid [gee thanks Holy shit!

That's crazy. worked ICU peak month COVID. hospital non-ICU COVID patients ICU beds keep COVID patients together. non-COVID patients given ICU care outside ICU.

There‚Äôs bunch BS happening COVID reporting designed hide numbers, first I‚Äôve seen actually seems reasonable. it‚Äôs easy put take touching backs ear loops. doctors might dead retired link data showing correlation cities protests increasing covid rates, I'm sure researchers conducting studies would happy review it. stands, *far* people going normal day (working, shopping, socializing) without masks protesting. Magnitudes more. Eye Duh Hoe pretty good overview. I'm sure come example text situation lol confirm. family member positive wife unable get tested today. place went tests think doctor test us either.  link info?  state's dashboard day percentage often wildly inflated. much porn pornhub could devote entire life watching probably would able finish Arizona damn hot hot enough kill virus seconds breathe out. People get it. Arizona hot enough whole planet would arid wasteland. Glad mentioned Oklahoma, bc that'd exact shit hear GA.  oH GeE WoNdEr pRoTeStS Undocumented workers I'm sure protesting good kickstart Anecdotally, believe back March. wife got new variant antibody test recently tested positive iiG. got sick March 10: major fatigue, confusion, anorexia, weird cold like symptoms, loss smell, loss taste, diarrhea. still feel like lung capacity way down. energy level shot. get winded easily. Months later. already hit Europe wish safe travels. Yep... surprise. would posting terrible numbers manipulating them.... make us look better? We're terrible job then. even reporting spikes cases?

Edit: I'm specifically talking US Well weekend. It'll probably go back week goes on. Same. Actually spent around 9+ weeks kid wish didn‚Äôt go back work. think compelled government anything bad wrong evil

If voluntarily wore mask, need government mandate. true possible causes death reported COVID, also true spike PIC deaths unmistakable.

It also certainly possible kids die this. We've seen new inflammatory syndrome younger people. could also underlying condition undiagnosed.

Either way, I'm taking chances. Masks distancing there's effective vaccine. Idahoan

Question, pronounce ""-hoan"" ""owen"" like ""own""? sit election... words more. Ok alarmed yet article saying they‚Äôre mostly 80%. Like I‚Äôm trying figure what‚Äôs normal versus would warrant bring-in-the-covid-hospital-ship level panic? think within 2 years might vaccine distributed things would start switch back. Basically it‚Äôs consumer choice - going school worth x amount money it‚Äôs worth x amount plus risk death. That‚Äôs a.. different consumer equation. don‚Äôt think parents would behave expected ways death line.

You take death table though? literally risk child killing everyone household inhaling sneeze someone less responsible parents? happen fast. didn‚Äôt really think saw movie Contagion. probably realistic part film. moment vaccine becomes widespread everything snap back motion.

So it‚Äôs temporary thing. think. experience economy make comeback it‚Äôs safe. Right there‚Äôs short burst activity shut again.

Question - existing institutions can‚Äôt survive two years without revenue irl students. Nothing done white collar layoffs, bring on. wife school nurse, too. Let us moment please one advocating spending infinite money, genius. Idiot mods think thing separated politics, politics actively making worse. Insane. I'd rather read EU banning travel US solve virus problem. Also enforce quarantines incoming US servicemen. US doesnt play along need restrict movement US military personnel country bases. option add amazon fresh. supplies back probably. Ppl buying like before. hope states continue fall, us(in states, NY, PA, NJ) sacrificed 3 months lives this. Idk I'm gonna lockdown again. super depressed, finally reopening. Nobody knows why

Demographics. Hispanics over-represented Covid cases. Like North 10% population, 44% cases 7% deaths"" (State ""Deciding Next Step"" Taylor ham Burk? Swedish corona strategy hard work. Arizona! Yay even schools starting year kids coming back school. gotten haircut 6 months due fear, telling even worse hey alright rights matter responsibility. big city hospital ICUs begun filling up. Guess want smoke all.  counties SD infections per capita Queens NY. Let hospitals fill. We'll see much hoax strokes, heart attacks, car accidents, hemorrhaging moms, emergencies anywhere go. state mandating masks, I'm starting see people slip stop caring. LOTS people covering mouths, leaving nose open. Like okay, mostly spread mouth, *but still spread nose*. Plus, breathing nose, completely unprotected yourself. county recently came red, we're green yet people acting like means over.  Lol, we've there.

I hearty chuckle, COMPLETE waste.  course is. could test every death, subtract tiny number coincidental overlapping deaths. choose want accurate numbers. get source that? sending best people. Shit, sorry pop. I‚Äôm teacher district story. plan they‚Äôve released incredibly vague asked HR clarification fall duties (ie literally keep POSITION given ‚Äúguidelines‚Äù) could tell me. It‚Äôs fucking mess. Unions faaaaaaar good bad. assume bad unions reflect all. Hospitals I‚Äôve worked aim 85%. different ICU‚Äôs. Usually Medical ICU, Surgical Trauma ICU, Cardiac ICU Neuro ICU different capacity occupancy rates. Also Pediatric ICU Neonatal ICU may included regular ICU statistics. ""tHeYrE iNfLaTiNg nUmBeRs"" absolutely obsessed following Covid since nov. work home last 3 months. go grocery store see 2 friends. going Florida holiday weekend. won‚Äôt flying, going bars restaurants, beach KNOWN low key. consider generally sane person, live south, life fucking hard, need something look forward months isolation insane work volume. Florida vacant. Florida isn‚Äôt gonna shut down. It‚Äôs gonna bad. summer, it‚Äôs time shine. Breathe in. talk us. wait... It‚Äôs typical thing. Admittedly read title, correct, sounds like school wanted graduation wasn‚Äôt allowed decided hold graduation disguised protest since protesting still allowed? Sounds like used protests loophole hold graduation. forms tourism risky anyway precautions. whole counties without cases ones rather safe.

F. let go years ago. didn‚Äôt say Easter. It‚Äôs also insane think every household parent stay home kids months. think everyone work home? Got email old church titled ‚Äúleaving COVID season behind‚Äù something similar. can‚Äôt believe irresponsible people this, literally acting like doesn‚Äôt exist it‚Äôs worse ever know, pigs raised butchered within building? meant farmers growers driver come contact produce can't fix stupid. I'm Dallas.

Yep. Allow open. 

Blame them. whole situation egregious hope recall gets bad. He‚Äôs going reverse course without Trump‚Äôs approval ilk currently economy public safety. way put onus addressing counties, neutered anything especially heinous. guy friends rot. China tried welding doors, people climbed windows, 8th story, stopped that.

China switched mandatory government isolation quarantine, worked much better. still use this, effective. FL getting away it? likely got many questions UK made explicit. LA seems city roll back testing Sunday Rigging numbers make look bad. Actually Germans r worried abt spike. 
Because local state govt handling well. big scandal GER (hopefully) nail coffin political career local state governor/PM.

They closed schools affected regions feds sent em team cdc-equivalent 'support' local state officials. basically means fucked need nannied feds.

The local outbreak running since may 5 seems company delayed reporting tried keep low profile. Locals protest front closed plant. huge clusterfuck, standards.

If u count meat plant workers pop county 1% people pos. PCR. sincerely think need regional lockdown order avoid bigger spread. He's cop, expect either serve protect? logical explanation.  Sex accidents, questions. absolutely correct outlying suburbs ridiculous- like pandemic magically gone, one needs social distance wear masks anymore. difference noticeable...the suburban sprawl, less sense common decency care concern anyone outside themselves.  Masks social distancing thing past.

Your point exposure via travel concern too. everyone begins relax, travel be, contact others, what's outlying areas state going start hitting metro areas. starts, going spread pretty quick one gives damn anymore. people like wear clothes allowed eat Applebee's fucking hog out. turd lining shit cake this. ""good"" deaths. fucking awful deaths. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Florida checking in. No. They‚Äôre even protesting economy, flat refusing believe covid still exists. Everyone moved on. husband invited huge public pool party yesterday. That's failed state territory. might true, however spains cases way point. assume reproduction factor around 1.2 spain would 3k cases day whilst USA would 375k, exponential functions somewhat stupid. medical workers tell hospitals better air filtration businesses? don‚Äôt mean COVID ward, doctor‚Äôs offices might another floor operating floor. True, trending younger well. 2 look like trust them. didn‚Äôt report time posted 69 4 days it‚Äôs simply ridiculous given last week 100 1 day. Texas stay locked bc hospitalizations rose. Got it. proved point. 

Here‚Äôs fact don‚Äôt want hear. People die. media told deaths matter deaths eat up.

The lockdowns slow curve. happened. can‚Äôt stop everyone everything happening. you‚Äôre scared STAY HOME. recommend read article linked post. agree officials may make choices favor motive trying get across, article stating patience listed ICU however, receiving ICU care making reporting skewed. Whether true undetermined, title article misleading. Mask wearing varies wildly depending go stl county. I've gotten takeout restaurants last 2 weekends, time employees either wearing mask around neck. like, damn restaurants even give fuck? I've various grocery stores since then, pretty good. Give covid daddy Probably want numbers look better Canada opens border. Canadian, say NO. Stay away. Well, yeah heads state arent telling people hoax flu. deserve whatever get shame wearing mask akin many ""taking right go bar away"". I'll tell last month shares diving. 
It's country, one side says somethint side opposite spite. Oh well.  There's reason people wearing masks world right now, despite whatever point trying make nothing link graph. Might want step evidence collection, competing scientists doctors lol IMHO, answer ""obviously yes""

But *real* question far ramp point? Florida report hospitalizations extreme care CDC reports flu, COVID pneumonia deaths every week. Deaths lag bit, find chart bottom page, see percentage deaths PIC (pneumonia, influenza COVID) epidemic levels. Data updated Friday, lags week aint king LG Basically, church ignored Governor's order held graduation services hundreds building masks social distancing. Multiple times. teach libs. chinese propaganda platform says now? Also, 30,000 cases per day US?! actual fuck. That‚Äôs happens raise country ideals looking yourself, part nation. 

Holy fuck. Greetings, fellow Pasco teacher! homes two working parents? supposed stay home kids another months? everyone work home. think people afford take leave absence economy? unrealistic privileged. still, large portion USA medical debt.. Jfc said spike due **the protests.** link says nothing that. consider spike might due memorial day? real source would considered that. 

This silly. I'm out. booked trip Mexico August, fully refundable.  

We'll see July plays out. point getting data in, analyzing it, safety measures place we're traveling making decision that.  

If cases/deaths all-time high, hotels shutting down, businesses, etc. brainer.  

Selfish, I've isolating since March 13th need house.  I'm young, healthy pre-existing conditions.  wearing mask, using tons hand sanitizer, distancing anyone wife. St Louis fucking crazy. Bro, finish sentence. ""and retort going about...."". Thus *if* million people died Covid, ""its flu"" crowd would still tell disaster. Americans perform labor. China excellent tests, things basically control. Fewer 300 cases nationally, compared 1,000+ US Tyson plant, need anything. China releasing truth obviously much better America. Course did. Implementing 5G insane. Time go massive campaign paints everyone insane people, like normally do, cheer gloat great look forward new technology like usual. care insane long right picture painted make mind ease. absurd dumb idea difference basic mitigation hiding bunker lot people need die. comes bullshit train! welcome! thought funny, wanted actually clarify things too. [Choose weapon (dice want go evidence accept masks similarly effective closing schools. 

Not one measure alone relevant result. countries managed get results without masks mean masks replaced example closing schools (there studies place similar effectiveness). 

And choose closing schools wearing mask visit store 30 min use public transportation yeah... 

The effect really good great cost/benefit ratio. Someone take food big Al's office make sure wipe hands cough everything. said 'wherever like' I'm sure he's man word want restrict freedom. Dealers spoke 4-5 weeks infection spikes. Understand takes 4-5 weeks kill you. hope wrong probably right. Cases good if

There end sentence astoundingly stupid/a huge reach. Viva la Covid! felt slighted budget increases approved consulted mask order signed county. Last checked enforcing order now. think anywhere Philadelphia to, northern North Carolina ridiculous weather. It‚Äôs stupid-humid summer, winters cool damp‚Äîbut still get occasional ice snow storm throws everything chaos. grew New England, live NYC. It‚Äôs furthest south I‚Äôve lived. I‚Äôm sure could go much south Jersey. Either go Florida Texas Arizona, stay north. Explain? I'm sure kinds idiotic ideas seem acceptable you. make good ideas. FWIW, many states, qualify medicaid living paycheck paycheck making minimum wage. get information? That's think. !remind 5 years got temp ban saying something close Boris got sick. interesting comments catch eye, speak. worry, educating me. love educating idiots like let's don‚Äôt work industry sir idea thing called ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù

Lol @ retarded idiot telling idea real world. Yes - nailed it. funny know sub censored yet keep using it? need get here. surprising deaths remained low end. That's great news honestly. However, wonder well folks recovering get really bad. Anyone know get stats hospitalizations? best indicator hospitalization, wait 2 3 weeks red slowly show up. hospitalization sky rocketing, that‚Äôs good sign, mean state threw 3 months preparation window shite reopening plan. Better testing, changes demographic people infected. 

We always known testing captured small percentage cases, better availability testing seeing lot mild asymptomatic cases went unreported before. 

We also know differences mortality rate mostly age distribution. virus getting weaker - scientists still saying functional difference existing strains - virus infect matters lot. infected 80 year olds, fatality would 10%, infected 40 year olds, fatality would 0.1% under. seems happening US virus shifted away elderly population, probably due better protection nursing homes (typically 50%-80% fatalities) population seeing much smaller death/case ratio result. Outside large metropolises Texas nobody begun take thing seriously yet. lockdown, know better now. Florida saw 12 deaths today. under-65 demographic risk dying Covi-19 comparable automobile accident. Unless high risk: mask up, space-out, live on! Maybe listens Oann buys treatment Alex Jones instead (I\`m racist, but) Mexicans! black people! always mexicans black people.

This post brought confederate gang. 
‚Äú**All animals equal**, animals equal others.‚Äù There's lag time infections death.

My patients likely die placed vent. ECMO.

It takes 20-something days vent patient either dies improves.

I would expect deaths spike month cases beginning health care system collapses. cases skyrocketing......but deaths declining? movie theatres restaurants deal this? People can‚Äôt eat/drink wearing masks. get special exemptions?  grew close Mason-Dixon line. weather atrocious different reasons. politics make worse. fact went Yale Harvard Law School, makes wonder wtf going on. mean could several possibilities, smart he‚Äôs purpose, rich parents dumb dumb, cruel cosmic joke don‚Äôt understand... got attention least one them. Maybe read discussion thread open opinions open exchange ideas challenged little. Probably not, maybe. Yesss Everyday delay taking serious action makes situation much harder recover from. saying die wearing mask.

Just long home take medical resources, i'm sure feel bunch science 'mumbo-jumbo' anyways. 

Just throw biohazard body bag doorstep table collection times. CDC publishes rates excess mortality entire US. Here's mind death certificates lag lot, recent weeks change. shutting people who... interest wasting time trying educate you. media brainwashed nothing say change that.

Just know way think, reddit thinks general way real world works. cotton candy fairy tale world everyone afraid shadow lives fear. OH GOD 100k people died world coming end.

650k die year heart disease one give fuck. media tells afraid eat up. Telling people change careers based fear shit. don‚Äôt work industry sir idea thing called ‚Äúthe real world‚Äù truly appreciate that. Really. yes, words seem hollow......but intention felt (if good).

Yeah. definitely one things, almost 29 years age, makes feel like I'm truly adult. can't want. others depending me. But, make do. I'm blessed wonderful support system friends surrounding care want help. everyone that.

And yeah, trending little bit, BLM movement protests going on, we've definitely moved back burner. hazard pay proposal, they're fighting keep us it. we're truly middle danger. kinda wanna like, ""well come see put tell we're danger."" I've co-workers literally spit on/coughed spite. enough make anyone breakdown. 

I feel like Walmart Reddit go that. vent support/comfort one another. subreddit definitely big help days I've angry seriously thought quitting. Seeing others going shit definitely helps calm bit. 

But thank much!!!!! truly appreciate kind words!!!! stay safe well. We'll get this! makes much sense! Another way Europe ahead U.S. ""hands-on care,"" mean care more... *intensive*... patients would receive? That's true though. Distancing masks work example. rural areas, disease disproportionately affecting immigrant farmworkers meat processing workers. admitting virus problem, also exposing company‚Äôs labor hiring practices. story outbreak meat processing plant Sioux Falls leaked local paper teenager whose parents worked plant. story [the BBC fascinating. workers literally world. 80 (!) languages spoken plant. 

And Smithfield, company runs plant, owned Chinese company (WH Group), purchased Smithfield $4.7 billion 2014. no. love living boot authority figure chance? Chinese citizens residents only. 

Minimum 14 day isolation quarantine travelers. 2 negative tests required release. I've eating 3 masks week I'm healthy. cells know make antibodies, yeah? pathogen enters system start pumping virus killing antibody army. actually highly doubt even knows people meets getting tested. aren't. Worldometer reputable. Seems acceptable me. don‚Äôt know law US is, thought president US could order states get Lockdown... whereas European Union every country decides themselves. European Union would decided act together would come closer state situation US. even case sure EU would acted better faster US. Probably number deaths would even lower. k u/undeleteparent  First, thank service. Heroes like deserve recognition better treatment respect. truly hope survive ordeal one day regale friends family stories covid years. Stay safe. rate see pass Italy

At current difference death rate Sweden Italy, it'll take two months. However, Sweden's death rate decreasing faster Italy's moment, long trend continues, time keep increasing.

RemindMe! 2 months won‚Äôt believe see it. They‚Äôll believe ever authoritarian worship tells it‚Äôs so. miss family too!!! last time saw August last year, supposed visit two weeks ago there‚Äôs thing called Covid-19!!!! When‚Äôs last time visited family?  *only* thing stop covid, stay locked there's vaccine. gonna happen, can't happen. quicker come terms fact, better be. never said were. said they‚Äôre well way, would rather get overwhelmed taking action? Hospitalizations states rise right now...your answer let things go hospitals collapse increasing surge cases? 

4 Houston hospitals indeed already right like prompt actions ‚Äúleaders‚Äù people instead saying ‚Äúmeh...we‚Äôre overwhelmed yet it‚Äôs good‚Äù. idea much tougher thing gets areas point return reached? It‚Äôs much wiser proactive thing instead reactive, even means sacrificing haircut better good society. hat wearing said this? money hat, mandatory biology 101 course hat, mouthpiece hat Pinocchio hat (not liar part although would work too, strings part) Listen little shit. cases going up.......but deaths going down? Even then, people get it. saw video posted yesterday president's rally guy's like ""yeah, friend die it, son sick while... really still think real."" many affected it?

If said 40% American deaths Obesity-related, that's America fat. Good luck both. I'm disability dont leave house often I'm surprised many people arent wearing masks staying away people. Part pays medications enrolled plan, reported sixty-five percent seniors‚Äô prescription costs out-of-pocket.   
   Honestly mind people going fun. fun social distancing. want go park? Great. make sure park crowded family stay good distance others. Wear mask.  ENGAGE time funding appropriated, already confirmed pandemic going 1-2 year situation. metaphor ""putting fire first month"" covid never spreads population complete fiction place conversation use funds.

Your argument holds merit. engage you. Pass buck, likely. Point finger, blame other, watch temple topple over. way could resist buying shares pimping manufacturer Rose Garden true. never fall cases good camp. infect others.

hospitalizations states outbreaks. There's possible reasons decline. One possibility larger proportion new cases among younger people (or younger tested more).

Another possibility virus mutating less lethal. 

My money first option. Younger folks typically going higher chances getting virus reopening. They're likely working likely older vulnerable folks.

But, worth noting vulnerable hit too, also need interact others, though less younger folks. high disease rate community eventually spread older vulnerable people. reason phase 3 trials take long typical circumstances unless challenge trial need wait see fewer people get infected expected. normal circumstances diseases currently trying vaccinate spreading pandemic levels. need wait really long time generate statistically significant results.

Eye opening, thank lying bed night imagine fly wall Biden transition team office, call CDC ask many people MDs PhDs spare. comforting. north got first 125 K south get second 125 K.

250 K early worst case scenario estimates that's looking possible now.

I can't imagine 400-500 K dead.

Remindme! 3 months Maintained? mean 'achieved' Lol *COVID ICU* like place patients hang out

gtfo Gotta Blame someone True, it‚Äôs worse nursing homes. they‚Äôre anything like Australia (where am) usually one qualified nurse lot carers usually equivalent home carers. Basic first aid know shower residents etc. hospitals you‚Äôll anaesthetists, trained nurses bevy specialists call well porters diagnostic allied health staff (eg. Radiology, dietitians, social workers etc). can‚Äôt even imagine work nursing home time, would absolute nightmare. Add fact nursing homes high number affected residents too. would feel completely helpless there‚Äôs specialised help available, equipment. It‚Äôs despicable you‚Äôre receiving threats desperately need support. want wash hands problem leave people die hospitals overwhelmed it‚Äôs case ‚Äúwell...it‚Äôs you‚Äù. can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre allowing visitors. That‚Äôs insane. love cheetos chance? Despite mandaory buses see maybe 1 20 passengers wearing one barely drivers. joke. elitist coastal liberal experts say it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs bad. actually look journal articles, first one *all* patients. cohort people outbreak (Diamond Princess) everyone tested disease whether showing symptoms - none patients hospitalized. Anyone know COVID cases getting high.......but deaths going low? Honestly feel like already pumped full someone else's plasma, symptoms awful adamantly believes simple flu. Way ahead Texas. Time elected officials pull heads sand. mom legionnaires years ago extremely concerned her. pretty good job going anywhere to, still. could take forgetting wash hands one time. Totally true. 1031 infected Tyson plant 3000 workers. anyone pretend American meatpacking somehow cleaner hygenic. That's bullshit. Drive Overton square, brain explode. leadership Pandemic looks like. Please link 1 article 1 hospital near full capacity guess living here...literally everything open. small number places. one heard costs like $500 go anyway Nobody Montana wearing mask makes mad. Plus opening stupid water parks it‚Äôs ‚Äúonly 400 people capacity time‚Äù good idea. Buy kids sprinkler slip n slide stay away large crowds. Ffs. relative way.

His wife works international company lot travel lot countries primarily China. public facing company, too.

He works international airport. 

And they've got son athlete.

They stayed home week gave up.

I told horror stories. work hospital. People dying alone. Blood coming nose mouth. Diapered patients paralyzed order prone them. horror stories.

Nothing gets through. Yes. agree. shut things gets point close overwhelming medical systems. vast majority places America aren‚Äôt there, anywhere close it.

Here exponential growth thing doesn‚Äôt invalidate point. Even grow herd immunity level around 60 percent population infected, still wouldn‚Äôt steal many days life Americans.

Ya Florida gotten smoked. sure much chance much mismanagement honest. seems random. longest time people criticizing Florida shutting spring break, opening beaches early, yet time that, lauding Denmark model response, even though didn‚Äôt even recommend masks, deaths per capita higher Florida‚Äôs. seems like open Florida, still aren‚Äôt wearing masks, half physical distancing guidelines, etc, good Florida isn‚Äôt well. theory Danes prefer eat outside summer, Floridans time prefer go inside A/C. Behaviorally, summer Florida kind like Denmark winter.

It shame become politicized. real problem. 

You people behave like fake one side, other, people believe grave threat public health seen generation, stop nothing reduce spread, including denying cries UN WFP shutdowns kill starvation alone worldwide save. say fake, like right warning us Covid coming, doesn‚Äôt matter people aren‚Äôt Americans.... 

Why isn‚Äôt anyone looking rationally? ironic spreads meat packing facilities like wet markets. say wear mask, I'm boat buy KN95's Ebay. good N95 - Chinese standard instances counterfeit masks there, even least good cloth mask. get 10 pack less 20 dollars use 1 mask per shift. isn‚Äôt fair comparison. EU doesn‚Äôt federal level could coordinate across members. instead dozens independent countries distinct cultures languages working piecemeal instead coordinated approach like US. Also way people EU packed mostly urban centers make risk infection much higher. Every single person know social media feed going fun selfishness. one complaining lack food money jobs. got tired able go out. ran stuff post home make feel better stopped caring virus lol. sure people forced go work take care family, government truly screwed up. much blame share ""leaders"" general public. Makes ashamed I'm gonna air side caution believe they're likely reporting truth due shitshow came month ago. beat it. came say joke's him, nobody wants come anyways Cool. like ribs big dose covid19 anyhow. Yeehaw. /s going shut protets too? virus spread protest. Well problem genuinely things going well state. idk know Supreme court ruled quarantine put place governer within powers.

So Midwest state ABSOLUTELY restrictions state level. Even Fucking Florida beat.

A county level officials western side kept quarantine, it.

Then bars open completely pact. (Thanks Tavern League lobbying group) facebook groups addition neighboring states still locked go bar hopping. 

Low behold half bars town closing 2 weeks reopening completely outbreak every one.

People fucking dumb. There‚Äôs saying goes, ‚ÄúEveryone Florida either end life end rope.‚Äù know takes little go sick dead, right? Fauci well, also fucked many messages. blaming trump, followed advice fauci n birx
.... Yes ones can't wait get back office get BACK NORMAL again. 

I feel like many people like ""normal"" bristle thought. Hopefully change Yes. said, quite shame impossible know. Florida's insistence lying pandemic going weaken suppression efforts, certainly kill people within state. Yeah point asking people comply isn‚Äôt going work, threaten people get they‚Äôre supposed sometimes least I'm apex legends classic wow player, yikes. don‚Äôt get Bezos rich without little dirty. Good you, want sticker? know yet, talk it... would beginning see effects that, however outside transmission much less factor inside... 3 3, way go! Yeah staffers sarcastic! midsize Florida town refused mandate masks, even this. What. The. Fuck. spouse high risk, we've stuck inside since March end sight idiots around refuse listen science reason. Coronavirus porn becoming quite popular pornhub adding here? see sub today record breaking infections 12 states, yet lowest number deaths 3 months? wrong picture? assuming bunch idiots notice? 34, relatively late delete it. still miss them. lack understanding situations and/or feelings others. 

Nope. even close apathy means. normally win arguments making definitions people completely screwed virus, fault (in many situations), can‚Äôt pack everything make new livelihood.

Sure can. mean? Unless think lazy idiots, fuck pack something new.

Do think lazy obliterate multiple industries, kind message sending culture? 

That care deadly disease certain night life.

We already send message course enormous restrictions night life pretty much everywhere WORLD? lives?

That deadly diseases bad create lots expect people open small businesses, drive economy, tell to, essentially, ‚Äúpull together‚Äù try again?

The way always have. nothing new. Obviously even owners restaurants bars disappeared tomorrow would plenty small businesses industries would unaffected. people would reopen bars restaurants like millennia. Well that's start counter-acting horrendous corona virus misreporting. Unfortunately, may 'to little, late'. "" *So said people, slow testing please.* "" 

and uses excuse close borders/limit immigration.

I think page. One simply get Unemployment Florida. think they're infringing rights, think needs go ways. 

If Americans coming Canada would cause massive surge cases thousand+ deaths, canadians vacationing US required testing quarantine, coming home following quarantine fear losing job doesnt, think there's clear disconnect.  local FB group I'm small city Florida, lady posted need positivity proud community we're good. 5 cases March June 1st. currently 19. pointed that's 280% increase less 30 days wants argue dumb points make sense. time frame county increased 114% state increased 76%. Small amount cases not, we're good, we're fucking bad lady!!!! virus causes COVID-19 thought spread mainly person person, mainly respiratory droplets produced infected person coughs, sneezes, talks. droplets land mouths noses people nearby possibly inhaled lungs. Spread likely people close contact one another (within 6 feet).

Here go. what? Still going stick anti- science narrative? Yeah, surviving mean lot different things, lots bad. really hope Canada keeps border shut. US well past point national response appropriate useful, well ""US States basically little countries"" territory. right Florida history, concerning. However, entirely possible previous cases know lot source transmission (plants, restaurants, etc.) could indication community spread deep initially thought (good news!). UK never wore masks.

Only seem public transport even significant number don‚Äôt. Yeah know Montana's record spiking was? 20-30 people day.

We're second healthiest state behind Hawaii, better while.

We'd need 300+ cases fell third best similar Alaska run differently US states, doesn‚Äôt mean Alaska isn‚Äôt part US proper. Yeah especially people allowed work home job necessitate it. 

I hope lot companies start allow future. Oh no, hospitals fill death rate going skyrocket  plant shut since April, doubt many currently active infections due working plant. unless submits Donald's begging reduced testing. looks like Texas set record number new daily cases outside NY. County declared racism pandemic. jumping head first politicizing term ""pandemic"". Good luck convincing people take ""pandemic"" seriously again. People already wear masks it, even less likely listen public health advice seen politicized... Bro get tested virus static stable thing, respond reactively proactively. Flatten curve Even St Charles County, masks far even though thing us St Louis County 5,000+ infections bridge... take back take mask? Cases good they‚Äôre young healthy people experiencing asymptomatic infection mild illness. Deaths today week week. really good Monday. Well shit. could predicted basically ignoring virus would make worse. Floridian can't believe people wearing masks social distancing. least admits it‚Äôs option...cough cough AZ Easter number close zero never going beat it. virus. Everyone exposed eventually. Might well hide bunker. control, though. increased testing done careful, contained, masked reopening would fine. Instead threw open doors told everyone ho hog wild. Judging today‚Äôs death toll, it‚Äôs obvious Mexico raging epidemic United States‚Äô epidemic rapidly improving (ie 5:1 death toll today). explains lot issues southern United States, clearly reopening related, given spikes aren‚Äôt happening states like Wisconsin fully reopened mask culture. know masks work. people wear masks, reduces spread virus effectively. work, people wear them.

We know social distancing work. Even 6 ft enough distance, people keep distance. keep distances, everyone room must pay attention constantly. people pay attention, get close other. Net result-- social distancing simply work. Nice idea, maybe, work practice.

The surgeon general issue mask ""order"". write prescription. *Most people told, need told.*  ""suggestion"" ""advice"", simply work. 

If governor want another shutdown, needs issue mask order. Paywall No. late think weird acceptable rate! Lt Governor said ok this, going take one team? Where's guy? knew march scientists saying driving nuts cdc saying 6 feet enough. 

And next month simulations showing regular talking could travel 27 feet indoors. I'm saying used majority funding testing contact tracing contain spread initially would fewer deaths active cases now. 

What going about? better explain control people gonna get confused lol So.... get COVID mouth... spit mouth? feel like drunk later saying "" I'm alcoholic; alcoholics go meetings."" downing 20th drink. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think going slow down. think wherever wood burn, fire going burn. right lot susceptible people,‚Äù said.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see slowing summer fall. don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going see one, two three waves. think we‚Äôre going see one very, difficult forest fire cases.‚Äù

We 20 new cases calling 2nd wave. burk infected decided dodge quarantine go family functions....  Every country made decision - arguably faulty modelling every single country paying price decisions took. Across world, are: 

\- millions job losses

\- millions people unable access critical care hospitals

\- tens, possibly hundreds thousands deaths caused lockdowns (in UK alone 10,000 dementia died alone)

\- tens, possibly hundreds thousands businesses closed never re-open

All combined lead massive amounts personal debt, illnesses, mental &amp; health problems inevitably lead huge amount deaths, - unlike Covid - counted Worldometers World Data. may never know true cost lockdowns, substantial. 

Everyone wants country save lives keep economies intact. real problem delicate balancing act try both. feeling see hindsight stratgey somewhere one Sweden took rest world took appropriate one take face another similar situation. time tell.

Outside mask ordinances may may enforcement back - current states problems anything mitigate spread. numbers keep going - people die. That's works. Aside one week county (not state) imposed lockdown employer said comply with, state following week job essential, another week job closed cleaning 2 people Covid-19 (which thankfully spread one else, attribute universal masking job place since early March ease social distance) worked throughout entire pandemic thus far. 

It‚Äôs great threw bone unemployed would nice bone thrown everyone else. I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôve really lost last lifeline objectivity. You‚Äôre caught mob reasoning think magically intuit people believe every opponent encounter made straw. 

The acceptance risk argument specious. contagious disease. protestors right assume risk behalf people pass virus, many die. 

The mitigation argument equally frivolous. simple fact is, protests spreading Covid. organizers South Carolina protests currently urging attendees get tested, infected. 

The back work protesters believe cause much BLM protestors believe theirs. position one rule another thee going fly. rules must apply everyone. Also, isn‚Äôt important whether convinced this. I‚Äôm sure understand that. doesn‚Äôt time turn everything around. can‚Äôt bring back 120,000+ dead. Neither bring back people died harmed malevolence, including innocent children ripped families border, victims vitriolic hatred minorities hands policies white supremacist sycophants, us harmed environmental deregulation (which GOP consistently endorsed) failure address climate change, paying lives funds rest lifetime. generation continue paying trillion dollar tax cut wealthiest long time coming. represent fraction he‚Äôs done.

Someone utterly incompetent, caused much damage country, cannot ‚Äúturn things around‚Äù. We‚Äôre fucked it‚Äôll take work generation undo this. Thank coming around; hope you‚Äôll consider trying help others sphere same. pains angry, frankly considering voters contributed to, would least could do. flew.

It may ""fair"" US disease needs managed entire country time, reality. states strictly limit domestic travel way that's comparable closing national border, may reasonable look response state instead aggregate, seems extremely unlikely personally states able maintain restrictions long countries able keep border restrictions.

The US case counts also almost certainly undercount, that's probably case elsewhere well. Comparing raw numbers (whether they're adjusted population size) countries somewhat questionable given differences reporting processes. trends numbers useful since showing relative rates change within country (and mentioned above, rate change also important metric predicting impacts).

I think right disease less deadly terms number positive tests end dead, part past several weeks new cases basically flat, testing increased. past weeks, people tested positive sick. 

However, % tests returning positive going Arizona (17%), Texas (9%) Florida (12%), indicating greater number people sick past weeks, even beyond increased testing. 

These numbers relatively manageable while, seem taking exponentially re-opening. Now, lot sick phase younger people going bars, they're spreading around well, places re-open, people going catch death numbers likely start flatten creep soon.

NY much better now. WA state generally well - problem WA state Yakima, 60% workers essential food workers covid spreading work sites.

The places got covid bad learned March okay. states thought NY problem learn problems now.

Ok great. avoided telling us truth could manipulate us. Great. else aren‚Äôt telling us?

Lol proudly say I'm among stupid half. wear mask every time go go much. groceries gonna daily article next days weeks, seems Western USA think San Francisco Los Angeles moderately long drive that's 600km. 

I made drive twice week months girlfriend weekends.

America really functional passenger rail system. think Europeans would take train 2 major cities far apart. China lockdowns, testing contact tracing starting January. Never claimed either. original poster asked difference is, explained it. want everyone following distancing guidelines, I'm going tell people watched man get murdered police wait year express outrage. fb friends posting pictures hanging people parties/bars, im thinking, man hope throwback photos... mask sight...

Masks importance really depend live. lot big cities, nearly nothing small pop towns Haha It‚Äôs end enhanced unemployment, end eviction repossession bans, end PPP SBA loans. Businesses states know coronavirus aid feds coming. open everything up. na√Øve? That's actually almost happens (usually). ever put phone fridge? actually like that, major brain fart super unfortunate super sad. (I know hard imagine anyone every brain farts bad, google people leave babies car. almost always ""I forgot there"" ""I thinking already dropped day care, spouse them"") 

But anyway, try challenge people say people lack empathy. want clear, way defending wearing mask, everyone wearing them. someone's reason wearing care people die lacking empathy. humans good realizing true risk something, particularly inconenience them. ever late work sped highway, maybe glanced phone see text says wille driving? Maybe ever ended bar gotten drunk? greatly increase chance causing accident (in case drunken example, maybe even car accident) potentially killed someone, say lack empathy things. 

Mask similar me. Say got store realized mask you. probably go in, lot normal people would. think lot people can't see impact. know anyone gotten really sick died, likely take seriously. lot people educated think masks effective, fault either imo. CDC started saying need wear one, people frequently believe first thing hear. maybe overly optimistic people think, think amount people going ""fuck people makes face itch"" actually quite small number. 

Again, wear fucking mask people, think right world needs understanding less us vs them. Probably crossover essential workers already exposed protesters, too.

NYC starting zero immunity anymore. would incredibly hard get peak 1st go around. low income neighborhoods apparently testing 50% serology studies.

Yes, major national retail employees treated like shit, that‚Äôs *most* employees treated small businesses. 

Inb4 someone coming saying ‚Äúmy business doesn‚Äôt that!‚Äù Yeah, get it, small businesses run employees mind, nothing small business makes inherently better regard - better oversight/accountability larger businesses definitely make average better.

Ya bout protests? world could collectively country country. kid?? Lmao, okay bro. know young af now. talking something clue about. Good day hahahahaha. would love to!

I've argued enough people common ground find. There‚Äôs one answer question. lot factors go it. 

- Hospitalizations/deaths lag new cases weeks month
- state little testing increased rapidly reported cases
- population testing positive may demographics lower hospitalization/death rates

That‚Äôs few. 
What really want pay attention percent positive total tests. early indicator increase increased hospitalizations etc. also shows increase due increased testing. time hospitalizations deaths start rising it‚Äôs already spreading fast easily contained testing contact tracing. non-American, I'm left speechless astounding levels stupidity. brain seriously longer handle it. Wow wow wow. Europe supressed nothing. still here. clusters co. must keep alert highs. Controlling pandemic extremely difficult. Making public health policies designed protect people political makes so. Add fact people refuses listen evidence-based research lower minimize transmission rates, well, get United States.

Friday, 410 total cases coronavirus ‚Äî 267 staff members 143 children ‚Äî reported 318 licensed child care operations across state, according Texas Health Human Services Commission. That‚Äôs sharp increase 339 cases agency reported Thursday 210 shared KVUE-TV Austin Monday.

In written statement Dallas Morning News, Primrose Rockwall said never stopped practicing emergency requirements eventually repealed June 12. requirements included pre-screening, limited entry temperature taking, among things.

On June 13, though, Primrose closed doors two weeks learning positive cases within school. Rockwall County Emergency Management revealed Friday seven people ‚Äî four children three adults school ‚Äî tested positive disease.

‚ÄúWe wish quick recovery look forward welcoming children families back school June 29,‚Äù statement read, adding Primrose stepped cleaning procedures response.

**No easy answers**

For months, childcare centers operated coronavirus cases, others voluntarily remained closed.

‚ÄúI think points many questions easy answers,‚Äù said Tori Mannes, president CEO ChildCareGroup, nonprofit operates eight centers, partners local school districts manages subsidy programs hundreds across state. ‚ÄúWe everything support sustain childcare providers, get side COVID-19, economy workforce going need childcare centers open operational.‚Äù

Mannes called childcare centers ‚Äúbackstop workforce.‚Äù said daycare workers heroes they‚Äôve gone work frontline workers could so, well.

The workers‚Äô safety requirements operating pandemic, however, expensive industry already operates razor thin budget, Mannes said.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre struggling keep doors open,‚Äù said.

In February, coronavirus hit North Texas, state‚Äôs 17,279 licensed registered child care centers homes caring estimated 1.1 million children, according Texas Health Human Services Commission. Friday, 12,196 facilities open.

Staying open deemed essential coronavirus. Texas Workforce Commission provided subsidies, drawing money programs essential workers low-income parents phased out. didn‚Äôt make facilities‚Äô revenue losses due plummeting enrollment.

**Onus parents**

On May 18, Gov. Greg Abbott allowed daycares open non-essential workers, well. Emergency requirements entry pre-screening put place, repealed June 12.

The lack requirements puts onus parents ensure kids going safe venue.

‚ÄúParents going look really closely ask good questions childcare centers policies are,‚Äù said Stephanie Rubin, CEO Texans Care Children Austin. ‚ÄúThey need understand state agency, THHSC, sending licensing reps monitor following rules right now.‚Äù

Though Cameron Tate came back negative COVID-19, mother said plans keep home least month ‚Äî possibly longer.

‚ÄúFor personally, would send back significant decrease cases,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúIn cases, daycares.‚Äù Narrative Logic anything China always got compared USA It'll takes weeks see death toll associated. Struggle? Bullshit. Local Mayors ordered quarantined houses fences erected around houses police site.

No struggle trouble people inside suddenly got Germany now, serious. So...the protests probably aren‚Äôt great idea health either? need USa think long term though...  Colleges schools won‚Äôt opening. fairy tale bullshit planning right now. soon next real wave begins, going home again. sane individual already knows this. someone says ‚Äúbut country XYZ school now‚Äù I‚Äôll remind country definitely taking seriously constantly fighting stupid shit like wearing masks. always thought hypothetically speaking, alien invasion outer space would last resort unify humanity work along together. think less saw video inside hospital italy larger effect opinions piece media. realistic test every American every day? mainland Europe borders closed Pls stop blabbering garbage, nobody wears masks except go doctor get hair cut case numbers going down. Also, stay US don‚Äòt want infected butt here. three positive cases resulted Dewey Beach rental unit

I assumed since many places closed Adults graduates paid rental food eating what-not. That's all.  Good you! wish could say same, anxiety wrecked habits, eat unhealthy food sleeping/eating/exercise routine gone drain I'm finding incredibly hard stick schedule. extra unemployment dries month what? government decided done covid everyone be. means lots people forced back work company cares much government does... Except exponential growth slowed missed undergrad graduation barely spent 5 minutes med graduation. 

Both times threw far personal proper properties class. Med get nice pics friends Dean robed up, parents might've actually killed that. people fucking lazy? takes like 5 seconds walk trash throw something away. There's trash bins place live Midwest. 

Stupid fat lazy self-centered assholes. Sounds like Florida. üáßüá∑ Yes. Also, it‚Äôs hard imagine baby able quarantine virus. Annnnnd lost argument, facts, nothing. Gg easy realy

 White privilege finest right here. God hate subreddit rushing vaccine I‚Äôm fucking taking it. don‚Äôt trust it. don‚Äôt trust government ever point. know comment gets tons dislikes don‚Äôt care. Hey man same. I've mostly treated positive experience even convinced go historic event gets little excited see what's come next. (Obviously situation shiet general ik fact would memorable me)
A lot good come far instead bad. AZ still ranks 40th testing. get test provided AZ, it‚Äôs 7 day turnaround. stated 1000 people waited 13 hours state testing site Saturday, arriving early. Many left long hours waiting line yet getting test due heat water drink. 

If go urgent care medical doctor insurance, pay out-of-pocket, it‚Äôs 3-5 day turnaround results. 

Where rapid tests spoken day? ""We definitely live caution several months. think mean say is, can't live without working lungs."" thing nobody relying ~~Chinese medical experts~~ reddit armchair epidemiologists. ~~This thing last way longer~~ actual public health experts split pandemic ends, depending large part delivery vaccine.

FTFY coronavirus cares whether hold events indoors outdoors. ‚ÄúWith 61 people simultaneously hospitalized Friday, county reached new peak pandemic. Seventeen people taken county get bed.‚Äù

Yikes, seems like lot places really starting spiral week. Different parts brain control different systems body. frontal lobes people likely hit themselves, using stereotypical barrel temple shot. That's higher thinking area. Problem solving, voluntary motor control, etc. part controls breathing, heart beat, rest stuff keeps alive brain stem, skull connects spinal column. there's whole testing fiasco happened Advent Health tens thousands tests invalidated.

Source: AH nurse. Dimitrov hometown Haskovo met hundreds fans hugged lot them. Including whole lot children. ""We definitely live caution several months.i think mean say is, can't live without working lungs."" google earthed Yuma. wall? looks like there's huge swaths open road north south. happens lot. watch learn handle outbreak. Agreed, glad Italy recovering initial outbreak wish guys best! government making tests sick people country, mostly worst cases dying people, people mild symptoms asymptomatics get tested, live put places free still there's lot people refuse go get tested even symptoms. yeah, Mexico's gonna bunch deaths much less new cases enough people getting tested... health system saturated fucking time population can't afford private clinics we're fucked.

And people stupid, going outside like nothing's happening actually believe there's pandemic, think government scheme IDK they're stupid, saying things like ""have known someone covid?"". favourite people believes government pays say covid. IDK like countries, oh man fucked. Perfect, means protest happened earlier March perfectly fine well. Good know. surprised see unBARlievable here. owner place piece shit said comment, mutating weaker strain, means people going believe already over, means lower guard.

If, reason, virus mutates heavier strain, we're screwed. Deny every protester critical care contract Covid-19. Save ICI beds ventilators sane Word mouth. seen yet. heard people recently. Yes existence pandemic political debate rather fact can't really expect go anywhere. Schools funded property taxes wealthy areas significantly resources disposal students. path graduation everyone. part people talk say ‚ÄúSystemic racism‚Äù, BLM protesting, it‚Äôs relevant topic hand. relationship taken beating past months me, girlfriend, two families disagreements amongst one another what‚Äôs safe what‚Äôs ok what. We‚Äôve gotten far it‚Äôs unnecessary undeserved damage us. think one statement [citation needed] written it. trump Tulsa speech yesterday. alot black lives matter rallies. alot I've seen wont wear Sames goes wresling, COVID messing also, dispite attempts wresling go on. Probably minorities like ""fuck that"" wanted save masks healthcare workers. manipulated public Take petty bullshit? mean handling Covid successfully like every country except maybe Brazil Mexico done? Yes, America free Korea, Japan, France, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Singapore, etc. countries cut reasonable number cases minimal daily deaths. USA - we're showing shithole countries handle it. I‚Äôve tried shelter place, people around insist around people. high risk dying get thing. Everyone knows this...yet still insist around people important. actually kind find funny people care informed ones insist things people. 

My death gonna biggest told lives everyone around me. 

I find baffling, really. It‚Äôs like hospitals keep lot extra ICU beds sitting empty waiting patients. People still get sick things. almost quarter ICU beds full people wouldn‚Äôt ordinarily strain system. quickly virus spreads, percentage rocket quickly next weeks. Stay home, quit job, excuse silly. Typical redditor excuse downplay part problem shunning others. Stupid No, I'm saying people skilled teaching kids. school helps enable parents work side benefit. source income referring to? Except exactly stats increase deaths go up... How? Deaths still lowest they‚Äôve ever bee. hospitalizations gone anywhere. None attributed Covid anyway. lot places allowing elective surgeries now. think 28th person diagnosed covid South Korea started outbreak. takes one person ignorant several people die Actually Gen Z's parents Gen X.

Boomers getting already retired getting close it. someone retail, money losing business. I'm WA state happen also reservation land, situation little unique. company requires employee's wear masks, we've several instances stores requiring masks customers gets heated arguments given what's going country, company want employee get injured requiring masks. I'm saying way be, I'd love everyone wear mask. people going unless getting ticket something. insidious, hurt getting disease, others hurt much barely hurt spread it, others fault own, spread unknowingly hurting others.  Deaths exceed 100,000 July number infected cases rising. Mexican President running, actually liked him, seemed like would good country, liked platform. seems like dissapointment, since taken office. they? We‚Äôve many breaches personal information misuse governments corporations. Don‚Äôt blame them. I‚Äôm Colorado new kind groove going on. good see businesses adhering protocols. expanded outdoor dining streets make room. face masks worn anyone moving space servers wear time. cautiously getting back life go place isn‚Äôt safe right now. People need support responsible businesses. business isn‚Äôt safe, don‚Äôt go. think time money speak expect. don‚Äôt need go bar. Leadership focus places like grocery stores pharmacies everyone deserves safe necessity. uncontained alcohol fire. Wired article: meat processing plants unique characteristics trickier modify, like cold temperatures aggressive ventilation systems required prevent meat spoiling getting contaminated pathogens cause foodborne illness. features could also contributing high rates infection among slaughterhouse workers, says Sima Asadi, chemical engineer UC Davis. ‚ÄúLow temperatures allow virus stay viable outside body longer, increasing survival virus air,‚Äù says. ‚ÄúThat really increases risk infection plants.‚Äù explain could end good bad news? face, sounds like good thing? live close stopped going Lompoc cases I‚Äôve hearing about. heard closed longer counting prison cases county, maybe shouldn‚Äôt taken count didn‚Äôt even think prison staff spreading locally forget mention 196 254 partially dry. (That's nearly 80 percent)

But please continue acting like know state me. Bye spammer group geniuses defending? ones fine kids dying totally preventable diseases ones think 5G causing virus fluoride water making everybody gay? gaffe definitely made people question masks, distrust CDC. personally think bigger issue mask wearing become political statement US. Many right wingers willing die no-mask hill.

This problem american politics. left right grabs hold adopts something own, large chunk side instantly rebels, even it‚Äôs totally nonsensical. wearing masks (idiotically) became ‚Äúleftist‚Äù, compliance rate capped around 60%. shouldn‚Äôt surprised public health taking backseat politics. Misleading post title article title article said. okay. Got source this. trying google cant find identifying different strain. ‚Äúhotties‚Äù probably underaged possibly barely legal... talked two people past week think real all. Others I've explain aerosol mask works people. others listen number news channels saying conflicting contradictory information time time, ways seem difficult understand anyway. news told exact things many times many different ways believe something changed better. scary itself! Thats sad. Coronazona talking Mexico US that‚Äôs exactly what‚Äôs happening Thousands ailing elderly people literally cannot ever left alone.

Yes, can. Leave let die home. Sending hell nursing homes make lives better.  Longer better poorly cared for. really hope kids let die home longer take care myself.

Again perception society wont happen dont care. Untill get regret it.

I watched trump thing Tulsa people wearing masks wearing maga hats. like blind leading blind read room mate calls nearby restaurant put reservation group 7 kids.  go snap map, click major city see uploads bars, clubs... first instance history people want sacrifice well younger mostly end lives Dude live fucking bubble frankly sound like part problem. moral panic excellent journalists, clueless teenagers, unliked coworkers everyone enemy subject self righteous mob justice, everyone pretends never heard Salem witch trials French Revolution see problem gangs destroying people‚Äôs lives based rumor. also seeing absolutely everything racialized blamed white people condescending language possible. Yet clueless masses people drifting right don‚Äôt realize trump losing support base increasingly think he‚Äôs clueless incompetent, became gender studies majors. people think it‚Äôs bad now, wait. media narrative still wypipo bad August half country literally starving, you‚Äôre gonna see racial strife like never imagined possible. people seem think fooling legal system fooling virus. Cali WAY behind testing. new cases closely tracks testing. big state, better ook county level see problem b/c state level great bad either. yet least. live Brazil and, yeah, sounds FAMILIAR. forget novel virus, time much correct tactic based Intel virus capabilities. slow act though. Hmm interesting still wrong. we‚Äôre talking article, whatever you‚Äôre talking about. 

they asked cases pretty much said yeah, actually read article she‚Äôs talking cases made hospital would severe cases. 100% correct. Love Cuomo hate Florida. It‚Äôs obviously blindly loyal liberal sub. don‚Äôt get it. Haha guess test three times week every shift. wearing mask. Ya, game works different angles:

Am nervous may contagious may infect someone?

Am nervous they're contagious may infect me?

To end, comfortable parties, recommend finding small scale gatherings. going last many months, years. Everyone find way tend mental health keeping social circles safe Hey, thanks timely warning, WHO. study control monkeys got pneumonia. Judging post history, I‚Äôm least bit surprised ignorant, xenophobic response, lol. Imagine disappointed OPs post? 

You‚Äôre problem. Aluminumhydroxyphosphate sulfate 

For every nanogram take take 3 open economy = go work, even unsafe family, lose unemployment. 

Or, open small business back qualify aid anymore we've decided fine, disaster over.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I've traveling city city to
partake BLM protests. majority people wearing masks hand santizer everywhere. friend traveled bounced out, waited week negative virus. thing worries free waters orgs hand many shared bucket. Honestly, much different bunch majority white unmasked kids piggy backing movement that's meant make actual change. That‚Äôs exactly trumps rally allowed. Peacefully assemble . get virus doesn‚Äôt care, isn‚Äôt point. point kids went messed hey could used reason assemble. Protesting lock protesters able protest lock weeks ago. don‚Äôt advocate gathering frivolous reasons using serious cause regarding murder cops messed up. Nice single digits 10 days, bound happen soonish Absolutely Deaths take report officially (that's normal, even pre-COVID days). Since like person died anyway, there's particular urgency come office process death certificates Sunday. realize NY numbers going way FL's spiking, right? Ain't nothing nowhere over. 

Model success?? Pffft... lower Mondays due hospitals recording deaths weekends certainly cause optimism considering almost one least area seems even care anymore. Shitty people, great health insurance stockholders. Yes, assume treatment improvements much larger impact deaths lingering health conditions. Preventing death inability breathe maintaining blood oxygen levels preventing lung damage causes inability breathe different things point time. 

Yes opinion conjecture based knowledge far point might able treat disease way prevents damage first place. Got link canadian oxford investment? awaits many unfortunate folks infections, chronic disease, death.

But least Karen Chad got stupid haircuts. Permanent cognitive, lung, heart and/or kidney damage many patients. (The internal scarring shows medical scans).  Usually younger people, older patients die outright, good news. soon see coronavirus free Italy design citing specific example rather nebulous blanket term means nothing? Get here. Please. Interestingly occasional stories virus suddenly becoming less dangerous given credence science-based bus. Churches host political rallies? starting change. mandate came city (and county) masks public difference incredible weekend. One grocery store went 100% masked 2 people without masks (this specific store usually like 70/30 mask/no mask prior). 

So next couple weeks gonna rough, things might look better month people continue adhere mandate. definitely encouraging anything. 

Problem still going bars restaurants mask-friendly business models see continues play out. Mods still pretty awful. Automod insanely censoring recently got 3 day ban ‚Äúmaking purely political comments violation subs rules‚Äù. Took 2 messages get explanation, 0 examples even pointed political comments place given time, line drawn? response lol 

Astroturfing gone tho part community good. hope didnt get off-brand. want certain getting performance advertised. North Safety, 3M, well-known brand, please spend extra $ so. yeah, things great, right? breath, they're easy maintain work. Age health give advantage virus little something everyone. older folks, death. young, sudden stroke, ""recovery"" lasting months months kinds bizarre symptoms. words, there's nothing special 25-34 healthy. shit still fuck good. theory yes, practice sometimes still see people without them, covering nose, wearing chin (At point, even bother?). VA PPE see patients current wave. VA refused see vets person months. cant even get cavity filled. letting vets big time. Yep, polarize, exaggerate, make false dichotomy public health economy That‚Äôs opportunity cost. country wasn‚Äôt really ‚Äúlocked down‚Äù families going Lowe‚Äôs, restrictions air travel travel states national plan testing tracing go it. Trump telling people wear masks daily.

Again, said wants stop testing.

This true it‚Äôs something world leaders dealing really. increase testing get better numbers time take optics hit. Trump open Trump tweeted backs Michigan protesters

He supported sending people back work yes, isn‚Äôt mutually exclusive reopening slowly. Specifically, supported deal made governor protestors reopen Trump literally suggested inject disinfectant sunlight bodies. messaging creates confusion puts people danger.

No didn‚Äôt. tired seeing context BS. Nope, everyone. Yep, anecdotal. want one anecdotes? want spread someone care ends one anecdotes? What‚Äôs funny is, made statement praised cuomo would probably get upvoted even though numbers 10x worse. It‚Äôs really shocking me. People want badly hate Florida, done great job, ESPECIALLY comparison NY cuomo absolute moron. I‚Äôm surprised state Iowa hasn‚Äôt seen dramatic increase yet. friends keep posting videos bars Des Moines **no** social distancing, **no** masks, they‚Äôre sitting bar, isn‚Äôt technically allowed. guy posted video drag show, everyone huddled around, 2019 one even heard coronavirus before. Yet see headlines like this. Take look Mississippi‚Äôs numbers. ([MSDH [MSDH CVD19 page internet started see big rise cases sudden longer getting county reporting case numbers several days, somehow provide hospitalization charts. It‚Äôs shady hell. county flying completely blind right local paper posting reopen flu bro propaganda showing cases numbers local business closings. find numbers MSDH site rely Facebook gossip find businesses closed due staff outbreaks. Ok Google said trusted trump administration fully? take see legitimate. Anything china though, bull crap. would like tell CCP world enough. Seriosly speaking enough enough 100000 people dead 5 months... Could hundred thousand Christmas... reports people surviving disease lingering complications months ""recovered"" certainly seemed worth concern. counted death total... crippling medical bills...

and look Sweden see get pretty bad let go unchecked keep people coming gets bad... businesses fail anyway. see survival to. look back Spanish flu people prepared most, took precautions came farthest head economically settled. 

we could avoided pain people could counted asked fellow man. "" Join die "" used patriotic saying... Trashbags. Wait, Canada buy oxford? heard interested China vaccine. Got link? wanna actually see health department guidelines this. Read person‚Äôs post history take couple minutes think truly miserable would them. second wave coming. There‚Äôs joke among real economists (Larry kudlow economist, played one tv). joke is:

Larry kudlow always wrong. Well, least busy coughing...sorry say Desantis lies lies, good job opinion. likes alternate facts...not sure moves he's made protect nursing homes, still enough tests residents nursing home employees. 

He's interested protecting anything, relationship big, orange baby. give shit anyone besides himself. Sweden could afford proper response pandemic. 

It's much obvious now. 

Wonder Sweden could match neighbours? might well strip FREEDOMS! /s stay away grandma? Deep breath deep breath, hold 10 seconds, expel rapidly cough. Repeat multiple times. Also lying stomach utilize back lungs. amount videos seen people freaking screaming stores refuse let without mask damn high. Bulgaria certain countries EU also problem.

Wearing masks apperantly counterintuitive large amount population. 68-year old client COPD 55% lung capacity. gets, basically automatic death-sentence. Definitely wrong infrastructure handle otherwise (because invest police), kinda fucked either way. dead yet retire. really script, too.

""Are supposed spend rest lives isolation?"" remains dumbest response mild suggestion extend lockdowns little longer everyone better prepared. droplets air, stagnant air air moved low power air conditioners easily move droplets waiting nose mouth, course.

This people worried restaurants, office spaces, subways, closed air environment massive amounts people gather. 

Also reason people trying hold everything possible outside summer - proper airflow ventilation drastically reduce transmission. Well guess live different state here. always roll dice leaving house. hope expect live house forever never going away. nations require mandatory 14 day quarantine single room incoming travellers, allow all. 

The US one cv19 hotspots world.  Good luck getting tourist visa approved anywhere next 6 months.  Y‚Äôall need start taking seriously home want travel elsewhere working vaccine created. careful... can‚Äôt support say positive things Florida DeSantis sub. downvote you.  ##r/sinus

Since outbreak December 2019 Wuhan, China [1], novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, created dramatic global health economic crisis. COVID-19 disease caused SARS-CoV-2. cases, COVID-19 associated mild respiratory symptoms. However, ~15% patients, hospitalization required, 5% patients develop severe lung injury result acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS may accompanied sepsis septic shock, multiorgan failure, including acute kidney injury cardiac injury. Older age, obesity, pulmonary comorbidities risk factors higher mortality [2, 3]. also reported extent inflammation‚Äîmirrored peripheral blood cytokine levels‚Äîis associated worse outcome [4].

Recessions typically minimal impact home pricez

The Great Recession exception Public transport yeah since june. bell help tolls Sweden. course one concerns worry know...yet. 
 
So much reporting focus count deaths, seem whole lot attention placed 9x.xx% people survive...but perhaps 100% infected.  
 
There recent report meat packing plant tested huge number workers end testing positive nearly *asymptomatic*. develop mild symptoms - symptoms all. tested, might even realize virus begin with. 
 
And yet...what three months road? Six months? year? suddenly develop breathing problems later year? Perhaps stamina problem weakness can't otherwise explain. heart issues. memory problems. knows?  
 
And given enough time understand medium-term long-term effects, worries me. people saying ""we get develop herd immunity"", get done. Like getting cold. simple? long-term effects this? Wishing ""rip band-aid let everyone get infected get with"" starts sound incredibly reckless naive. think small America never really bothered flatten curve unnecessary dead don‚Äôt matter ten thousand. 

Wild trump announced slowed testing keep numbers looking better. genuine crime humanity limitless potential bring unnecessary death world years come. One man making decisions cost humanity much. H1N1 pandemic 2009, evidence came light exaggerated danger spread fear confusion rather helpful information. later learned *‚ÄúItaly, Germany, France U.K.* [*made secret *with pharmaceutical companies‚Äù* *‚Äúobliged countries buy vaccinations raised pandemic level 6.‚Äù*

The proceeded change guidelines defining pandemic order accommodate contracts, thereby increasing public‚Äôs fear despite fact pandemic never became serious threat.

 $84 million investment, Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche largest single contributor WHO‚Äôs coffers year. Luckily, turned out, could afford sales unnecessary Tamiflu H1N1 medication¬†[rocketed ¬£3 WHO‚Äôs declared H1N1 pandemic. 

Which coincidence. Pretty sure case herd immunity means die it, do. better immune not. Well, children mostly safe. thing could possibly go wrong children families.  Man wtf talking about? Sweden literally nearly 50% deaths per capita. course not, first wave bad ones left antibodies. Masks mandatory cities/counties

The cities/counties can't enforce it. someone refuse wear mask without consequences, they're mandatory. Testing massively increased less 10% infection rate opening up. Barely state one surprised increases never contained quarantine nothing enforced. Read article. Bad cases die. Moderate even mild cases may left significant long term issues. still completely understand mechanisms. Scar tissue sounds like 'healing second intention'.  things done resolve scarring. lot control inflammatory processes, e.g. cytokine storm. lot damage blood vessel endothelium (the inner layer blood vessels). much still completely understand. Wear mask, wash hands, Social distancing. Vitamin (and K), Vit C, Zinc, garlic. There's doubtless lots doing. ""Increased testing!""

Percent positive also increasing. 

""..."" fact one mass gathering allowed really good, say least. state sponsored ideology, exempt rules promote certain political ideology. promoting it, rules apply again. I'm expert, I'm pretty sure illegal state formally endorse political ideology. Basing average timeline absolutely meaningless ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù dumb idea start.  extremely light. make public facemasks mandatory? Management know manage remote workers feels comfortable able see working. I'm Chicago lot us getting sent back offices reason this. Well, cost money fly even fly... So...

I know people celebrating reopen health care working colleagues entered period depression anxiety it. currently feels pretty safe here, me. current infection rate longer feels like everyone could virus. I‚Äôm super freaked idea someone wearing mask sometimes like situation mentioned. also assume workers places probably aren‚Äôt wearing masks 100% time it‚Äôs difficult so. 

I‚Äôm you. It‚Äôd great it‚Äôs us, I‚Äôm sure either. spike again, hopefully least won‚Äôt level was. 

I think fact we‚Äôre still largely wearing masks keep helping numbers. 

That‚Äôs opening gyms restaurants worried hope keep closed/restricted longest. Pulling PPE production thin air possible. Germany bought seems improvised FFP2. substandard, never used it.
Currently got good domestic masks FFP2 3 hospital. used masks TR. back pre-crisis standards.

Ppl outside healthcare use cloth masks imports China. Almost every pharmacy sells FFP2 KN95 China. need random sampling based statistics. want find exactly many people use make decisions, would great, don‚Äôt need test everybody order make really good estimate. attempt don‚Äôt actually want know many people it, want able say they‚Äôve tests anyone political talking point. Well, tied speech ok. 60% nursing home deaths Sweden, 70% Norway, Norway far fewer deaths overall. Simple math tells bullshit. Herd immunity starts take place 60% population antibodies. 

The virus .5% death rate overall. 

60% 332,000,000 people 199,200,000 people. .5% number 9,960,000 deaths. 

Quit spouting bullshit. well home school movement recent years sad hear that, hope lived good life knowledge love give remain.

According worldmeters, Chile 5th infected country per capita, beat Bahrain, rest mostly microstates. Qatar 1st.

I've observing since January observed society I've kind mentally prepared this.

I'm pessimistic learning anything this, culture. stay home. difficult couch potato marching steadily upward sinc first week June... think dope. love masks, like small cosplay everyday! bought themed ones. problem can't really put everyone perfect bubble. They're going quarantine housekeeping staff, kitchen, maintenance workers? deliveries? support staff's families? move US work reading people understand severity situation gives hope. definitely think lack strong federal plan, enforced guidelines play here. I'm struggling understand country opening up. Perhaps feel restless since rest world opening up. serious strict measures could similar place, instead seeing unprecedented rise. Next unprecedented deaths. people refuse wear masks freedom. Well freedom stay alive? exploit it. lied gathering BLM protest party beach instead. exploitation? Right peacefully assemble known mean protesting it‚Äôs obviously means that. looks like babysit United States America president crystal clear intention decrease testing show less cases. Im sure thats well underway.

I hope people smart enough stick best preventative practices despite questionable authenticity numbers reality kids, parents hoards acting same. Can't second wave say yolo catch first one Every sub echo chamber whatever agenda pushing. Large employers antibody testing blitzes everyone brought one big room wait blood draw. That‚Äôs great way help virus spread. They're going report number higher 3 day average tomorrow know met (and hugged) hundreds fans visits, many kids among too. get applaud tremendous achievement. biggest water drink ever, like, probably, nobody's ever done before, except, know, maybe I've said that, somebody go try greater water drink, same, really, it'll shame. Nailed researcher actually seems partially disagree assessment - although entirely clear article. Here's confusing quote researcher claiming mutation like aggressive tiger March April, like wild cat. Even elderly patients, aged 80 90, sitting bed, breathing without help. patients would died two three days ""I think virus mutated immune system reacts virus, lower viral load due lockdown, mask-wearing, social distancing. still demonstrate different now.

Which peculiar, understand it. seems claiming factors mentioned commenter real, may causing virus mutate. explanation might occurring provided. Restricting movement mostly. need reason go outside gradually depending severity tighten it. arbitrary go Rosenheim Kitzb√ºhel (well go now, situation couple weeks back).

And prevent people fleeing vacation could also lot, like requiring reason travel shutting hotels.

I see reason approach similar germany couldn‚Äôt worked US aside politically desirable Archive link: http://archive.vn/0nL9h  lol telling immediately downvoted yet one challenged claim Yeah I‚Äôm telling people I‚Äôve seen hospital. I‚Äôm worried personally still think people cautious. think lot vulnerable populations already hit lot getting infected people stronger immune systems. long death rate stays low feel pretty comfortable going public. weeks ago, people Reddit predicting outcome constantly voted supposed do? Stay home? OK doom*r.

Unfortunately, people fathom staying home weeks saw actual decline Florida, we're today.

At start what's supposed extremely active hurricane season. but, increase cases due increased testing! /s \*Inserts picture guy pointing head\*

The US suffer second wave let first wave linger. I‚Äôm willing bet house never shut again. matter happens. Sad.  he's said times past months. surprising one?  happy people fine stay happy Everyone called Michigan's govenor Hitler Nazi freedom destroyer look us now, we're one 2 states Green. great job lot people admit it. I'm assuming it'll go shitter soon people barely wearing masks social distancing. I've covered multiple big city protests least 70% masks remove that's rough guess 70 generally see people without except cops supervising. They're standing protests many spread out. 6ft per like boardwalk march pics. think worse spaced bit, natural even otuside pandemic, 90% bunched nice maskless group upon request. I've thinking - problem coronavirus scary enough.

If something fearsome reputation like Ebola, Americans would panicking. coronavirus frighten people. sounds bland, like flu. Hence people taking seriously. disposable people.   kudlow along Jim Cramer told investors bargain Enron stock buy crashing nothing too. Thats need know opinion anything said explicitly article, perhaps obvious people living Sweden, ""prioritising regions municipalities"" practice translates ""prioritising hospitals nursing homes"" two handled different levels local government, that's nurse says ""the municipalities given priority, suppliers authorities, already started talking protecting elderly"" end article. smell like rainbow sherbet, would taste it? Wait, Spanish Monday thing? Dimitrov, one trainers, another tenis player, Djocovic's trainer positive tests. Idk tell you. That‚Äôs docs keep saying. Texas reopened gradually like many states. Cases start leveling weeks certain amount become infected. I‚Äôm anxious person I‚Äôm definitely living fear. Basically US exists. One quarter thinks whole coronavirus conspiracy Trump, another quarter refuses wear masks they're 'sheep' government control them. half stuck infected bunch morons. will, thanks. really third bullet point all, know parachute slows enough safe, idea amount cloth mask inhibits even relevant all. Nobody would wear parachutes slowed 10 kmph leading slightly chunkier splat. I'm saying fully supported science.

And thanks proving little knowledge really extends, see evolution quite easily labs lol. Literally antibiotic resistance, example. true, deaths reported first week June would reflect infections happened way back around end April, Florida cases. think likely part classic excess deaths conundrum see places. died COVID, many (most?) even infected. Pneumonia common older people. know cases. They're different category. prevented Covid .08 chance death. 1000 asymptomatic young people getting tested abundance caution, nothing see folks!!!!!!!! Almost certainly üòÇ need single-payer healthcare release energy American entrepreneurship rebuild small business base powers economy.

We need free tuition otherwise single payer create demand healthcare without enough healthcare professionals serve. Yeah, still uncertain, looks 5 10 times lethal flu far. Sigh. take day updated last day still different fohm.

For instance, show 107 deaths june 17th, last time Sweden 100 deaths april. think good portion got banned suspended!  teach critical thinking school. teach indoctrination.

We news. news commentary.

The Pentagon co-writing propaganda films advertising language regulated therefore meaningless.

These chickens coming home roost. Thank goodness neither major candidate left race supports medicare all. Murica! pretty big deal. know everyone loves dog Florida governor they‚Äôve done good job explaining making decision are. also first movers recognizing dangers nursing homes taking steps protect them. Gender equality would effect literally every Canadian. census Means government makes data based decision done. good gdp means job (well... maybe you...), way 1% Canadians smoke weed, independent senate would effect literally every Canadian.

Why alt right bros small brained? like thinking creatively. would way hot think need get creative solutions. Pavilions maybe fans? Idk. problem, always, money. Srysly fuck anyhing I‚Äôm trying get traction twitter page I‚Äôve started that‚Äôs supposed educate consumers plastic waste. 

I figure spend days gathering many masks gloves ground can, send emails newsrooms city telling I‚Äôve picked ‚Äúx amount‚Äù masks laid home way would make good b-roll footage news segment nuissance corona virus plastic waste. maybe could get promote twitter page. leaders news sources constantly reaffirming people bullshit beliefs, inevitable. Hearsay spread confirm whatever people want believe. people choose ignore anything counters arguments. 

There even governor threatened withhold coronavirus aid counties require masks. 

 people care, people wont... Corona isnt going anywhere doubt even Newyork death levels would wake people fuck up.

In short, screwed. don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really unpopular all, it? influx nowhere subsequent disappearing didn‚Äôt exactly seem organic IMO. remember Reddit Astro-turfing ‚Äúreopen state‚Äù protests...they exposed one pretty quickly yeah, behavior ones similar angry ones saw foaming mouth reopen protests. World Health Organisation (WHO) financed combination assessed voluntary contributions. 

About 80% WHO‚Äôs finances¬†[come voluntary recent 2017¬†[voluntary contribution shows $2.1 billion received private foundations global corporations.

This compared $1 billion voluntarily provided governments.

Contributors included GlaxoSmithKline, Bayer AG, Sanofi, Merck Gilead Sciences. 

So, yeah - pharma pay *all* wages. it. Work retail Tri-Necks. Yeah, seen fights break customers masks distance. Freaking ridiculous. supposed adults act like toddlers. memorial day, since june 1st oklahoma pretty much open like normal, would account that. 

bars full, churches way back, people eating restaurants.

a majority new cases 18-45 range not. Everyone needs get first wave. like forrest fires. Every city obtained least 1% population confirmed positive tinder box sparks coming everywhere. positive cases fall dramatically even reopening. See northeast mid atlantic states. understand systematic racism? Im minority whos protesting years. Comb history find out. Im here. baseball design made social distance outdoor setting, problem it? Obviously, sports like football involve extremely close contact, closest contact baseball someone base near someone watching base (even still distance away) maybe catcher near batter. it‚Äôs professional sports, that‚Äôs job. could prevent spread requiring players stay home much possible putting masks public places contract. 
They don‚Äôt need fans, don‚Äôt really need dugout could spread it‚Äôs time bat. feel professional sports could go on, it‚Äôs stuff like baseball golf. NYTimes article couple months ago illustrating much different challenge COVID rural hospitals versus urban counterparts. 
  
 
Unfortunately, think disease's impact rural communities go tend go under-recognized leading lot complacency. virus care attending BLM rally, Trump rally Biden rally. BLM rally allowed pandemic, rallies must allowed fairness too. can't pick choose. Shelby County. request coming one Commisioners. actually agree way happen. Despite primarily Dem huge pushback wearing masks idea mask mandate. County Health Department done good job briefings presenting statistics however large contingent Trumpies rednecks yammering "" guided fear"" everybody sheep muh constioooooootional right FB places. Plus Commissioner request bit divisive figure well white folks. find particularly problematic lot sticky local politics attached make request DOA. agree numbers suck happen. Monday usually low day, tuesday peak weekend stats coming then. said that, also case Mondays, still win. drs appointments require mask Florida doesn‚Äôt suprise me. every 10 customers see I‚Äôd lucky saw 2 people wear them, hand employees wear part good Novak‚Äôs tennis future test positive. many reports long term lung damage coronavirus survivors. sad. Swedes seem like way. I'd yank forever. ""Thats adorable"" - 2024 Lmao I'm commercial banker. Dude there‚Äôs many conflicting reports. Hopefully weakening though. touting fact average age positive cases lower, expect lower death rate.

That would true, good, though:

1. side effects deaths.
2. Increased infection community makes harder higher-vulnerability people things like go get groceries without exposing risk. 'its masks' comments. Nobody wears mask netherlands, nobody.

The virus run course here, like countries EU. going Corona + stuff, turns Corona + stuff. black? blue? gay? considered ‚ÄúALL‚Äù? I‚Äôve repeatedly told lives matter? I‚Äôm confused. found 1300 new cases meatplant weekend. Thats R going up. communicated RKI. bet article, every german article abt R uptick. get wall built around White House, claim victory that. First link leads [this Nypost equivalent linking Fox News. owned Murdoch. earth figure math.

~0.01% death rate across average population, meaning risk people included. 18 healthy rate low cant calculated statistically meaningful way. (Less 0.0001% ).


What means. average, 10000 kids INFECTED, one would die. Millenials right 26-40. That's correct. everyone actually still small minority people. article anecdotes twitter. contained concrete stats scientific case studies. better farking zombies next time: Easier spot, harder deny. Trump right. number cases trending can‚Äôt get access tests. think onto something. Speaking costly lessons... many Trillions lockdowns going cost??? We're still racking unknown. However, cheaper planned everyone wear proper masks outset know wear them? Maybe billions... planners really thinking? Eh. need mass die anyone preserve social security combat automation job market. win-win! Please read works. call Exposure Notification there's contacting, tracing, tracking taking place. need understand stuff much arsenal fight virus!

Explanation coming... Yup. honestly think good amount frontline healthcare workers going PTSD this, especially ones working COVID units. they're beyond point told ""be smart,"" -- mean, stupidity (at levels) caused happen. would assume reverse exponential growth? keep trying tell people we're middle information war. I‚Äôd give least another week two counting chickens. Got reading process previous vaccines? live Knoxville. There's way hell people go back things shut down. could lines leading hospitals, mass graves dug along Tennessee River, etc., people still prefer ability go sit eat wear masks. It‚Äôs almost lockdown worked. Who‚Äôd thought it?! Supposedly contagious prior symptoms showing immediately become contagious body needs start replicating virus first. I'm sure quickly would happen somewhere hours days guess. going everyone one going immediately contagious. yeah, updated yet... I've heard, Sunday Monday low reporting day Florida. We'll see least keep 3000 rest week. ?????

What fuck implying? Please, enlighten us think highly unlikely. many people would faking data death certificates (regular doctors hospital data administrators). anyway, case totals took last week 10 days. even seeing huge death spike yet. decision between:

Leaving bunch people dead extremely chronically I'll creating policy solutions address needs society economy.

We chose reopen donor class demanded it, necessary economy. Ah yeah heard help prevent large storms forming alittle make sunsets prettier too. getting reinfected? mean? Yes insane it? US school system needs much improvement, cutting budgets right scary fact Who‚Äôs florida Yep, that's budget passed. city gave businesses property owners **MASSIVE** multi-year long tax breaks incentives, meaning getting money that. cases upwards 30 years worth tax breaks, IIRC. Basically house cards Covid-19 simply gentle breeze knocked down, required business kept booming.

And we've fostered society strongly believes trickle way go, instead attempting rescind tax breaks giant companies businesses could afford pay taxes, going citizens take burden. 

The rich get richer middle lower class gets absolutely crushed additional burdens already can't afford. read comment?

Or respond one again?

There blanket bending normal legal standards allow businesses failed take reasonable precautions avoid lawsuits. Reasonable care ALWAYS standard, whether pandemic, burning houses faulty wiring (see PG&amp;E right now), preventing train derailments.

You phrase individual asking special dispensation, exactly opposite. airline almost certainly going forgiven negligence, contradiction normal legal standards. That's rich coming Tedros. Nothing enforced Florida either. first week reopening one restaurant got shut crowded it‚Äôs huge free all. couple days restaurant got shut sister call restaurant working heard managers arguing fitting people in. ended letting allowed capacity. sister said lady phone line called said ‚Äúokay‚Äù nothing ever came it. similar post subbreddit discussed brain impairment cased COVID. stuff way scarier permanent lung damage. [Here's Last time checked, even 30-year-olds Millennials. wider definition used Strauss &amp; Howe, age range 2020 would 16 38 (born 1982--2004). wrong. 12-18 month timeline gets quoted basically means follow every step process test safety efficacy unexpected surprises take 12-18 months. takes years find unexpected issues go back drawing board. yet deaths Covid down, that's amazing!! serious? High school graduation huge milestone teens likely biggest achievement time lives. Dayde Increased testing consideration. testing 20 30% cases 200 300%. spiking states positivity rate much higher before. rest agree degree Tourists brought them, migrant workers, and, and, and.... I'm sure they'll think something else blame on.  fair, stopping travel shutting us-Canada border pretty unprecedented actions. Even building pandemic hard argue simply shutting everything *clearly* correct decision make.

That border prided longest land border entire world generally good relationships two countries maintaining - bigger deal think shut it, especially current admin south. numbers wouldn‚Äôt nearly high everyone simply wore mask. That‚Äôs point. never said factors obsolete.. must fluke accepted wisdom comes waves come from? Nursing homes well, especially it‚Äôs basically left laps figure out. area state government seems largely washing hands problem, going far tell facilities open visitation etc putting almost precautions place general public. 

I‚Äôve business twenty years I‚Äôve never seen many frustrated tears outbursts past month. Everyone knows we‚Äôre fighting losing battle instead support get threats massive fines action state. It‚Äôs going rough. unpopular answer astro turfing.

A bunch astro turf accounts popped reopen campaign funded billionaires millionaires.

Now users job muddying waters, confusing discourse, increasing skepticism states reopened. job complete.

Like coup accounts spin every time US government decides overthrow another country, start seeing bunch new accounts talk one thing, using script, disappear succeed campaign declines.

And Monsanto thing, astro turf accounts insufferable. USA USA USA Yes, nightmare caused criminally understaffed work place. medical training occasional first aid class yet watching two dozen dementia alzheimers patients. really depends media look at. ton good info there, newspapers TV. not. need understand U.S.A. government little better. governors state hold lot power. get clue! they‚Äôre high population area they‚Äôre following out-of-town resumes clearly steering ship wrong. military started helping months ago, building field hospital etc. (which used due hospitals managing without it). damn, nice F√∂rsvaret help out. Wonder could places ridiculous military spending like US. Really good signs occurring peak transmissions occured working well. deaths go again, new spiked cases occurring seems likely, period needs looked doimg right. Sure, situation always get lot worse 2nd wave, especially hits multiple countries once, especially manufacture PPE. fair - shit show. Now, Fauci saying lied effectiveness masks start protect supply masks medical workers.

Of course people little trust government begin going react badly study Fauci's admission. I'm longer willing vilify them, though. fault ""experts"" handled pandemic. fair, ""new daily high"" entail likely lot infected people rally. number could 3 cases ever seen new cases 24 hours previously, they'd call new daily high, is. instance, 143. 

I'm saying wrong, probably right, new daily high report. Absolutely correct. recall news reports showed people China wearing masks reports outbreak ""over there"" people thought would stay there. told masks necessary. Apparently people still think not. ""Fuck facts logic"", seems pretty obvious, unless stupid. That's good point. Administrators keep mentioning layoffs coming things return normal, things return normal right now? It‚Äôs American way. good point. think need completely revise management models expectations, happen, long time coming. article HBR management theories need change thought-provoking: Well, I've read impression gotten bit better many places late. varies lot region region. likely many places still problems. Esp. would guess smaller less wealthy regions less clout, like US. super kind person made waking morning lot nicer! Thank way worded really hit home. certainly ‚Äúall together.‚Äù own, zero federal leadership. caused incalculable damage country world, it‚Äôs yet. Fucking nba finals mine, pissed. I‚Äôve home 4 months haven‚Äôt left much. I‚Äôve followed guidelines everything it‚Äôs still like lot people wait know something absolute certainty, never publish paper medical field.  So, researchers use statistics confidence intervals, try quantify results. cannot prove virus cannot travel 2 meters, can. measure often does, confident measure. 

The popular press usually drops probabilities confidence intervals, reports main number. virus changed...the variable equation human action. way fight virus avoidance...there vaccine, cure, reason flattened curve us. folks plain stupid. would never worn mask even endorsed jump. hand getting less severe. know guess that‚Äôs I‚Äôm frustrated many people believe every headline fact every article find another saying opposite. Honestly gives anxiety. Lol Unfortunately see NHL well. don‚Äôt see resume happening either league, MLB NFL severe danger well. death rate high? really hope true however notice always downward trend deaths cases weekend due people off. normally sharp rise Monday weekend reports get entered. extremely alarming almost mid April levels cases rising, last week. top president saying told officials slow testing results look bad. (Not trying start political debate, pointing consideration numbers could even higher.) Oh god pos Yah. Promising one thing gets work giving ""lol nah fam, working doors"" bullshit. stated concern probably underlying condition diabetes. door work knew jewels. Hawaii island 14 cases 1.5 million people. 

That‚Äôs infected rate .00093% New low today far? Death going cases going though. change things literal schoolchildren gunned class, would change things this? Play ball! Could mutated? Yes, dare facts yet *novel* virus month started. story written January time true *was* likely would catch flu COVID-19 US. However, virus spread became pandemic. information became available reporting changed. need stop shaming people/politicians/institutions updating stance based new information, end people doubling anti-science views otherwise would admit wrong ""God forbid that!"" severe cases mild cases? actually means stocks go keeps saying shit like TV news reports without skepticism. High probability profits, him. Bolsonaro: what? It‚Äôs real don‚Äôt report numbers weekends reason Strange people screaming economic disaster won‚Äôt wear mask improve things. I'm looking video (which downloaded). 2 min 40 sec mark 2 min 45 sec portion, Fauci indicates cloth masks work too. Gotta watch video - total time 3 min 7 sec. site provided still shows increase. 

I did. I'm asking COVID-tracking site evidence spike sort, let alone 800-1100 positive tests day. I‚Äôd interested see kids development next 5-10 years. ‚Äòhappy medium‚Äô doesn‚Äôt much happy it. Every schools scenario look different, here‚Äôs looks like mine, he‚Äôs middle school school grades pre-k gr 9. Class sizes 6-7 students, one teacher every subject day, common areas, shared resources, social distancing times, staggering hallway outdoor times ‚Äúbubble‚Äù ever meets. library, gym, lab, band, etc. Kids arrive 1hr+ stand line 6ft apart let one one hand sanitizing. First problem isn‚Äôt enough teachers break classrooms small, parents given choice (and encouraged) continue distance learning next year. next issue course, understand you‚Äôre teacher, let‚Äôs real, taught kids classroom forgotten end term, let alone school year, majority cases taught never used again. Different children exposed different things interest may go find use things future picking career university major. Realistically, won‚Äôt. son taught introduction political system year, one example. point time, could tell single thing learned study back November. true kids, generation generations past. don‚Äôt actually learn topics take personal interest learn personally affects life. Whatever someone taught 6th, 7th, 8th grade really one year other. Remember long need pass exam it‚Äôs gone forever. read, remember, regurgitate never left education system. 
What school important for, invaluable even, emotional social growth. It‚Äôs learn human independent parents immediate family. learn make friends, compromise, grow individual. taken picture, what‚Äôs left? even leaving question ‚Äòwhat good it?‚Äô, importantly ‚Äòhow harmful going them?‚Äô
You know yourself, thankless job is, appreciative parents do, social aspect left school, glorified babysitter working parents. parents children 10 under, sending kid school isn‚Äôt option, parents need work. kids 10+, stay home distance learn, maybe that‚Äôs better? They‚Äôre seeing friends person daily, seeing them, learning them, bigger circles ‚Äòhere‚Äôs 5 kids talk day year‚Äô. doesn‚Äôt seem healthy. Forcing dystopia ever masquerading ‚Äònormal‚Äô school experience doesn‚Äôt seem healthy.

And lastly, clear, I‚Äôm trying diminish role teacher. Teachers invaluable best little available best times. math lessons little Timmy learning, science, history, none sticks majority them. None us ever really needed know powerhouse cell make use today. what‚Äôs learned age time filler they‚Äôre old enough make plan future decide learn what‚Äôs important them. problem people accept lied to... People common sense continue wear masks like always regardless CDC says. Everyone else choose wear masks think cdc full shit. ""evil"" may sound, Im actually glad stupids getting wiped out. Ive hoping plague long time thing.

And hearing recently uptick Tulsa, top several staff members infected rally, I'm expecting large uptick area soon. Really trending since mid April. major league sports coming back. would difficult impossible keep groups young twentysomethings confined longer week one sneaks party. Yeah mean Anytown USA. Much reason current problem everyone say numbers declining NYC said meant cases declining everywhere.. false reality Come back laugh proved wrong, weak shit like, ""could still rise"". That's weak shit. Sure! fuck death percentage rate high Mexico!? rate high, giant bunch cases undetected? Hawaii island part USA low numbers sort destroys argument though. island factor definitely thing Ok. Thanks info United States long history strong organized labor 

Really? I'm debating you, that's opposite rest developed world perceives, could provide reference support would good.

I call China advanced nation. Wow. russian social media disinformation work? Stupid knows nationality. here, three months, haven‚Äôt gotten nickel. *Halo intensifies* laws enforced puritanical. freedom. freedom protect ourselves. Freedom object government. important worst freedom act intelligence due real virus. defense/s bars kind hard get raging drunk thru mask. 2 people Korea recently got infected 5 minutes restaurant. posted yesterday. don‚Äôt know wearing masks though think arrived infected people 5 minutes infected people left. ever tried running bar able sell alcohol 30 days. 

You‚Äôre longer running bar. actually pretty strict rules Dallas. thermometers. lower Greenville time it‚Äôs basically dead new restrictions changes. won‚Äôt same. stupid spreading  healthcare.gov. lost job last year got insurance family four $250/mo reasonable co-pays deductibles. national level narcissism. sure? nice healthcare pocket max $6k. means could pay one year plus premium employer pays vast majority. bet you‚Äôll cry wolf $6k people‚Äôs savings, guess what. I‚Äôd pay probably double healthcare taxes lived someplace like Germany, that‚Äôs regardless sick get. responsibility leadership seem sorely lacking USA.

This glaring problem certain culture America someone thinks everyone else problems stupid enough fix problems, never fault, I'm everything right already.

And glaring example course Trump. Personal responsibility everyone else's prerogative, except Trump, zero personal responsibility. fair, measles special case infectious herd immunity needs 95-96% range fully effective.

COVID19 Likely require something like 65-80% herd immunity level.

That means 5%-10%+ anti-vaxers seriously screw measles immunity, number people refuse (or unable) would need 2x-7x higher negative effects. insanely random. TABC suspending liquor licenses... people piling barber shops without masks state nothing. You‚Äôre pretty wrong.

A lot states opened without meeting benchmarks randomly started reopening things.  sources Vitamin treatment? heard low Vitamin levels might contributor severe cases, heard given treatment.

Deaths purposely misreported. recall correctly pneumonia deaths 500% average. several instances revealed death data Shelby County extremely Democratic  tough Covid don‚Äôt know find hard believe county re-opened restrictions 3 weeks ago. hospitalizations since March. everything going well here. AKA perfect else! Yeah thinking restaurants, mostly consumer goods shops grocery stores. That's difficult sure :/ Arizona running 85%. less 300 open ICU beds. referring liquor laws, referring to? may jumped off-topic here. talking rules like wearing mask use bathroom restaurant. Let's blame trump another massive protests without masks proper social distance ! two weeks, protest another new spike, forth......

FYI - support proper protests masks proper social distance without looting rioting.......... like you‚Äôre enough social distancing, mask wearing staying home. Facebook posts say masks kill too, ignoring number people wear masks job every day. cases spread well last 24 hours disturbing number US citizens normalizing it, convinced hoax. brother law constantly social media talking flu regurgitating conspiracy theorist rhetoric. recently compared wearing masks Holocaust, saying started, Jews wear armbands star David. Absolute cunt. anti-education effort country downfall. Viral load factor too, believe (less days people catch it, opposed ""start"" things 3 months ago) Exactly. think media caught stories ‚Äúsell‚Äù building sense fear doom go sounds intimidating. think lot jobs let employees opt work home long time. Especially employees yet eligible health insurance benefits. gf work home risk contracting anything going back office especially since she‚Äôs eligible health insurance November? Surely can‚Äôt force come back circumstances... hope mean, I'm Columbus, Ohio over. several full shop international grocery stores frequented lived Cincinnati too. study says hydroxychloroquine (I'll call HCQ) dangerous retracted several journals. Please delete this. (school opening) backfire. ""school open cases still going down"" meaningless statement. entire point social distancing avoid making cluster spike cases. 

As far lecturing us Americans importance education: say, opening education. Educational system needs move new century, able accommodate distance learning. Hope life gets less shitty future This, 100%. Thank taking time out, write out. you‚Äôd think professional athletes would cautious contracting respiratory virus ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è though? remember customers arguing minimum wage workers prices food fast food company changed prices 30 cents per sandwich.

WTF wrong you? seriously blaming nurses CNAs always given like ratios one nurse thirty residents two cnas. Meaning one nurse responsible 30 people his/her shift. CNA responsible 15 people. 

Some residents worst people ever met life. call staff especially foreign minorities racist names. seen enough times residents lie abused staff get trouble. seen feces thrown staff. Staff bitten resident. like course idea grandma grandpa racist sit watching Fox News day relearning hate taught kids absurd. blame staff poor care staffing ratios bare minimum maximize profit. haven‚Äôt seen anything yet. we‚Äôre EMT try working inside homes one thing, know foreigners take job ... white folk don‚Äôt want wipe shit 15 people multiple times day 12 hr shift It‚Äôs design another land grab wealthy. people saw her, alone. Many trails people Vegas could considered work trip. Disney wouldn‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs required trip think could fun profitable. 

Yes know old people. don‚Äôt see many old people regular. There‚Äôs virtually chance hanging soon old people don‚Äôt also travel. two see travel do. 

Your last sentence dumb. Outside subreddit, I‚Äôd venture say one know scared traveling it. little bubble live possibly warped truth you. brain can‚Äôt seem process wont get it. get it, absolutely fine. Wear mask, live life. Step outside subreddit see life goes on. Everyone mother knows new deaths lag behind case spikes. Taking one data set calling reality moronic. maybe perhaps include total active cases ""reality."" fuck would wear mask thought thing flu? I‚Äôve never worn mask life March. Florida's true death count probably fully tallied everything said done.  First week June excess death count 1100. 28-35% normal averages.  hide counts pneumonia death counts it'll easier convey data end 2020 protestors get Coronavirus. mean get serious comment (hopefully). polarization ridiculous right now. sake angry bit rational please try spend little less time echo chambers. Honestly should. 

It's got people going fucking crazy. Technically defense US whole plateaued certain areas dropped others rose week rising again. Wikipedia article makes seems like everyone knew get-go poisonings concentrated Chicago one else risk. true. remember lot concern widespread tampering was.

I 7 happened. next Halloween area parents afraid candy supply tampered didn‚Äôt give year. got everything candy. crazy. fun getting infected, idiot. think unexplained fatalities probably variety issues.

I think people less likely go ER COVID-19 peaks fear they'll contract virus hospital (not unfounded fear given one retired surgeon Alhzies).

But virus giving people heart attacks, strokes, acute organ failure (compensated organ failure little symptoms depending organ). outcomes may disproportionately impact children, teens, young adults.

We recently started looking atypical presentations. Head non beach areas San Diego still lot people wearing masks. Mars best planet. Can‚Äôt second wave everyone‚Äôs dead gets here! Everything's sound bite. one looking comprehensive manner.

That okay three months ago. irresponsible point. Another possibility infecting younger people better chance fighting virus.

If starts go places like Villages... things going get bad. Dang, actually kinda describes well. Texas knows fun, try cleverly name every establishment it‚Äôs embarrassing say name place. Same. department ""essential"" office us keep working home. Reportedly, 90% office workers NYC back office. true almost meat packing industry responsible far infections dole. Bingo! ""Human Resources"" - name. get protests spike might blueprint things going forward. Outside, social distancing much possible masks. White people using black people gain even American.

Luckily event both! Agree - NC freaking out?  They‚Äôre going bad fall.... Meanwhile Australia, excess deaths *negative* 1000 due vastly lower usual influenza deaths thanks social distancing. Worldmeters inaccurate. NY DOH data says last day 1000 6/5 seem pretty spot state sources column link public health government site.

Glad sorted new. lot different explanations there: increased testing, vulnerable populations heading warnings, delayed deaths, etc. Hard know answer is.

What know headlines like ""forest fire"" productive. Doom gloom headlines imply deaths too. People assume cases up, deaths colors people's opinions. saw that. 10 am... ugh. happened NYC although reason might Canada. 

The entire system overwhelm combination hospitals e capacity treat anything COVID, people presenting ED otherwise fear going hospital EMT/firefighters able try ressucitate patients field hospitals wouldn‚Äôt take them.

I'm going take shower good decisions Florida making explains (positive mind?) development? Yeah, need decrease testing positive case count would plummet! Business reasons considered essential.

And since half population implementing mitigation efforts half-heartedly -- even growing number people intentionally going guidelines due political identity...well, are. Florida Texas leading pack exponential virus growth, least dozen states far behind. Same. commend though willing risk lives family‚Äôs life‚Äôs others though. Probably cuz either currently it. realize world counts increasing virus reaching countries populations before.

Yes. viruses work. Nobody thinks would stay Wuhan infect people Italy one first countries infected provides good evidence virus interacts humans time (e.g., months exposure vs. initial weeks exposure).

Yes. however zero bearing fact every day people infected ever before.

The Swedish numbers show slow decline deaths. easy see set 7 day average worldofmeters.

But based today, take long time declined way nothing.

It's also known declined caused corona getting less agressive, people likely die already dead now, changed way count dead, is.

It would great got less agressive. normal viruses mutate direction. Anything say would get banned.

I guess settle - actions consequences. mean ... they've still got long way go get close overtaking NY America's plague pit. conflating numbers. Bruh really generalize extroverts lazy stupid? Americans trusted right thing, they've tried everything else.

- Winston Churchill. thought *enough* people get suffer know multiple family members friends affected maybe it'll prevalent deniers marginalized drowned-out.

But course I'm probably giving Americans much credit. New cases flat month started trending upward little week ago, deaths steadily declining since mid April. 

Anyone know is? identifying mild cases previously? treatments improved considerably? many deaths reported properly?

I know theres huge increase excess deaths past months (something like 40k average nationwide) reason why? feels like states death counts way low based number cases. honestly worse news America. S.Korea one shining examples control virus. 

If they're second wave, America screwed considering still even finished first wave. ya‚Äôll, honeymoon trip Europe isn‚Äôt going happen selfish care yourselves. Europe never going open US long time. Thank you. No. virus remains same. Humans get immune virus they've already contracted developed antibodies, causing infection rate decline. described virus weakening. virus weaken mutates, talking different strain virus.

I think see deaths start trending heavily upwards mid late July. Giving time people say ""see bad"" catch themselves.  Right oposition shambles. first president win majority votes since 1994, winning percentage largest since 1982 (and one opposition party). 

I can't think anyone right could that, honest. proposing compare values year long averages? continue compare values ‚Äú7 day averages‚Äù like various media outlets (CNN Fox included‚Äù do?

[Disclaimer difference infections Canada US attributed Trump's interference. far know, scientific evidence can't get Covid-19 again. amounts antibodies insufficient stave new infection. would live proven wrong, however. Gotcha, well banker probably know much better make money work probably waste less big margin. Hope day goes well, happy Monday üò¨ fire employee right test positive coronavirus, lose court battle every single time. Even put reasoning. obvious dumb play employers behalf. Wow, cool - thanks sharing, idea going on! 

If pans out, potentially game changer. right, results promising, would theoretically allow much earlier Remdesivir intervention, could huge. 

I know still limitations terms manufacturing Remdesivir, pans out, imagine buckets money thrown Gilead scale production fast possible. Considering music festival across France thousands wearing masks comment seem accurate clearly missed Korean research then.

 Oh, irony can't declare success over. Today first day opening salons barbershops still can't dine drink inside NJ. Even outside past week. feels like live different country now. either treat systemic problem systemic solution thing failed since reopening. want people panic staying open one close panic mode...sure  that's true, think meant media focused on. Media certainly give impression 99% protests 1% riots, whatever true ratio is. Group projects worst üòëüò∑ It‚Äôs wild country argues masks.

Asian countries it, Canada EU wore masks kinda little bit largely don‚Äôt don‚Äôt hear people bitching there. think problem test positive. You""ll take 2 weeks off, maybe unpaid. company may realize cam function properly less staff whole saving money. may furlough straight drop you. California, employers need reason let employees go. They‚Äôre less likely argue directive coming place can‚Äôt immediately contest.

Yeah, there's whole ladder ""authority"" different people different reactions to.

Personally me... ""because we‚Äôre pandemic"" higher authority others, guess that's backed interest history wide reading every detail could, Wuhan onwards, since January. People back parks streets I'm impressed seem think whole thing over. there's always agenda. every sub agenda. agree statement, believe important note initial statements regarding masks respect N-95 variants. 

N-95 respirators/Masks definitely short supply beginning pandemic. masks needed rationed healthcare workers.

Then, important, multiple claims made masks ""don't help you, help people"". non-N95 type mask partially true. Now, mask definitely limits ability contract virus, eliminate risk entirely. lot wishy-washy statements made health experts. statements twisted interpreted ""masks work"".

Ultimately said ""N-95 type masks offer best protection, need conserved healthcare workers. Surgical masks cloth facial coverings offer protection, prevent transmission infected person prevent contracting illness.""

Either way, masking early would ideal compromise everyone beginning. Unfortunately, messaging somehow wearing mask became gesture political ideology instead active health measure. depth thought people analyze situation sub. Europe US pooled testing too. forgotten pedophile ring!

I remembered forcible rape punishment non-compliance (e.g. eating maggot food). virus weaken. thing. would need evidence new strain become dominant also weaker. One doctor's gut feeling suffice. 13 deaths per day. **ÔºªJune 22nd OUTBREAK ALERTÔºΩ** following 10 developed countries states United States reported new confirmed COVID-19 cases far today (will keep updating since countries U.S. states reported) :

This propagandaish. world record new people getting infected. talking ITALY fewer infected. 

Fox news betting people assuming virus declining worldwide. I've never seen many people rooting people die. Honestly less less patience conspiracy theorists like days. Good chat, I'm going entertain nonsense like anymore. federal government chose option 1. Let virus run population create Herd Immunity expense lives. That's really works though. null hypothesis ""This shorten hospital stays"". trial rejected null hypothesis found statistically significant change hospital stay length. average change length (not part null hypothesis) determined using data. significant change duration hospital change, large change. 

So, length significant clinical point view?

Maybe not.

Will debunked later on? 

I would guess, yes based 10 day trial. I'll leave actual scientists prove.  good saying people wanted hear, good it. live? I'm amsterdam quite literally nobody gives shit social distancings. Masks extremely, get bullied wear one. Nah, stuff literally back March, they‚Äôve moved discussing bloodwork, current treatment regimes preliminary vaccine results around world.  Also patients losing antibodies. :/

They‚Äôve got pinned weekly question thread top, ask lung damage issue there. said statement. THIS. feel exact way. ""ONLY 120,000 deaths? LOL need harcut!"" hope people learn lesson this. 

lmao Damn read references. 

They say exact opposite you‚Äôre saying. 

Read references people, that‚Äôs god gave us pot. Straight video tapes ""not destroying people's lives rumors"". tape, cases, see. People receipts. One thing came task force meeting 5 living Governors PSA. wanted show matter voted for, reopen safely protect other. hope guys enjoy importantly, hope reaches people need hear it. top all, president [...] he's moron.

That pretty much sums up. Florida doesn‚Äôt state income tax. Almost taxes come tourism. know why. I'm throwing people clueless reading lines 6 months dealing virus, real good scientific studies studies $1000 vaccine. get reinfected within timeline virus around far. Beyond guess.  said statement. mean donor class able willing stay locked financial means so?

All people I‚Äôve seen demanding lockdowns end rural, blue-collar, less educated.

White-collar upper-class people aren‚Äôt rushing go anywhere. said May.  cells somewhat ineffective owning mhc elimination. would helpful though! think initial response piecemeal continued way. bad can't unified. many issues! lived Massachusetts, wouldn' want anything Texas either. I'm super jealous! Take care said May. story making rounds titles generally lead lot misconceptions. Here's article nuance.
  finding necessarily mean people longer immune novel coronavirus months. lower levels immune responses measured study may still enough thwart virus, types immune responses examined study play role immunity. Overall, still many unknowns potential immunity SAR-CoV-2 infections, including protected long protection may last. 
 
...
 means immunity yet clear. Another study published Thursday Nature found neutralizing antibodies present low levels also potent‚Äîpotentially hinting low levels may enough protect infection. But, researchers know yet. Commodity problem can't solve could problems solved. canr convince people eat less meat, can't convince people buy companies unsustainable policies. matter confortable are. Yeah. 

I breathing/dizziness issues covid ever thing. Young nah, I'm much taking cautiously af. 

My mom, COPD post-lung cancer, howevs, wear mask keeps taking risks recently came place mask *just try take got inside*. 
Then got mad wtf her. 

I get definite impression lot folks wearing masks it, sort of... performatively, thats right word. full understand they're supposed work. Hence infuriating under-the-nose thing see lot too. Nope, hence incompetent downright negligent response virus.  Yup, buddies taking 11 days trying get tested results predicted available Yep. It‚Äôs another ‚Äú well said bad thing don‚Äôt listen him‚Äùplugs ears. 

‚ÄúSir he‚Äôs dentist‚Äù

Does dental pain. do. statement false. 


I regularly see people wearing masks supermarkets, streets, etc. minority. however see lot people keeping distance. course difficult small shops such, many people best. Right. ask able detail share adapted hospital care last several months improve outcomes would bolster public confidence optimism path forward getting back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù sure hell would nice earlier NYT article: ""The federal government received 4,500 complaints four years sexual abuse immigrant children held government-funded detention facilities."" ICE CBP effectively state-sanctioned pedophile poor patient went everything. hope recovers completely. Sounds like lung heart damage. People going prosecuted protecting participants customers. criminal negligence. Bad bot... wanted read based comment enforce adhere laws, people come bar. shut open gofundme hicks donate next stimulus check fight libs. People still saying surgeon general says masks don‚Äôt work won‚Äôt wear them. don‚Äôt care backtracked. keep repeating words winter proof useless. massive fuck people going die Dr Adams did. think something Tulsa rally... idiots let corona stop showing. think simply less enthused Trump days. Good sign. Mostly 

a) adequate social safety networks place help people can't/won't work - +$600 unemployment good thing come this, that's people get it, turning fewer fewer every week. event catalyst universal basic income got one $1200 check that's it, we've lockdown 3 months now. enough pressure send (this people protesting IMO).

b) inconsistent messages leadership creating false sense expectations. everything claiming ""not big deal"" even hoax one end, even governors taking seriously making executive orders expire 2-4 weeks, making seem like expect end timeframe, upsets people gets extended further. AFAIK, single person leadership role (besides Dr. Fauci) tried make clear going take many months sort people keep looking forward deadlines ending get hopes dashed realize pandemic still ongoing (yes, people idiots thinking that, mostly leadership's fault letting believe emphasizing measures need effect [likely] entire year, longer) 

c) almost nothing enforced, people understand long-term problem becoming frustrated/depressed news/pictures/etc. people taking seriously CAUSING last longer.

d) made clear lot people enough hobbies (or any). dunno guys, even able home much more, still enough time day spend hobbies. You'all need get hobbies bored. fuck. Look IHME data linked. Texas reduced testing. Florida ""test surge"" still testing far month ago. surprising. Based worldometer's vivid tracking site Arizona completed 11,000 tests yesterday got back 2200 positive tests. 

That good positive negative ratio shows testing nowhere near needs reports. lot ancedotal, not. Problem sure reinfection ror reactivation. Again, hugely misleading way junk article written interpreting reality. entered agreements companies make vaccines able respond appeared serious global health emergency. health emergency, remind you, saw 284,000 deaths worldwide (over 12,000 US). Ironically, criticism reacted quickly. writing H1N1 serious health emergency made sell drugs. rooted conspiratorial ignorance hard even know start. stupid news wont make educated, Larry Kudlow know difference enema heart transplant. /s one state NM, we've testing anyone wants test months. even need symptoms. That‚Äôs good look death curve doesn‚Äôt reflect dip all.

You say masks security different, since coronavirus kills, preventing spread vital national security interest!

All could prevented wouldn‚Äôt even need conversation. little bit leadership none happen. lockdown, unemployment, masks. That‚Äôs part makes frustrating. direct ""us"". wont say many us utter shame witness this. huge divide happening literally killing name Freedom. possible would move country. like watching movie absolutely unreal ignorance. Texas, Arizona Florida abnormally high case numbers compared death rate.

Even green zone need still act wave break out. testing numbers enough, need also percentage tests result positive... get 1k new cases daily 2k tests 20k tests per day. never said infected people good. testing different people better finding existing cases, like said. 

They‚Äôve protected vulnerable population like explained analyzed current situation believe tests doesn‚Äôt actually mean deaths come, like also explained. helps one third sickest patients, actually bad give anyone else.

Wait. You‚Äôll see deaths moment hospitals start max anytown USA. desire. It‚Äôs facts. Here's latest ranking states terms per capita deaths:

 map deaths county:

 would probably wear diapers stick libs. You‚Äôre right. takes weeks someone virus pass away it. really sucks. can‚Äôt visit hospital. Thats said, clearly wasnt speaking specifically US. everything always US-centrist? Cant really grasp notion maybe, maybe, countries current American political situation doesnt apply?  lying, think best idea.
I may UK citizen currently furlough able work over, think England moving quickly this. little late that? Maybe decoupling cases deaths US of: 

\* Outdoors better indoors  
\* High vitamin levels better low vitamin levels  
\* Humid air better dry air  
\* Better treatment methods known (e.g., proning patients improve blood oxygen saturation)

These multiple factors could explain many trends seen far various states countries various climates (time tell). Thinking loud: 

* Winter temperate climate:  People gather indoors closed windows, concentrates virus spread  People lower vitamin levels, makes virus spread even worse severity greater catch COVID-19.  Dry air may increase spread outdoors indoors
* Summer temperate climate:  People gather outdoors and/or indoors open windows, disperses virus spread.   People higher vitamin levels, since outdoors more, slows virus spread decreases severity catch COVID-19.  Humidity may mitigate spread outdoors; dry air may increase spread indoors outdoors
* Winter sub-tropical desert climate:  People may gather outdoors and/or indoors open windows, disperses virus spread  People higher vitamin levels, since outdoors more, slows virus spread decreases severity catch COVID-19.  Humidity may mitigate spread outdoors; dry air may increase spread indoors outdoors
* Summer sub-tropical desert climate:  People gather indoors A/C closed windows, concentrates virus spread.  People may somewhat lower vitamin levels, since indoors more, makes virus spread even worse severity greater catch COVID-19.  Humidity may mitigate spread outdoors; dry air may increase spread indoors outdoors best analogy ive come use meeting anyone wearing mask, say kind like made smoking public illegal. Yes took away peoples rights freedoms want safety others. extent also seat belts mandatory. cases like people ‚Äúdropping dead‚Äù literal statistical anomalies. virus date killed 0.00041% Americans, infected much more. Given millions aren‚Äôt dropping dead streets lung collapse despite virus circulating mutation least 6 months (some studies show perhaps long 9-10 months), severe lung problems remain within outlier category.

Again, 80% people remain asymptomatic. Given studies coming sars-cov-2 antibodies lasting 2-3 months, it‚Äôs possible repeat infections higher viral loads general vulnerable; also outliers. What‚Äôs likely killing people otherwise survive malpractice resulting misuse respirators bad respiratory therapy general. Western civilization woefully underequipped handle infectious disease. respond wrong comment skim said fill blanks? see commercials 20 years now. ‚ÄúDid COVID-19? might entitled compensation! Call us One Eight-hundred COVID19.‚Äù

It‚Äôll like mesothelioma commercials. President Trump held campaign rally Tulsa, Okla, Saturday, reportedly brought 6,200 thousand attendees ‚Äî many indoors, close quarters sometimes without masks. Sunday, Tulsa officials released statement urging attended ‚Äúlarge-scale gatherings‚Äù get tested COVID-19.

6,200,000 attendees???? I'm salty reopen protesters.

I stand BLM protesters. far know there‚Äôs evidence immune cells insufficient prevent second infection body can‚Äôt start producing antibodies again.

The reality virus isn‚Äôt magical, use phylogenetic bracketing infer traits likely have, similar use phylogenetic bracketing predict certain therapod dinosaurs feathered &amp; usually proven right fossils discovered. USA too, it'll cost $3000+ think went dormant immune system fighting virus properly. another case actually got infected comprised immune system This\^ northeast thier issues cold one wanted go outside, they're outside comfortable seeing NY, NJ, VT, Me, etc greatly reducing case counts. HIV reverse transcriptase enables insert genome human DNA anyway imperative hundreds thousands protest. latest article presented June 11. article, discusses HCWs concerned PPE present tense, past tense. therefore logical conclude speaking present. Great, guess ban cars planes now. amount deaths road pretty big observation. Fudging numbers huh? people don‚Äôt want see real numbers try hide together.


[ Trump defends coronavirus testing comment, says tests make 'us look like cases' -Fox Here's latest case/death charts Arizona Texas. Neither state looking here's current ranking terms per capita deaths:

 seem contradicted first forth sentence. 

Though agree effects become focused learn more. point they‚Äôre second wave, they‚Äôre ripple nugget Even start everyone hoping worst south, guess laughs now? 69 positive tests testing done mainly upon hospital admission means around 690 people got infected around 14 days ago. Lol know sarcastic see alot people wearing polyester masks instead cotton. Western business elites coming terms reality. Yea buddy hard time going back biking annoying thing made arguments (as often skew data). Percentage dropped ok open. Number confirmed cases ignored we're testing more!

In reality early days/week results opened testing baseline judging going forward. Can't compare percentages former data self selecting. Overall irresponsible acts going many Governors. ethical issue becomes vaccine work someone sprayed coronavirus ends dying, you, challenge trial coordinator directly killed someone. There's huge difference someone walking around maybe catching coronavirus wild. thing keeping safe days thought Oxford vaccine trail could go really well may start rolling Halloween... searching news articles every single day. Come July... 

Even super optimistic timeline, hard imagine we'll get next several months. state pretending virus exist, cases naturally spiking. know I'll able avoid least 4 months. Ah, saying NY surge people already covid. based evidence? apply Illinois well?

Also, get 0.4% mortality rate? Last time check John's Hopkins number 10x saying, around 6%. [Also, contact tracing require use GPS, Bluetooth, still use app GPS Damn. That's quite increase confirmed cases. really unfortunate local governments can't enact PPE. think enough counties, larger one especially, retrogressed phasing could catch media's attention, create discourse. I'm noticing figureheads mouthpieces insulated. ways get politicians actually acknowledge people feel. platform goes one way. present team curated move on. it‚Äôs better catching high positive outcome. strongly suggest substantial growth? 43% Delhi... still high ... concerning. probably shared article mentions one makes mention covid anyone even tested, let alone positive. would like make wild guess houses country going skyrocket price people afford want place run away needed. Love states see poorly going states decided go anyway. There's another story posted sub indicating antibodies drop significantly time, diminishing effectiveness herd immunity. believe greatest threat protests level 2 level 3 transmissions, would seen sometime around mid late July.

High asymptomatic numbers = protesters positive show zero signs go work, visit friends, family, etc. etc. people same, causing level 2 level 3 spread. level take days weeks showing signs, getting tested, ending hospital.

Everyone seems rushing see numbers tick protests, virus moves slow motion takes levels spread see increase numbers, take considerable time.

IF (this big if) see uptick cases protests, won‚Äôt see another month so, contact tracing would needed couple levels contacts (nearly impossible without army contact tracers) tie levels spread back someone attended protest. 2 cents. Could totally wrong, so, would excellent means protests caused zero spread. Kind random, Reno general? live NYC thinking buying land west go times year kind fuck around on. looking stuff outside Reno Sierra Nevada. work gas station liquor store outside GR area, mask use dropped 70% May, now. It‚Äôll pick soon, unfortunately start offering diapers put instead masks wanna babies I'm history teacher pains seen coming. obvious would take time spread locations outside major metropolitan hubs, busy complaining inside. Handling correctly would transmission rate less 1. 1.35 last checked growing. whopping 16.5% cases reported today positive. Positive test rate 6% time, much greater majority US.

Cases growing exponentially, people affected pandemic unemployment delayed months states day turn around.. purposefully refused wear mask properly stressed risks play here. 50 mean risk.

Not sure see ""spot on"" great handling situation. definitely happy get forced 60+ day lockdown another month record breaking virus growth here. Kinda missing point there, smooth brain. stupidly risky take cruise August opened back outlets spent February telling Americans less serious influenza ignoring it. NJ seems getting handle things. latest chart deaths running currently ranked #1 terms per capita deaths:

 second part hard people reason, even hated close people. hungover high school graduation deliver speech left home cause spent night elsewhere, ended remembering could made rest up. 

Thought well fellow classmates asked party went last night. RIP. Parents seem notice that's matters. know pulling ICU nurses hotspots regions?

That would certainly put damper herd immunity approach hotspots spread. LOT research said reinfected. Immunity goes beyond antibodies sad see testimonys, happens whole healthcare system collapses. Delhi quickly growing hotspot fear severely undereporting well. Indoor dining 25% well date. Really proud done NJ. Mask usage indoors pretty much near 100%, many places signs requiring entering basically understood, hopefully continues. Indoor restaurants first place open indoors folks masks point. argument strong, nothing worry - fact, welcome opposing views strengthen argument. 

But instead, resort personal attacks gaslighting.

That tells story. original article 18th June beginning April. think news current events?

No, they‚Äôre crazy. interpretation March April. There‚Äôs nothing supporting June. expected due protests  live Qns 4th floor walk up. get there's perception safety, inherently less safe go park walking backyard.... guess need accidents necessarily. think sex toy unlikely weapon choice practical matter. one dying it!!! Stop it. flu killing more. ONE DYING IT. Put care facilities elderly lockdown. ones dying it. Stop hysteria. None people studied virus. living last word untrained. Sheep!!! Please correct thought liquor license revoked - could open.

I forget lied something isolation kids looked weird first went establish eating pixie stick sandwich confessing promiscuous toward anyone pulse.

At end though seemed isolated dressed goth way let get hurt again, kids cause know 13 year olds WORST. bad news (potentially. 

Every point utilized lessen severity situation gets discreditted.

I wish would work things pretty high level certainity first taking decisions profound impact... then, play safe. Lol well clearly you‚Äôre looking troll go enjoy life. Hundreds thousands? Uhmmm we‚Äôre ~80k deaths away number? Even White House forecasts predict us hit number October? 

I‚Äôve hardly lived basement though thank you. lake past weekend well. enjoy packed bars freeeedoms. 

I think it‚Äôs remarkably clear statements you‚Äôre either troll, quite ignorant, live you‚Äôre trump bubble. Probably three. 

But enjoy man! Lot deaths EU well sadly mean android phone tracked google, iOS phone Apple. Also tracked less specific geo info telecoms 
 
Nothing really it. Thank you!! don‚Äôt know everyone blaming beach people packed inside small hot poorly ventilated bars hours! beach great fresh air, exercise vitamin d! Finding spot isn‚Äôt crowded possible! literally mentioned 4th link. Business Insider article looking for. They're typically neutral political scale writer appears left-leaning. appears that, yes, locations, told directly ask attended BLM protest could result person hanging up. Whether intent rule hide numbers whether prevent respondent hanging debate.

At end day, know protests going increase spread. close proximity people, use tear gas, fact point large gatherings people safely, bound produce increase COVID19 cases. impact protests apparent see/have seen increases places like NYC, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Denver, D.C past week week. Much like Pneumonia deaths, we'll extrapolate data generic ""attended large gatherings"" data. never said Lancet bad; evaluating 2 possibilites. guy work tell day real ""game"". also better knowledge towards steroid helping severe patients alpha defensin potentially impactful blood clotting, may better drugs treat hopefully would lower mortality rate though may lower damage individual, increase survivability. hope virus spike north, due reason. Seeing less less people taking seriously. shame, help inform people much... full time job college fired boss like going college. never late house never conflicted classes exams. like loyal job since college first priority company. money sue, working full time pay college money tied that. Actually live really like DeSantis. Voted glad did. handling spot far. Obviously, we're woods far steady correct. Protected vulnerable populations allowing less susceptible get back work. Certain areas definitely need monitored closely. Wear mask, keep distance wash damn hands! deaths flagged pneumonia. long term side effects covid recovery. happens state government doesn‚Äôt care lives cares money flow. take advice. problem tons ""minor"" opinions. 

Obviously first protests important people. increase spread though. 

Then ""mY rIgHtS!"" Crowd. Followed Bill Gates this! Hoax! even real! I'm 20! economy tho! Crowds.

What left 1 person 30 actually paid attention Biology class willing allow educated background make decisions better. **Is possible tell whether spike infections due protests, relaxation restrictions?** 
 protests occurred backdrop \[states\] reopening. states, we're already almost back kind usual levels mobility. course Memorial Day weekend, know brought lot people mixing ways would enhance transmission. many states we're seeing largest increases \[in coronavirus cases\], Arizona Florida, fact, people starting move around interact protests. So, somewhat difficult disentangle cases directly arising protests versus opening society general.

\[In addition\] protesters generally young. means many symptoms, symptoms mild enough go health care facility, \[the cases wouldn‚Äôt recorded\]. people hospitalized dying COVID elderly people comorbidities. impact protests‚Äîor gatherings, whether Memorial Day weekend reopening‚Äîit might take little reach people show hospital elderly otherwise unhealthy populations.

 **What risks posed protesting?** 
 know people crowding together risk transmission, although outside better inside, course, lot protesters make effort social distance wear masks. Nevertheless lot things think would high risk transmission. things response protests, crowded together vans, crowded together jails, tear gas, on. So, risks associated protests? would say, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù think remains seen impact transmission.

It's interesting New York, yet seen massive uptick cases‚Äîbut might there's time lag transmission \[new\] cases, symptoms hospitalizations. \[*Editor‚Äôs Note: representative New York City Department Health said data number coronavirus infections linked protests yet available*, *but noted attend protests eligible get tested number centers around city.*\] think that, terms risks people taking, right protest important function. prioritize essential workers, prioritize essential functions \[of\] democracy. personally support idea behind protests, even though think risk bring lot people together.

 **If people attended protest, get tested COVID-19?** 
 Absolutely. important thing remember wait days \[before getting test\] takes days viral load increase enough test able detect it. So, get test next day, get test three four days later. part called brain. Use research. residential neighboorhoods tons single double family homes separate entrances uncrowded parks. pretty easy part brooklyn go walk safe, put mask leave. Even smaller residential buildings like 6 floors, could take stairs health condition made difficult. usually chose stairs visiting cousin elevator damn slow. possible, agree still lot different suburb country heavy population areas. . Whats point contain virus open borders everyone infected countries comes.. Quayle, you? mean, say many things brought online easily actually agree extent. original, unedited question works within arm's length college students day answer pre-covid world, many did. post-covid world many changes, one arguing that.

To address behavior 18 21-year-olds, well yeah, one expects behave perfectly about... anything. That's really ground-breaking comment anyone works higher ed. every brilliant mature young person, there's polar opposite lol. Buford's gets traffic. WTF much latter 6th next big players next door Oh please get grip dude Sounds like tests Long Island nursing home employees. make wife take tests 2x week test results take 2 weeks... sorta defeating purpose tests. owners various nursing homes seem want use tests various checkpoints throughout NY. least there's vaccine, yes that's exactly going go America. Even there's vaccine, regular antivaxxors, plus likely whole bunch covid vaccine due conspiracy theories, politics, sheer stubbornness. Also vaccine probably prohibitively expense people health insurance. device's location services must turned order utilize these. long-standing coupling permissions features present Android many versions cannot get around time. Somebody enables order contract trace location sent elsewhere, period.

Agreed, that's unique problem contract tracing app itself. Enabling contact tracing make somehow *more tracked* owning GPS enabled Android phone. important difference HIV. hijacks cell system. COVID kill cells virus encounters, hijack whole system.

It may lodge system permanently means, particular HIV comparison gone around lot. none left patience conspiracy theory. think true number cases within first month pandemic probably higher published numbers simply seemed testing hard come by. prevalent. I'd like see percent positive tests trend throughout whole timeframe. Would recommend good sources learn? feel like remember seeing online tutorial kind set like educational game something, remember called. got free stock joining Robinhood never logged scared anything, honestly worried one stock if/how report taxes. locked March. buy time make tests accessible. bad portion State Government apparently playing game - lets buy daily dose propaganda DC ignore issue. Arrest employer hiring undocumented workers. employer able reap benefits cheap labor facing none risks liabilities? Stop demonizing people simply want work provide better lives family. know know either. don‚Äôt know people talking about, it‚Äôs simple shut up. Thanks linking, that's one referring to. says HIT likely 60-70%. mean I'm 20%? recalling memory ago, bad. say ‚Äúlatest months‚Äù mean March / April. like that? long incubation period apparently long two weeks, slow onset symptoms another week so. Hence 3-4 week lag infections/hospitalizations/deaths. Schools still open 2-3 months, things change strange. Covid kills old people. median age Ghana 21, twice (42) Netherlands. Well kill native Americans sooo Yeah wear mask, homie. Ahhhhhh yes fund corrupt organization I‚Äôm interested implications places side first wave. 

Like nyc, philly, etc Hey got banned COVID-19 posting cross post press-release flare. reason this. I'm looking information this. moderators need replaced. woman Houston tested positive recently, testing positive since March. way people experiencing COVID-19 chronic condition, difficult tell got reinfected virus went dormant several months. need leaders. People fuck without leaders. subjective feeling hot forehead thing thermometer showing objective increase body temperature (e.g., 100.4 F) They‚Äôre really helpful teaching percentage fractions children paying chores :) actually means people fled drug war Mexico South America. primarily caused draconian drug laws America. let's ignore talk like evil guess Personal attacks like make look weak. Stay subject stop spewing nonsense don‚Äôt logical point. stop testing reduce number positive COVID results. Kindergarten Logic. unions must Tulsa watch party. probably people bar rally. Almost every without unions moron, detach reality myeloid immune response related cytokine storm i've reading due vitamin deficiency?

sorry i'm curious computer programmer medical training. That's nice...but pneumonia death reports? Serious question happen? Said one ever. Haha matters USA! Good luck proving that's reason termination! not. People acting like things normal reality data paint bad picture. Ok well narrowed you. profit media. maybe run nurses staff beds?

Anyone claim free capacity. think idea they're facetious. Yes, sure. also says soon say sure. early indicators promising. think going *really* bad we'd've seen indication now, probably. data faked. deaths ultimately resulted pneumonia heart attacks, COVID-19 may underlying cause lot them. know sure lack testing early on, something definitely different year - significantly pneumonia heart attack deaths far 2020 previous years. people care know do. 

The problem smothered who's loudest ramblings others expressing inconveniences Google research. corporations ever want.
They unjustly fire reason suing hard. Especially many places dont allow phones expose People age. New people enter vulnerable pool time. open think open.

I think Arizona, Florida, Texas soon tell us whether appetite let effectively overwhelm disable hospitals continue little nothing it.  

Given apalling lack leadership support national level, limited effectiveness funding state governing bodies, may right. 

So applicable death toll projections scenarios next two years? temperature checks catch symptomatic people. think I'll go spreading kindness instead covid now, many people giving best. Sometimes easy forget majority part quietly. grandma‚Äôs house western Pa sold $47k years ago, great shape btw like trashed old lady hoarder house, totally charming 3 bd 2ba, safe quiet street, small nice yard. nothing left, always resort gaslighting ad hominen attacks? 

Why desperation resort low levels? saying HCWs worried lack PPE ""it's heads""? trust HCWs able properly assess whether adequate access PPE? live Missouri kids starting class summer school next week. Kids definitely going back school. Please try use hypothetical argument disprove actuality setup. person saying contact tracing app ""doesn't necessarily need track you"" relevant what's actually put forth, especially depends integrity tracking app permissions configuration OS. 

For example, OP post literally says: device's location services must turned order utilize these. long-standing coupling permissions features present Android many versions cannot get around time. Somebody enables order contract trace location sent elsewhere, period. 

We reason distrust companies handling data, please downplay this. Yeah, joke thankful virtual option. Insane. 

Waiting plus test took less 30 minutes Saturday. Dodger Stadium went. 

Got results less 24 hours later. last week 22 states spikes cases. offered swap, blood, ‚Äúrapid‚Äù tests. Central PHX Isn‚Äôt part job? credibility one listens. need new leadership. Literally. know people refuse wear masks ‚Äúmuh freedums,‚Äù mother cancer. interact without wearing masks. people simply stupid. would laughable weren‚Äôt sad. Yeahhh... well you‚Äôre going continue wrong, enjoy staying basement flaming. couldn‚Äôt less worried covid. Went packed bar weekend friends Friday. Went lake Saturday chilled party cove. Sunday family went bowling packed bowling alley went dinner after. don‚Äôt think anyone‚Äôs worried hundreds thousands? joke LOL people seriously going trust anything comes China point? Please, Please.. STAY SAFE. this, scary hard things get. CAN‚ÄôT give up! ""do want"" Sweden??? US best 30% peak death rate, yesterday outlier. Wait what?! source? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* tell support trump? feel sick looters rioters. destroyed beautiful cities. Look happening Seattle. Yeah, people vulnerable. know why, but... clearly, were.

We know 70% (ish) country gets it, two million (ish) die, based death rates we've seeing. new dexamethasone treatment means maybe it'll 1.75 million. Hooray.

Hopefully immunity works way expect take 7 years virus change significantly. Hopefully get vaccine safe effective kill million Americans. Hopefully people power finally start taking things seriously.

Hopefully dad finally starts wearing mask going overcrowded areas maskless people get infected bring home vulnerable mother.

We hope.  Maybe bar/restaurant crowd herd immunity lol know that's partly tongue cheek, even covid cases think would make difference. Even focus millions positive cases assume would counted covid death died, death rate still curiously lower Europe. know Europe good healthcare, suspect there's something else numbers. article mention often enter White House actually tested Covid. thought tested regularly rapid tests? Viruses mutate time. instance bad thing. virus mutates harder develop vaccine. influenza vaccines cover strains influenza virus people die flu every year. simply many strains influenza virus.

If corona virus outbreak contained, countries around world taking strict containment measures get-go, vaccine would necessary virus would simply die lack hosts. 

Look virus raging hardest find countries done worst containment. America prime example. People actively fighting wearing face mask single best thing stop spread. Americans dooming future 

Think viral mutation survival technique. virus mutates, likely survive us forever. Trump's Murica.  Illinois. People bashing J.B. Lightfoot (Chicago Mayor that's implement additional/different policies) labeling leftist extremists hell bent burning whole thing stick Trump somehow. things looking great, we're track Phase 4, infection rates dropping increased testing federal government (Trump) everything make things worse. Hate Trump? posted news article one media mouthpieces. 


You seem confused though. say CCP Worse, doesn‚Äôt give US license bad it‚Äôs ‚Äònot Bad‚Äô.


Just much Ass someone else doesn‚Äôt mean also ass. Why? Honestly, anyone? Please explain, Im looking fight...just something soupcon rationality explaining this...And, yes, read article.  Where‚Äôs spike Memorial Day case increase? evidence back claims?

It simple enough look total death numbers (total deaths matter cause) see numbers back normal levels.

I update graph new data comes plan posting update month.  Back January, guessed US would see 500,000 deaths. I'm still sticking guess, things mostly playing expected too. initial guess something like this:

Dense populations get hit worst first, people think overreacted, starts spread grow less dense population centers, growth masked decrease areas hit hard, drop summer lulls places false set security, starts hit bad weather cools, blows bunch places winter, people finally start taking seriously year. quarter million deaths first year, trails vaccine found, totally half million.

I hope hell I'm wrong, but... we're already quarter way there, five months in. Fucking terrifying. report Australia back March indicating patient found active virus cells 37 days symptoms disappeared tested negative twice within 48-hours.  


If want good information real study analysis, use DuckDuckGo (not Google) search studies virus coming Australia. January, reported children become infected symptoms approximately age 9 due body mass producing ACE2 cells throughout organs (if recall correctly read). also showed scientific evidence virus genetically manipulated lab found 4 HIV inserts areas unnatural missing blocks genome sequence happen. fact need scientific evidence thousands people sweating standing shoulder shoulder breathing leads COVID cases concerning, really shows you‚Äôre unwillingness hear something don‚Äôt agree America become joke, one, within international community still whole still prideful admit mistakes, filled way much infighting, refuse needs done.

Reminds Ancient Rome, longer around.... IDK around decision shut made individual locations employees testing positive making danger everyone. government may choice rate. theocracies world say hi! would least concerned hospitalizations. It‚Äôs like it‚Äôs big deal hospitalized long end surviving. happy see. I‚Äôm impressed quickly society found voice pushing back real time racist views outdated ideologies.

It great city local millionaire businessman lost millions contractors overnight racist stuff posted FB. understanding many european cities also basically limited outdoor time residents. Like - exercise 1 time day within couple kilometers house. 

Meanwhile State first wildly different classifications 'essential business' cases decent portion public still going business setting (even things like lawyers support staff saw California working). never much limit people recreating outdoors streets got crowded people walking/biking/jogging. never big halt trips grocery stores also took us really early May begin getting serious mask coverage. 

And couple opening stores ~early May (4-5 weeks many places mandated initial cloaure) states went full restaurants opening time. 

It's mess realistically strategy never going yield manageable contained situation end. Rather really way keep hospitals functional feasible otherwise lean hard herd immunity approach. Hold on, covid get eradicated long time ago? Like, lifted restrictions, reason worry right? Fl here, encouraging bars absolutely rules, wild west man. True story. Tampa same. Oh yeah, lockdowns? one those, think. Anyway meeting Joe's backyard cookout tonight, socially distant course. respect president, let handle problems. find joy watching TRY. Trump wants get continue life victim hood immunity? one documented case person actually getting covid twice Also bear mind rural areas seeing spike also breadbasket America degree world really cant understand Americans content paying much little. 


Here Denmark get tested day call doctor - even choose exact time day want test. No, greatest danger reacting like sky falling, huge amounts societal damage first time life ever thought weighing life vs death, really really bad it.

Death around us times. Millions people die every day. never thought before. Well luckily olds it‚Äôs possible get groceries without leaving house. doesn‚Äôt apply president us. There‚Äôs legal standard it. doesn‚Äôt get wildly suggest things claim one listen-he‚Äôs powerful person world. 

Trump doesn‚Äôt care America doesn‚Äôt either-he could eat babies air fans would figure good hates babies. 

In civilized country position power comes responsibility suggest bleach (which killed people) chloroquine (?)(killed people-no evidence works) light (wtf?) consequences presidents actions even without direct line command. thought related casinos reopening. understood meant asking. Thats gave anecdotal experience type thing. Ok? deaths hospitalizations lol Disney opening week half. work there, many us scheduled report starting 28th. course legit. MBC one three terrestrial TV networks S. Korea. expected due early state openings proceeded protests  mid-20s Army, changed jobs become parachute rigger. One first sewing projects time build sex swing/harness parachute harness. 

Kinky suspended sex chute tower commenced upon completion. wouldn‚Äôt expect price drop all,

Why? 40 million people lost jobs last months. There's going defaults, etc. fake word

Says who? It‚Äôs dictionary. people don‚Äôt use it‚Äôs still word. years

There'll revolution point happen. people supported reopening work home option.

Most people work home supported staying closed.

Reopening absolutely privileged thing. city Miami completely separate entity city Miami Beach, South Beach located. least another 12 months. Yes. states opened without steady two week decline anybody half brain understood states would experience spike see today. correct. CDC teams now? Maybe high day weekly average 600 currently got number one... Even kills us. 

Ffs. recent surges try catch us Brazil! I‚Äôm right wing I‚Äôm denying need progression. Next please. think us keep distance other. time works. Also working community perfectly capable working home. husbands work almost everybody working home 4 months keep next couple months. People can't works home go work think half working population home. iff loose job safety net provide minimum income. go. really... know. hope keep up...... Let's see tommorow whan weekend numbers processed. Or... words, country thousands people marching streets seeing spikes. 

Not defending side here, spikes US result stupidity sorts people. We'll see WHA votes later year Taiwan's membership. Taiwan, remember, voted member 1970s large part US wanted drive wedge deeper China Soviet Union. 

The member countries, WHA, decide membership. secretariat. common misconception see repeated reddit. exactly true. People favor illegal immigrants favor exploitation weak. look total deaths, even ages 80+ within normal bounds given year.

I've updating new numbers come week. post new graph reddit per Got it, yeah make fair point. total closure, limited valid reason (and reason life death situation). Inactions too. Wait, cases gone up? America places? Shocker üò±üò±üò± he's really saying is: ""Come everybody! Here, take bags me. go. Oop, make sure get 'em all. Enron great buy levels too!"" HAHAHA saw clip someone maga rally tulsa said one friends died, friends son also got placed ventilator close dying. followed still doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going thinks it‚Äôs political parties trying spin narrative. Exactly. many us owe thousands dollars better lives raise smarter children. That‚Äôs wanted American dream one hell price tag. tend low reporting - tho past two sat. tested people 'til later week time 8 9 percent positivity. thought interesting b/c testing last week came back much higher rate positives. Nice sturdiness tree probably key. indoor buildings require masks form social distancing. 

Hand sanitization gels available front several super markets. 

People also wear masks gas stations car washes. 

Random Trader Joe's example: local Joe's puts arrow markers, floor, show people walk set direction. also request one cart distance people decorated window. 

In lot businesses, also limit capacity get long lines could wrap around buildings. 

Fast food chains, like Chick-fill-A, mostly operate via drive-thru only. Also, menus became limited. 

Some specialized restaurants, like taking Thai restaurant, may require customers stand outside wait food. businesses require customers wait cars. 

In convenience stores like Wawa, best social distance waiting prepared food made. Hand sanitizer machine stations several spots. 

We take social distancing seriously state. So, businesses caught penalties slapped forced shut down. (i.e. Recently, one town, beer garden hosted many people social distancing.) 

Of course, also individuals, around shore areas, feel need wear masks boardwalks outdoors. Thankfully, that's everyone. sand may slight exception. 

Last, least, gun-ho drive thru anything. Drive-thru weddings. Drive-thru zoo parks. Drive-in theaters. Drive-in services. Drive-in theater. think something drive-thru-able, someone come it. üëç must error, right? Armageddon! definitely need leadership here. current leader like talk problem. That's technicality. Test subjects given dose self-delivery container, spray themselves.

Other that, many activities humankind engaged associated risks (spaceflight one notorious), what. Meanwhile I'm placed 225 student classroom starting August. Depends market, think. putting townhouse Northern Virginia sale tenant moved last month. couple townhouses within 100-yard mine closed within 7 days listing. agent told seller market right area low inventory people delaying home buying March COVID.  Let chips fall may. Ironically, unions shitty cops, teachers folks get keep jobs. cause chaos that's going on. Except random sampling beneficial people really need know whether it, especially may need proof stay home work.  Yeah worried second Thank empathy. joke eaglesnumberone Yeah dumb shit. so? number informal trials, least four formal ones, getting started.  saw EVERYONE wearing mask protest attended California. Unlike jackasses huddling bars mUh BeERs üçª naturally able provide solid evidence Protest led spike cases

I suspect answer involve ""common sense"" etc. AZ's %positive 20% (TX 10.3%)

We testing nearly enough either states. agree it‚Äôs easy us say don‚Äôt many businesses screaming us. 

Simply put, many business models obliterated longer function safely. But, people depend livelihood....so ? we've reopened 3 weeks ago cases hospitalisations keep declining Lol Yeah I‚Äôm wearing fucking mask... people could understand hate legend bottom, different colors instead ""bright red"" centered paragraph. OK, lets try this. Let's say two ideitical android phones. GPS disabled. One contract tracing app installed, one doesn't. app contract tracing app greater risk privacy violations? Haha good luck. like telling child put hand cookie jar. infected people come in, Rt &lt; 1 transmission chains fizzle out. ""No comment."" Supposedly church ""didn't know"" event agreeing host Trump rally. legit newssourcs They‚Äôve decided unnecessarily (in minds) expand lockdown appease reactionary 24 hour news stations uninformed redditors instead base actions data presented. Florida here. I‚Äôve phone SIX HOURS trying find testing site takes insurance take referral doctor testing (because don‚Äôt office)

I found appointment NEXT TUESDAY FINALLY   experts believe 5-10 times cases confirmed. knocks death rate .2% .4%. We're going serious conversation age kids left alone would child protective services getting involved... know thing intellect

LOL, woke saw comment reply without original comment. thought someone trash talking first üòÇ

Thanks great day Americans want everything compared them. Thinking theyre always example World. people lazy. keeping distance 3 ft really difficult task. Europeans seems overcome it. accept people's laziness make believe masks effective remembering stay 3 ft away others? many people state (not one 12) wear mask it‚Äôs terrifying. care relatives severely immunocompromised, it‚Äôs difficult avoid going essential places. I‚Äôm trying act like Karen I‚Äôve already contacted target establishments don‚Äôt seem enforce sort penalty people don‚Äôt wear mask. state requires masks it‚Äôs bullshit people getting away wearing one ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel like it‚Äù. Well don‚Äôt feel like giving relatives fucking coronavirus knowing could die! I‚Äôm tired selfishness consequences assholes. thinks? brother exposed rodeo Dallas. waited four hours get test last monday hasnt received results yet. probably RIP healthy ones too...there‚Äôs way telling what‚Äôs going happen someone‚Äôs infected. Yeah, thought people pushing get away WFH MISERABLE home lives hate kids/spouses use work escape. Ditto! I'm hanging woods dog, kitty, guitar husband weekends people company. Rock on! ü§ò export 4th world freedumbs rest modern world. makes perfect sense.

It‚Äôs called ‚Äúskirting responsibility‚Äù wont, labor materials arent gonna slow anytime soon. Yup, around mid May everyone know started acting like corona went back normal lives. I‚Äôm Utah outside SLC wouldn‚Äôt know pandemic ongoing. 0% mask usage packed restaurants. heard Abbott going another press conference something today doubt right thing. please sponsors all. Probably yeah Florida going re-frame numbers looks better.

Incoming ways FL re-frame...

* count individuals speak fluent pig-Latin.

Those two morons nowhere seen except posting subs cojones pipe up.

Total bitches. one take year start top list devastating diseases.

what's happening resources split dozen different ways nothing succeeds fast should.

i'm saying need vaccine every sniffle, disease kills certain number people ought figure prevent ""griped at""? 


I'd find intelligent friends, family griping tell fuck off. US are, unless rich, maybe take good care rich famous. rest us, nursing homes hell. well said. man gives 0 shits safety people actively working manipulate numbers make things look better really are. suspect he‚Äôs time, feel like least monthly get headline shows controversy Florida‚Äôs official numbers.

Dude‚Äôs basically Mayor Vineyard Jaws point, except worse...COVID-19 managed kill way people Jaws ever did. Arizona says hello. ""Texas one ¬†lowest death rates -- fact, lowest death rate -- among top 20 states COVID tests America,"" Governor said. 

Texas - people dying ""unclassified symptoms abnormal findings"" Covid-19 low Covid mortality rate. Insert surprised pikachu face Yeah, 100% US Europe economic circles started media campaign depicting victims disease a) expendable (old, preconditions,...) b) unavoidable (we cant contain virus even Asians it).

Dude, seriously country every economy-leaning newspaper parading fake-experts around intonating old Flu song put pressure Merkel give NPI. There's false housing crisis. enough houses everyone America, we've allowed get bought hoarded boomers AirBNBs corporations international investors, serfs choice rent exorbitantly high prices them. repugnant. masks work. Social distancing hand washing bare minimum. Masks extra Goodbye economy. Delete now. don‚Äôt need give ideas. family Florida. said there's spike cases spike hospital admissions. There's theory what's discovered asymptomatic carriers far common previously believed, increase testing capacity (fivefold per day past weeks) means people without symptoms known exposure starting tested. Freedumbs explain covid spikes. Sadly it'd need much closer 100% mortality rate achieve that.

Instead get people asymptomatic saying ""I got even get cough, SEE?! bad"" go help spread around people may may serious comorbiities agree, one take seriously first place, possibly burnt ""crisis""?  rural areas, sometimes one regional, low budget hospital extremely limited resources PPE test kits medical staff.

Right, can't overstate this. know rural New York hospital four overnight beds (4!). Short that, road trip metro area. ICU usually actively dying they‚Äôre everything prevent it. Anyone ICU bed requires intensive level care. rate see pass Italy Spain nr registered deaths per mill. Really exceptional, dead Italy...could thing finally make people Sweden realize acted stupidly. 11 domestic cases yesterday. People predicting 2nd wave exponential growth least month now, peaked like 50 domestic cases '2nd wave'. isn‚Äôt washington state this? protest, would think would spike see point aware arguing European style regulatory regime. frustrated EU gotten outbreaks control, US struggles would unpopular infringe people's rights enact stricter lockdown. know airlines Europe doing? not. case OP, think airlines done? Lets say, like OP, everyone booked flight months ago want cancel trips. budget airline flight presumably cheap. think airline canceled existing reservations sold new tickets higher price cover operating costs? think airline canceled tickets, others? sure either even options US. sounds like airline either needs 1) operate 2) operate loss ensure social distancing 3) resell tickets higher price make price tickets. studies shown airlines would need operate far less 50% capacity considered safe. sure right answer here. Sounds like joined navy . boss really wants things open bored nothing weekends. also wants haircut spa day. people super selfish. Thanks! Lol

People focused kid world...no one else‚Äôs. sucks. I‚Äôm sorry. see maybe 1 person per 50 wearing NC. bright spot large percentage protesters masking up. 

It become political problem. aren‚Äôt ever going see second wave here, first one never stop. mentioned Texas. WHEN, happens expect 2% fatality rate go up. Small towns cities fucked, fuck much Abbott. government keeps changing criteria massage numbers get results want. It‚Äôs infuriating us actually working problem. 

As real world example, longer admit people diagnose clinical COVID. patient lives house 5 people positive, pt come fever hypoxia , CT shows ‚Äúground glass opacities throughout consistent COVID-19 pneumonitis‚Äù , longer admit diagnosis likely COVID. must actual test result. 

Now test takes 48 hours come back send test Monday Friday. So, patient gets admitted Friday night hypoxia, send test off. lab doesn‚Äôt pick Monday won‚Äôt get results Wednesday. patient may get discharged Tuesday, since test result isn‚Äôt back yet, never listed COVID patient. Voila, COVID statistic. never affects numbers. die time, depends back death paperwork filled out. nursing home patients, nursing home doc often pre fills paperwork( courtesy ER doc speed process) patient may never listed COVID. 

There many ways manipulate numbers. That's separate issue tiered list needs pandemic. important course, right point totally inadequate rapid tests - *everyone* assume isolate others.

The first important data needed policy decisions determine many people it? 0.1% population infected? 1%? 5%? 30%? making decisions based data, public feelings/emotions sort lifestyle people want. 

If live community 300,000 people 30,000 people virus, *really* want relying individuals make decisions themselves. can't identify 30,000 people limited testing resources - going miss **lot** (which made even worse 7-10 delay getting results we're experiencing). public health decisions made all-important piece information responding pandemic - real-time estimate prevalence. *We never done this.* working absolutely dark, speculating correlation total confirmed cases deaths trying make sort estimate actual cases constantly changing criteria include test group, one day majority data points coming prison, next they're coming drive-thru test blitz, day they're coming hospital ward. total chaos keeping dark.

At point option left isolate everyone fullest extend possible...but given lockdown fatigue economic panic, ""isolation"" people still willing accept putting piece cloth everyone's face gentle reminder people try remember get close strangers. many independent Reservation governments stuck shitty responses public parks geographically close reservations. 

Ultimately, though, states face unless close find way halt travel states. Excellent objective analysis. People often forget evolution angle almost everything life society close enough, hear fuses blowing. ""China dedicated stopping virus"". 

My bum stomach hurt now. I‚Äôm not. places go see small restaurants still takeout. doesn‚Äôt leave much thing keep safe. keep others safe. Let's right thing even others court madness.

We together got back April date first publication date, updated regularly older person, seem less willing accept rules. Lots elderly ignored every new rule stores get mad store manager tells please everyone else. Regardless fatalities, lets say even hundreds thousands college students become sick fall, going severely detrimental studies. really curious many end differing year. Sick students probably going able study well need rest. Granted broad assumptions less important one's health, another point consider. Please explain nyc's numbers continue drop despite tens thousands protesting, shoulder shoulder. Stay safe there! require intensive level care, taking ICU bed. ICU cases extremely expensive, person need intensive care, ICU. probably kids everyone decide put trust in. chose science, politics, religion, even whatever popular. chose you?

What study shows masks alone reduce spread virus among humans 75%? grew CA, living TN, say right. understand it, nailed it. Sure do... google 3 digit number ""new cases"" see many cases got. sad, takes major outbreak people know dying people get scared enough simple, responsible thing - wearing masks. Tatoo x-ray chest, way need take new x-ray next time get pneumonia there's different pandemic (or covid returns) Agreed, NL caught flak hard restrictions travel, currently 0 active cases 4 days 24 days without new case. Still seeing mixed reports asymptomatic spread though. Neither us symptoms all. I'm coughing sneezing, exactly could spread it? waste money realistic. going give kids like 50 different vaccines? things really threaten lives, waste billions dollars eradicating something like that?  Science come clear consensus. need masks social distancing. 

If send children school, get covid asymptomatic like studies found, give parents, give grandparents, give coworkers, give families - looking insane rise cases many deaths. 

If we're still comparing car accident statistics, 2019 38,000 deaths car accidents. currently 121,000 deaths covid year. That's three times amount deaths half year. Okay luxury resource find add trade network already have? keep us going turns. Jeez don‚Äôt know test fewer people fewer cases? /s prior covid, i've always asked employees gym front counter open keep door open everyone exercising. seemed really natural expose everyone fresh air exercise. would always get mixed response - sometimes yes sometimes no. think indoor air policy nationwide. easy opening door. Unless industry needs closed doors security, open doors windows policy seems right thing. China blight World‚Äôs good future Nope biggest protests big cities yet we‚Äôre seeing spikes rural areas soooo...you‚Äôre wrong fuck clearly agenda push. definitely shouldn‚Äôt go out. worst since beginning, since people weren‚Äôt wearing masks first. 

Nothing gotten better, honestly. It‚Äôs lot people can‚Äôt maintain isolation trying convince it‚Äôs better. fucking course are. Jfc. Thats China. play ball everything naught. Wish one. know Mario 64, Diddy Kong racing etc amazing. did, thus conclusion. Tests ALSO infallible good doctor understands make assessments accordingly. church opened, friends figured pandemic over. article says vast majority 200 miles simply replacing old wall handful miles new fence. looks like Canada US border. wore P100 essential job worst state (we fewest new cases per day country right now, thankfully). 

Don't give damn anyone judged it, quite people ask got it, called, etc. mention found rubber 3M P100 used substantially comfortable cloth N95, less heat generation face also. potentially deadly everyone. also 1% population still millions people whose lives selfishly give shit about. it‚Äôs ridiculous say doesn‚Äôt affect non-elderly Maryland lost almost 1000 people 70. Interesting. Love country's maple syrup. addicted it. ;-) Why? Lol. One expensive flight little passengers. searched word 'location' article found one instance:

But... there's chance they're going start increasing increased occurrence hospital stays south. death lagging indicator. repeating government telling them. lies masks early on. event Jan 22nd. Governors since then? thought fighting bids....so happened. 

There billions PPE produced past 3 months, someone it. worse ""Now, want test, get test. We've got test available. We've got 120-plus locations,"" said Governor Doug Ducey June 11 news conference.

Your governor either lying woefully misinformed COVID response state. Beside odd bit news I've seen, really idea Trump US. gather, shitshow, whatever blame put him, I'm sure probably well deserved. 

My point - completely agree - re-built top down. shitshow own. 38 states didn't. believe presently reported death numbers US. They're far sort pattern relationship reported confirmed infections pretty easy see they're manipulated. people need led politicians? They're literally useless.

I need listen suit, there's literal science publishung data daily tells us best course do.

The state middlemn hampers progress sake. lot lockdown can't really enforced, lot people smart voluntsrily isolating quarantining themselves.

There's way ""leadership"" enforce this. literally US call people they're selfish assholes, also create communities associations mutual aid

The state cares promote interests. care people die. Harvesting effect. easy spewed everywhere. people country think follow like dogs. interesting people want donate blood plasma though. I'd say quick test done daily everyone catch infected worthwhile. protests, New Jersey well?

There protests Trenton, Newark, Toms River, Asbury Park, New Egypt, towns, densely populated state union... yet, nothing. 

It's primarily protests. protests outdoors people largely wore masks factors helped. colors light dark, bright red worst? Same. doubt companies large employee bases employees return least next year. statistic found correct number new cases per day slightly increasing spikes, number tests per day though, cant give tests positives ratio, would said more. second additional statements True.

But solution then? 

Most adults can't quit work look parents full time years, bills families support.

Care homes ideal, also needing 1-2 full timers caring specialist facilities meds, etc. governments less less money spend elderly care.

I guess good solution, otherwise would see implemented already. looks like future, affluent rich would able time money provide good elderly care. working day labor demolition cheap (real job product photographer killed rona). got decent cut foreman sent hospital tetanus booster wound checked. 

I feeling like world deemed nonessential quite honestly expendable... guess expendable politician, got going me. Heh. something that. Okay, point federal statute uses term ""illegal alien""? I'll save time -- none do. find reference ""illegal entry"" reference aliens, nowhere ""illegal alien"" appear.

Nice try though. grandmother one operated church group. assume that‚Äôs profit. don‚Äôt know anyone makes money elderly feel right here. really idea treat prevent spread disease without severely limiting social contact. well could several years enough information contain live life normally.

Also poor people dying spreading disease everyone gets expensive real fast. It‚Äôs like jail. slavery.

Gladly Well, u/turdpussy, even going ask kinky things to. quick sneeze state, cases skyrocketing deaths aren't. mean sre testing more? month since deaths gone up. 

On average across USA testing simply catching people. They're new, they're newly measured.

That said, hospitalizations deaths lag bit. states, %age positive found tests increasing (generally indicates increasing outbreak) low ICU availability, might struggling 15 20 days. big problem wait trouble fix spread. bit trouble 20 days, stricter rules implemented 20 days, might mean heaps trouble 30 days. discussed repeatedly but, nothing confirms asymptomatic transmit virus. 


Should countries currently report cases incorrect reporting asymptomatic infected be? absolutely true. wife first time buyers actually going move soon (our offer excepted) offer day listing otherwise town, houses would post MLS (for Realtor) sold within hour two. got see one right main realtor list it, thankfully made offer straight away.

We looked one, day officially market, sold within three hours market, 6 7 offers, one one 10k asking. Like compete that. late. politicized moment Trump saw would possibly effect campaign. 

Then followers also national leaders went path did. 

And two biggest countries Americas doomed. died (at least then) COVID, many (most?) even infected

wtf even mean??? thousands dying died covid19? Nurses, frontline retail workers, police officers, emt far young workers. places protected older workers laying retired early. Makes sense young people working age would contract virus. Honestly also care distancing inside stores. matter walk past people everyone wearing mask. heard expert late March saying needed hardcore 14 week lockdown else. Guess getting else scenario everyone got bored 6-8 weeks it. ARDS go hospital, dead. Thank children families. 

Lol virus track record killing incautious. I‚Äôll never understand people throwing away caution. That's rules melanin-deficient people. believe 50 states virus control August.

Narrator - ""they didn't"" world *does* miraculously disappear they're rich. That‚Äôs young people don‚Äôt want wear masks partying friends. I'm going apologize advance, due corporate firewall issues access sources. let sync bookmarks work laptop, saved Reddit opposed Chrome.

[Cotton 1/3 effective given takes relatively particles infect someone, anything short medical grade mask probably going stop Coughin' Karen giving spews face.

But Karen wearing mask, means would *much closer* get infected, even mask bandanna wrapped around face. air pressure. Cotton weave thin stop aerosolized particles getting through, slow speed exhale way grove trees slows wind. spreader exhaling cloth mask, he/she spreading particles far physically he/she would wearing mask. Moreover, asymptomatic/presymptomatic spreaders shed virus particularly quickly, 30-50% reduction particles tertiary contact (say, passing one grocery store) huge. One article (which sadly bookmarked instead saving Reddit) suggested that, based coronaviruses, takes 1000 particles cause infection (because body plenty broad-based defenses catch virus even lack antibodies). asymptomatic shedder spraying 20 particles per minute direction, blocking third massively increases chances none getting - doubly pair social distancing get exposure seconds minutes, triply they're *also* wearing mask even encounter plague cloud already 1/3 filtered even hits mask.

Things get even complicated introduce potential materials homemade masks. ""non-medical grade polypropelyne masks"" available sale certified FDA, testing block around 90% particles. schematics homemade N95 masks using AC filters. masks use activated charcoal filters, synthetic fabrics better filters, fabrics antimicrobial materials tested, etc, etc. fortunate enough something better cut t-shirt wrap mouth nose better. 

But reason (stupid) people say cloth masks protect filtration rate low save symptomatic carrier. kind person want wear mask, carry strawman battle like protestor sign. Infection Symptoms: 5 days.

I also 100% believe states north phased reopenings place, *will* actually take step back adjust things start going wrong. That‚Äôs shocks FL, TX AZ moment. Like it‚Äôs clearly getting worse reaching pivotal moment, instead largely enforcing masks/distancing even closing governors like ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è still hospital beds opinion, death numbers valid. totals manipulated states either reporting all, reporting unconfirmed cases presumed SARS-CoV-2, ignoring people die home ""other hospital"".

so ...not chinese bad people fake shit sell ( chinese ) similarly muslims terrorists ( actually HATE terrorism/extremism ) irish drunkards.

all i'm saying SinoVac someone who's going destroy image supplying COVID-19 vaccine fake af

the drug authorities test stuff allowing population

P.S : since people, well screw FDA honest testing stuff trying clear view COVID-19 something everyone take seriously, fake vaccine question unless company wants bury I‚Äôm embarrassed american. Idk, seldomly travel north Main. üòÅ longer lag time that's all. We're catching people earlier process testing. instead catching people right death's door, we're getting near beginning sick. lag time estimates 28 days incubation death reporting. We'll probably bottom deaths end June start seeing uptick early July give take week two. first case job WA.


This dumb motherfucker went vacation Arizona came straight back work. employer actually taking seriously, mandatory masks day taking temp couple times per day.


Before, wear mask customer waiting area. Frankly I'm surprised took long. blaming media convenient easy people go along existing biases. Yea working pretty nicely here. Outside one gives much shit anymore, seem matter infection rates. Inside stores 100% masks matter go. really feels like got routines. 

I like positive percentage rising lot current hotspots. month ago Florida 2-3%, 9-10%. Go back posting gay porn. sub never changes. None states mentioned large scale protests I‚Äôm failing see point People different. Life experience teach this.

Some are/were legit depressed suicidal isolation repetitive nature quarantine working home.  people handle isolation see nothing look forward to, stuck inside, working money can't spend, completely rethink life. Others mind it, love never want end.

You shown also short sighted. simple making whether see way not. unlikely round 2 even close bad round 1 nyc. 25% already infected, extra precautions citizens, high risk group taking shelter almost completely. you? thought patients self selecting/volunteering can't really extrapolate sample. Reaching back twenty years probably wrong. Must American. It‚Äôs serious.

The U.S. death rate 2017 863.8 deaths per 100,000 people 2,813,503 total ( ). That‚Äôs 234,000 month. Assuming coronavirus kills weren‚Äôt going die year total coronavirus deaths come 200,000 year, total deaths would come 3,013,503 using 2017‚Äôs numbers. That‚Äôs 7% increase. Many victims coronavirus death‚Äôs doorstep anyway, true number would 7%. Also, death rate significantly decreased, unlikely hit 200,000 deaths. Also, decreasing 7%. sure WA cases spiked weekend too. Could due spikes Eastern WA might well south. Wow. realize DC got hit hard. shown believe things find real. Still waiting evidence. misplace it? That's tough, hope manage figure put it! know bunch people China - response thing whole time incredibly hardcore. example, one friends living 32 floor apartment building Zhuhai 8 units floor, total 256 units. reaction finding two confirmed cases two different floors building put everyone strict ""don't leave home"" quarantine 14 days. wanted groceries supplies, called used WeChat request wanted delivered outside apartment guy hazmat suit. moved another floor, sent message say could pick stuff now.
Oh, tested everyone building twice (once start, end) told people take temperature multiple times day fever symptom immediately took screening clinic.
As turned out, two initial cases ones building, make clear seriously taking this.
I absolutely see going overdrive confronted sudden outbreak capital. Lots absurd comments comment section, claiming ""we public health care it'll cost lot, better let poor die."" fundamentally disagree sort narcissistic sociopathic nonsense.

Especially age proven beyond reasonable shred doubt public, non-profit health care system saves citizens absurd amount money.

Also age super bugs thing everyone get health care vector spreading plague, turn *shuts planet's economic system.*  employers actually demanding COVID tests people stay home work sick symptoms? Absolutely economy, costing us TRILLIONS dollars , simply can‚Äôt afford . 

I mean think debt going ? Debt heaven ? money fairy going come one night leave trillion pillows . 

If current level spending keeps taxes rise tremendously spending probably cut hurt poorest .

That inflation , hurt poorest . Hell yes they're everywhere. *countless* days leave house encounter literally nobody wears mask.  Can‚Äôt ? Yeah, responding non-US countries, talking country. plenty young people believe ""99.5% recovery rate"" added articles like one.

 

Information like available months yet people still think people ""it's flu"".  Freedumbs! Yup, shell thousands lawyer fight potentially years long battle. good evidence. coworker fought 3 years sexually harassed final settlement less $10k. lost house lawsuit struggled find employment that. Huh WONDER WHY!!! jest sexual exploration extremely huge lockdown... told teachers can‚Äôt wear masks - wearing faceshields students need see faces fml I've unclear. increase virus right indisputable. I'm quibbling treating ""waves"" distinct phenomena different causes (as opposed virus resuming propagation fail maintain defenses it). view example media representing us helpless face causes beyond control. That's case. poor policy that's causing second ""wave"" kind inherent, cyclical viral behavior. logical. Many wearing masks. statement protests create spiken create cases. asymptomatic person could created super spreader event wearing mask prevented. gonna come evidence bold claim, deals undocumented immigrants reason hiding cannot apply unemployment benefits. place going fire indeed get fired automatically able claim unemployment benefits likely much better wages currently getting. Good news. Hope keep up! reported anyone Floridapolitics.com?  ton hard classes last semester online environment impossible learn in. People different learning styles exasperated problem even further. Personally auditory learner get lot person lectures body language open communication professor student. Another one biggest issues actually came testing. can‚Äôt hold traditional tests projects messes everything up.

Also another thing comes major in. English courses, computer science courses business courses example perfect online learning. subjects like engineering incredibly difficult teach test zoom. shit Sherlock! Miami it‚Äôs beaches beautiful. Sorry hear couldn‚Äôt cope leave. [Relevant image Sadly people don‚Äôt care, work witha 55 year old bought tickets family vacation Thailand last week. Marine buddy pissed wants take cheap cruise ‚Äúpussys‚Äù sit home. jokes light bulb ass know extract it. would cam, wont butt stuff, Sam am. blatant misinformation. walked dog near ""main street"" city last night. Fucking everyone acting normally. masks. Standing inches other. Sharing apps bar. Club back open everyone's twerking other. People literally bringing babies strollers bars *ZERO* protection parents baby. dog park packed kids running around. Think saw 10% mask use. 

It's fucking blowing mind. know *for fact* people going get sick absolutely rage government, too.

American's pathetic can't even literally nothing prevent people dying. government paying stay home people die everyone's like ""fuck tyranny!"" Masks outdoors make huge difference Yeah, scary operate global epicenter virus (America). Really saddening happened country still horrible. Guess 2nd part LOT important first part. feel like probably combination 4. Funny I‚Äôve gone comments everything blamed except protests. protests also help spread coronavirus. well everything else pointed want ICU bed, doctor. care intensively me. Deaths per capita everything..

Not saying good job, think deaths per capita great measure determine effect measures taken..

It dependent stuff like population density, household size country specific stuff..

Also doesnt take account bad initial outbreak was. country could used perfect measures, late implementing could still lot casualties.

I think last thing went wrong Netherlands. basically week late every measure taken creating high initial surge. Especially carnaval festivities pushed initial surge, think.

To determine taken measures succesful seems reduction rates better. much amount daily cases/casualities/hospital submissions got reduced compared peak long took go down. Like average reduction xx% week week.

Haven't seen analysis yet. Seems interesting. Similar MA. Indoor dining today, think phasing appropriately. Review data weeks see part phasing increased positives. also front requiring face coverings. Coronavirus exist anymore feel you. I'm finishing anesthesia schooling September. took job Florida....

Covid rules everything around  Yup, uncle works retail said never get test quarantine 14 days. super afraid they‚Äôll fire replace him. good news, seeing another spike coming, deaths/recovery rates rise again. Holy fucking shit. way quicker even thought possible. small droplets last hours, that's main issue here. know infectious smaller droplets are, one. 

The main issue air conditioning causes larger droplets stay airborne much longer normally would, also carry 6 feet. masks effective, primarily block larger droplets. Well ruined top comment me. mean however appreciate accuracy honesty comment thank scared shitless mind past couple months. Stay safe I'm also VA I'm amazed amount idiots boasting reopening. COVID nothing shutdowns nothing. problem casinos attract people states careful.

This Congress codify safety standards disaster.

You're safe Florida Arizona.

At end day, one super spreader event away. long term effects virus fact still really know much thing.  link AZ isn't. coronavirus play favorites!   find sharks grown legs hid years waiting need break deep cover. 

#sharkearththeory quite bunch patients negative swab despite classic symptoms imaging result.

We could diagnose RT-PCR stool samples. rapidly developping IgA IgM-antibodies.  accurate information novel virus. one earth idea happens covid patient two years. They‚Äôre talking possibility represents it‚Äôs genuinely terrifying. 

So want information totally new thing left dark it‚Äôs over? one earth knows things want know guess die droves figure out. consider really good chance really bad case? Yea maybe chief pawn whatever fuck China tells idea america built amazing. easy support that.

Also keep mind saying ""america sucks"" ""americans sucks"". mean attack personally. probably worse better redditor.

People angry America days bad things used usually good well. bad. became one bullies world. especially harsh used be, still pretend be, good guy. fuck? live LA spewing bullshit. seen bars, restaurants, hair salons, fast food chains ect. opened even allowed open. Businesses care law enforcement hands busy protest shit like budget cuts. 
City officials too, penalized businesses point close good well goes local economy. seen many building lease signs them. many empty stores many last legs/savings stay afloat (I talked local stores employees concerned might survive months.) 

Another fucked anecdote lack masks seen outside around areas. taco stands parks bank areas.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'd add gyms list coworker basically forced quit returned maternity leave. replaced came back put administrative assistant role even though expertise marketing. asked old job back said no. also put crappy location next kitchen. quit within month returning realized intention putting back marketing role. would nice articles reported whether spike hospitalizations.

More testing = cases, that's brainer. increase younger cases probably also result testing. 

Without knowing severity cases impossible draw real conclusions. typo ""attendees."" supposed say ""braincells"" Let interject real fast eat shit.

'But regular food boring.'

Well, kidding. That's like saying life without cocaine dull. He's professional drinker alcohol. HA!

I would not, could box, fox. would find hard fuck bad second time, even Bozo charge! can't even get social media sites now. Even online people disgust me. crying shutdowns ruined business people need get back work. COVID numbers fear mongering. Blah blah blah. 

One dad proudly stated he, wife, children wear mask. ""your health responsibility."" Sorry it‚Äôs ridiculous mention Germany among US Brazil. There‚Äôs one massive local outbreak Germany pushes R0 numbers low already, completely different situation US Brazil. I'm somewhat confused. basically excess deaths two weeks ago Florida. Florida second highest number seniors US? possible? someone used coach scrum team.

Yes.

This. he's liar care us Utah, hardly anyone wears masks. soon state started reopen hit ‚Äòorange‚Äô ‚Äòyellow‚Äô risk, everyone decided point masks longer needed. bar restaurant packed, families kids everywhere.

I walked dog night saw everything back normal, man. Families babies bars unprotected. People sharing apps. Hugging. Sitting next strangers. social distancing all. masks anyone. even babies. 

My biggest beef *know* people going get sick rage government authority figure. really wish everyone going right without protection non-vital reasons simply logged completely denied healthcare. Got COVID went beach wear mask? Ok maybe find room we're placing people actually followed rules first. Treat like organ donor list break rules get booted. reason waste limited resources people like this. I'm tired shit. Wow... perfect headline... lack social distancing also exists many European countries. American thing prevent ~~forest fires~~ coronavirus person put regular size Qtip nose past cotton. felt like really spinning nostril. right way test? really , really scares me. I'm certain doesn't. *I anyone sub wish ill will... blah blah blah*

However, one could *hypotetically* see situation public figure could use personal bout illness way save face electoral loss.

But again, *I anyone sub wish political specific harm*. can't catch covid outdoors. /S fucking blows.

I‚Äôm familiar bad Covid hits college students Yeah fail see people Michigan health officials said would literally kill grandma going see cases skyrocket days. Yet round mass protest somehow immune spreading virus? 200 people cause outbreak 2000+ cause concern? Also states like NY cases deaths decline recently there's slight spike. 'article' handful tweets Hey guys read Bolton‚Äôs book. That‚Äôs pretentious shit. know Donald doesn‚Äôt like mustaches, apparently cause dad one... hmmm... that‚Äôs opening repressed childhood shit right there.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* love propaganda!  Well, lot places U.S. managed contain coronavirus. states nobody took seriously places surging, unsurprisingly. sane individual would say trying ensure loses. still figuring drink water one hand  lot people China still able get home, likely decent numbers least bit. 

Add onto far lower numbers flights going (and therefore far less cargo space), restarting flights makes sense. *They teach schools!* pretty awful. one's account widely retweeted next 10 days, Shircel‚Äôs health deteriorated.

She shivered tried sleep despite piles blankets top her. Waking ‚Äúawful fever dreams,‚Äù found drenched sweat, eventually laying towels mattress absorb perspiration. lost appetite, couldn‚Äôt keep food water anyway, vomiting multiple times day.

Shircel‚Äôs primary care physician grew concerned dehydration told go emergency room.

All alone, Shircel called ambulance take UW Hospital. Doctors couldn‚Äôt much her, said. hooked IV gave anti-nausea medication releasing hours later.

Back apartment, Shircel said became weak couldn‚Äôt walk. crawled bathroom back. developed shortness breath concerned much doctor told visit ER, did.

‚ÄúI honestly felt like going die,‚Äù Shircel said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt think would make it.‚Äù

Holy shit. work western Arizona provider calls phone get history drive clinic call front office someone comes out. Takes 10 minutes I've gone shopping 4 times since put place. Today first time saw someone without mask. pulled right walked - hope someone said something him

I can't say else go else. walk restaurants always see people walking on. think place see people putting see walk like 7-11, even 80%+ wearing them. seen anything showing us dramatically higher death rate originally estimated.

For first months, tracking mortality rate Virginia, Colorado, US large. largely paired initial morbidity charts coming China. I'm basing assumptions loosely model used Ferguson/‚ÄãImperial College report, put deaths US 2.2 million 80% infection rate.

Do source assertion? I'm latah myself, let's hope keep case number down, lot people seem concerned... There's nothing wrong that, technology continuously make lives easier nicer...and one ""nicer"" aspects continue survive thrive (even 100%) still keeping pandemic bay allowing hundreds thousands people survive wouldn't.

It comes pure selfishness peoples' parts. want limit all, they're willing kill people make happen. two weeks isn‚Äôt death surge, what?  hypothetically get deleted, want *non*-hypothetically upvote you.

It's *also* daycare. name, fact. Especially dealing working-class families single parents. go rarely possible, always wear mask.
I'm good stay home least Sept., trying find remote work isolate longer.
This going much worse needs be, simply people dumb. new regulation: ""Banning consumption wild animals common practice developed countries universal need modern civilization"". ""white"" list permitted proteins: pork, chicken, beef, rabbit, fish, molluscs, lamb, donkey, duck, goose pigeon. Everything else blacklist
by correspondent FILIPPO SANTELLI
February 28, 2020
2 'of reading
BEIJING - animal coronavirus jumped man still clear, jump really took place Wuhan market. China popular outrage towards eat exotic species, possible reservoirs pathogen, maximum, authorities taking opportunity give country's stalls tables good cleaning.

Last week, leaders National Assembly, Chinese version Parliament, announced decision ban trade wild exotic animals, decision flow organic law coming months. waiting, authorities Shenzhen, metropolis far south technological center country, chosen anticipate times. new regulation presented municipality fact forbids consumption dogs cats, excludes ""white"" list even non-traditional meat snakes, turtles, frogs

Southern China known omnivorous diet. city Yulin, Guanxi, home highly criticized dog meat festival (it estimated 10 20 million specimens consumed per year country). wealthy Guangdong, province Shenzhen, far behind food oddities. reason significant first move comes there, symbolic city area.

The new regulation, public review next week, actually speak health reasons, cultural ones: ""Banning consumption wild animals common practice developed countries - says - universal need modern civilization "". confirmed fact ban also applies dogs cats, carriers pathogens coronaviruses. essence, authorities created ""white"" list proteins consumed, ie pork, chicken, beef, rabbit, fish, shellfish, lamb, donkey, duck, goose pigeon.

Everything else blacklisted, including meats considered delicacies many citizens, snake frog. Fines 250 3,000 euros foreseen pinched consume them, restaurants serving 50,000 renminbi, 6,500 euros.


In addition attracting protests animal rights activists around world, eating habits long increasingly criticized China, especially among new urban middle classes. Making decision pass modern Shenzhen much easier traditional cities, consumption exotic animals considered symbol wealth cure-all health. that, many rural communities, hunting game breeding edible species important sources income, ban threatens dry up.

Even Sars epidemic, whose incubation tank civet, Chinese government banned trade exotic species, authorize emergency over. meantime, however, country changed, attention health hygiene become priorities. messages authorities clear, seem indicate ban final. Well, space be, liked optics empty sections better spacing. means first wave could avoided humans devolving right eyes. read article, hospitals set COVID wards within ICU house COVID patients, even requiring ""intensive"" level care.  data time period never going show correlation protests cause. 

Between re-opening, memorial day fiascos, protests popping around time going next useless try separate possible origins. We're probably never going able prove disprove wide-ranging conclusion, trace back certain outbreaks possible. 

I personally still doubt protests cause spikes people handling protests outside, especially compared effect I'd expect bars indoor hotspots re-opening, I'd still doubt validity data showing sort thing unless one could eliminate known non-protest outbreaks data. cite source lack ""severe symptoms""? (How phrase *actually politicized* public issue non political way overzealous mods delete comment?)

Let's say setting example matters. appreciate public health officials demonstrate properly wear PPE wear public educate others. reminds wear it.

I suppose *hypothetically* elected public official, really well liked one-third country, set example *not* wearing PPE, could create culture people refused mask up. Yes would like put invention Coca Cola modern day internment camps border. Let's sit back really think impact reputation America more. Oh man, scary. happens system overwhelmed. Wishing best Delhi. idk country use spirometers routinely asthma self-monitoring. Mayor said enforcing mandate public speaking event tomorrow. Wrong, first read thought same.

It saying the;

SARS-CoV-2 **induced** acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) Grim. interesting. Thank you!

I think explains California, Oklahoma, Montana, Hawaii stuff. DeSantis wants avoid ICU filling up, keep businesses open.

He seems lying actual number patients ICU, number ICU beds available, counting manipulations absolutely effect actual medical epidemic.

DeSantis power actually reduce number cases. could order everyone state wear mask whenever public, near people live with.

Recent medical papers, [summarized , clear.  Mandating masks actually work reduce transmission. Masks actually prevent cases, people actually wear them.

Lying work. Lying prevent cases. keeps lying, anything might actually work, close businesses, again. Let's blame bhakts Modi BJP RSS solves problem.

Infact, public health also dependent upon states lockdown extended consultation states. main motive get ready resources overhelmed. Majority reported cases 5-7 states India big country, difficult control stupid people events (single source). 
Few positives though, high recovery rate less infection rate deaths. Wow type heartless person take make comment like this? high risk person afraid go work maybe huge commute involving subway bus work necessarily following safe guidelines stop helping get protecting perhaps loved ones well being? look money government completely wastes like power plants canceled costing $950 million, post anything online complaining that? ya screw helping high risk folks want protect themselves. governments also require pants shoes establishments Turn brain make sense aimed you, aimed people talking (and people talked said thing). wish people would honest intentions: ""I like talking people in-person I'm willing kill hundred thousand people make happen.""  young people getting infected. 

They going need hospital beds. good. need opening. /s mean doesnt love eating rhymes wussy? Well also talking March/April, may june data comes out, it'll housing prices absolute sales numbers still well below. people currently work renters market sell first place. mother listening house 2 months. 4-5 house town 15k sale.

One sold earlier town within 6 hours 10 offers.

There's nothing people around getting back money little supply paying asking.

She's trying get right around people making $$ trying see many different levels make sense once, you‚Äôre great. can't pretend problems become world's soon enough.

They allowed outside borders. Plus rate world likely come time, except countries really running death counter. Remember people mocking people saying ‚ÄúJuSt 2 WeEkS!‚Äù Well, are... Rapid result tests would work well, test kids going school everyday, isolate trace positives you‚Äôd choke fairly quickly believe. essential workers anyone else returning work we‚Äôd nip bud likely month two without lockdowns economic disaster. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs test yet though read LA times yesterday cdc bring uncooperative dragging feet testing. prefer first wave ++ appreciate point, difficult find normalized statistic takes account aspects referencing. 

I suppose experience limited Amsterdam, I've nothing disappointed many public response, plus confusing/contradictory releases RIVM beginning this. bartender work (never wears mask) asked still wearing mask.... still? told we‚Äôre 20,000 new cases day US said ‚Äúyea live charlotte it‚Äôs crazy there! that‚Äôs i‚Äôm glad got job outside city!‚Äù yea great thanks bringing charlotte town. yea great thanks. never got sick, would expect test say did? Seriously. Imagine thinking sugary drink causes obesity around world makes country great. Ooh, know, know! charge money!!! Stop spreading fake information. town Italy lost 20% population, even close. trying accomplish here? Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fucking morons. guy deserves gold medal mental gymnastics. country? Graduation right passage, it‚Äôs pandemic rules large gatherings , we‚Äôre making exceptions rule obviously pandemic must bad . Additionally without quarantine centers easily available testing. Without contract tracing woefully inadequate. ellipsis looks like "". . . "" would look place word ""c'mon"". 

Noone nonsense. talk Taiwan done far terms containing virus? accumulative total asymptomatic carrier? number published, although recorded somewhere I've seen total published April (where 6700 something). get running total one would take number add new daily asymptomatic carrier, subtract number asymptomatic carriers became confirmed cases day.

If mean number active asymptomatic carrier number published daily report. Daily recovery number also daily report. NEVER WEAR MASK MUH FREEDOMS!! I'm cool huge proportion state's population adequate access polling stations /s seriously believe COVID literally infected every single person nursing home US already? - STILL going looking 2-3 week delay massive uptick deaths current peak, March-April peak. Well cause? purchased Bayer.

Monsanto sold company right lawsuit verdict Bayer owns liability.

You know.

Because cancer. Dumbass thinking going holiday global pandamic. really think virus going go away wearing masks?

your immune system thing protect virus. Documentaries. Courses. New York possibly entering phase two news like coming out? That's early. got next gen virus last year.

How COVID19 Slim? absolutely proof herd immunity happen. never human coronavirus. antibodies fading months. agree things mentioned necessary. think context, said took masks, analyzing *gap between* needed do. thoughts exactly.

Maybe President Good Brain's plan along. fools doubt him. limited travel around state talking relatives, people acting direct function education level/political leanings specific locale, along hard locale got hit March/April infection numbers amalgam current results backdated tests well different methods brands test - don‚Äôt believe exact measurements - think day day trend noteworthy.

If follow moment, Florida official probably standing finger button hiding COVID deaths cases. That‚Äôs like tv show. systemic bias reporting cases - wherever comes - desire state government report COVID cases deaths possible, along. originally testing people come contact confirmed (tested) cases.

Anyway it‚Äôs systemic bias. it‚Äôs constant. can‚Äôt look case death number specific day say exact - say lower boundary day compare past future lower boundaries.

Anyway it‚Äôs day day movement averaged time (5-7 days) matters most. accurate assessment sure. virus. *lockdown* 

even says article 

""As lockdowns linger economies tumble, many families [are] using school closures cut marry off...."" think Arizona, Florida, Texas soon tell us whether appetite let effectively overwhelm disable hospitals

For one thing, happening. Especially Florida. Arizona up, pretty much hospitals normal capacity. Remember tent hospitals convention centers? Remember basically got disassembled? real risk India-style breakdown (which btw like 15% capacity per capita US), think governors would kept case?

The 20% hospitalization number used beginning least order magnitude. NYC saw 2% confirmed case crying loud.

The world opening going close blanket fashion way March April. I'm even argue it. I'm saying truth governors willing acknowledge. Cuomo blowing hot air talks locking NYC again. happen. way, how.

The way through. Take precautions, manage risk see fit, expect government protect you. can't, won't. know troubling think 8 million people infected case. Feel free turn page read side üëç helps blind life. eyes open instead one! Lol slowed New York state lockdown long people actually took seriously. happen places South peaking now.. Continuing make excuses peaking.. continuing make excuses need masks follow rules. 

Lol covid 19 political issue. South sees crazy reason.. apparently masses value education South. Yes, understand it. 

Alcoholism disease, yes. However DUI something anyone get. DUI puts others risk. However driver suffer often that's often. friend Corona. scary hell. would risk partying going body. guess becomes debatable since lot stopped caring Covid. grew Latah county, moved years back. Would rude ask that's anywhere near region Idaho? what's solution? Take money away community give another community *poof* systemic racism gone stop talking it? Tr*mp said x can't must libs minority doctors must racist treating white people.

Tell patients welcome go somewhere else get treated, shut way. nice, ballys sportbooks ticket i've waiting cash since feb doing* CBC seems forget still happening... dont. to. Talk. Like That‚Äôs it? serious, would probably something like 12 hundred bars lose license. mean, never said didn‚Äôt there‚Äôs many factors blame. Almost many.. True, general sales tax 6% 7% tax electricity. Massive cope. Idiots massively ignoring rules led one worst death per capita numbers world rules seemed ""unnecessary, bureaucratic belittling"", people individualistic give less shit other. half country died, half give shit. That's truth. Ty described tweets mostly people hospitalized. It‚Äôs relatively rare hospitalized COVID. Overall, still many unknowns potential immunity SAR-CoV-2 infections, including protected long protection may last. 

This important takeaway people considering. counting expecting sort herd immunity long last long last immunity virus yet research support even possible. lot misinformed people want get ""non-vulnerable"" people infected hoping mean return normal sooner smart clear evidence herd immunity possible. Spreading virus around help make things better. ain‚Äôt Dutch, ain‚Äôt much. Poor Czech Republic, nobody remembers them. remember early days Coronavirus, people countries starting learn benefits *logarithmic* plots. Maybe help open eyes zero political mention comment buddy. nice see jump conclusions. Pretty typical redditor President Trump held campaign rally Tulsa, Okla, Saturday, reportedly brought 6,200 thousand attendees¬†

Trump wishes 6mil attendees. Honestly flying US anyway, considering prevalent virus unreliable masks stopping it. way get enforced workers start suing catch work would require re-watching every single presser, I'm going to. goalposts OP spoken Fauci 4 weeks (Faucie reported)

Which lie. place Fauci reported 4 weeks.

you potentially 5 weeks spoken.

Which lie. See above. blame lack education lack empathy. Nothing change Americans better educated empathy toward other. Title say ‚Äústill doesnt protective gear pandemic‚Äù. vast majority people dying COVID past reproductive age therefore deaths don‚Äôt effect gene pool. Unfortunately, idiots age 50 statistically likely cause older person die themselves. ‚ÄúHow pregnant? never took pregnancy test!‚Äù Yes except doubt close. one Colombia linked directly official report National Institute Health. Colombian NIH shares daily report official verified twitter account.

Before begun this, worldometer didn‚Äôt link Colombia. Exactly. way misinformation spreads, gullible people believe part problem. grew always skeptical everything read knew it. guess doesn‚Äôt always translate others, sadly. countries, besides New Zealand perhaps, ""eradicated"" disease. 

Places like India Bangladesh getting ""worse"", especially India, ""acted"" fast. know that's flattening not. 

""Leadership"" red herring wide range social, economic, cultural context leading crisis shows us prepared willing population dealing crisis.

You can't ""lead"" shit like action movie. people's daily interactions. can't police peoples every move. can't lead that. people call shit people wearing masks, help others food drives programs help people mutual aid 

Not state. Amazon. Us start leveling weeks certain amount become infected.

That would herd immunity. going happen without vaccine.

Almost one wearing mask test&amp;trace failed.

When ICUs start overflow, Texas need close unfortunately. Northern Marina Islands back track seems. Hoping best Sounds like worked then? heard expert said less testing, numbers go down. Seems legit me. Ouch. Thanks....

-- American Yup. Honestly COVID-19 present there‚Äôs way I‚Äôd getting sea floating Petri dish, that‚Äôs lot people packed really close takes one person spread far wide. Look many people recently stuck sea weeks, even months, Corona first exploded? worth risk mean. comment literally said things starting look like March/April numbers

If remove NY NJ, March April numbers don‚Äôt look bad Technically already ""0 deaths"" days delayed reporting. Yah. I‚Äôm looking remote property delivery existence. Done playing rest humans except PlayStation 267 new deaths reported yesterday? stop testing like trump wants? sure irony laughter mental breakdown laughter.... (You can‚Äôt get seal N95 beard) always context issue. completely people, also SG himself.

The Surgeon General never intended ""masks work"". even clarified pretty quickly afterward. time (and tbh, still) clear issue people needed N95 medical-grade masks unable get them, people get were, wearing wrong types, wearing wrong size, maintaining hoarding them.

The comment 100% meant get higher level masks people need most. followed suit president (and apparently important people days) vented Twitter instead. course intention instantly lost blind interpretation. 

To specific:

He saw tons people hoarding wasting masks, people massively jacking prices masks, paid healthcare workers, scared lives time could find anywhere. shouted, ""STOP BUYING MASKS!"" 

That guy surely kicking hard also say end announcement, ""FOr know coming from, stop taking masks hospitals NEED right now, LOTS mask types even household materials everyone use lieu specific N95 masks."" would living better life today it. wrongfully assumed people least common sense. uses Twitter screening apparently Trump uses. 

That you, MANY others, still understand this, shows pretty clearly power immediate &amp; truncated social media consumption also politicized &amp; bipartisan media truly terrible even dire circumstances. 

And also communal lack common fucking sense. people naturally know point cover coughs &amp; sneezes contain germs hands tissues inner elbow literally anything/material all, need authority literally tell handle sort situation (being fearing sick public place) probably hope first place may well ley thing run course. essentially term coined Dutch government measures. nutshell:

- ""full"" lockdown. want go outside can, please stay home show symptoms. 
- Public gatherings banned, (youth) sport clubs etc. quickly reopened.
- Caf√©s bars, well places like barbers close (but since reopened)

Basicly: ""We need full lockdown, we're smart it"" time start see major spikes protests began. 3 day weekend spike. saw major spikes AZ, Florida, Texas week prior protests began. time expect see numbers rise. It‚Äôs fear mongering article, interested clicks He‚Äôs scumbag ring bell mommy brings pizza rolls. It‚Äôs easy guys. What‚Äôs neolib sheep *bills*? Thanks, flight worries me. We've assured flight full I'll believe see lol Yeah going interesting seeing kids across country able keep masks on, safe distance, wash hands. We‚Äôre talking particular school happens overwhelmingly white wealthy. think meant ""C'mon"". needs ellipsis since contraction ""Cum"" ""Lemon"". live SW Arizona. It‚Äôs super confusing see # positive cases news day; yet neighbor test 7 days ago still waiting results. don‚Äôt know # people tested positive day; results tests reported. 
There lot American citizens live Mexico come hospital treatment though good doctors Sonora, enough facilities treat everyone. üò¨ It‚Äôs also happening California, American citizens living Mexico go El Centro; San Diego treatment. nurses complained counting positives twice (one county border; transported another hospital another county). That‚Äôs purely speculation though. cite source?? Numbers lie, completely get that. guess feels like impending doom day. good psyche. Special ed classrooms open summer New York. Theres many major education equality issues schools closed. What's really gonna hurt ability exercise freedoms drowning lungs Remove NY NJ stats looking ""the numbers."" would've nice read new DNA times. 6 ft. like one lowest risk vacations could do. Fuck grandma good time Stockpiling testing ""working"" states, they're partnering private labs. Sounds like Arizona's conservative leadership inept can't figure partner capable labs. Yea, worried airport/ flight. get SD I'm sure I'll feel pretty safe. 

We active, healthy, hardly EVER get sick, I'm optimistic. LOL... hear from? forget /s ? Try different market? Different supply may different mix. That's dark side American individualism, exceptionalism, libertarianism. mix creates uniquely American mindset everyone knows what's best themselves, expertise mistrusted favor gut feelings, self-reliance ultimate (if only) virtue. course, there's fine line self-reliance selfishness. labor delivery, however spent 4 years ER Nurse. many friends there. Hospital works (Level 1 Trauma) whopping 4 cases currently. mean sounds like well dread stay way. Ah yes. lake ozarks party happened ago checked phone lately? Google settings. I'm curious post possible discuss given poorly filtering automatic moderation occurring sub.

Essentially, entire sub allowed discuss anything politically related even though pandemic become heavily politicized.  That's major failure sub exists discuss pandemic. don‚Äôt think yet. remember SOuth Korea little blip recovered patients tested negative later test positive again. despite positive test, found none secreting live, infectious virus. quirk rapid tests, sample low levels genetic material, whole virus. concluded recovered patients residual genetic fragments still triggered tests turn positive. individuals longer contagious. didnt get see post facts. dont try posting factual lines believe argument strongly? protest organizers encouraging people getting tested, lot wearing masks outdoors. better odds people bars restaurants maybe mask. also seeing aces close due following guidelines like Texas 12 bars close due violations. watch fact get largely ignored amongst carefully picked ""evidence"" solution masks, makes content.on sub. guys hear? gone... Nothing worry /s Germany starting see spikes again, EU countries too. think, reason see first like before. precise EU countries. 

Brazil US though... hope everyone trying responsible looking themselves. States(in US), leaders completely clueless full bad intentions. Feel flight crew new study found ‚Äúno evidence‚Äù wave protests demanding justice Black Americans contributed spikes new coronavirus cases.

Can see 'new study'? alas, smart enough eat garlic. :-D locked since March!
Going ship. read article 3-7 years ago climate change bring new dust bowl we're starting see transformation.

I'm really area really follow it.

It's really remarkable hear seems coming true. Yeah dumb, even know pre-symptomatic asymptomatic people 95% spreading virus. Every precaution helps.  touched nerve seems. definetly California definitely well think secondary infections vulnerable people. extends 4-6 weeks, - exponentially. say would get me

any number consequences.

disappeared comes mind. No? rate we're going, not? Yea New York. 80k seems like dream me. They‚Äôre part social distancing. ""The health authorities Taiwan Taiwan's CDC deserve praise. They've mounted good public health response Taiwan see numbers,"" Michael Ryan, executive director WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, said press conference headquarters What? That's punchline ""What call cat jumps pile manure?"" antiviral antibacterial. look up. JR. look PubMed. Here's one citation, many:  CFR change since larger percentage cases young people less likely die. However IFR likely stay highly concerning many still wearing masks. 120k deaths 2million plus cases virus enough convince people? many get infected rate Doesnt China travel ban? Snyder couldn‚Äôt imagine worse source information ‚ÄúPeaking‚Äù. unfortunately aren‚Äôt even close that. It‚Äôs looking like it‚Äôs going get whole lot worse gets better know, kinda get bored wfh.

This load crap. People literally idea nice now. movie ever made, piece music ever created, interactive video games, ability video chat people thousands miles away, websites browse, e-commerce get anything delivered two days, air-conditioning refrigerated goods, cars drive around interesting socially-distanced places...the list goes on.

Go cry river every person saying need open they're bored. think life like 1918 last mass pandemic? options limited reading bible around fire, sewing, tending crops. CMS massive school district, heavily overburdened layers middle managers rarely ever see student. also primarily Black Latino student populations, which, know creates much higher risks adults. 

Are planning reopen August? Quoted Stanford:

**Chu:**¬†Our studies show that,¬†if constructed properly high-quality materials,¬†a homemade cloth mask function¬†as well or¬†better surgical mask.¬†Based studies, recommends cloth mask least three layers different materials. outermost layer made fabric least somewhat water resistant. fabric combination cotton polyester, nylon rayon. middle¬†layer either a¬†polypropylene ‚Äî a¬†spunbond¬†material¬†used¬†in reusable grocery bags,¬†mattress covers¬†and¬†craft projects ‚Äî three-ply¬†disposable facial tissues like Kleenex. Finally, innermost layer wicking material draw moisture away face.¬†One hundred¬†percent¬†soft¬†cotton works well here.¬†

The masks make 100% cotton top bottom layer that's fabric have, use halyard h600 filter layer. polyester recommended fabric outer layer, makes sense. Big gap elderly 31. Right? Bothered went east side river (St. Louis metro-east, state IL, case local) grab something hardware store. Go wearing mask kid behind counter says ""aw, need here, ain't gonna kick out""... told him, ""Well, I'm going wear twice hard""  main reason discrepancy someone died, tested COVID prior death, would post-mortem test see actually died virus not. Dogs compared scum extent...so every country.

That‚Äôs becoming clearer day great works yet, im wayyyy far north see tons plates arizona new york hanging around small towns ""supposed going alaska"" stopping restaurants taking sites  


its 100% going hit candian rural towns soon, give weeks cases start popping 2nd wave already? *%#&amp; 2020! Unfortunately me, need deal stupid people daily basis ""essential"" am. 

I'd rather put goddammit mask get sick give three shits them, dont want Karen sneeze give bullshit disease, selfish sounds. he's stupid, he's evil.  going feel obligation slow spread virus worried family? Unless traveling hotspot family seriously compromised immune systems, chances parents infected anyone immediate family serious complications very, low. can't conduct controlled experiments viruses people perfectly legitimate experiment considering droplets cause spread. gospel, results held real world scenarios meta studies. 

In Boston, group 1000 people recent protest mask use extremely high tested. 1% came back positive. rate community week 2%/. 

How would design experiment? genuinely curious. issues using literal ""mask"" stop droplets blown. number hard? course not. definitely highlight importance mask use effectiveness. get excuse ready nobody ever asks excuse, can‚Äôt say excuse worked. got away excuse.

So calling ‚Äúprotest‚Äù didn‚Äôt ‚Äúwork,‚Äù never came up. live disagree completely. friends work hospitals they're telling us anything different papers say.

However, noted biggest spike cases came muay thai stadium holding fights back March.. .a stadium government ordered shut down. However, Thai army generals run stadium ignored order responsible 30-person cluster one night. course, much corruption here, swept rug quite quickly, though army relieved ownership assets result.

In country 65 million, we've 58 deaths...99% people wearing masks since march. closed everything strict curfew. new case in-country 4 weeks. wait July 4th Serious statement here.....I‚Äôm really starting care anymore GOP states responsible point feel like shrugging hospitals completely overwhelmed. feel like terrible person give trying talk sense people. don‚Äôt care anyone....not vulnerable, elderly, sick, nothing. city state opening huge restrictions help keep cases important....give businesses stability. wild irrational openings closings going cause severe economic pain adapting strict measures. businesses opened early May federal assistance go business weren‚Äôt mandatory closing public health. people don‚Äôt spend money there....the business simply fold. heart breaks stuck state leaders fellow citizens don‚Äôt care can‚Äôt anything them. It‚Äôs mentally draining live society cares little makes thankful live state believes science believes short term pain equals long term economic stability. Obesity? That‚Äôs paper saying. 

They‚Äôre saying it‚Äôs likely PRIMARY source transmission population standpoint

That article literally says kids index case households 10% time Aren‚Äôt governments requiring business make masks mandatory? case wouldn‚Äôt choice property owner no? need sterilize places massive amounts humans congregate.

Florida said testing much different demographic focusing workers high risk jobs accounting increase according them. They‚Äôre recent recent positive cases average age 30.

Kids eat pennies, least used people used coins. may eaten one Conspiracies big discussed terms hoaxes outside niche internet forums maybe, mask policy considered, would public discussion. would argue policy ineffective others it. evidence mask policies making big difference thinner think reading forum would mostly reasoned discussion.

Recently often ""well people die mostly old"". Like what? fuck decide lived long enough come conclusion lives cost less ours, wtf. Tomorrow gonna old too, let's hope next generations know better humanity is. going see deaths.

Awesome sigh relief think first steps white people take take time learn ways systemic racism affects people, take deep dive whiteness means, history whiteness America.

All night, beach till break dawn Pretty much says all. mostly blame people, ""leadership"". People choosing wear masks, go crowded indoor places without them, simply can. We'll pay price, behavior prolongs pain keeps ""getting back normal"" far future. Yes, however, everyone wear because:

1. Leaders lead example - respectable leaders know without told;
2. idea long immunity lasts (could weeks, months, years...too early tell);
3. people guess whether non-mask wearing person ""poses threat not"" - whole idea act everyone potential it;
4. related but...I also hate idea think getting decide whether wear mask not. many people ""swear it"" likely didn't. popular fair confirmed despite pandemic turning spotlight hygienic conditions so-called ""wet markets"", animals killed. happens suburbs minor tone. Activists, however, hope latest edition. BEIJING - last dog binge? Animal rights associations, also many Chinese citizens, hope so. Also year, punctual summer solstice, infamous Yulin festival begun, traditional fair held Southern China dedicated dog meat lovers, often slaughtered eaten spot. Confirmed appointment, although coronavirus pandemic turned spotlight hygienic conditions so-called ""wet markets"", markets animals killed, risk deriving consumption wild species. appointment year seems lower tone , according group activists came scene try save puppies. vendors, last year mounted stalls center, confined peripheral market, mostly meat already slaughtered cut, visitors (for now, last week) few. sign industry, although prohibited, feeling pressure public opinion authorities.

 Consumption dog meat still relatively widespread Asia, China. Yulin festival, town poor province Guanxi, become emblem practice years. event sadly known worldwide amount caged puppies sacrificed appetite thousands visitors. coronavirus epidemic, Wuhan market first major outbreak, brought traditional food practices center debate, risks transmission virus animal man. Immediately outbreak infection, Chinese authorities blocked, would seem all, trade, sale consumption wild species.

 dog among them, evidence quadrupeds constitute reservoir virus, unlike bats civet cats. breeding puppies, however, often done family structures, without hygiene health checks. consumption meat already offensive Chinese, especially new urban generations.

 Thus, wake health crisis, several authorities sent signals direction ban. Chinese Ministry Environment, although explicitly prohibiting, included dog ""pets"" category. last April metropolis Shenzhen first China officially ban sale consumption, high fines restaurateurs keep menu order it.

""According conversations meat sellers, authorities explained consumption dog meat allowed future,"" said one activists Humane Society International, animal welfare organization. ""But ban difficult, take time."" Simalarly, I‚Äôm returning first week August worried myself, terrified bringing virus home immune-compromised husband.

There‚Äôs way effectively teach language wearing mask. I‚Äôm considering asking accommodation (which governor explicitly authorized), right-to-work state, one dares tallest blade grass. Americans lazy research issues really matter?

Mandatory mask wearing gold standard, physical distancing much

Of course still sit enclosed space longer necessary, masks much air filled aerosols good alphabetizing.... Two things help experience:

- existentialism
- learning (always learning)
- humor like http://existentialcomics.com/ words calling group people include 5 years worth millennials contain 40% non mellenials ""millennials"". Maybe say 18-35 year olds without generation designation since grossly inaccurate. virus deadly. it. hottest take reached 20% parts Italy. lot rural counties Texas Florida respirators. ambulances. Hundreds miles hospitals service dozens counties. depends live. point ""argumentation"" simply test positive asked past two weeks, tell people BLM peaceful/otherwise protest 7,500 people 4 hours straight couple days ago... effective contact tracing. fact, IMO borderline criminally contact tracing.

That response framed least. Perhaps misunderstanding? 

The way read article linked though... one suggesting ignore BLM protests contact tracing. required ask question ""have BLM gatherings""? long people reason hide suppose fine. reason hide it, make news headline saying allowed ask? weird. I'll give that. sorry said non usa that's huge If.... even Los Angeles, public health officials noted acceleration cases continues may run ICU beds next month resort surge capacity. One problems trying predict resource needs infection spreads exponentially guess wrong time catch up. tsunami sickness &amp; death quickly overwhelms region's hospital system. US can't build makeshift hospitals fly hundreds doctors &amp; nurses areas moment's notice like China did. People already required organ transplants. know destroy organs point can‚Äôt recover.

Panic never good, people don‚Äôt take shit seriously playing dangerous game lives lives everyone around them. Well that‚Äôs confusing. ICU means require intensive care, maybe like...rename ‚ÄúIntensive Care Unit‚Äù /s  would get it.

You realize reason vaccine created takes 5-10 years actually develop. money priority get vaccine quickly. People altruistic view world need vaccinate stamp every disease matter cost. AFAIK always known 6ft/2m would ""good enough"" droplets, aerosols. practical limitation require keeping places like supermarkets functioning. That‚Äôs go spend day outside. People don‚Äôt go Lake Woods cabin retreat, go fish canoe. happens humans short answer. Yes. long answer really depends politics person course places lean one way other. city , policy what-so0ever. city 30 miles east, Dallas, 100% mask policy. difference political make two cities. Woosh I've read, seems growing consensus. also gives pause returning dine-in restaurants, gyms, high-rise office or, well, indoor spaces. aerosol droplets accumulating air, plexiglass dividers world help - money would better spent technology better ventilate sanitize space. 

Here's hoping clear guidance soon. worries well. vaccine available quickly, way outside normal timeline testing trials (based past vaccines late 2021). opens legitimate question skipping steps pipeline ensure safety.

God forbid vaccine side effects efficacy ‚Äúlive‚Äù found trials, given virtual nuclear weapon anti-vaxxers eroded trust science. need careful. vaccine likely least six months away. want lockdown another six months? virus 99.5% recovery rate? Here's hoping spreads like wildfire. Mostly normal stuff. Food, alcohol.

What wrong moderators there???? Florida reporting in: took day schedule test five days out. Results take 5-7 business days instead 2-4 days promised. happen know many deaths is? Beyond that, treatment general improved. know compartmentalize symptoms treat patients correctly. Something simple keeping people backs using ventilators dire circumstances helped significant way.  doesn‚Äôt matter. Young people get old people sick, young people still die virus. go back phase 0 start there‚Äôs vaccine. check article, minus Asians looks like country club social. despicable (and yet totally brand) bunch privileged rich people co-opt movement started black people inconvenienced.

So what? 

Why dont take issue people protesting middle pandemic lieu obeying lockdown socially distanced work masks might even actually productive, photos tell purely get around pandemic rules. 

Well protestors violating lockdown well. like WW2 industrial America pumping B52 bombers heavy artillery everyday.

Now trouble producing cotton swabs toilet paper. OP, perhaps car crashes contagious, whereas contagious diseases brought home parents grandparents likely higher risk children themselves.

As parent, moment kids start daycare school, parents get sick lot normal school years. escalation that. Mostly Red-ish States California  mean, unless Ohio bans travel land, sea, air states festering virus matter time plague flares again.

If smashed curve lower half country let rip, temporary celebration. prove protestors higher R0 rest population, unscientific opinion point Small droplets last hours.  cant believe people saying dont. Let guess. still think HCQ + Z-pack works prevent COVID-19. must new here.    
Wether total number numbers per capita, Sweden almost 10 deaths neighbours together. lot unplanted fields rn. also many fields whose crops rotting ground due lack value commercial marketplace. We‚Äôve also abnormally high amount dust storm activity. It‚Äôs reminiscent Dust Bowl terrifying think about. Nah today new measures rolled state government slow spread . 

The governments actions driven data hand . heard restrictions lax. Mayor Betsy Price CNN saying everything A-okay. meanwhile city county highest rates since start Pandemic.

i got thinking Rrrrrr. speak minds simply trying antagonize fellow rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr's especialy rrrrrrrrrrr chief?

We simply cannot trust honest take word . must assume thier mission supporting rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr chief , even expense health truth. sister got tested 10 day turnaround. got tested early last week won‚Äôt know Friday...

This Arizona it‚Äôs mostly young healthy people testing positive.  I‚Äôm frontline. Midwest hospital hasn‚Äôt got hit hard all. payed significant number workers slow past 2 months. 

In New York you‚Äôre probably right though. Sry sad. 

Interestingly enough hospital getting busier past weeks mostly respiratory distress patients haven‚Äôt gotten positive Covid test quite while. something going testing results. wonder meant ‚ÄúSo told people, slow testing!!!‚Äù post going unsubscibe fear mongering: get may denial. gonna die this. You. Me. brothers sisters. parents. borrowed time. question if, when. Reaper busy, number come you... Seems true Ulster County NY. shocked see asking prices around - necessarily buyers. closest neighbors turned weekend home Airbnb it‚Äôs currently rented people Brooklyn. want buy house, owners, bought 4 years ago $550,000 want million today - nice Brooklyn family spends weekends driving around looking anything affordable. Another friend sold nice home 10 acres $375,000 seven eight years ago. saw online went market $1.2 million. Insane. Looking local paper, prime listing sale decrepit farmhouse flood zone (they ad says overlooks ‚Äúmagnificent beaver pond‚Äù LOL) listed $425,000, bad guess, even considering beaver pond, it‚Äôs prime listing paper, it‚Äôs listing, pretty unusual. easy dont go Florida ... Yes, thanks!!!! technically possible large group people given number tests process day. nasal swab saliva?  Literally make mask scrap fabric. couldn‚Äôt imagine many people poor can‚Äôt afford scrap fabric mask. People wear clothes, right? case though government find way get cloth mask everyone afford one, agree likely wear masks, disobey laws act public ?

A. 18-25 year old generation Z.

B. 26-40 year old millennials.   Yep. mom refused course, well-liked there. can‚Äôt say people sick aren‚Äôt working. exact opposite come from. place like ghost town Saturday afternoon. 'Nice sunny day, shops open, 'just one interested. would say 10% amount people would see shopping sunny day June 2019 about. it'll back Nothing's foolproof, seems safe still seeing family. 

I mean, we're point make choices acceptable levels risk. people going go years without seeing families, managing risk level live with. I'd surprised attitudes budged went million deaths TBH. 


For reason, people America need scary visual they're attacked they'll take action. Look numbers US cities see increase Memorial Day now. New York Philly prime examples

These areas trending downward matter months, there's something else top re-openings protests that's going here. Us knowing mean draw conclusion protests affect case Seattle even study people tested site

This two weeks protests started, Washington (two weeks that) reporting bump. incomplete epidemiologists healthcare experts say minimal impact

The source article either, NBES, take will: crux paper cities overall increase social distancing behavior even protests added in, tbh surprising, know single protest that's actively courting people come even sick. I'm sure cut dry conclusion.

EDIT: think it, crux argument social distancing increased protests got underway, people increasing social distancing result memorial day re-openings fear spike could lumped data set.  employers pay living wage, eliminates incentive hire illegal immigrants. Americans refuse job pay employers willing pay, raised wages could hire Americans worry illegality hiring. absolutely don't. Despite enormous amount cases United States, still, less 10% population encountered virus. Without vaccine, number could easily reach 70% crowd immunity really takes over. Imagine 7 times many deaths now, U.S. leadership absolutely idea many lives lost virus. Found full time desantis staffer Haha, thanks blowing expectations amazing tale. Conmercial meats terrible, us can't start hunting meat. Also wild game high amino acid called histamine (histadine) many people like allergy issues cannot eat meat wild game, although bird hunt one time able consume meat birds time. get saying plenty airlines selling 60% seats requiring masks know babies don‚Äôt object permanence? play peek-a-boo really think you‚Äôve disappeared?

Trump baby one covering virus. can‚Äôt see it, it‚Äôs gone! said brother üíØüíØüíØüíØ They're going close many people either care think hoax. We're screwed won‚Äôt, it‚Äôs far cringe. say UF rolled massive testing initiative testing residents - exposed not. cohort negative co residents.

ETA: 970+ residents fellows UF across Gainesville Jacksonville campuses. Idiots idiots. I‚Äôm one florida teachers better believe won‚Äôt going back Hahaha Hell, ask patient they'd like bleach injection. customer's always right. :P expect increases Texas Florida cases dip (at least) little, they're starting least publicize social distancing measures, close restaurants worst affected areas.

Arizona. IDK. per capita cases skyrocketing, they're implementing measures degree. Considering plenty airports already require masks think I'm good sounds like grandparent lied parents

ok upset hobbits wizards dwarf's required skills list. Troll's need apply. know weren‚Äôt asymptomatic people infected? people protest seem young likely asymptomatic. easily spread people weren‚Äôt protesting. protests perfect asymptomatic spread. dumb fuck, med/surg beds greatly outnumber ICU beds. LOL! Subtle burn. Love it. certainly would problem that. know people would though, unfortunately. Danish doctors said second wave might coming work purposes is, brother law custodian summer busy painting, renovating he's wearing mask day uncomfortable.

It‚Äôs real money win. Hospitalizations entire country pretty useless metric hospitals certain areas get overwhelmed, giant hospital middle US.  talking farm field field laborer wages risen nearly 50% since 1996.*

*Some farmers even giving laborers benefits normally reserved white-collar professionals, like 401(k) plans, health insurance, subsidized housing profit-sharing bonuses.*

*But raises new perks tempted native-born Americans leave day jobs fields. Nine 10 agriculture workers California still foreign born, half undocumented.*

*Napa County pays farmworkers $41,940 year (about $20 /hr)*

*But Silverado, farm labor contracting company Napa, never white, American-born person take entry-level gig, even company increased hourly wages $4 minimum. Silverado far unique.*

*‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need deep analysis understand farm work wouldn‚Äôt attractive young Americans,‚Äù says Martin, agriculture expert.*

I epert topic read different reliable sourves nobody ever said solution. per capita basis US employing control strategies tamped testing contact tracing would possible reopen/leave home adequately contain outbreaks. \*shall not\* inbreds? Yes, driving long list rules, regulations requirements. people die convenience motor vehicles. 

So tell me, happens go highway drunk without valid driver's license? Well, there's legal punishment. God forbid kill somebody negligently. looking real potential felony. follow rules there's accident somebody dies, tragic happen. 

So happens take Covid test think might positive, go yoga studio string bars without wearing face mask one woman town did? Well, nothing apparently. least one business put permanently business close yet awaiting tests deep cleaning. afford it. 

That's point making dichotomy. looked driving, established set expectations requirements minimize deaths accidents, consequences failing follow them. 

Extending analogy, reasonable person saying everything shut forever. science understand mass adherence mask wearing practices limited inside capacity greatly reduce threat transmission. vast majority US nothing it. 

If everything could reasonably society people still got sick died, we'd totally different discussion one we're country. egregious disregard situation everybody upset. Stop literal caricature entitled, dumb jock. one who's life put hold here, kid. ‚ÄúOther people bad can‚Äôt complain ‚Äú used live Kennewick. doesn‚Äôt good news ever come town? find sad thread end getting locked politics intertwined spread covid-19 USA can't really talk even though leadership top-down decisions real life death implications.  protests may caused increase, large enough increase ""stand out"" clearly transmission paths occurring time period. think Qatar government handle justly wrong. due process Qatar population. People celebrating government ""health"" edict government routinely allows migrant workers starve death, provide adequate food, water, housing medical services essentially slave population. 

This ""mask"" story popular politically relevant situation US. entirely ignores context edict like enforced. No, aren‚Äôt wrong. ask reduce risk Covid-19, tell us best way that. can‚Äôt answer bigger questions us like ‚Äúis worth it?‚Äù

It like abstinence form mitigating STD risks. Yes, totally effective, STDs aren‚Äôt thing life care about, many things care don‚Äôt involve zero risk getting STD, weigh out. Scientists experts can‚Äôt help make sorts calls. feel neutral part. actually good bond get closer.... 

Why assume worst? Well, East Asian standards.

And also Korea standard, since chief CDC said according article. 

Why misleading Korea talk using standard? Vietnam one domestic new case, would totally declare wave 3. desensitized see thousands new cases everyday US. slight buffer bank account thing keeping going full meltdown, CARE unemployment stimulus runs we'll still able pay rent month two. Please treat like everyone extra mad money save. What‚Äôs username about? Reason ask I‚Äôm Buffalo. 

If think comment wasn‚Äôt directed sub well, made clear Yes, Texans much like Tennesseans allergic sanity science. mask requirements yet put forth local walmart city. City council meeting Wednesday decide I'm guessing no. focused business, money. outbreak started places closing wanted launch ad campaign saying ""come quarantine [city name]"". I‚Äôm happy sit room play video games 12 hours day without bothering anyone. getting shit bullies school.

It‚Äôs empty happy, though. Can‚Äôt distract watching world burn...with people something it. Yeah, downtown pretty hit miss I've seen. Also many people wearing masks incorrectly... NOVA (Northern Virginia) pretty good comes masks, least city. No, we've killed em all. Sedgwick Kansas. 2.5 hours, 100k population differences two counties. idea numbers counted, county test ran person lives? NEW CASES. Well think MO still ""If test positive, regardless old are, quarantine test negative"", no? know that's assuming lot, think fair make seem like spreading rapidly via young people nobody getting tested; that's average age come much, surely. Yes, Amazon dirty.  know pathetic need justify murdering criminals? Well month ago closed ment evidenced New Zealand's success, could absolutely go somewhere close borders introduce strict lockdown procedures. America that. banned before? got banned February still waiting get restored. mod subreddit ridiculous. one get unbanned? 0.2% fatal counts minutely. This, coupled fact less 1500 fatalities Canada experienced people without pre-existing conditions kind. know getting past confirmation bias hard, people prefer sticking whatever believed made afraid, unfortunately doesn‚Äôt make true despite overwhelming evidence contrary. government untrustworthy absolutely power tripping failure.

Shared air handling enclosed building big cause spreading events.

One worker got half floor infected. One person sitting front AC vent got half restaurant sick. 

Airhandling/circulation huge spreader. Ok... get virus... pass healthy parents... worries... y‚Äôall will
 fine... parents go work... get fellow employees sick... employees get friends family sick... bet kid... I‚Äôm sure see works... that‚Äôs infections spread family... hundreds kids families.... 5-4 season want bad, could cost lives. one beach

more like parking spots available near beach... least that's Florida friends told last week. :( Yesterday Sunday it‚Äôs helpful look single day anyway. Worldometers showing 7 day average 627 daily deaths. feel 9-11 equivalent every work week?  

Also, looks like bar/restaurant sales well travel/tourism recovered people staying home usual ‚Äî even places open. returned normal levels interaction spread. 

And looked Sweden‚Äôs death toll? never locked chasing towards Italian levels moment. 

I think many people taken step back looked current numbers, something worry about. Thanks know it. I've getting trolled TN day FB people saying die wearing mask. offense, see Floridians much different. gonna along summer, boys! Cool. Can‚Äôt wait diametrically opposite article tomorrow. Every 60 seconds Africa minute passes Depends. 

America likes pretend cares mom pop businesses, know fed's real interests megacorps like Walmart, Amazon, etc. probably accounts seeing deceasing deaths increasing cases. say ""no vaccine ever long-term side effects."" 


He said specific vaccines already tested long-term side effects. Pandemrix one vaccines. mean, mass graves Middle East, trucks upon trucks corpses Italy, Chinese welding citizens apartments. 

Most planet already hard way.

But sure, wait finding hoax little longer.  offense, research scientist sub might worst COVID subs comes people researching shit parroting hear echo chamber. busy giving cops sick ass military gear they‚Äôre ill trained handling. like someone writes ""$25 dollars""  mean ""feel"" theyre right must be. numbers work! Yeah shit people act like disappeared suddenly Got mine Amazon.

Haven't experienced side effects,  Florida look homeschooling. need risk child's long term health complications like Multisystem inflammatory syndrome Troll bot? idiot? Texas people wearing masks people are. Easily. probably 3 non-mask wearers every 1 mask wearer tell, obviously anecdotal honest God terrifying. sucking China‚Äôs tits first. question. Also AZ local Walmarts require mask get in. much management cares Walmart determine strict are. reckon masks around necks needed wearing get in, immediately take half sight employees. get approached manager slip back on. Wear mask, bot. like white house AC shares air. Nosiree... literally zero proof that. pretty good wearing masks public Springfield too.

Maybe south Springfield. live work north side often feel like person wearing mask. Seems fact 2 meters proven actually far enough, could possibly go wrong? highly doubt specialized case illustrated would impact ICU admission statistics. COVID patients stay ICU days average. can't say certain counted COVID death. Hospitalizations... maybe, really matter point discharged quickly? Closer killing them.

Just kidding. kids good crap dealing last 3 months. 9 yr old son getting somewhat depressed sports camps cancelled look good fall. easy right insane.

That's whenever go road trips I'm always amazed people totally cool love living middle absolute NOWHERE. 

I it. need conveniences stores nearby. late doomers sub need long continue predict apocalypse. include TABC shutting bars violating coronavirus social distancing policies, river parks shutting due overcrowding, increasing testing ""hotspot areas"", working hospitals encouraging people wear masks public.

Shutting river parks new, although we're also opening theme parks.

Enforcing rules already place.

""Working hospitals"" (?!?), increasing testing, encouraging people wear masks... things supposed happening already.

None plan.  back Catholic Church three months. Bishop gave dispensations attending even though I'm younger still shudder thought either catching getting anyone else sick. It‚Äôs record bc it‚Äôs still new delayed first spike makes sense. Title say ‚Äúas predicted‚Äù. wife immunosuppressants MS, evidence certain immunosuppressants actually beneficial get COVID may prevent cytocine (so?) storm. But, depends one on. wife Ocrevus depletes B cells cells. taken lessons New Jersey.  beginning outbreak till mid May could get tested showed symptoms. turning people away ‚Äúmay exposed‚Äù cause didn‚Äôt enough tests. would think states would say ‚ÄúDamn, prepare, stock tests, PPE, clear decks prepare case comes.‚Äù Nope, stuck head said pretended didn‚Äôt exist. Poor leadership. Send kids back school pandemic? great idea! Next day's headline: Big Al's closed. easy argue privileged ivory tower, really wants systematic break society one work. ever seen uneducated person get angry? give person gun, make kids go hungry. think happens next? smallest droplets always stay airborne regardless air conditioning. larger droplets usually fall ground quickly air conditioning keeps airborne longer. think people realize medicaid many states US essentially give free healthcare income certain amount.

I pretend expert here, anecdotally, partner medicaid wisdom teeth removed, two MRIs, x-ray, prescriptions, even dozen physical therapy sessions pay $18/month whatever costs (it genuinely low cost).

Now, I'm saying think US healthcare system great, think absolutely fucking ridiculous public healthcare. However, typically SOL can't afford private insurance lose job - cases rare reddit would lead believe. Mask=freedom

My kid gets go summer camp next week masks, everyone, everywhere wearing them. Governor Lee atrocious. High school football fall.

Good cruel joke. Aren‚Äôt see face masks accessibility purposes? Could join others lobby them? course is. Ever since read Lewis Clark expedition accounts dog meat preferred meal American explorers, curious. 

How taste? worth it? Vanity, scared looking weak President's case, copying president they're brown-nosing sycophants cases. Dry air isn‚Äôt safe. droplets float air longer periods dry air dried out, therefore smaller. That's like saying good fire department saved water fighting fire water later instead putting early. 

We contained SARS MERS effective testing contract testing front minimal deaths cases. could done time, apparently successful last couple times means wrong time. like mom getting aunts together woo toddler something used think that. pastor tried suing California made way Supreme Court (only lose 5-4) keeps saying interviews close family members affected die, still pushing open churches asap. Money weird things people. Wear mask. Duh wow, arizona.. texas? wya

&amp;#x200B;

edit: florida? afraid normal cycles life something deeply cultural shared across many demographics. It‚Äôs machismo. media specifically? see CNN/MSNBC/local news Chicago telling people wear masks?

The media broad. Please specify. wear mask 8 hours day people can‚Äôt even keep door register. epileptic jack russell terrier self control Americans... Go üá¨üáß Deaths lag, testing finds mild cases, better treatment, stop like answer Bars losing liquor licensing failing enforce social distancing. fake news needs stop. numbers look wrong maybe wrong. wait weeks. Touristic areas Spain going disaster zone. :-p system, stupid headline egregiously singles Google (it‚Äôs Google/Apple partnership), Does. Not. Track. white papers clearly openly state entire system works. 

Please don‚Äôt conflate system everything else hardware cell towers apps do.  That's absolutely terrifying that.  

If medicine, happen know USA COVID cases high....but deaths low lately? back forth forever noticed too. Maybe virus mortal thought maybe medical practice efficient? Another option new cases mostly younger people. see broken ways here. 2,777 positive swabs collected last Monday. number increasing every day week results come in. 155 positive swabs collected yesterday, that's many yesterday's swabs already resulted reported state.  21 Million dead human beings minuscule number, represents huge loss human life. Oh long get shots friends worth it? Fuck Definitely surpassing 30k Monday first time forever. Time leaders US admit flawed logic implement enforceable regulations mitigate spread. It‚Äôs large droplets stay airborne it‚Äôs smallest droplets. Large one float ground faster. cases hospitalizations going roof, yet certainty That's reason. Recycling earlier comment mind:

1. know virus getting better treating it. Early on, believed critically ill patients needed intubated, thought giving nasal oxygen would spread virus throughout hospital. turned case. Intubation major procedure increased chance death.

2. We've learned people lie bellies helps, used well help patients. assume breakthroughs can't name top head.

3. lag time cases deaths couple weeks, spike cases reflected death count bit.

4. past month--up past days--the overall rate people diagnosed holding steady, though overall rate positive tests dropping. indicates number due wider availability tests, meaning tests catching higher percentage people disease, cohort much less sick first wave March, serious cases could get tested.

5. Many vulnerable people still taking precautions, whereas greater percentage people getting virus younger people going bars.

However, past week we've seen big spikes number states, along higher percentage positive tests. again, we're hearing shortage tests Arizona. indicates re-opening, virus starting spread exponentially number places, probably see different outcome first wave (because testing still catching higher percentage cases back medical interventions improving), states roll back openings, impose face mask laws, take actions bend curve, even lower death rate per case, we'll still see medical systems overwhelmed weeks. e) Round Chinese-Americans forced quarantine. cramped quarters result cluster respond saved good Texans China flu.

f) Make poor available liability-free testing experimental medications/vaccines else lose benefits turn **may** infected



I'll leave sentence read slowly. live Amsterdam since June see much less social distancing. saw full cafe (inside) lots terraces groups sitting closely together. 

I believe latter fine though. think Maurice de Hond onto something (the research collected): cancel big badly ventilated inside events humidity around 3 6 g/kg superspread events via aerosols someone high viral load, would managed.

I know people take rules seriously (almost religiously, ""with lust bordering pathological"") shake hands know others think harm good hug. You‚Äôre one can‚Äôt read must asking ""Was I, contact people?"" 
Well... May odds ever favour. interesting study, huge caveat.

C. Drostens group found 40 percent healthy ppl history Covid t-cells reacting different viral proteins. Another study found 60%.

Drosten's group hypothesized pre-formed t-cell immunity cross reaction past HCoV infection maybe explain varying disease course.

The problem study samples before, mistake authors.
But limits deduced study, could thin air measure cross-reactivity T-cells. seriously going sit scratching heads pretending baffled spikes infections rates? really dumb naive watch hundreds thousands people protest every city US, social distancing, rarely wearing masks (properly) name Social Justice, pretend understand spike infection? ACTUAL FUCK?? Asymptomatic carrier varying viral load depends close date infection. reckon load enough infect kitchen worker return Beijing enough induce positive test kitchen worker discovered infected. live Shelby County? cost living really low compared areas. City Memphis low cost living size. Everyone know got put unemployment, many still collecting, getting 800 week. made less going unemployment. Literally people hoping get laid here. work full time net 500 week taxes insurance come out. don‚Äôt know anyone financial fear, prior Covid19 lived constant state financial fear. Come sand, surf, Covid-19! article pointing US whole declining daily new cases, areas seeing opposite. Texas steadily increasing new cases, hospitalizations, deaths since June 1st. Yes  yes young adults move back become intergenerational home. That's case lot people know. Seems safer beef pork, COVID-19 standpoint, given 1026 confirmed infected German meatpacking plant, 1031 confirmed infected Tyson pork plant. 

People like meat, nobody wants know sausage gets made. like meat magically turns plastic-wrapped cut styrofoam tray. 

Perhaps time everyone look is, step back cultural stereotyping. OSHA something say this... beautiful place yes environmental issues, due gold mining. [not getting think it‚Äôs one many factors, yes people working home getting full pay cash govt stimulus. really crazy people don‚Äôt care. i‚Äôve seen people pull masks chat, lean around plexiglass shields hear cashier/workers better, pull masks unlock phones, etc. that‚Äôs ones actually bother wear mask first place. Yay springbreak people cancel trips

Never said all. airlines, one point, every seat. ones enact, legislated enact point, need take personal responsibility.

My issue statement, put inside conversation specifically, personal responsibility sole mechanism play here. Air travelers, coronavirus conducive conditions, spread corona cities infect people choose go planes. person apartment complex measures personal responsibility decides fly country fun... put risk. Even decide fly.

Packed planes literally spread disease country. people charge different things, could lessen spread. That's I'm trying say. personal opinion: maybe try lessen spread...?

It's amazing bent pretzel people get simply pointing basic mechanics. Packed planes spread shit, spread people planes. Guild whatever ""it's risk!"" freakouts want, doesnt change literal physics situation. dont know boil further. quickly removed January 2020, can't write tell-all books become whistle-blowers they're dead. dumbass governors states blame probably read article. Non American here. Louisiana staying stage 2. exactly stage 2 state? What's open vs not? guidelines currently open? 

For record, think great governor willing push back next phase save peoples lives. pandemic still going going next year. New information become available fall winter. impact new seasons transmission still unknowable. decisions spend money made now, would mean make decisions without relevant information available. 

The fact they've already spent half money 3 months (imo) 2-year pandemic already quite heavy front end. so, idiot? USA COVID cases high......but deaths low? worry, He'll back üòÇ So... plan? Maybe missed part. heard was, continue open businesses. Holy shit you‚Äôre dumb Yeah. There‚Äôs villain like guy saved us Nazis. People restaurants cracking windows every hour several minutes even means can‚Äôt maintain comfortable temperature spend air conditioning heating. important. That‚Äôs insane! Ontario, Canada population double Arizona‚Äôs, testing double, we‚Äôre less 200 cases day. 6,000 people, indoors, majority weren‚Äôt wearing masks. goes without saying people gonna get sick. Enjoy win professor goes heat humidity loophole. Yeah. point governors relatively influential (5% more,) terms social distancing compliance. going take 6-7 days see, surprised Texas' growth rate tips least somewhat, based statements. similar London Blitz spirit. ones survived going shelters middle night, ones said f it, die tonight die bed, people ended dying. end Blitz, people started interviewing reporting earnest, ones survived tell tale dutiful ones kept vigilant. ones decided sleep beds got fed nights days interrupted bombs sirens. C. above. Actually opposite likely true. still financial incentive label death ""COVID19"" hospitals. needed, wont happen. Masks solution let politicians keep economy open, people wearing them. commented thing! reminds me, ? fact even feasibly shows privileged position you‚Äôre in. people won‚Äôt choice. People selfish children. Meanwhile Canada sore shoulder hard fall snowboarding. Went doctor, got checked out. sent ultrasound make sure didnt rotator cuff tear. sent physio, thing employer insurance pay physio, co-pay.

The doctors visit ultrasound entirely covered government health coverage. even nickel charged. fair, testing increased positive cases identified increase official figures thereby making official picture look worse. orange dummy trying say. keep figures rising quickly paper bu testing sell dummies good job saving like hero read past headline. Everything else team's fault whatever loser loved last week, hates probably pointed something made insecure like child is. politics right/wrong competition making whatever way better everyone else everyone else suck it. spread virus adding problem period. spread virus contributing problem. There's way insure catch spread virus. next best thing least awear risks taking. choose travel, less selfish mindset. I'm surprised see going on. live Central Illinois testing site drive absolutely packed month ago long line cars stretching onto road around corner. drive I'm sure still open since rarely see even one car waiting. assumed like everywhere people bothering getting test anymore. feel bad professionals going stuck trying help people don‚Äôt want help. He's spreading wild misinformation post. Fuckstick mods allow article comments actually talk content. family Texas, surprised hear one got snide remark police official store. said ‚Äúpolitical statement‚Äù breath saw mask on. am, it‚Äôs perfectly normal wearing mask, hear thing jarring.

I dislike recommended safety precaution associated something silly. would like getting boxed political party wear seatbelt. much SARS 1 similar Covid-19, doctors aren‚Äôt treating respiratory disorder anymore finding blood clotting disorder/blood vessel disorder affect every organ body. imo idk that‚Äôs solid argument. time I‚Äôm saying wrong either, two cents. Nuh uh, coronavirus hoax, stopped *testing* much, numbers would go down, left trying bring perfect president!

/ going retort scientific facts realize....It‚Äôs worth effort. It‚Äôs like trying convince someone decided Earth flat doubts motives telling otherwise.

Even Sweden hits 6000 dead, big second wave neighbouring countries, vaccine delivered Sweden‚Äôs reputation economy takes significant hit... still hold theory. change parameters success go along, always doubt evidence short time machine alternate universe. sounds like ruse given history administration.  impeached one going intermingle diseased rabble (everyone him). simply rally anti-everything sensible base. ""  April 6, state started reporting number patients positive tests hospitalized. 1,153 day 3,711 June 22. data account people hospitalized gotten positive test. ""

If hospital stays average 7 days time get test back 14 days., reported rate hospitalization 0.

The real number number certain level severity illness (I would suggest severity breathing distress, pain, discomfort, disturbed sleep), number persisting disability (inability comfortably drive, normal household tasks). NY antibody study showed undercounted 10x. agree though cases probably 2-3x confirming right now. particular building, might actually good move.... r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd r‚ìîd Since one reading hospitals located COVID-19 wards within intensive-care units reporting COVID-19 patients ICU patients.

In cases covid negative patient exact pneumonia symptoms covid positive patient would ICU. They're asking break reporting since people technically ""need"" ICU, placed safety.

Or go headline reputable get pitchforks DeSantis. even finished first wave yet? makes sense (so long enough ICU beds spare). seems safer staff non COVID patients. feel bad rural America... Decades voting competent government going fuck real hard next year spreads. know hit read someone explained FART make underwear pants hits nose, virus definitely make mask! 

But jokes aside wearing mask universally proper thing right now. understand it‚Äôs wildly uncomfortable especially heat. lot people really stopped caring long time ago. testing mild cases sure. average age infected people Florida went like 65 37. overwhelming majority people testing positive experience anything feeling like shit couple days. Let‚Äôs get bigoted. Keep civil. don‚Äôt know anything citizenship waistline. Attack ideas people.

See something wrong math come back. 

The average age someone killed car crash 38. 38 40.37 years lifespan left according actuary tables. average age someone dying Covid-19 78-81. Let‚Äôs use 79. 79, average lifespan left 8.82 however, unlike car crashes, Covid-19 typically kills co-morbidities wouldn‚Äôt typically lifespan others cohort. Conservatively, say average 79 year old died Covid-19 4 years life left average. Covid-19 death represents ten times less effect overall average lifespan typical motor vehicle accident death. threat average lifespan motor vehicle accidents, death count Covid-19 would ten times higher. isn‚Äôt likely year‚Äôs end. Would happen one looking one Please much vitamin D! Covid19 gets you, could difference life death. Wishing good health! brains handle much ‚Äòcrisis‚Äô, eventually cope downplaying compartmentalism get back normal.

""So said people, *slow testing down*, *please*"" Good! working (middle lower) class expected spend money pandemic jobs risk 401ks jeopardy!

Why responsibility risk losing everything prop economy. responsibility risk losing everything (aka ultra-wealthy). 

Before COVID, wife budget allowed monthly spending certain categories (for example, entertainment dining-out, etc). 

When started, decided completely slash categories budget instead adding straight savings. 

We shared budget $150/mo entertainment $100 dining (included things like coffee there, too). 

Now, cut shared budget $50/mo (Netflix comes this) allow bit buy book art supplies, etc. budget. 

I honestly think completely permanently alter spending habits. already care buying things anymore (I've completely lost interest spending money video games plan spend $0 Steam summer sale). 

We saving 250% month before, kind addicting. 

Will probably continue mindset past COVID. 

I hope others follow suit. true me. Silver lining Most* Americans.

Happy? global public good mean exactly? mean it‚Äôll free extremely low cost? nasopharyngeal Germany starting see spikes again,

Germany ""spike"". people one day one meat packing plant. rest country fine, thank much, yes wear masks go shopping. people getting sick Alaska? northern territories Canada least affected part county... I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get obliterated this, number really 0.28%, yes, big-picture perspective, think bars nightclubs worth 0.28% world dying. Bars nightclubs contribute greatly extroverts‚Äô quality life, planet literally already strain overpopulation. 0.28% minuscule number, even half percent?


(However I‚Äôm conservative anti-masker, anti-lockdowner. follow local laws guidelines. goddamn miss nightclubs) need workers, Americans want thankless, merciless, low-wage jobs. want here, willing come jobs terms.

Why also need treat like criminals third-rate citizens? can't regulate work migration, offer social protections everyone else enjoys?

Not ask unwanted jobs, make live fear, threaten sic authorities them. over-worked, abused bosses criminals, enjoy gov benefits. even basic protection afforded law / police. subject theft, extortion, rape, recourse whatsoever.

The reflection greatness way treat less fortunate. people hard workers carry weight most. We'll never give recognition respect deserve, could start basic minimum treat members society. here.

At end 3-4 weeks peak cases, deaths rise.

We see death toll rise again. shut first place, sudden surge hospitalized patients huge problem. Florida already running beds. really. Boomers actually remember something called ""Generation X"" children belonged it. comments obvious sarcasm. points wrong

1.	Vaccine distribution massively subsidized world governments
2.	One study questionable methodology saying antibodies can‚Äôt detected 3 months mean long term immunity graduate high school . thought seeing headline. becoming almost common (Florida,Texas, Arizona, California, Brazil) set new case records headlines. Long term disability lung function strokes? we're telling young, healthy people now? reality is, overwhelming majority cases severe majority severe even manifest symptoms. argument massively flawed. ""care vehicle deaths Covid"". ""yes people die every day literal pandemic killing many people need die numbers easily reduced simple measures"". presenting absolutely false dichotomy. 

And, said first time, years lives lost. huge growing body evidence even mild cases end severe lingering damage complications. death rate 0.5% (to use number) rate lifelong complications 5%, there's severe secondary societal effect. 

Not mention complications may experience markedly shorter lives. well think previously healthy 35 year old going next flu season catch mild case Covid permanent lung damage? people found diabetes result disease? People may need dialysis? 

Death perfect trouble-free recovery two options here. That‚Äôs easy say it‚Äôs livelihood that‚Äôs affected.

Also people wearing masks since can't enforce it. also seen migration homeless destitute individuals everywhere. increase per se migrating even before. Exactly! get tested fine. doubt we‚Äôll see another major lockdown US. Thank you. *DID HONESTLY FUCKING THINK BEAT?* Traffic returned normal. social media feed returned normal. Massive amounts crowds protests.

It's gamble would take purpose. I'll wear mask keep distance. state respectable Yep, I've got family believes this. think little cold give shit get give someone else. US control 

until World control U.S. trending towards 30k+/day cases, towards 500 deaths/day. 

I hear testing up, positivity rate also up.

Is big death wave impending, deaths under-reported misreported, cases less fatal now?  Ya even survivors know we‚Äôve seen lasting damage I‚Äôm looking forward twenty years large swaths population COPD, MCI, etc. Larry Kudlow doesnt know jack shit anything roundly ignored. Go back look predictions year alone plainly see idea going care. needs STFU BUTTON worse even DJT! Corruption rampant WDC ! Here's Florida's Differences noticed: California

I think California's increased cases mostly increased testing, hospitalization rates match cases increase (even 2 week lag). LOL, no. US President legal authority. 50 State Governors do, law. Hahahahahahahaha said get unemployment Florida!  

If aware look up, unemployment criminally broken I‚Äôm lazy find article, basically virus seems thrive cold environments, yippee winter... oh jebus... 

You also include meat packing plant Alberta (Cargill) Would recommend 7 day rolling average, flattening daily deaths number positives clearly uptick.

 
  


 No, dude. Running around quarantine threatening public officials criminal offenses.

This nothing childish. imagine many cases must really have. Good info, thank There, there. isnt total amount funding go towards like first 14 billion

When/if evidence exists support claim, change viewpoint. there's going another $25billion every 3 months (for next 2 years), agree makes sense spend $25billion every 3 months. take political loss death though, maybe even legal loss eventually. good options. least worst option lockdown. lets pretend icu bed numbers people put beds available. basically creates doubt collected data. It‚Äôs tactic anti intellectuals use ignore reality. That‚Äôs terrifying. feel people opinion whether opening schools good kids bad idea kids. However going issues open schools. seen sports past week, postive cases schools may need shut time time. There's kids schools, there's janitors, teachers, conselors, librarian, office area, principal. positions could people well 60s high risk. thing may happen, even though kids teens ok 99.95% time, may bring spread disease home parents guardians. There's reason fall worries me. cooler outside school back. Awesome username, please attempt 69 eating kimchi  everyday cars. kid wayyy likely get killed passenger car likely die COVID contract it. kids talking about. reward outweighs risk. Actually that's longer recommended due potential Click bate....this event happened may 8th.... Old news repackaged attention Yeah hospitals country collapsed. Carry fear circle jerk. know live world everyone lockdown forever saves 1 life. Except totally can. US States lot autonomy provinces in, say, France countries. theory, US EU sort thing, independent State joined Federal compact. fair point, hospitals get overwhelmed make difference people left untreated. Sorry loss   using single example overrule multiple counter-examples, provide ""why"" Netherlands pulled off, falsely accusing cherry-picking, guilty confirmation bias confirms belief masks...so yeah, context conversation, useless. site that's got graph daily growth? headline alarming, article purposely skews numbers order way. course number cases increases people tested.

This still developing, unpredictable event, without much precedence go by.

There incorrect predictions happen when, correct predictions.

For example: Georgia started reopening things April 24th, much fear outrage. ""Georgia full zombies two weeks,"" everyone said. accounts, seemed like fair response inevitable outcome. are, two months later, hospitals fine. system collapsed. obviously many factors play fully understand.

What *is* apparent, taking social distancing seriously probably flatten curve reduced pressure healthcare providers, supposed to.

We coming worst look critical cases fatalities, flies face every doomsday prediction month two ago.

Yes, hills valleys, results could based million different factors (one predictable factors raw number tests). need remain vigilant protect vulnerable people conserve healthcare resources.

But necessarily mean everyone needs locked away homes right now.

Every one saying ""see, red states dumb""... exactly expect? think point social distancing *is*?
 (Hint: protect healthcare resources treat sick people.) 

Is specific number would satisfy you, agree start relaxing restrictions? scientists saying 4 days memorial day weekend wouldnt effect... remember getting downvoted saying seemed bit early both. Abbott blaming now? Oh yeah.. protestors, young people keeping everything open cdc estimates 40 million people far US, unreasonable guess good way it. going get money back anyway. definitely difference number physical beds beds actually staffed. hospital may 30 ICU beds nursing 20 them. That‚Äôs part issue surge capacity. It‚Äôs physical capacity don‚Äôt know actual functioning beds. Lots folks getting real lesson exponential growth right we‚Äôre getting started. tried nothing we‚Äôre ideas! Freedumb*

Fixed ya Scam artist Philly New York haven‚Äôt actually open long. first protest Philly day moved yellow phase (and locked even harder usual week due stores closing curfew). COVID causes kidney dysfunction lot cases people severely? Financially many schools collapse without football. Akin Murder(s). study review process short cut little due urgency situation. change fact treatments show promise adopted death rates falling result. Studies pre release finals found r/COVI19 interested time look medical terms understand medical professional. 

It take time others verify actually happening treatments like would happen cases, given situation lot trial testing treatments going on. find something think works share info much, much earlier would normal. may 1/10 population, barely 100 000 cases guys almost 2.5 million. Even multiplying population double per capita.

Additionally, majority population resides cities, one would think would make infection rates higher. still seen evidence deaths caused lockdown although keep waiting. I'm sure suicides overdoses. 100,000? way. Agreed. apparently. I'm ok that, fact support it. also know many would problem even though make enough. FloridaMan waves back Utah record case spikes governor moved state ""green"" allowed everything reopen. Almost one socially distancing, restaurants, parks, bars, etc packed again. Half people wear masks. pathetic.
The places overrun ones chose stay partially closed. Many favorite restaurants chose stay take risk health employees. much respect businesses eating stupid quantities take try support them. 


I've also specifically avoiding places people without masks go pretty annoying, since many Utahns seem wearing masks. grocery shopping limited Trader Joe's high end local grocer demographic draw mask wearing kind. pretty ridiculous. Also, Costco, require masks (thank goodness). they‚Äôd finally invest better automation. reason hired exploited. No, simple. Read source data linked - plenty possibly confounding problems here. found social distancing increased protests, cannot tell whether cases came time result protests. protests could causing uptick cases hidden result non-participants also changing behavior, cannot link change behavior protests way tell people staying protests another reason. guess vast majority health experts, Doctors, hospitals, health organizations (both national international) wrong.

Labeling someone ignorant name calling true.

The evidence abundance.  Yeah think combination factors also likely reason havent really seen heard anything it. 

And much think would shenanigans states reporting fewer deaths expected though put past (looking Florida), think every state reports cases/deaths differently based different criteria makes much harder accurately compare states. philosophy life ‚Äúsave lives‚Äù , it‚Äôs impossible Sign fucked economy people need spend like drunken sailors. long east asian custom save 30+% income every month. That's people Wuhan need stimulus check, months savings draw living Korea end February. 

I left fear peak returned America. 

The way handled versus America handled like night day. 

They started testing tracing immediately. They'd send traces city-messaging system *everyone* saw phones. 

People encouraged self-report self-quarantine possibly contact people.

There initial problem church clusters, PPE things like hand sanitizer available, almost everyone wore sort facial covering, whether N95 cotton cloth.

They gave people positive go quarantine free ration pack rice, meat, soups, ramen, cleaning supplies, FREE. use app track health stay home. 

There hiccups, addressing expat/foreigner population well, rations masks, etc. apparently worked out.

They never officially closed anything except schools initially school year starts March, they've open couple weeks far, many schools *re-closing* couple cases. 

America screwed, we've done literally WRONGEST step every level handle this. Bruh, know. ever go family reunion, there's one loud obnoxious cousin bad hygiene touching potluck food? We're apparently cousin, us really embarrassed it. see lockdown opportunity family bonding. I‚Äôve never spent much time kids I‚Äôm loving seeing every minute day. more... organization skills sadly suck &amp; bookmarks control. Good them, realizing entire thing overblown** media.

** overblown mean ""fake"". virus exists caution may taken individuals degree feel appropriate.  lot hoarders folks got burn fastest. ""take seriously"" time period buying gallons hand sanitizer.

Really moving avenues decide selfish course action. hoarding supplies that, demanding barbershops reopen that, packing bars that. scientific articles/models showing happen rural states don‚Äôt change behavior? overwhelm hospitals reach herd immunity?

We're ****ed... right thing 2 months, may need 2 years.

This exactly tried explain people.

The cost cost. unavoidable.

You either pay front save lives.

You pay later tried put off.

But get paying it. Kinda ironic guy taking temperatures isn‚Äôt wearing mask üò∑ I'm Memphis, though live anymore years. 

If Memphis gets huge surge, going *devastating*. city fairly poor, lot vulnerable population. 

Also, realize it, Memphis far southwest corner state, sharing border Arkansas Mississippi, frequently residents states work Memphis (or vice versa). COVID surges Memphis going affect areas too, extra problematic lot AR/MS residents live within hour Memphis come Memphis healthcare needs. 

My husband lot family still there, we're watching rather anxiously. might even lopsided way. would imagine younger people comorbidities would tilt left sides healthcare plan ...? Although might balance impact age predominant whiteness rural areas. I'm sort interested see rationale people rural communities lose huge parts senior population. Ok. Thank you. Agree. think people also fundamentally underestimating actual risk necessary action required. coworkers wear masks go grab dinner park something ever wear one work, really wash hands should, still friends ""social distancing hangs"" etc.

Article pretty sad,with bunch minor girls tested positive covid,and even found pregnant. know may answers yet, t-cell remain longer system antibodies? Since antibodies seams decrease weak recovery, T-cell responsible immune system memory? 
Did gives immunity, complete partial? (Maybe protect infection, protect complications)
If gives longer immunity, could vaccine works way?

It may also explain places 10% positive antibodies see downtrend even reopening everyone social distancing required public health authorities. Well fair social distancing effective mask. even effective use both, since couldnt come enough masks said social distancing priority. 

They dropped ball things general think done well. Also everything educated population, ppl smart enough listen govt. issues they? click link set weekly, hospital admissions I'm guessing so. tested myself, would likely take shorter that! Cheese grits? would prefer approach ""let's stick heads sand"" approach US. definition insanity, something repeatedly expecting different results.

**The virus never went away.** systematic plan adopted across states would leave us vulnerable? cases Europe combined?

This current administration want explore creative solutions alternative options.

**There need exclusively binary choice solve situation:** re-open country, expose get sick. could exercised options may include Universal wages period time, subsidize food vouchers, etc.

They limit choices, make binary, this....

Bailouts putting finger dam, solve problem (for year least). 3-5 months go right back square 1. think may out-of-date information. understanding results 3 completed trials I've quoted (what believe be) relevant portions press releases each:

* [Gilead Dosing study demonstrated patients receiving 10-day treatment course remdesivir achieved similar improvement clinical status compared taking 5-day treatment course (Odds Ratio: 0.75 [95% CI 0.51 ‚Äì 1.12] Day 14). new safety signals identified remdesivir across either treatment group

* [NIAID ACTT Preliminary results indicate patients received remdesivir 31% faster time recovery received placebo (p&lt;0.001). Specifically, median time recovery 11 days patients treated remdesivir compared 15 days received placebo. Results also suggested survival benefit, mortality rate 8.0% group receiving remdesivir versus 11.6% placebo group (p=0.059).

* [Gilead 'Simple' (5 day vs 10 day vs Standard study demonstrated patients 5-day remdesivir treatment group 65 percent likely clinical improvement Day 11 compared standard care group (OR 1.65 [95% CI 1.09-2.48]; p=0.017). three randomized, controlled clinical trials demonstrating remdesivir improved clinical outcomes several different measures. Today‚Äôs results showed treating moderate disease, 5-day course remdesivir led greater clinical improvement standard care, adding evidence remdesivir‚Äôs benefit previously released study results hate say it, *anyone* refuses COVID test work fired anyways. 

That said, obviously fucking anonymizing these. states massive protests? 
Since uptick due protest would begun expressing populance around Friday/Saturday throughout week. keeping track.  particular fact would like refute sufficient name-call? testing, find cases. less testing, find fewer cases. doesnt really say much ""how bad virus is"".

The important thing *deaths*. deaths steadily decreasing past Right, point Gen Z likely bars went head I'm guessing. Lol where? sale anywhere.  behind.. Sweden reported 0 deaths every day since Friday.. 



oh wait.. literally gave stopped reporting Friday. usual Swedish fanboys told reporting restart Monday, are, another day without reporting 4 days data. put practice trump strategy avoid showing testing numbers actual deaths instead cases. comment blocked multiple times quoting article approved.

I added nothing it.

Just direct quotes.

Blocked politics. approximately 40 million people US age 65. Considering supposed death rate people 65 least 3% would mean could expect 1.2 million people age group alone die virus infected. 

That's 10 times current number deaths US also includes thousands people age 65. 

It's possible limiting factor doubt would important one.  Probably least amount people got tested Sunday, Father‚Äôs Day. Expect numbers skyrocket week. absolute blowout. coworkers complained today fridays feel like fridays walk building commute home finalize week out.

I know, right? talking guy Somalia eaten two weeks 3 5 children died weeks born malnutrition.

It's tough around... average age someone killed car crash 38. 38 40.37 years lifespan left according actuary tables. average age someone dying Covid-19 78-81. Let‚Äôs use 79. 79, average lifespan left 8.82 however, unlike car crashes, Covid-19 typically kills co-morbidities wouldn‚Äôt typically lifespan others cohort. Conservatively, say average 79 year old died Covid-19 4 years life left average. Covid-19 death represents ten times less effect overall average lifespan typical motor vehicle accident death. threat average lifespan motor vehicle accidents, death count Covid-19 would ten times higher. isn‚Äôt likely year‚Äôs end. live DC gotten accustomed people wearing masks indoors everywhere. went Texas dude wearing MAGA hat shouted ""coward"" face mask on. idea Texas breeds resentment towards expert opinion, science, etc. Lockdowns work, that‚Äôs scientific fact. 

That depends entirely scientists listen to. two sides debate issue - popular one moment lockdowns work many opposing views. far many variables unknowns minute make definitive statements - web finally untangled, hopefully know better, now, stated far concrete evidence either direction. 

The applies Sweden vs Nordic neighbours debate - may appear Sweden's policy direct cause increased deaths, simply cannot say certainty. 

Therefor, say strategy failure, simply opinion. opinion many people sub seem share. clear want everyone see Sweden failure, unclear want this. History books future : ""Alas majority people failed learn obvious lessons first wave approximately quarter million died second wave mid August late October 2020."" Yeah we're going see field hospitals pretty quick rural America going get heads stoved in. compare recovered cases/recovery rates active cases?This exactly government keeping testing rates low,in hopes recovery rate eventually catch up(and also community transmission repeadetely denied,even concrete proof).Our discharge policy also changed bit bit inflate recovery rate. disagree, easy figure out. easy figure ""clearly"" context provided mutually exclusive. article says test take 15 minutes. Maybe that‚Äôs swab actual testing process? Yeah. linked another reply. [Here go. want make distinction recall article making.

When low wage workers say things like, ""We need reopen kids going homeless income,"" lot articles summarized was, ""Low wage workers eager reopen.""

I find disingenuous. employees want get back work they're bored. They're terrified financial ruin.

If folks provided option continue receiving $2,000 per month stay home reopen current wage, would opt reopen.

I recall article making distinction. think they're going sheer poll data capture nuance.

But find nuance important understanding position people in. RIGhtS Stay safe n' healthy. 100k casualties states? minutely fatal? Perhaps fact took actions prevented us becoming similar basket case.

You loon suffering Trudeau Derangement Syndrome. Well common cold never shut world down, understandably less urgency decicion made strategy though. choice taken, based (faulty) scientific knowledge. Letting virus spread flattening peak. 

This happening real time, people dying uneccesarily it. 

What suggesting tantamount waiting autopsy instead reevaluating treatment live patient. 

All ridiculing acting paranoid towards colleagues suggest worked similar scenarios. 

I want Sweden get it‚Äôs shit together save lives it‚Äôs economy both. won‚Äôt happen attitude though. late many. Events course prove rest world right Sweden wrong...but won‚Äôt consolidation. make believe Earth isn‚Äôt flat. predictions. elderly people need fulltime care 24/7.

A significant proportion care homes need daily care majority needs someone cook, give medicines, bathe them, clear rooms wash clothes,

And think every day someone time sink?

*Especially* older types personal care takes 3x longer do. It‚Äôs terrible, 2020 ignorance beyond human understanding. 

I speak lots people involved healthcare NYC. 

The tell different facing Covid-19. surreal. 

Usually people talk, survivor tales like that, it‚Äôs over. love talk about. It‚Äôs human trait.

Their response time?

I can‚Äôt talk it. Let‚Äôs change topic. 


My take?

Surreal? Think that‚Äôs understatement. part consider proof? Mmhm. You‚Äôre literally joke I'm angry least bit. showing hypocrite. That's all. protests Buffalo well, bub. Tons people wearing masks. OK though, lived denial grew up. There's still hope maybe Canada. Hope make there!! Florida bottom half. long, I‚Äôm afraid. test EVERYONE hospital within 24 hours... debate means nothing... certain areas dropping ball doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is... people.. 77 year old gets fucking cruise ship March 8th. 2 weeks Diamond Princess dominated news. Mass exctinction when? Given density habits, maybe significant portion city actually it.

Either way, fascinating watch Losers: Mexico. Much South America, all. likely Africa.

Remains seen: Costa Rica, originally well cases began rise exponentially reopening started.

Winners: bulk Asia, adding Hong Kong, Cambodia, Thailand.

Mediocre: Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia. Thanks info, see VB Hampton Roads area. Good luck friend. cases transmitted people pre-symptomatic anyway. Okay, propose a, say, child lives apartment take care surviving parent middle-stages alzheimers, poor mobility?

Wait: got more.

What woman 3 children suddenly deal father declining physically mentally, home built facilities needs (ie: bath, washroom, corridors small wheelchairs). prioritise children? give whatever work might do? completely upend home, move another, 'elderly' friendly home? afford this?

Or two late-middle aged children suddenly finding 93-year old parent needs full-time support. older children entering retirement themselves. want become effectively full-time carers? parent may well heavy require lot lifting. Would okay completely destroy backs trying shift mum dad around without proper equipment (know average house hold hoist?)

Sometimes ailing parent refuse leave home. kids move in? I'm sure actually run course. We've dealt first big surge, time tell things develop start loosen more. good point thank you. 

There's also harrowing footage 55 year old woman disability gasping oxygen refused care. daughter filmed try raise alarm vulnerable people triaged, ever hosted critical FB groups, youtube one right wing site; never mainstream media. *infamous* link right wing source posted *still* bring bash wit, messed right wing site would host even though daughter went rest press too. Expressen cover death, MUCH lighter touch. angry daughter, wanted expose crime happened mother, Swedish media turned cold shoulder. 

Actually, searched found link neutral looking Norwegian site: Figures they'd pick Norway. noticed lot, esp. ealier on: there'd radio silence Swedish press x horrifying incident it'd reported better Danish, Norwegian Finnish press. 

Here're links Expressen: Saying closing ""last option"" escalation closing ""NOT option"" least. longer winter. much thing quieting heat. 



‚ÄúNow, virus we‚Äôre talking ‚Äï know, lot people think goes away April heat ‚Äï heat comes in. Typically, go away April. We‚Äôre great shape though. 12 cases ‚Äï 11 cases, many good shape now.‚Äù [Feb. 10]

Trump said Sauce[Trump Listening drone self righteous arrogance worth it.

Especially since pushing agenda.  Yet UK goverment decrease 3 feet pubs restaurants need open; people need fucking fish chips pint! Actually big fan Denmark. like shutdown didn‚Äôt last long, like don‚Äôt force everyone wear masks, even though prefer wear myself. generally lot freedom Americans. Check rank worldwide terms freedom press, economic freedoms, general freedom overall. 

But lot stuff history criticizing claim astroturfing though. think that's absolutely true. Yeah, agree, Ron good head shoulders well, three work searches/week requirement unemployment eligibility governor absolutely fucked. Yeah, probably degree. We've got biases receptive information matches biases. Subreddits great belief bubbles. subscribe community talk bunch people share views, helping reinforce own.

That's say ""all sides same"". certainly different degrees unanimity receptiveness new information different communities. good keep mind group people commenting sub like way representative population whole. find majority elderly many care homes really situation could live home, children.

A small minority, oddly enough, choose go them. China, creator complete lockdowns got new wave now. sex toy accidents

seems overly specific... usually vote every election.

This first election might sit out.

My first amendment rights either get eye shot leg shot I'd rather set damn system fire. Well viruses don‚Äôt play nice. People told mild case ventilated next day. Mild case stupid term virus ramp kill two days anyway. Point remains don‚Äôt trust anyone telling little risk fine they‚Äôre young healthy okay. shit still finding new ways kill us. Didn‚Äôt learn Virus 101? Money incredibly cheap right now, terms interest. That's likely contributing less stellar attitude towards loaning. sure hope someone makes point loud clear press.

That would require American press full actual *journalists* instead partisan standard-bearers clickbait kids. also poorly US customs run That's good! Imo, that's y'all trending down, coupled delayed entrance reopening phases.

The state numbers plateau bc NoVa trending parts state beginning rise. Actually 8 rh factor - AB, A, B, plus minus. fact study said A,O results exclude rh negative Well probably drive stock prices. Even it‚Äôs true. reminder daily Covid deaths USA dropping past month downward trend ""There something wrong Reddit."" mean people wimps downvote they're mad post (or user), whereas vigorous responses like ""doxxing"" ""swatting"" popular elsewhere? He'll best flatten curve attitude, that's gonna problem hospitals. actually improve situation, like NY need emphatic.  essential though? young people first....

Then restaurants....

Then ???

Just dont blame people charge! Probably lot divorces blows too. I'm super familiar Wisconsin situation.

I'm wondering % positives high enough make list even trending up. Oklahoman here: people still think joke. in-laws still comparing common flu. Masks rare sight, unless international market. reason, much regular shopping along grocery pickup. Things still opening up, restaurants area pretty packed good while. I‚Äôm not. rules need followed doesn‚Äôt mean be. Many people give shit family member dies covid, that.  think Florida Man can't get dumber, I'm proved wrong. 

Very scared brother lives Miami, thank goodness he's self-isolating since March plans stop anytime soon. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre angry. one protest went saw two people without mask face. also brought bike use social distancing tool. one isn‚Äôt plan near me. cases still falling. 

I looked moving Canada. would drain life savings denounce citizenship start over. don‚Äôt lot go huddle Kansas. throw Florida vacation. Yea, let's completely ignore hordes people protesting, rioting looting, make virus spread Downer not, wrong. U.S., lowest since March 23. Awesome.

The average person knows generally 3 things really well. 

the field work in, hobby interested follow one sport 

everything outside time interest dedicate learning about. 

how much time take research know, really know something true? 

think reading Wikipedia gets right answers time? ever taken time check sources links bottom page? times lead spurious websites data laundered Wikipedia make look legit.

So need go Wikipedia also check sources make sure correct wordpress blog geocities page. 

and news institutions meant checking short circuited way people have, things need nanosecond bleeding edge first get clicks.

it's shitshow. white Here's smart idea: US actually studies virus instead find media outlets belonging nations? 3500 sunday 3000 far Monday. previous trend low reporting days continues, going bad week. ""I asked slow testing down"" - need know? assume treatment improvements decrease deaths decrease lingering health conditions? 

Or saying people get lingering health conditions inevitably increase along total number cases? pragmatic point view would irrelevant ask someone attended protest contract tracing perspective. go attempting trace anything?

What mean? effectively making claim contact tracing fruitless endeavor feel like mass gathering support important mass gatherings. making one ridiculous arguments I've ever heard. that‚Äôs sharpies for! story behind article:

In Jeonju, capital Jeonbuk Province, high school girl Jeonju developed fever class tested positive later. community transmissions reported city last three months local quarantine authorities clue infection route. 

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, quarantine authorities Daejon suspected patients Daejon door-to-door sales company cluster stated faithfully past route found visited Jeonju business briefing phone gps records.

&amp;#x200B;

Translation 4 meters away""...Coronavirus may trasmitted via wind air conditioner?

&amp;#x200B;

A high school student, confirmed Jeonju last week, also found related Daejeon door-to-door sales company.

&amp;#x200B;

She ate restaurant patients identified earlier.

&amp;#x200B;

However, sitting far enough away them, time overlap 5 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

Because this, quarantine authorities investigating possibility wind air-conditioner become vehicle infection.

&amp;#x200B;

Reporter Kim Yun-mi covered.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Report -

&amp;#x200B;

A third grader Jeonju confirmed last week.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back path infection, verified two confirmed dealers Daejeon door-to-door sales office snack shop time was.

&amp;#x200B;

The overlapping time shop 5 minutes. (ps. student first dealers came later. )

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, infection occurred even though sat 4 meters away.

&amp;#x200B;

A university student Gwangju, two meters away confirmers, also infected.

&amp;#x200B;

There conversation them, sat distance, infection occur?

&amp;#x200B;

The quarantine authorities paying attention system air conditioner, operated ceiling snack shop.

&amp;#x200B;

They investigating possibility virus mouth confirmed person spread wind air conditioner.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

There similar result Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention.

&amp;#x200B;

In January, 10 people side table restaurant Guangzhou, China, infected one another, air conditioning operating wall restaurant.

&amp;#x200B;

There possibility air-conditioner wind spread virus straight direction moving back forth three tables. 

&amp;#x200B;

Moreover, air-conditioner wind dry lowers temperature, experts say increases survival time virus.

&amp;#x200B;

\[Kim Woo-ju/Professor Infectious Disease, Korea University Guro Hospital\]

""If hot humid, difficurlt virus survive survival time shortens. temperature goes (due air conditioner), virus survive longer environment.""

&amp;#x200B;

Because this, ventilation paramount.

&amp;#x200B;

The quarantine authorities ask enclosed space ventilated least every two hours, wind air-conditioner direct contact human body.

This Yoonmi Kim MBC News. Brazil. Brazil saw 54,000 new cases weekend. Nice Miami barely seen people wearing masks. went car mechanics shop crib saw workers talking masks down, clients none. effects around disc unless vaccine found. Europe going experience slower longer duration time suffering effects extreme social distancing. is, driven primarily 2 countries seem think best strategy ignore virus's existence rather anything it.

TABC pretty damn strict Texas. don‚Äôt mess around alcohol here. said, it‚Äôs thing done statewide. Every county make rules. Notice there‚Äôs pompously bragging nothing happening two weeks.

Two weeks dumbasses, reap sow also support trumps plan ease covid spikes testing less people? Maybe directly Memorial Day weekend, also lot people getting together weekend going back live spreading it. bars churches restaurants keep spreading it. far there's nothing suggest number maliciously wrong. Contact tracing performed well, people mostly obeyed mask distancing order, quarantine mostly obeyed. repost? guess assume recently returned Reddit.

The astroturf accounts bad mods made sub unusuable.

I'm sure scores settled many still linger. shut up. there‚Äôs going either vaccine, treatment that‚Äôll make worse common cold. it‚Äôs need flatten curve overwhelm people working stuff.  definitely real poster Yeah, take regular bike rides, feel like hobby.  shop till drop (literally) ""Promise Made Promise Kept"" Look senator rand paul, freaking Dr, going Senate sick meetings, lunches top GOP, exercised swam Senate gym.

Philly went weeks without posting gain 162. today, 275. Might extension Northwest Arkansas hotspot. Hospitals nearing critical levels desperately trying get people wear masks.

Meanwhile, governor Arkansas has, executive order, exempted employers businesses liability Coronavirus related health claims. He's saying shop shop shop! Same. got control how. Yeah, many places even city wearing masks improperly, noses chin, whatever.

Even chiropractor's popping mask every time he's behind closed door, expected better healthcare professional. :\ still protecting president Vice President virus don‚Äôt give shit anybody else, lot say. Yeah people getting delayed effect here. Hard concept grasp reason. 1,026+ German plant,

The German meatpacking plant 1,500 tested positive. man competent run United States. really think starting loose it, big mouth keeps getting deeper deeper things can't talk way of. really mentally unstable. capable ANYTHING! doubt CA reported deaths. Numbers lower elsewhere percentage.

On hand, watch pneumonia deaths. Soooo....the Memorial Day spikes catching up. 

Protest spikes soon follow another couple weeks. buttermilk biscuits! Last monday currently 2,777, wonder tomorrow.

!remindme 1 day is, astute eye foolish younger brother drove Florida last week go Universal Studios, quote: ""Because Disney still closed"" 

He took whole family too! Son, wife, MiL lot them.

I told get tested stay hell away 14 days.

Hope worth it. isn‚Äôt bad news either though. % doesn‚Äôt really matter unless random sample. Otherwise it‚Äôs people reason believe exposed going tested.  Lamo, media, whose ugly, wolf? Hard take people logic. Uncovering infection chain pcr negative patient IgM. Smart. CCDC seems good work.  Rural populations trend older too. going Cali?

I thought lockdown one strict It‚Äôs worrisome. live Missouri, 40 miles STL. one takes seriously. Everyone around calls scamdemic. say Texas stay locked down? wouldn‚Äôt putting words mouth you‚Äôve got weak argument now, would you? Please show said Texas go back stay lockdown. Pakistan definitely cannot afford shit economy. People flock join terror groups promise food money support families. completely impossible government provide semblance aid impoverished. Imams helped either tbh expect bc Pakistani government openly corrupt. I'm Florida, went get tested Sunday morning waited 4 hours line (in cars). Multiple people ran gas wish could. they're admitted, though, can't get rid them. visitors behave unless want banned. Here's thought. Pay unemployment financially support taxpayers like countries doing. Instead, fill businesses middle pandemic look happens. ""Play stupid games, win stupid prizes"" comes mind 4,800 cases Texas today. ‚ÄúHowdy, pardner‚Äù -Texas think ever much point trend would gone stuck closures another 1-2 weeks. never really fully cases like Europe prior reopening. would incredibly surprised kids go back school fall. Ain‚Äôt way. china? Yes China NJ like 6 weeks. 250 cases yesterday. ""Closing Texas always last option,"" said Abbott.

I take threat warning, PROMISE closing LAST thing he'll do. Let guess place mass protests taking place ‚Äúexperts‚Äù find spike cases. No, list day swab taken. wondering takes long number per day stop LOL? since allowed homes rate transmission gone up. anyone didn‚Äôt get social distancing, mask, etc... messaging?. Sounds like can‚Äôt trust people responsible health health others. I‚Äôve noticed median age testing positive getting younger younger. Pictures Trump‚Äôs rally seem show 20s-50s. Didn‚Äôt see 60+. see lot millennials bringing babies toddlers. one masks. thing said mildly sounding like ""plan"" WASH YER HANDS.
That's plan. Unfortunately excludes causes death like heart attack stroke (or abnormal, yet determined) know fact covid gets misdiagnosed as. Even give ‚Äúhonest‚Äù numbers deliberately cherry picked. wouldn‚Äôt put much faith CDC deliberately lied everyone masks useless.

I don‚Äôt know - avoid deadly virus kills family controversial, edgy advice. Nobody need convince take problem seriously.

I shouldn‚Äôt need find links bunch numbers saying kills young people reading dead teenagers Wuhan back January. image? arrogance might something Florida, Georgia, Arizona Texas relaxed social distancing 1st week May.

I remember Ozark incident happening month ago. 

Bottom-line, data showing supposed resurgence , especially due relaxed social distancing norms.

Deaths true statistics -- I'm willing count abnormal deaths, COVID attributed deaths. numbers simply narrative Good point thank sharing. seems weird places wear mask busy store. it, keep on? Even putting up/down multiple times recommended. I‚Äôm hoping continue work home I‚Äôll stop getting sick damned much. don‚Äôt kids, small circle friends, don‚Äôt get much primary vector catching illnesses people won‚Äôt stay home stupid attendance policies.

Plus ton mitigate migraines/sinus headaches home I‚Äôm calling anywhere often used to. Utah many infections general thinks expected number cases go up. least salt lake city we're ready kind large outbreak wave two.

At least far know. Wear masks though public Thats thing? wanna see  whole lot new information. now, cases slowed trickle Union County Yeah, unfortunately, agree too. Yes def wearing glasses. sure get toddler anything watch screen touch anything. won‚Äôt keep mask on.  makes think 2 years? curious. huh? Could HEPA filtration like hospitals. presidential limo oxygen tanks protect biological chemical weapons expect house good stuff even strongest protection likely bunker... somehow elected (D) Governor. paying off. US third world country Gucci belt Supreme hat. good question always refresh physiology encounter great concept know. depends. acute increase higher altitude would likely see decrease SPO2 result decreased atmospheric pressure O2 available gas exchange lungs. altitude sickness thing.

That said, barring pre-existing health conditions may obstruct someone so, variety responses body compensate decrease O2 availability. example, increasing respiratory rate (more acute) or, time, amount hemoglobin. would expect someone enough time acclimate (and extremes altitude), SPO2 (in healthy person) would remain normal range perhaps even still 99-100 places like Colorado. course, expect decided climb K2. 

Disclaimer: practicing sea level since started physiology regarding altitude rusty I'm wrong someone something else add, feel free educate Seriously, AZ plodding along. It‚Äôs Wild Wild West. lol that‚Äôs fair too. AP seminar AP research suck even let masks mandated... believe he'd go lockdown? rate drop reasons:

1. actual IFR likely near one percent (overall - higher older individuals), catch cases testing, inflated CFR approaches actual IFR

2. younger people getting sick means fewer deaths.

It could combination factors. Maybe better treatments also play role here. know much impacts deaths.

I'm saying states possibly hiding data, factors could contribute. I'm sure someone must thought Peak 7 day rolling average new daily cases was: 32 425 April 10

On 9th June was: 21 294

Yesterday 27 644 go another 1000 todays total. 

Basically 3 months lockdown gains almost lost two weeks. kids back school bad idea, change way get school (not bus), number kids per classroom, wearing facemasks, keeping distance...

I don‚Äôt know Germany done US. I‚Äôm teacher schools simply resources make changes. cannot run buses, cannot lower classroom sizes (I‚Äôm going huge class upcoming school year) way social distancing large amounts students buses classroom. 

I also highly doubt access many cleaning supplies either.

I think US going go wide open let chips fall may. could wrong, point don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs going many precautions changes place. late.
We'll 5k day Friday 10k July 4th. Yeah saying 2 weeks since Spring Break exactly predicting future performing rain dance. can‚Äôt ‚Äúpush‚Äù time money resources. Part reason vaccine development takes long time need patient see fuck vaccine long medium term, it‚Äôs acute affects Wow read old reddit comment you‚Äôre expert. Amazing works. come worldometer shows 130,716 yesterday's number? saying already decided whether school classrooms open fall? open half year Christmas? I've never seen better example digging ones grave believe case well. sick march person many others knew able get tested. one positive case counted among 10 us. really though? Also know Covid caused Miscarriages even mild cases, alarm you, know presenting this. 

Please stay safe. attest said, grew HoCo too. schools pretty good far could tell. think mixing statistics. ""To likely die car accident"" usually statistic people refer lifetime risk dying car accident. (Not risk dying car accident year.). 

So comparison lifetime risk dying covid 19 versus lifetime risk dying car accident. Yeah wouldn‚Äôt cases.‚Äù relative went haircut recently, stylist wearing masks. days later, stylist calls said tested positive also symptoms. 

My relative went got tested result negative symptoms appeared.

It seems wearing mask worked scenario much burden. far nobody seems gotten Covid stylist (she isolated getting symptoms tested), perhaps everyone wearing masks. Goober Cooper government mandated social distancing Big Al‚Äôs, feel Free eat wherever like,‚Äù reads sign posted front door Big All's BBQ, near intersection Louisburg Forestville roads northeast Raleigh.  ""And maybe slow testing, stop it, we'll see way fewer cases!"" happens masses access decent education. really slow. numbers tests taken last monday still climbing. Americans going happy politicians basically conducting genocide them? easiest visualize 

There's whole lot red green explains AP chemistry class period three students. Asia people would money 

No wouldn't, plenty people asia ""the money it"" even unless elderly person needed 24/7 care. culture individualistic like USA/western europe Ugh. I'm sorry. painful family friends fall something like that. ‚ÄòIntensive‚Äô intensive care? link article, ""*Some Houston restaurants won‚Äôt say employees COVID-19. don‚Äôt to.*""

It seems wrong public access info could inform decisions. parents live Idaho Falls seems business usual back Idaho. Nobody seems really give shit pandemic aggravating parents risk people. Like, catch COVID, dead meat.  Betcha officers aren‚Äôt social distancing. planet? Emissions gone way lockdown. mean ""how much""? never does. say this.....fml Nope. going lead .28% entire world dying? getting numbers?

Do people dying disease matter you? hard-won progress scourge slipping away resistance among many Americans wearing masks keeping distance others  arguing different that. it‚Äôs also stated many longer eating meat this. hoax him, he's using excuse close borders. Yep. still feels better standing sun. guess would sit bathtub full sanitizer day safe going worst monday since May 1 ( +35000 ) demographics bit different earlier spikes. expect fewer (not great deal fewer, still...) deaths people driving spikes younger average age. necessarily sustain, virus stay one demographic group. exactly. Indeed Guiana [overseas (which are, since reform 2003, limited sole [french southern antartic ).    
And [overseas (semi-autonomous regions) either [overseas     
Apart far Europe, overseas departements special status, slightly different inland departements. instance, Guiana instead [regional    
Ok, difference big I'm sure there's important difference. must reason different names status. Breathe jackasses. Americans stupid fuck ... we‚Äôll see insurance picks up. day labor I‚Äôm sure do. policy self employment still place (and sucking account dry). Go hide bunker!! DOOM AWAY They've dropped dramatically April peak reflecting actual cases millions. Serology testing plausible fatality rates leave doubt that. NYC metro Boston, core over, killed almost 60k people. Means least ~ 6 *million* there. 3x whole country reported.

The ascending cases Sunbelt much closer actual infections. set tone. leader country taking virus seriously publicly wearing PPE makes easier people follow lead. 

Leading example effective.  People can't fathom staying home period.

In early shutdown days, neighbor constantly running roads two little girls. Trips Walmart, Tractor Supply, Target, supermarket, Costco, PetSmart, Gamestop, etc. every single day, multiple times day would tell me

Finally getting mail saw asked middle panic going news/fauci tells us stay home. told it. Said up, out, something else goes crazy. 

I asked ever maybe, sat say read book relaxed instead going kids.  laughed face. Yeah helping us well! I'm curious death rates look like cases spoke though. 100% Arizonas fault. cant give tests away Connecticut 

Oh less 20 cases today Annnd even close packed Ugh. op get improper test? think they‚Äôre instructed purpose reduce confirmed case count? true! mullet effect. least locally, school windows open all. guess mayors read lines I'm assuming due reporting. one company create **whole specialty line** dangerous. honestly depressing they'll even huge amount profits. would think would know long term terrible idea genuinely appreciate it. We'll catch up. I'll looking DM! That‚Äôs everything I‚Äôm seeing central Jersey! I‚Äôm looking house ‚ÄúOK‚Äù split levels developments going 40k asking, market 2 days. It‚Äôs crazy. talking Texas Arizona? point contact tracing Florida? states contact tracing, one federal requirements reopen States.

Again math, higher positive percentile means people infected, even alarming since tests. 

If anyone selectively avoiding facts fit narrative you. 

Again, problem. live &amp; affect way. might want learn read data &amp; think yourself. SWMO cluster could attributed meat processing facilities workers testing positive. Usually one worker gets it, do.  forgetting people shielded bordering counties states actually taking things seriously fertile like problem. finally we're hit start panicking suddenly give shit. Thank smoking! Thank you. completely agree. unfathomable we're doing. 

Please take care friend! safe there. live smaller East Texan town, 97 cases Tuesday 118 Friday. way people behaving here, I‚Äôm worried get bad soon! True help eliminate larger crowds. Mostly family gatherings still good least it‚Äôs 10k crowds. Exactly this. never saw significant policy close country down. Thanks part weak welfare system. people work go hungry. Unlike Europe paid stay home. viral load asymptomatic enough infect someone enough test positive? another riddle? mayor Houston voluntarily lock city? comedic gold. see. Thanks.


But feel like even seem great news. optimistic scenario here, reach immunity threshold 10%, means seeing close another 100,000 Americans die (assuming death rates go bit due improved treatments).


I'm sure sane person thinks acceptable, way things opening cases rising, may long get see ourselves. e) blame Obama democratic mayors lol think means all. test people coming health care system, going get chart positive rate. amount test general population random basis, likely get fraction percentage point positive rate. 

But testing done contact traced people known likely infected, whatever number got good indication whether trend going short term, good containing spread. China South Korea doing. I‚Äôm getting anxiety looking pic basically changed comps? title off. applies businesses employees duty enforce it. customers can't punished ( even though wearing masks) wearing them. Nah, schools definitely going open again. I‚Äôm teacher already in-person professional development classes scheduled July. logistics impossible, think going ignore that. SA... went GNC employee decided volunteer information (I wearing mask, mind you) ‚Äúhe supposed wearing mask company policy, wasn‚Äôt going it‚Äôs uncomfortable‚Äù. nice knowing all. Percentage positive tests daily deaths increasing many areas. know actual time. go sleeping. 12-14hrs response via dm (need little bit time sleeping+price checking country thing) Thanks.

I know what's going become widowed mother.

My father brother dead.

So I'm pretty much it. Fuck media. I'm listening doctor. said stay home, wear mask stay home. fuck :) frustrating amount misinformation going disease, part makes sense learning zero go, also much bullshit going around crazy ICU beds dont need need Intensive Care? literally name unit

An ICU bed used non-ICU patient, way around.

I know common nationwide, hospital near live small number special negative pressure ""infectious patient"" rooms pandemic, use normal hospital rooms. patients get moved make way coronavirus patients. Sadly, last month made agree this. trying figure safest next 6 months. Right now, NYC seems safe went grim months. think next 6-8 weeks pretty bad unless people change course. people already don‚Äôt care 120,000 people dead - old, sick vulnerable people. know well things regulated here. (SW MO). businesses taking super seriously, nothing happening don't. quarantine WORKING here, like town (med size area) got 30 cases week so. stopped lock-down bunch places threw parties Memorial day freaking churches opened things spiraling again. frustrating. going issue employers provide safe environments employees. government cannot check every single employer. government also cannot expected bailout employers either. catch-22. Employees decide whether going work current employer worth health sanity give CERB stay home work somewhere else. meant global leadership like CCP. every word speak always favour China. like politicians doctors &amp; scientists. It‚Äôs likely given contextual evolutionary factors mayor Miami long term immunity, I‚Äôll put way. Well luckily Trump decide. summarize: withouba vaccine immunity means much smaller herd youve expanded testing wrong group people. USA bad EU good I‚Äôm Atlanta super nervous. cases reported nurses put complaints happening. (There article 11 Alive.) Also lot protests (I love part) businesses one first open. also right border Florida. friends tested positive. feel like even worse began one taking seriously anymore. half people see aren‚Äôt wearing masks. also go back work, husband medical issues covid could really mess up. nervous wreck. do? nervous wreck? Please don‚Äôt respond think covid joke know not. know someone died it. Probably great news still protesters Richmond. Police declared unlawful assembly last night, unknown used tear gas. I‚Äôm looking daily positive case counts Georgia. 


The average day highest Monday decreases steadily throughout week. 


What special Mondays? can‚Äôt figure out. florida, still hard get tested 18 almost impsossible, mail testing yet? Some, some. Hey hey, gotta make another 4 months, gets reset button! No, property tax increase overdue since last property tax reassessment; recent events made need urgent. Framing percentage increase terribly neutral way report it. tax rate historically higher rate 34% increase last 20 years. higher recently 2016. [Source](http://www.padctn.org/services/tax-rates-and-calculator/) (scroll history local tax rates). also still leaves us tax rate comparable similarly sized cities leaves us lower property tax rates large cities Tennessee. wish done earlier, city leaders done fewer give aways developers etc. boom years, something range necessity unless want see services cut dramatically, services stellar begin with. Ok got it. haven‚Äôt read much don‚Äôt know maybe people post mild stuff too. balance out. agree, CNN. thing, different sides, don‚Äôt naive disagree. It‚Äôs incredibly frustrating seeing many cars road almost one wearing mask inside stores. people seem throwing huge parties like celebrating end corona. Someone neighborhood party 30 cars multiple people car. never ending battle one city even caring. mom wants visit dying mother Panama can‚Äôt people suck don‚Äôt stay home. 2 words, Tulsa Oklahoma. That‚Äôs half audience! Really? great news. next two weeks, next two months. infections like hugs hip, ton intertia quick change course. old folks homes need burn residents, people essential workers pass among themselves, still spread community degree. Masking helps, perfect. meet two infected masked people week prob catch it, 20 masked infected people supermarket still get infected. see curves states surged soon lockdown. weeks, New York spot Makes perfect sense. He‚Äôs applying insane low standard medical caution low-level staff he‚Äôs applying rest US. Intelligence never mentioned I'm not. Masks work well, know now. Especially brief encounters. need go crazy entering store. CNN reporting younger people getting south. know severe younger/healthier people, could part it.  testing too, probably catching mild cases.  may anecdotal, live, one could get test Feb, March, April.  know plenty people flu like symptoms, negative flu test never got tested.  recovered fine never counted. Maybe people actually getting tested now. 100% stupid fucks exist. see every day California.  Still stop possible lawsuit. box? fox? Would train? Would rain? Looks like attempt rid responsible journalists. already do, steroid thing. Like said reduces death rate 1/3rd. Good news sure I‚Äôd call end pandemic Arizona's government given up. own. friend looking houses NJ. put bid 9k ask price still lost, haha. said realot told another client put 50k ask lost. Insanity. could require employers strictly adhere safety precautions fine them/revoke licenses don‚Äôt workers feel safe going back work instead refusing. can‚Äôt force people risk lifelong complications death. either bail people‚Äôs basic needs help businesses providing safe workspaces coming hard don‚Äôt both. Anything else going end badly. can‚Äôt government walk away throwing hands up. might work things going great, times crisis. must've gotten Trump's message slowing testing. number high, test much. go go testing. moron Trump is. think Hillary Clinton's statement 100 years word Trump mean something derogatory. disagreement think it'll hundred years like 5 years. explains displeasure Swedish people online. may outlet voice disagreement Sweden's action plan online communities.

I offer this. know placed feet Tegnell. beginning Swedish strategy high risk dubious reward. Science informs strategy. However, leadership governance ultimate arbiter move forward. very, risky move away strategy almost globally recognized sound shown effective number countries. something everybody aware of. Outdoor gastronomy okay, limited profit becausr dependence weather.

Indoor dining huge problem suppose. u push ur caseload almost zero work. problem people eating 1 2 hours indoors perfect superspreader setting.

Btw wont go indoor dining sustained virus suppression vaccine reality. counties? drive region soon I‚Äôm trying avoid stopping hotspots much possible. Pretty bad Philippines. third world country without adequate healthcare - lots people die. worse government priorities Well right, know antibodies transfusion. Nice gaslighting. Careful burn yourself. 

The whole H1N1 debacle resulted Parliamentary Assembly Council Europe (PACE) launching investigation look issue a¬†*‚Äúfalsified pandemic.‚Äù*¬†During¬†[the subsequent hearing](http://www.assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/News/FeaturesManager-View-EN.asp?ID=900)¬†the epidemiologist Dr Wolfgang Wodarg basically held trigger pandemic preparedness plans, key role play deciding pandemic. Around 18 billion dollars spent pandemic worldwide. Millions vaccinated good reason. even clear vaccine positive effect, clinically tested.‚Äù*

At hearing Professor Dr Ulrich Keil, Director Collaborating Centre Epidemiology University Munster, number scientists others questioning decision declare international pandemic. H1N1 virus new virus, known us decades \[‚Ä¶\] Germany, 10,000 deaths attributed seasonal ‚Äòflu, especially among older frail people. small number deaths, namely 187, attributed H1N1 virus Germany ‚Äì many dubious.‚Äù*

But yeah - nothing see here. Two friends, 42 39, athletes, 3,5 months ago. drive car 30 minutes needing break/ nap, 15 minute phone call need break. Racing heart, kidney pains, breath constantly. mild temperature bit tightness chest 1,5 week COVID. 

Another friend, 42, yesterday heart attack died, symptoms. 

Those 3 people know it. Anecdotally, disease play well... case virus less severe less deadly would matter lot less made way population, like cold Anyone better pandemic?

I feel like I'm lucky one well pandemic. wife work home, saved money refinancing home 2.75% eating out/vacation, started day trading getting massive gains 300%. Thanks! thought nobody would reply. terrified honest, people like Florida, smaller. surprised people disrespect social distancing guidelines. truly hate people won‚Äôt care more, ignorant.
For live AZ, please stay safe. Even hard get tested, lockdown. Protect loved ones. Grosse Pointe population seems forgotten virus, many wearing masks feel like outsider it.  familiar US geography, daily high temperatures time year usually 40-45 degrees Celsius shade. South Carolina here. thing. Still one ways get test ventilator Charleston area. True significant differences. people ICE custody held civil custody mostly civil infractions, means pose threat society released. comparison, people prisons generally convicted criminals could potentially pose safety threats released. ICE also detains whole families together, frequently transfer people different facilities. ICE detainees sentenced death simply xenophobia. Florida never learn mistakes Oh place still astro-turfed hell back, topics even majority sub may agree regardless astro-turfing! Labcorp's mail test. time submitted order results literally 3 days. no. true reddit. forsake everything website stands for. bad trust numbers... country sink right wing always point locations justification changing. Yeah there‚Äôs little guessing involved. guy straight fucking said rally told slow testing So, evidence comes population ""best guess"" estimate fatality rate CDC available puts overall fatality rate .004 0.4% *symptomatic cases*. population New York City 8.4 million. fatality rate 0.4% and, estimate, asymptomatic rate 35% would mean 21,840 deaths New York City. New York City 18,935 deaths around 86.7% would expected 8.4 million people exposed.

I say fatality rate probably lower New York City likely stumble across previously unknown mass graves coronavirus victims, likely find people test positive antibodies never got tested. providing proof, link something previous date want different response... Definitely typo. Someone forgot omit ""thousand."" see people understand this. think want take funds away public schools put private schools heck it? happens make good education attainable affluent? rich get richer. thing is, people see family members contract virus, still talk shit. are. I'll heading back work middle September then. Early January suspect Covid-19 arrived, took late March saw exponential growth deaths. July 4th seems date pubs reopen life gets back relatively normal status quo, I'll bet money thing happens mid - late September get shut again, nothing changed regards peoples behaviour. Even reducing distance 2m - 1m, masks shops public transport, entitlement alive well. trump announced slowed testing keep numbers looking better.

He say told people slow testing, there's nobody could tell. people responsible testing answer him. ""his people"" case mostly hot air blackmail. said mirror. üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ think stay whole year Missouri. lot kids can‚Äôt online learning due internet rural poor afford it. Plus jobs open currently since pretty much open parents work therefore kids need go school daycare. Kids kind need school here. Hol-up I‚Äôm still here. I‚Äôm currently trying get retested return work. Thank looking out. you? 80% flat refuse answer question hang instead, incomplete data. generic question, ""have attended large outside gatherings May X June X"" respondents provide information. NYC, large outside events going on. Governor punted cities municipalities. enacted requirements making mandatory applicable fine worn. live suburb city Seoul. It‚Äôs really second wave, like second ripple. Daegu outbreak brought control, zero lockdowns zero mandatory quarantines (except incoming international travelers). competent handling combined overall social responsibility exhibited by-choice mask-wearing population makes S.Korea prime example handle pandemic. course people already knew that.
Any time someone tests positive, contact tracing complete within 48 hours constant informative alerts sent out. older person sick city ended passing away, public announcement treated genuine tragedy. perspective here, looking home country continues lose thousands lives, it‚Äôs quite clear nation‚Äôs people value life, community, healthcare, social responsibility, nation‚Äôs people would rather hear want hear want do‚Äîat everyone else‚Äôs expense, regardless facts. asked what's going NJ, answered. Masks worn everywhere indoors well many safety measures everyone takes seriously. Masks mandatory casinos. would like refer people robert redford smile meme. Again, kiddy hour so. direct link press release -- I, problems takes average 3 weeks someone die virus. Three weeks ago number new cases lowest time. new cases rising now, number deaths might increase 3 weeks again. soon celebrate. Supply partially dependent buying though. want move nicer house sell mine, I'm certain afford nicer house due COVID, list house. wife went test Friday afternoon. waited 20 minutes took sample. recieved text message results 9 morning. live South Africa. Technically 3rd world country. (It negative. Looks like flu) hearing guy reddit shoved dick nothing ever surprise me. simultaneously be;

1) Disturbed angry nonchalance treating virus, consequent surge infections; and

2) Skeptical deadly severe virus younger healthier populations

Those two mutually exclusive, yet don‚Äôt see media outlets (or barely any) reporting 2).

99.8% COVID deaths NYC people age 44 people underlying conditions. dialogue assess deadly virus truly is. Sun valley got hit hard. I‚Äôm East Idaho there‚Äôs large population people whose residencies state (if know know lol), test positive, it‚Äôs reported Idaho. Far less half people stores wearing masks. It‚Äôs probably gonna get pretty bad soon.. Nothing new. Still dying like flies. Bad news recent protests. want population smart enough work dumb enough question it. sorry happened her.

I wish best. wonder folks ride seatbelt disengage air bag? Yeah, partner going grocery shopping risk family members, havent caught yet we're always using masks sanitizer lol non-US outsider, whats hapenning, including political splits worsening worried.

&amp;#x200B;

Its not, think (from outsiders perspective) Trump wont admit wrong,i think case \*incapable\* even understanding \*can\* wrong. always right, always someone else's fault.  Would interesting see ever, ever entire existence admitted mistake.

&amp;#x200B;

Somehow, doubt I‚Äôm immune compromised. Looks like leaving house year Covid really bad aim, targets thinking it‚Äôs nothing... seems getting closer. Agreed fair, would fucking riot state gone Florida Plan. basically nothing half-ass measures continue pander idiot voter base.  Well, here's get. Keep trying save economy morons.  lose economy too.

Infectious disease 101 fail.  Exactly. Pretty bad Louisiana showing sense Texas. guess good anyone's here. Weekly reminder FL:

‚ÄúFlorida medical examiners releasing coronavirus death data. **The state made thought people see others wearing one figure don‚Äôt need either. need remember wearing mask helps normalize mask wearing general... impact others even though don‚Äôt realize it. friend mines father retired doctor that, heard COVID, returned back old hospital help. 

He contracted COVID died within week getting it. 

This disease real absolutely kills people taking seriously. May front line workers Rest Peace I‚Äôm also supposed go bachelorette party trip New Orleans late August. Feels like I‚Äôm one group that‚Äôs still concerned.  strong social welfare state good infrastructure. Combining inbuilt advantage corona specific support programmes allow people social distance effectively without complete lockdown mask-wearing. rules harshly enforced reminder keep 1.5m constantly noted social situations (and literally big signs around).

When lockdown began Dutch well setup live small households family individual work home, commute bike, transmission difficult.

The initial outbreak also specifically localised south country rather densely populated areas.

Undoubtedly RIVM policy really caring virus, avoiding overcrowding ICUs, lead additional deaths. However, achieved aim riding overcrowding line cases went allow tests anyone symptoms part reopening rather containment. u r telling dont order supervise quarantines? recommend it??? Isn‚Äôt Ozarks located? Throw couple drinks, social distancing completely over. work guy Springfield, MO. Early June said back normal, working normally office. Madness.  try thank you. one noone different. One means nobody one means body. 

Cmon, every body nose that! think important metrics.

I wish knew long term disease mild cases.

If end vent, blood clots? necessarily show stats, either. seen sure cases somebody getting reinfected though.

It seems would many cases, thing. That‚Äôs literally point. articles subject. 

Also lack testing mean big brains assume COVID. read Darfur, hundreds likely died. substantial deaths several nations. Looks like situation Latin America South Asia: really reached Africa yet growing. Used it‚Äôs corrupt told EVERY INSTITUTE corrupt. world organization isn‚Äôt corrupt degree. Cutting ties finding people talked job replacing childishly idiotic. 

Looking world leader announced publicly slowed testing keep numbers low limitless potential impact additional deaths. even appoint him, gives shit? 

The 14 million citizens Zimbabwe, they're saying politicizing pandemic right valid. virus politicized actively making situation worse. 

While may true, look handled H1N1 pandemic 2009, dubious previous history director chief, clear financial conflicts interests due funded, pretty clear political motives issue. want give big thanks local Chinese community. govt made social distancing masks obligatory local Chinese shop place everyone acted careful masked up. Wow, good job cherry-picking best case scenario (lecturing professor) people mentioned. ‚ÄúThe finding paper doesn‚Äôt mean sky falling,‚Äù said, also noting number patients studied small.‚Äù PA. popular Reddit mention George Carlin quote ""the average person stupid, half us even stupider that"" (paraphrasing)...but boy, relevant. Humanity dragged level stupid selfish members. mom‚Äôs boss leaves recording early March Fauci saying masks don‚Äôt help day. honestly think people know things changed. refuse accept use justify actions. United States collection states, turn collection local governments. Public services single entity. Individual towns, cities, counties, even states perfectly capable making system. requires people demanding point politicians fear stupid jobs don‚Äôt take action. funding already many places - police it. NSW Victoria may entering 'new normal' time everyone else :-( refusing wear mask public even asked requiring people wear masks rallies, tacit approval non mask wearing even CDC suggest mask wearing safe. type leadership matters spreads message mask wearing critical. daily message followers mask wearing important. see that?

Who gives shit optics hit global pandemic. Stopping testing dangerous. leads worse spreading incredibly contagious virus. would argue suggesting stopping spreading sole purpose optics dangerous terrible leadership. Again, Trump shows care wellbeing country's citizens makes look bad.

""He supported sending people back work, isnt mutually exclusive opening slowly"". Uh, absolutely false. Opening specific stores people protesting about, like hair salons barber shops example, would direct contradiction CDC guidelines time. Thus Trump openly advocating something different CDC guidelines saying. Even today, majority states reopening meeting CDC guidelines ... Trump administration silent this.

Trump absolutely suggested injecting disinfectant sunlight directly veins. watch video? chillingly hilarious.

You seem willing talk detail online. Spend bit time researching talking productive conversation.  far know everybody infected produces neutralizing antibodies, antibodies persist 6 months prevent future infections. I'll add links get work, easily googleable.

This sub went deep end doom porn still cling worst-case ideas March since discredited. scientists tracking lung damage coronavirus months now.

Does breakdown help understand everyone voting you? one care support Trump giving obviously false information. bizarre. Wtf happened yesterday? Im sure police shoot anyone comply, right?

That would typical police behavior US, yes. agree think may soon know. Covid really hit force March. know may get immunity 3-6 mos. that's case, may front end people getting re-infected right may look like weird corner cases could change. Seriously dude. U clue u r talking about. Btw work hcs lot experience thinking abt death.
