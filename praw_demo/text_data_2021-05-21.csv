0,2021-05-21," Vaccines work well flu, keeps changing itself. *do* vaccine mandates measles though. Well, except experts think herd immunity ever happen. walked wrong side door store early overzealous doorman came screaming like protecting JFK. ""SIR, SIR, WRONG DOOR!"" 

Scarred living shit $10k medical bill? $10k?  Around here, might cover hours sitting ER waiting room, 10-minute chat nurse. There's never approved mRNA vaccine before. That's difficult fact lot people grapple $5M grabs NY scratch offs vaccinated. Vaccines work. less risk, risk. Covid still kill them.

I believe age group 0-11 death risk flu higher Covid. flu vaccine mandates before. They've year now. handle another month. restrictions state even bad ATM. Well, thankfully you’ll choice sounds it. pandemic fear. think saw mass deployment short time start actual stay home orders happening absolutely nobody following point stores gave stopped replacing stickers peeled up

Surprised chain US still using hardcore enough make big deal pulling  Pepperoni banana pepper please Jesus, well guess propaganda works. idea. That's terrifyingly depressing. Made money wealthy nations first donate ton get tax write get name recognition. Close soon FDA fully approves schools add COVID list required vaccines Nope don’t. Thank translation. Reminds guy last year made bold claim science journals testing would beat pandemic rather vaccines conveniently owner company putting R&amp;D developing rapid COVID tests. 

Just trying make one last fast buck studios trash safety measures entirely make policy vaccinated work movies question Disneyland parks open fully visitors, including unvaccinated kids. mean small business tyrants really care workers either want us continue mask up, social distance, stay home much longer exactly then?  Lol people still believe garbage.  south, get drive inside summer heat You’ve seriously bungled percent reduction means. order interpretation work, infected people would 100% chance transmitting COVID. reality, likelihood infected person transmitting COVID already pretty low. mean number people infected person infects high super spreaders; median useful number here. already low chance transmitting virus reduced 40-60%, reduced 40-60%. top massively reduced chance catching virus first place. That's makes really frustrating 

That botched chance get vaccinations make Tokyo Olympics symbol far we've come beating pandemic last six months since mass vaccination started patient C, even tested positive covid yesterday, still going get motorcycle accident today current number 290 according CDC tracker data Covid breakthrough cases amongst fully vaxxed people. 353 63 deaths considered caused Covid.  appears Michigan going last state fully reopen Whitmer set reopening date July 1st. think state set date late. Username checks out, lol. Jersey strong brother can't that, like can't force business stay lockdown mode.

I know least 3 restaurants remained open club, 4 got fines lifted. remained open everyone else locked pay cent.

If 4th wave come expect business Poland stay open rulings. walked work giving option vaccinated staff shed masks since last shift like 95% us did.

It almost felt like 2019  Besides buying RV (but spent last year working software financing RV loans, almost counts) pretty spot me. able spend months visiting family without using PTO, got promotion, saved gas, work clothes, make etc. Plus havent listen coworkers cough asses months swear allergies.  Sad! Yes joke 0% × 14% = 0%, next person's joke maybe really meant 0%+14%=14%. events destined happen regardless. Meaning, doesn’t matter whether Patient recived covid vaccination not, going go cardiac arrest next day. goes Patient B, even never received vaccine, still going die brain hemorrhage next day. lmao reddit moment guy responding to. Overly online people cannot imagine anyone would possibility want live evil imperial hellworld US could live magical utopian paradise Canada.
 
 Also they're 17. Well address first point, different terms privacy comes showing negative test showing vaccination card? anyone know safe fully vaccinated people smoke fully vaccinated people? actually surprise anyone? people dont give f*ck anyone themselves, STILL dont give f*ck anyone themselves?  cant fix stupid, usually buy beer. Hell It’s Ideally, everyone would apply logic. people arguing *either* side exact people arguing opposite year ago. True personally 1st offered took it, waiting dif one dumb unless allergic AstraZeneca one. actually reminding people people still dying suspect went people's head. 5 people die stupid event people freak out, 3000 die week we're like, eh whatever... joe flacco elite? Working home benefits absolutely staycation Damn thumbnail New York? nurse heels like   Several thousand people died today, die coronavirus. Yeah new video saw Japanese video cite claiming vaccine injection site becomes magnetic. bunch crock since neodymium magnet stick mention amount metal small injection cause permanent magnet 🎯 plus kids 12 immunocompromised people exist. 

Once achieve herd immunity, fine. early, fully vaccinated rate (across entire population, eligible folks) 40% Huh? 654 people

Would said thing one family members one ""654 people"" ?  standpoint water. There's going announcement shift schedule Québec Soon.

The way things going literally arms left Inject first doses end June. wouldnt say chaos almost impossible tell mask policy places since almost seem old signs. Also without almost notice businesses seem two options: dont require masks still require masks. seem single sign communication/ process store actual revised cdc message unvaccinated people. pushes idea masks optional everyone vs fully vaccinated go massless. Yes places would able verify vaccination tons data show power suggestion effective. Yep, know! Water wet, news 11. Especially idea every county one winner guaranteed. effective small rural counties large percentage vaccine skeptics. mean, likely links posted older studies focusing antibodies measure immune response. already said much [in 

In original post declared natural immunity short lived, articles posted support. supported antibody titers drop time (shocking!), know measure duration immunity and/or immune memory. understand ""but kids interact vaccinated adults"" argument. interact kids, also way know adults interact vaccinated. antibodies doesn’t mean immunity. couldn’t reinfect ppl it’s inhuman, don’t know sure immunity. know antibodies cell memory. Huge difference immunity. Well ya considering year ago beginning growing numbers. get supposed good news anyways lol. definitely worse Pfizer+BioNTech, relevant wait weeks get mRNA vaccine. Yes wasn’t spreading fast UK weeks ago it. affect EU countries haven’t accepted (publicly) yet make pandemic shorter two days do. Masks prevent spread protect wearer. pure propaganda highly effective vaccine criminal

I mean, really given could wait weeks mRNA vaccine (pfizer) effective less dangerous. cracks perspective numbers. 

600,000 deaths coincidentally occurred within several weeks 33 million positive Covid tests? course!

3,300 deaths coincidentally occurred within several weeks 200 million vaccinations? Impossible!  yet AZ far effective.

I think that's true. propaganda all, huge safety issue less effective. trying defeat argument, point wrong say ""White people leading everyone.""  almost exactly 80% deaths 65+. I’m 30s, still follow summer camp went age 10-17. one biggest highlights adolescence I’m still friends many camp friends. 

Camp closed last summer first time something like 60 years imagine devastated would been. precious years, especially towards end would completely heartbroken miss summer. little bit irony dog able sniff disease causes humans lose sense smell. 

Good boys nonetheless That's easy enough statistic quote parent worse young person deal long term effects easily preventable disease rest lives.  Yeah reason occasionally outdoors. I’m going one place another it’s pain take hands full Yup agree you. Hoping best them. effective cheaper ad campaign celebrity endorsement definitely list, LOT competition ""dumbest."" It’s denim GOP wants ban drive voting makes voting easier. GOP doesn’t like making easy vote, know they’re outnumbered democrats. GOP way, people vote old, white, retired people, since voters tend vote GOP. young, working class people able vote, tend vote democrat. places rules poorly? What's point?

Or fearful would accept anything think may help. Event without evidence ever will. first studies focused preventing symptoms - especially life threatening ones. vaccines excellent - basically prevent covid related deaths. started vaccinating people outside trials, looked whether vaccine prevents infection well started testing people - 95% time. one best vaccines ever made. mask service requires honor work.

Biden’s MO underpromising overdelivering. doubt would’ve made public promise wasn’t doable. shutting bad science good thing right? ""paranoid""... cautious paranoid. exactly : lemme put bold

**if unvaccinated wear mask**  Estimates 1.7 percent Sept 2020, rounded 2 ease calculation.

Seeing 1.7 figure country's whole health system overwhelmed 2nd wave covid deaths underreported begin with, 2 likely conservative figure underselling true mortality rate deny what? never said anything even remotely close that. invent stuff, around You’re never going able test whole population one metric track time % positive (positive tests/total tests). Early likely high testing limited sickest may even allowed test. certainly won’t capture many asymptomatic mild cases, people may even know virus. time, test rates increase, could easily see positives, you’re seeing even negatives looking positives doesn’t tell whole story...which % positive comes in. 

It’s also case fatality rate inflated early on. It’s simply deaths/confirmed cases. numerator rarely undercounted; denominator grossly undercounted; fatality rate seem much higher actually (why statistically projected IFR much better indicator risk). measles polio one point well 🙁  Yeah comment means nothing coming guy thats r/theredpill Bro could lied us update smh /s article idiotic : subject wrong. look vaccinated do, done.

follow simple logic

**if unvaccinated wear mask**

see? problem solved. Meanwhile Florida... Second straight day million doses, another .3% increase first dose shots Adults. Maybe Biden’s July goal isn’t unrealistic lol. 33 million Covid cases officially (and likely higher unofficial count), one-in-ten Americans Coronavirus. possible infected repeatedly, seem happen often. doubt one factors. Thank goodness! Got shots arms! think normal knowing go school building, maybe one day without masks, join clubs activities friends. agenda promote vaccinations. vaccinated done. look them, back normal lives already: concentrate unvaccinated UK 260 cases VITT around 38-40 deaths far I've read, they're really *that* few, though vaccines like smallpox's done less damage probably heels conducive giving shot. would want shot person. Maybe seeing horrors covid first hand (largely caused poor policies) prompted countries buy many vaccines outbid everyone else. Finally got jab feel modern German medicine coursing veins now. notable B.1.1.7 (in Taiwan) B.1.617 (Singapore likely places) suddenly causing leaks surges cases despite far successful measures taken Southeast East Asia.

Like insanely fast, place 100% B.1.1.7 previously. thing *extremely* contagious original measures likely semi-effective  Apologizes, specified ages. 

I friends young kids finally feeling optimistic decline numbers getting comfortable taking masked kids they're like...well, fuck. Nope. like updated last hour, super late today still Covid risk, *probably* going negligently kill someone. *might*, know vaccinated since present someone care Covid, *probably* won't. there's variant deadly goes around vaccine, *then* accidentally kill someone yourself.

You notably angry people still feel like masks necessary much country still vaccinated. Thanks rant, couldn’t said better myself. Short making illegal unvaccinated I'm sure else CDC could do. point people vaccinated want live that. Obviously percentage population cannot get vaccinated continue wear masks.

Another nice uptick 12+ 18+.

Also 65+ passing 85%!! Yeah, they're pretty fucked, compared emu's, they're little angels. Unless piss you. fall head. Cyrus shahpar tweeted update today, dont know cdc page fun. I’m still getting used new world. expecting CDC announce new guidance like that. expecting masks etc another couple months. It’s bit digest. registered bunch places March/April get vaccine, least 4 hit got first dose. Maryland can't get vaccine, imagine trying. Must fan Prince.

It's funny, happened me. ""Sir know that's door""

""Well I'm already here, might well roll it.""

He half chuckled end it. course pre-covid probably fucking me. :) really put South Korea japan boat.

South Korea heavily limited supplier issues. hand, japan millions doses storage, sitting incompetent bureaucracy large percentage anti-vaxxers.

Once vaccine actually starts getting exported worldwide, expect South Korea quickly start vaccinating japanese voluntarily choose to. Whether aware not, entirely possible agenda based obviously leading questions asking. Another example:

If smoking bad you, come many people it?? know people smoke develop lung cancer? controversy something cause health problems huge number people???

You could hide behind obvious agenda saying ""jUsT aSkInG qUeStIoNs,"" make agenda less obvious  1 30/40,000? find statistics? curiosity, 1 100,000 youngs less older people received lung transplant someone throes active aggressive COVID infection. possible exposed? 90% wants vaccinated, beginning July (around July 1st) goal every willing adult vaccinated might achievable. would probably take week extra turnout 90%. would great, means around 73% total population probably fully vaccinated somewhere end July. Also assume around third remaining population natural immunity due infection people 18 vaccinated well. end, pretty much herd immunity immunity COVID-19 (through adult non-adult vaccination infection) 90% total population summer probably breakthrough cases. course variants could make things worse, knowing booster shots (potentially updated variants even) potentially standing ready fall need, extra updated shots 2022 2023 well. 

Cases dropping quickly hospitalisations quickly dropping since last 2 weeks. deaths significantly dropping since early January measures loosened since January. Opening things going quicker last weeks, expect continue accelerate coming weeks, cases, hospitalisations deaths continue significantly dropping, due vaccinating quickly, high vaccination turnout, high levels immunity seasonal effect. Flu wide spread school age kids get exposed pretty much every year. Chances getting covid quite comparable. no, dangerous flu heathy kids age 12. Everyone freaked covid relatively new unknown, flu well known virus everyone comfortable accepted risk.  Way smaller hundredths. still long way go things looking better every day. wish we’d track Long Haul COVID rates. Surveys show stuff might hit 10% infected. know bunch anti-vaxers I'm trying combat misinformation. anyone info compelling enough perhaps convince hostile audience? Key points are:

Nope. tested positive still symptoms 6 months later.

It’s rare, happens. Yeah totally agree make wear mask get negative test I’m super mad got many downvotes said certain group people denied service Choice made. weeks ago nytimes ran scaremonger article we’d never reach herd immunity  PA announced day CDC issued guidance would also require masks indoors vaccinated people.  CDC say whether masks mandates go away. say trust things presented trustworthy based actual analysis. think like that, might right sometimes rarely right reasons. Kids mask Fall enough adults get motivated get vaccinated. wish complainers would realize this. get zero covid safe enough.

If want masks schools- get covid shot. Non-covid pneumonia killed children pandemic covid. Guess group viruses generally causes pneumonia children. Shhh, doesn’t fit narrative. mean far _managing_ pandemic, yeah, really handled shit well, especially compared Europe Americas. still less 2000 deaths _total_ Covid. diagnosis children, tendency evolve ASPD some. aren’t far off. spice must flow. funny sub changed. Normally get upvotes suggessting makes sense new variants.  overlap two groups? Many may gotten COVID without symptoms, rocked jab months later.... think mean people don’t like look. 100% adults ever vaccinated either. right 0% kids 12 vaccinated fall. Yesterday report around virus ravaging rural India. 90% cases unaccounted Kids borderline risks respect COVID-19, research far.

Kids low risk everything. mean make best effort protect them. Nobody lose child negligent practices. Anyone lost child, even ICU (myself included) know pain. Quoting stats help matter all. think word means think means. Immune compromised people always risk disease. Isn’t normal said people take proper measures protect themselves? family member care vaccine hesitant? soon, new variants? part surprised me.

It surprise me. lot rhetoric first months precisely ""we shut country young people risk"" even despite change administration, pervasive opinion first 9 months led many think ""why get it? I'm risk dying"" nearly 48 hours since (M22) received first dose Covishield (Astrazeneca). mild soreness point injection yesterday, side effects. people internet otherwise fever, aches etc. others pointed body developing immunity virus. concerned weather get proper vaccine ( cold chain maintained)? That's losing mind. certainly warrant stupid bullshit strawman OP invented. 

I definitely understand concern wanting perceived selfish sociopath. There's going transition period sure. fucking virus us long. God hope right. I'm pregnant American expat. hard home long able risk flying home vaccine. Waiting get jab NL seems far ! supposed prove vaccination? hope they're expecting us carry card everywhere us.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*   You’re right it’s easier enforce rules everywhere.

Not sure long virus stays surfaces, long don’t touch face using sanitizer good hand wash, think it’ll fine.

For outdoors, risk extremely low, virus dissipates quickly. That’s understanding. Written web sites accept state visitors without vaccination. bad news another successful country succumbs rona thought vaccine helps boost immune response previously infected people, well alleviate symptoms true northeast, thought 2nd wave rest country experienced summer last year. I'm fine this. Really decent use taxpayer money. 

When last stimulas check issued, thought shame link receiving vaccine (if enough vaccine everyone time) 

I know arguments this, dont care. Unprecedented times. 

Sometimes efficient way get people something protect give another incentive.  every country (except AU/NZ) lifts lockdowns get zero cases, sacrifice wasted. family received 2nd vaccine April 21st great. Peace mind really big part it, too. hard find good source, question assertion 20-30 less risk COVID flu.

This article suggests claim appears true children, true age 15 according article. fact could find single source back claim.

So unless claim people spread misinformation 20-30 justifying decisions based upon misinformation, I'm going say likely wrong.

Now claim misinformation causing people wrongly avoid vaccine due estimating risk, would agree you.

Also 20-30 good demographic group contains two different generations often clear generational gap. I'd suggest assertion logic likely much true 18-25 26-30. Demand fear outstrips supply going football nightclubs anything else rest world restrictions. test capacity increased meet demand understood testing. 

Also, testing(short testing everyone time) fuck widespread transmission masks help mitigate that. policy counties could safe outside long distanced. Taiwan policy issue, let pilots quarantine days think Australia's flu deaths went 910 due border closures lockdowns,,,, Unvaccinated people create new variants getting infected once. lead strain protected vaccine. there's always possibility strain deadlier infectious well. title. June 15.

Also, they're requiring vaccinations, know heard this. Californian, guys beautiful state too! Planning travel San Francisco Canada next week. Anyone Bay Area know TSA ask plans self isolation? know quarantine upon arrival mandatory US, curious anything specific San Francisco know. numbers actually low people getting tested?  doctor vauge says, ""When feel better."" know looks like mono. said, already sick almost month still fever on. wish body too.  That's absolutely wild. state Australia goes lockdown one two public transmissions reported. world's shortest path backfiring right here.

""So find people who've gotten chipped avoid them? Awesome!"" Spain desperate tourists. harsh lockdown, pissed away opening up. stocks money. 🤦‍♂️

You sell cash. Thats do. special forms sell large holdings.

When u buy home, u do? Get loan.

When buy yacht thats worth ur tiny house, sell stock. real money, according comments Im reading. 🙄 Also AstraZeneca/Covishield, one gave mother example. Here's even better way putting it: bunch folks claimed take every precaution 14 months, tired pandemic, fuck anyone them. Way go Joe! anyone memory problems vaccine? clarity, I’m pro vaccine. However, week second dose, started serious memory issues. (I keep diary. first notice one week second shot.

It’s two months hasn’t cleared up. I’ve got appointment neurologist 4 weeks. (That’s nearest appointment.) wondering anyone else similar ssues. heartbroken ill bet never invented vaccine

Lol thats bar set, many people  thing bad things happen people time. given 200 million doses many opportunities people attribute random bad luck vaccine. 

Actual studies decide really correlation. Individual stories pretty meaningless Exactly like... lol No, feeling sick may want put compound symptoms side effects expose people vaccine clinic, there's reason screen asymptomatic people vaccination. Fuck yeah lot people side effects one two shots. But...

The second shot mostly protect people around you. cases falling sacrifice couple days help friends. cases start rising, B.1.351/multivalent boosters become available, that's time get second shot. I'm 40's honestly no. fine. also got shot January/February though, lot negative press booze vax yet dropped (or least seen it). are. USA needs Taiwan keep China check. Taiwan gives China microchips USA fucked Yes factors impact. think fall winter months quite telling year. Taiwan always help USA microchips computer parts. USA really donate vaccines instead hoarding Ask doctor understanding idea confuse compound symptoms vaccine side effects. brilliant. venn diagram people spend ton money lottery tickets likely overlaps greatly group people refuse vaccination. taste smell fun guess Dude originally 30 positives pool 100 3%... typo, downvotes, deleted comment ""why downvotes"", says ""maybe cuz typo""...

I saying absolutely *nothing all* veracity numbers, talking typo, longer exists. I'm really part conversation anymore point :) looking forward media creating doomsday scenarios there’s slight uptick fall Really is

When CDC says might've totally missed 75% infections due failure test broadly enough know botched According article Japan 1.5 MILLION hospital beds, 20% hospitals treating COVID patients, resulting tens thousands patients essentially wait disease (or die) home?

They obviously capacity. gross mismanagment that's leading people denied hospital care one advanced nations world, dying it.

It's year, health care system done anything try deal growing outbreak country? Forget field hospitals, enough time build actual hospitals handle increased patient loads. I'm surprised strident response government prolonged mismanagement pandemic Japan. people would consider worth time try change minds. Everybody else unfriend, online real life. Tom MySpace currently active. Please stop 9/11 comparisons. It’s can’t vaccinate world’s poor 30 billion dollars. problem currently doses, money doses.  numbers supported original study data, leaves one effect population level huge effect: vaccines lower transmission rate even get infected.

All evidence UK/Israel suggests vaccine lowers rate symptomatic infection, lowers rate transmission even infected. means population scale risk infection goes even prevent 95% getting symptomatic infection, also lowers transmissibility.

Basically risk getting sick exposed lower, rate exposure lower (assuming decent quantity people vaccinated: note take everyone). hopping plane India right now, going back normal US/UK different story. dumbass antivax parents still claim moral issue CONSERVATIVES: Hold vaccine 

Yeet!!!!!!!! Sad come this. I've heard stories people second shot makes feel like crap. felt like dying 24 hour flu years ago. Testing capacity could there, like guy said, spend money tell people sew old tshirts put face free? doses required? second shot described booster shot. 
And would safe enough remove mask occasionally public? fucking understand resistance vaccination. makes absolutely zero sense me. handle internal pain well. Leave Reddit always turn something race thing. day got vaccine shot, contend tender arm got shot. took Tylenol PM went bed early, woke chills. neck sore trying teeth chatter together. woke twice curled ball covers. day 2, woke feeling fatigued drained. bothered get bed go bathroom, ended holding 2 hours finally getting strength get go. 
After felt tired, drained. much appetite. took tylenol PM went bed. 
On third day woke eyes hurting head felt like vice, throat felt sensitive sore. hated anything, ended going outside mow. think molnupiravir promising early outpatient treatment MABs?  tell really spelled HIPPO. looked faq find answer question understand may solid answer. 

I first shot Moderna April. due vaccinated month, unfortunately, vaccination day urgent care diagnosed mono. usual age category mono, 49 symptoms fatigue, fever, spleen liver enlargement generally feeling like hammered shit. sick month, diagnosed mono two weeks. still low grade fevers night highest 100.8.

I told hold second vaccine better, know better looks like. fatigue night fevers fine.  read fatigue last 18 months. second dose seems like would another first dose.

Should approach fever? go away 24 hours come back vengeance.  given clear answers know safe get second vaccination? fever gone 48 hours? week? know even though rates case covid would kill sure. told protection long? Help. Woohoo! We’re winning! vaccinated unvaccinated sections stadium, someone came state would need sit unvaccinated sections.  lot people don’t anyone life that’s high risk. there’s point getting shot 

So chance passing old lady grocery store, vulnerable person enough make get free vaccine? Give strength. Yes. person even came concept mRNA vaccines board BioNTech.

The UK's infection rate 4x lower Germany's people died yesterday Germany died last 3 weeks UK. article used bad science though. Eh we've beginning. stupid us getting diplomatic benefit we're still behind vaccinating population. binary. 

We starting get data, looks like lot fully vaccinated immunocompromised chronically ill folks building many antibodies need robust immunity. 

 likely tiny subset breakthrough cases, likely get lot sicker average breakthrough.

Other people going maskless reach herd immunity puts many like risk. ""return normal"" far horizon me. Sure, merely 200 times effective preventing fatalities still result twelve-fold lower case count. Compared country article stems, least. Powers like US, China, Russia, even UK, use vaccine diplomacy means geopolitical influence. time EU step ramp production provide world without ties attached. international division labor common produce Western products third world third world countries labor cost. That's big vaccine production capacity India provide third world vaccines via Covax, financed rich countries.

I’m saying is, got dizzy taking vaccine... what? automatically assume it’s vaccine could anything. Dizziness broad, mild general symptom, ask 200,000,000 vaccinated people feeling bit ‘off’ bit dizzy since vaccinated you’re going get many thousands people saying are... would statistically weird didn’t. asked amount people ‘have feeling bit unwell/dizzy since last full moon?’ you’re also going get lot people saying been... doesn’t mean full moon making ill. 

Because many millions people getting vaccinated, join dots individual experiences create picture want. It’s choice entirely course, step back second make sure you’ve thought possibilities refuse second jab willingly leave open Covid infection.  ""permanent""   That’s bold statement. think Poland, Bulgaria, Romania (just name few) advanced pharmaceutical facility/capability?

Those fantastic numbers second survey linked, 87% recent measure, upward trend last 2 months may climb further. uptake like (plus impressive levels supplies coming + approval already done 12s) Canada amazing position coming weeks. Lol wait till Indian variant hits initiative EU countries, like Covax May last year, even managed WHO. Pfizer Janssen vaccines developed produced EU. long DPA prevents exports US-made vaccines, even vaccines US companies come Europe. EU wants US everybody else participate since can't save world own. know, facetious. Idiots find way/excuse vaccinate stuff keep coming back.  Good.

I'm UK way eradicate quickly... stop spreading! fact comment getting downvoted really tell everything  no? Conversely also means number people negative get test done. simple probability, number people get tested, lesser positivity rate since much likely covid negative positive. 

Low positivity rate large testing higher significance normal testing nos. unless there's exceptions.

Put simply high positivity rate means testing enough low +tivity rate testing properly. country high positivity rate starts testing more, positivity rate falls. Simple math boat.

My intention necessarily terms _why_ delayed, various reasons

Every country's situation different. I'm _very_ familiar especially latest chaos Japanese vaccine booking system, I'm _vaguely_ familiar Korean shortage issues...but idea what's going with, say, Taiwan, NZ, Australia, etc.

People saying study shouldn’t believed “use modeling, actual data” idea talking about.

I’m assuming think modeling means bunch complicated math barely looking data make conclusions based math, study all.

I’m arguing results, pointing criticism based ‘modeling’ invalid unless don’t want take statistical analysis seriously surprised eventually everyone get one booster shots coming years regardless vaccine originally received. 

Earlier week position able choose two appointments next week receive first vaccination shot - either AZ J&amp;J, depending day chose.

After day reading it, I've chosen receive J&amp;J, purely single shot allows get back living normal life sooner. fully expect need supplemented point future, might much info available now, change.  know people snort street drugs, smoke, drink regularly getting it.  No, true Funny quickly sentiment changed lol! competition, Germany want make situation worse already is. Awsome Good.  I'm glad.   sure that, live freed testing (to enter bars, hospitals, restaurants,.... countries) 9 months vaccination. Afterwards need antibody test new vaccine.

For disease six months. I'm span need antibody test every three months Especially something truly matter. people still want wear masks, affect meaningful way. hate break you, every statistical analysis ever see ‘statistical model’.

This criticism makes sense.

I think bigger thing mention increased cases deaths school reopenings (assuming true) one part full cost-benefit analysis done determining whether reopenings mistake. 

Keeping shut may saved lives medical costs, also may permanently damaged future life outcomes thousands students. Plenty people missed lost opportunities. sucks quickly catching up, thankfully. Ah. Well sucks.

End February everybody freaking italy lockdowns hospital pressure.  Time get CNN.

I highly doubt reach 50% kids December…anti vaccine parents going allow kids get vaccine. 

While agree mutants go back valid point, anti vaccine people already wearing masks spreading ever want, been! Vaccinated people aren’t spreading anything! children masked unvaccinated adults masked. 

Do cut credit cards stop someone else stealing identity? logic. seems like either little contagious B117 and/or little immune escape (but less SA Brazil).

So might worst variant, probably significantly worse problem ones. would make big problem countries vaxxed and/or avoided huge waves last spring/this winter. That's rampaging India whereas west likely simply slow drop cases (which variants already doing). I’ll still mask indoors while. Even vaccinated, new territory I’d rather safe sorry.   No?? don’t “very high chance contagious”, it’s complete opposite actually. Wow, almost like telling people ""you take mask get vaccinated"" incentivizes get vaccinated. could guessed that?

**sorry keep hoping , guest. repeat vaccines work**

I said repeat *yourself*, around No, opinion around September kids vaccinate. 

Vaccinated people much risk pose little risk others. issue care others. 

On top spreads greater risk mutations render vaccines ineffective. I’m gonna say it. 

Global Socialized Medical Care. you’re going talk efficacy, could least get basics right. 95% efficacy mean 5% people get COVID. means vaccines 95% effective baseline. also work known VOCs. top that, community spread live (New York) quite low *because 60% adults already least one shot*. positive test rate back 1%.

The point is, Malta almost 70% whole population, adult population claimed. See link data. Worrying Canada going first dose approach won’t get people second doses while.

People keep quoting numbers show either aurgueing bad faith idea vaccination calculations work.

You take total number documented breakthrough cases divide total number people vaccinated, tell anything. That's like saying 85% effective vaccinated 15% non-vaccinated people positive COVID test. compare number breakthrough cases number cases among non-vaccinated people.

I think numbers support conclusion.      
 scenario much risk pandemic measures, risk weighted non-vaccinated group measures place (unless propose deprive young people indefinitely pre-pandemic liberties). see take important distinction account. huge epidemic sure. reality low numbers China. Perhaps official numbers (they probably lied one point) anywhere close US can’t double triple 600k number

Well yes can. logical. 

On one hand, dictature weighted could early epidemic. Totally locking home millions people. like half-ass lockdowns countries: locked home like police there. continued dictature way dealing things: ensure China wear mask, wear mask.

On hand, moronic president denied hidden domestic pandemic banning flights testing population. moronic population never really fully lockdown, never accepted things like wearing masks try see other. thing somehow saved US compared Europe strong car culture strong street/bar/restaurant culture, live bigger houses less grandma living home. Masks required cdc everyone regardless vaccination status hospitals example doesn’t hold up.

Wearing masks isn’t “pausing world”. way past lockdowns. fair, island really helped Australia NZ throughout whole thing.  Lotteries attract people bad probability. also people gotten vaccine yet. Sorry, US? Honestly asking one argued unvaccinated people need wear masks! vast majority businesses around country states requiring proof cant! logic laid never unmask impossible people prove fact vaccinated! 

You second person try throw unvaccinated people face, show ever disagreed unvaccinated people need wear mask? Please? It’s rule CDC said needs followed businesses local authorities decide enforce mask mandates need to. solution check vaccine cards they’re that. thing Korea done successfully pandemic, less Japan too.

Which is, funnily enough, exactly works EU too. I’m thinking key point made absolutely way determine whether dude without mask vaccinated not, purely honor system. we’ve learned anything last year, 1. People honorable, 2. Many anti-vax also probably likely saunter store maskless use excuse mask - including lying vaccinated. elated. think it’s psychological anything. It’s CDC’s job push people away safety measures. job inform people disease risk. guidance explicitly says that:

**Unvaccinated people need wear masks**. 

Two ways accomplish this:

1. Require masks everyone. 

2. Check vaccine cards.

Since Starbucks neither they’re breaking cdc guidance. worst? C'mon, man. I've heard worse getting enough. Damn didn’t know  Getting mrna booster vectored prime would theoretically good; potentially better either itself. lot countries research - UK Canada particular since lot AZ first doses. want wait 3-6 months first dose though (again, like Canada UK get vaccinated stronger immune response). Japan's entire covid response centered around isolating blaming spread foreigners. got 2nd Moderna shot yesterday. side effects arm soreness little bit fatigue (which completely fine 1.5-2 hr nap).

So fine take them? Thanks avance! uk never said dont export production way low lol, uk sites produce meant produced. designed certain quantities. 

Again explanation uk export vaccines? could. not? constitutionally guaranteed rights citizens even pandemic can’t deny. still quarantine can’t denied entry. reason UK get millions vaccines due contract, back September 2020. UK criticise AZ publicly though.

No idea looking link trusting moron Boris Johnson though. Yes, UK *also* get vaccines EU.

The entire point EU collective vaccine purchase prevent richer countries pulling ahead front smaller poorer countries. Rich countries continue efforts sake EUs solidarity.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* last time: 95% efficacy means roughly 0.05% incidence COVID breakthroughs. It’s damn February 9, total 5,455 health care workers UCSD 9,535 UCLA received second dose 2 weeks previously; findings correspond positivity rate 0.05%. think would safe enough take mask swig water customers? opposite? CDC says masks required people vaccinated. policy Starbucks adopting. They’re protesting company’s decision drop mask mandate vaccinated customers.  not, though. look vaccination doses administered per 100 population, Germany pretty high compared EU countries. would help much. Canada's vaccinating 0.9% population day. Demand probably going start slowing within 1-2 weeks. basically late use them. exported elsewhere.

In fact Canada sending proportion vaccines elsewhere point. countries need far more. lot countries still elderly even medical staff unvaccinated, meanwhile Canada vaccinating 18 year olds people even young 12 right now. literally lol uk export single vaccine. imported millions doses eu.

It defakto ban. export despite eu contact naming factories uk divilery sites effectively banned exports.

You're splitting hairs. Identity politics. US already government databases track vaccinated isn't. still infection. It’s taking way longer expected people feel comfortable wearing mask. sure it’s based anything mom always told takes 3 weeks break habit. It’s aligned experience quitting smoking stopping bad habits. 

Anyway wonder whether applies unmasking. I’m red town New Hampshire 60% least partially vaccinated. one people wearing one Target today. One guy started taking saw told save next time. cancel vacation trip last year Malta. I’m looking forward rescheduling, within next couple years. need wait, live African country, idea started soon cases started popping up. exactly ""show papers"" state? nonsense. nothing stopping firm producing exporting vaccines UK. case one producer said vaccines UK, contract UK legally sound. government policies banning exports, sadly gets constantly spun UK ban exports. 9/11, unlike covid, politicized hell. Therefore, majority Americans supported measures taken post-911, including inconviniences infringements came them, packaged nice bipartisan ""greater good / national security"" pill. Thats takes. opinion, Americans much inclined oppose measures perceive individual rights /freedoms, compared people countries, long actions framed right way, support sides aisle. 

For record, dont think vaccine passports (a digital, app based records verify persons vaccination status government database) bad idea, combined incentives wear masks socially distance others. Especially right now, kind zone regards many people vaccinated, vaccine passports simplify things places like large businesses, recreational facilities concerts etc. hope allow atleast 1 dose vaccinated ppl Nah I’m fully vaxed don’t support domestic events. Governments big tech talks digital vaccine passports quite now, don’t trust oversee broad, far-reaching technology. fundamentally disagree forcing individual provide digital medical documentation order enter domestic event. Every time cede rights government/big business cooperation, scope gets expanded beyond originally presented, average citizen little recourse. Seems completely reasonable. unfortunately they've heavily politicized US, forcing private businesses deal burden trying follow masking guidelines. second link


But AstraZeneca’s CEO pointed UK signed contract three months EU UK factory also started operating earlier, increasing supply Like “shifted” Austria kids could in-person schooling cried get rid America? Fuck guy. It’s actually opposite. CDC guidelines say unvaccinated need masked, employees fighting for. someone U.S. immunosuppressed vaccinated (possibility antibodies vaccination though due medications) chances getting black fungus? something unique Indian variant could possibly could spread countries? .........no shit.  pretty hard track though. like government GP know gained 10 kg last year. vaccination center do? Weigh come vaccine? also seems like get weeks priority best. year vaccine weeks minimal impact. vaccine made available 2.5 weeks moving country. able go back second dose. figured protection better none. reddit moment dumb people think capitalizing words makes right? I'm sure much know EU, made 27 sovereign countries. That's UK could set successful vaccination program still follow EU rules well. Oh nice I'm glad switch flipped we're safe. Thankfully carpet bombed vaccine 100% population. /r/topmindsofreddit CDC states “a disease eliminated geographic region endemic cases disease occur within region,” whereas disease declared eradicated “the worldwide incidence infection drops zero.” 

Eliminated term want. Covid, like every disease highly effective vaccine, likely eliminated soon enough many countries. Man conservatives hard-on blocking boarders 😂 valveless ones simple find. one example many. people want good masks readily available now, personal concern sure heck would upgrading. Future headline: Unvaccinated Americans killing record numbers. rest America shrugs. 70% great number vaccine.  Publix FL walk see employees customers alike without masks others still wear them. wl get there. Yeah can. Unless protected group, business reject literally reason want. 

If ask proof vaccination tell no, tell leave can't anything it. Private businesses ask anything discriminationg based protected class. require drug tests, think can't require people prove vacccinated answer question? Businesses ask, require employees get certain types tests/treatment want to. I've required get TB test certain innoculations jobs.    companies give employees weeks notice lifting mask mandate. CA right way, budge, even though lot pressure to. model based actual statistics, seems like actually read it. downvoted complaining downvoting lel is, ""Not wanting die,"" owning Repubs?

In 1.5 million vaccinated people DoD, mortality rate COVID-19 people vaccinated 0%. That's typo, literally 0 people 1.5 million DoD vaccinated people died COVID-19.

You substantially likely die car crash getting COVID-19 vaccinated. It'll safe enough rates transmission much lower now. keep hearing ""never"" ""forever"" argument masks understand people think masks masks rest lives. Eventually, probably far future, enough vaccinated people virus stop spreading effectively disappear except perhaps pockets high levels unvaccinated people movement areas high infection (likely, both). 

It's pretty clear CDC made decision guidelines based safety. They're based rates hospitalization, tolerance restrictive measures like masks, desire pressure unvaccinated getting vaccinated removing one protective measures. change premature consideration safety stopping spread. works fine main concern make sure hospitals overwhelmed (as they're unlikely be) want spook people getting duffs getting shots.  Immunocompromised people fully vaccinated develop antibody response victims selfish callous attitude. deserve reaction.

Additionally become sick risk creating variants possibly evade vaccines. can't find hearts wear masks social distance compassionate responsible person; want prolong pandemic increasing chance catastrophic variant Agreed, think would Facebook clone takes spot. never really concerned acquiring covid. Never quarantine. Work public every day. want mask anymore. Never did. give fk drs nurses wearing time. I'm them. work 12 hours day, 6 days week. Bye bye mask.

Japan's innovatiom way ahead time prior Japan's lost decade. 30 years passed much innovation made throughout world, innovation exceeds 80s. lol wut think states closed mass vaccination sites? Couldn’t handle demand? Thats people use high altitude simulating masks training.

Because they're suckers marketing?  Summer break coming soon, huge issue, though worry summer school. course already EU , countries reported presence, , growing fast UK. 10x less people holding needles delivering doses, proportionality works ways went store today without mask. first time I've gone anywhere public without one felt weird. mask requirements dropped I'm fully vaccinated cashiers lot customers still wearing felt kind like asshole. swear I'm one people! there's anything big pharma *should* earning money from, surely quickly putting together vaccines producing billions exactly want? made bil quarter Oh understand. advice gave quoted doesn’t address unlikely chance vaccinated person infects others.

I’m genuinely confused scientists UK believe vaccinated people infect unvaccinated people. saying avoid explaining segmentation mention? maybe people UK still vaccinated primarily one dose only?

It’s rhetorical argumentative question. US vaccinated people going unmasked based idea (I thought proven least established high degree confidence) fullyvaccinated don’t transmit virus. Thats me. teetering. mask won. people work Hollywood remotely rich fyi Justin Trudeau incredibly polarizing Canada, crisis, it’s default position large percentage population claim federal government screwing everything up. agree.

I'd say we're agreement. like AZ vaccine poor efficacy. fact, local transmission happening, sudden uptick self paid vaccination program Taiwan. Then, government pause save doses healthcare workers high risk groups.

No doubt there's geopolitical mess China vaccine procurement, way now. Covid find way - simply matter time, trying stay zero indigenous cases monumental, exhausting, isolating task country. Trust science!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Personally, think masking policy used kind weird incentive encourage people get vaccinated (""hey kids, get vaccinated wear smelly old mask!""). 

If want people get vaccinated, tackle head on, making easier, giving direct incentives, making sure free, alleviating people's worries it. Also, realize number people getting vaccines may never get high enough cause number cases drop strategy alone, *want* everyone wearing mask public spaces. less risk, risk. Covid still kill them.

As sad is, COVID infected killed adults rates infected killed children, would taken measures did. could read public health professional’s take could keep saying it’s wrong, that’s choice That's mortality rate confirmed covid cases, total mortality rate. That's also high end estimate. children either asymptomatic experience light symptoms tested it. *public* money... Spending public supposed works... first time pandemic, actually feel relatively safe bar. Like, many positive cases have, odds actually ending room infected person, I'm fully vaccinated well. We're getting point bar vaccinated might less risky going store used be.  gets low, diminishing returns happen small variance trends. example, Israel low, 10 cases day, 25 next, 15, 8. case numbers low, trend variance almost irrelevant. Wait, costco samples take car? displays....

Also, probably 7,000 people died US today.  huge population around 3 million people born year unfortunately around 3 million die. 

We’re likely right around point like 97% daily deaths non-COVID causes equal parts morbid encouraging far pandemic goes grandfather better protected delay. Fun fact, forced pay parking ticket. let go long enough warrant issued arrest. say ""nah want arrested"" literally kill you. parking ticket.

Note, think that's right either live world lots things people want forced them. like seem voting wrong people. sayin Yeah

Well mean username makes us know mind right place think want wrong. hope SF follows... Probably didn’t want see shot going arm also pose position photo.  Good riddance think people start realizing people date vaccinated people they'll get vaccinated people. Pushing unvaccinated people away real world good way get want vaccinated. Vaccines taking 10-15 years developed *almost* bullsh*t, mean true actually false. Though 1 year still impressive: let's break down:

Usually vaccines take 1-2 years begin trials actual bureaucracy, real study time. Usually vaccines take time develop base, Sars-CoV1 work precedent borrowed past experience (some months-years work) got past that, scratch. That's true least Adenovirus vaccines, sure mRNAs. 

Gathering volunteers long process standard conditions, may well take 1-2 years, time needed since many people came spontaneously enough volunteer, since well found pandemic. 

Usually normal trial reviews, vitro first, animal testing, Phase 1, phase 2, later Phase 3. Animal testing already performed got good, needed point iterations. Phase 1-3s run normally except done parallel sequence, Phase 1 take 2-4 years (remember volunteers gathering too), Phase 2 same, Phase 3 one year, parallel takes 4 years 9. security result. 

What yet helped?

Usually vaccines engineered replication original virus inactivating it, takes time develop specific industrial processes, result satisfying, iterate process takes time. mRNA vaccines less effort needed. mRNA virus recipe piece (spike protein case). recipe alike RNA viruses, means processes designed maybe flu diseases could immediately employed targeting Sars-CoV2 spike protein, old fashion guys designing inactivated virus processes Sars-CoV2. mRNA study past 30 years, bit silly claim everything happened year. 

And last, contrary anti-vaxxers beliefs, vaccine designers usually much financed, going low budget unsurprisingly lengthen time reach task. Billions thrown time record fast bureaucracy, done wonder many mRNA vaccines could already gotten. 

What bureaucracy issue time wasn't. Money thrown. Volunteers ran researchers, Phase I–III parallelised, mRNAs fastened usually slower approach, Adenovirus trick less well yet better classic vaccines. lot effort scientific community taken once, 100 vaccines fastly started studies. 

What scientific miracle enough beaten road performed, surprising enough satisfying unbelievable and/or, skeptics, dangerous. 

It's bad comparisons past, they're better contextualized hope SF follows... probably try drag long possible... Again. don't. kinda tired now.... fav...check previous reply: Outdoor transmission rare enough big concern, transmission people carpooling beach easy. higher positivity, cases missing less trustworthy case numbers are. goes high, mentally replace case number giant question mark. odds transmitting outdoors low, thirty feet away?

Also looked data region/time person posts. data always matched sources. sad hung giving data rather data correct. sure baseball follow it, hockey require residency. assume applies baseball. can't verify vaccine status also accept proof negative PCR test within 72 hours, offer site rapid testing(for fee course). Chill intolerant. Right, concerns wanting answers pushing agenda. Case point. I'm (Can) getting first shot next week day friend (USA) ten years junior getting second shot. Vaccine rollout insane. None new. American Biology major, frustrated American leadership ignorant citizens. even covid? Hope companies tank. Yeah it’s this. People lot side effects idea go twice there’s alternative you’re one done attractive. Plus gives time 12-16 group get fully vaccinated everything opens up. telling CDC made wrong call, pressure make right one risk undoing everyone's sacrifices. Vaccine passports tool toolbox desperately need. telling mask indefinitely. hope everyone expect pandemic end month two.  encourage people go maskless 2/3rd folks vaccinated, virus get 2/3rd population experiment mutate. likelihood herd immunity goes virus becomes moving target. Oh I'm relieved. Hopefully first dose strong enough mean time.

Illinois planning June 11, Chicago keeping restrictions place July, we’re right there. True Sign. hope Florida follows suit, highly doubt people generally referring vaccine passport centralized government run way verifying vaccination. telling companies need figure verify own, could asking see paper cards private company running database vaccinations. nice work. Right it’s probably artificially low due “logistical” issues. even recent events numbers crazy low doubt untested spike anything. So, accurate numbers:

100m people infected (CDC estimates)

160m people vaccinated. That's 50% Americans. 

So, lets assume percentage people got infected pretty linear population. means, 160m people vaccinated, 30% COVID. 

So, 190m protected. That's pretty close 60%. someone says never money...it's always money. less reaction second dose moderna colleague Covid, says experience awful. got first shot Moderna. 

Her immune system went hyperdrive...she felt fevers, body aches, headaches...she felt like crap 12-15 hours terrified something gone wrong. went away.

Clearly risks kids low. Lower say playing contact sport thru school.

Vaccines look safe, tested young kids. Also many developmental impacts may take show. (Looks good far though)

So main justification get kids vaccinated protect frail society. Fine me, force youngest protect weakest...hmmm

When it’s available I’ll definitely get kids vaccinated. There’s reason unless trial studies say something different. person vaccinated stopped potential infected person well potential vector. 

No, greatly reduced chance become vector, ""stopped"" chance vector. There's huge important difference two statements. large indoor events, going grocery store. Hence """" eradicated ""just clear"" bottom. think would make lot sense talk realistic terms. cigarettes + energy drink breakfast people.

but worked. understand perfectly concerns (are mine well). but

Here's video explains efficacy problem comparing vaccines based alone: Strange thing come people helped create vaccines save lives money. human endeavor seems like kind awarded financially. change guidelines hopefully remove one extra political argument that's persisting (not saying ever turned political issue somehow did), hopefully help healing partisan divide USA going through

The CDC changing guidelines greatly increased politicization COVID mitigation measures US, done exact opposite helping heal anything. *pauses licking door knob* EU ""By end March 2021, least 80% people age 80, 80% health social care professionals every Member State get vaccinated. summer 2021, Member States have vaccinated a minimum 70% entire adult population.""
Adult population! low target. concern. autoimmune disease. I've thriving position working remotely company wants us back bc CDC says fine. Basically, company protected lawsuits, letting us work remotely never safety. 

I know many people team refusing vax. I'm honestly scared go back work also pissed bc team performing better home. Rules say vaccinated people around vaccinated people. 2/3 vaccinated. occurred higher infection rates fewer vaccinations might good reason let new variants? Yes…why would not? vaccine passed clinical trials concerning children? yes!!

""target vaccinating 70 per cent population aged 16 ""  agree people even admit anxiety. pretty clear issues. tolerable effective rate reproduction virus? similar typical flu? Somewhat less that?

Operating assumption virus isn’t going away, point suggest start behaving like normal?

Not discount personal risk groups (I certainly empathize personal stresses anxieties), hear lot comments effect “there still risk let’s allow anything yet” instead “the appropriate amount risk ‘X’, still weeks/months/decades away”. 

My non-expert view hospitals capacity manage 6 consecutive weeks increases (giving societal reaction time), currently effective R &lt;0.95 healthcare region, take next phase resumption normal life. still trying get rid severe lockdown.

No aren't. authorities specifically said full lockdown necessary. asked people work home ordered many workplaces ignored request. put limits gatherings closed venues, nothing close kind lockdown use zero-covid countries like New Zealand Australia. 

In Australia NZ kind outbreak would see everyone banned leaving house except walk around local area alone businesses except supermarkets pharmacies forced close. Taiwan hope eliminating virus. 

On top Taiwan shockingly low testing rate, idea widespread virus already is. certainly render COVID non-issue, sooner later.

I agree, simply eradication. seriously think matter time people. 

After 9/11, remember hearing many people, ""i'm never flying again"". years later extremely rare. 

If feeling way struggling it, would strongly recommend slowly exposing time. 

So maybe going mall wearing mask window shop, maybe wearing mask outdoors park. Slowly ramping exposure point normalcy. may take time, people this. Following rules set CDC. Following science saying risk spreading virus. think evidence vaccines ever reducing ""natural"" immunity since exposure virus vaccine immune system ""naive"" virus. Surely *can* ""eradicated"", matter reducing reproduction number R. best continue vaccinating everything moves, fast possible. far, none variants we've come across render vaccines completely ineffective. Even problematic strains simply reduce efficacy certain amount, ultimately compensated higher vaccination rates.

Just clear, we're likely eradicate strains sense wiped face planet, simply can't vaccinate can't get vaccinated. certainly render COVID non-issue, sooner later. think J&amp;J used UK  Right, although they're rapidly catching far fewer vaccinated people, poses way threat them. wearing mask 1/3 country vaccinated. let's stop using DNS see people enjoy stop articles? people well, exposing way frankly cruel. No, vaccines lower immunity. 

I'm sure would go finding vaccine country, live? Someone else may able comment know country. think that's part everyone misses travel restrictions implemented. people idiots, understand way stop variants crossing borders. buying time, time *could* used set better outcome. why?  Problem solved! sure whether Pfizer say whether data gets aggregated. Whats end goal here? Everybody makes exactly thing? wondering, ASPD stands antisocial personality disorder. missteps - calculated steps. Korea able postpone purchase vaccines exceptional containing spread virus, unlike States Europe. policy development perspective gives Korea much leverage comes negotiating price vaccine. current administrarion publicly announced, early stage, negotiating vaccine producers around world. Around time, nations alarming rate Covid cases, Canada, UK, France, Israel, etc..., purchased vaccine ask price - extremely over-valued purchase. obviously states options buy offered price containing virus turned failure. contrary, Korea considered one successfully managed covid spread without comprising economy -(no lockdowns). like said, policy perspective, makes sense Korea could wait see side effects arising states vaccinated first save money waiting. strong studies side effects place, Korea beginning purchase them. 

Hope helps. current regime far competent realize. Kids can't get vaccinesvyet lot immunocompromised people risk even vaccinated. prove anything. last variant appeared 3 months ago.... I'm pretty sure good amount people got vaccinated now. lower natural immunity future? 
And one more: gou guys find different vaccines? country Pfizer Moderna ""this good ones"" harder get that's lot people vaccinated A. Zeneca. real thing?

In months first got sick COVID-19 March 2020, Jennifer Minhas developed cluster mysterious symptoms. 

""I profound fatigue,"" says, along brain fog, headaches rapid heartbeat, especially changed positions lying standing up.

""Just standing make sandwich, heart rate would 120,"" recalls Minhas, 54-year-old nurse lives San Diego. normal heartbeat adult ranges 60 100 beats per minute.

Doctors ordered tests rule heart disease. came back normal. doctors find anything, Minhas says.

About time developed another strange symptom offered clue condition.

""I would wake middle night burning hands feet, would look feet would bright red,"" Minhas says. addition, continued feel tightness chest, brain fog intense times, says, remember four-digit code phone.

Her symptoms became severe stopped working. ""Normally I'm active. used play tennis go gym,"" says. activity came halt.

Yet doctors could explain wrong. first, primary care doctor thought anxiety.

""It disconcerting,"" Minhas says, ""lingering way long without proper answer."" persevered, determined ""dig look answers.""

And months later, late 2020, breakthrough: group cardiologists University California, San Diego helped lead diagnosis mercurial little-known condition: postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, POTS, blood circulation disorder.

A growing number people facing mountains frustration health problems linger COVID-19 clear path improvement. subset people what's known ""long COVID"" — mostly women Minhas — POTS diagnosis offers road map treatment options relief often-debilitating symptoms.

COVID-19 brings new cases, new awareness

The doctors told Minhas begun see patients COVID-19 developed similar symptoms. explained issue nervous system causing heart race, usually upon standing — signature feature syndrome — circulatory problems.

POTS type dysautonomia, stems dysfunction autonomic nervous system. That's part nervous system works automatically regulate body functions breathing, heart rate, blood pressure digestion.

Don't surprised never heard POTS. ""There's lack awareness"" condition, even within medical community, says Dr. Tae Chung, POTS specialist Johns Hopkins Medicine Baltimore.

The syndrome estimated affect 1 million 3 million people U.S. — commonly women, young adults adolescents. COVID-19 pandemic brought new attention many new diagnosed cases. 
 
-continued article- currently thought vaccinated individuals still transmit virus people without protection circumstances. big breakthrough everyone excited fully vaccinated individuals apparently cannot transmit COVID fully vaccinated individuals. Since 80% cases thought never detected thus included official tallies known get levels protect unprotected levels anytime soon. Germany slow vaccine?  BioNTech German company... FDA fully approved....or emergency excemption variants prove significantly worse kids Probably 20%-30% fewer height lockdowns based car insurance rebate checks.

They developing nearly 10 years, adapted specific virus. happenstance. like developed nothing vaccine year. mention vaccine trials take years finding right number candidates get data from. world full infections easy get results promptly.

Whats sad good therapy would help people pretty quickly nearly impossible find. I’m afraid cities forever changed crisis. Looks like moving back menu ??? Uncertainty. Lack trust. People get vaccinated go without mask ""inconvenience"". much detest people making masks political anti-vaxx, mean want see dead sick. That'd psychotic.

Not everyone everyone's family vaccinated yet they're anti-vaxx. They're still vaccinating nearly 2 million people day, there's still people want vaccinated yet. easy say ""it's choice let die"" relative friend.

My kids get first shot today, that's soonest could get in, there's still backlog appointments lot teens areas general population unless travel get one, many that.

So I'm anxious certainly see spikes cases even they're people see eye eye with. mean want see dead. sorry see stories India get downvoted ignored. It’s sub want ignore India tired hearing tragedy there. Maybe effort downvote India posts like claimed happened China. don’t know.

I know still many people care don’t want look away India rest South Asia’s crises. Better tell much metal Big Mac, using logic. Honestly think ones getting scared. I'd perfectly fine going back work vaccinated people allowed office non-vax could continue working remotely. company flexible frustrating part it. 0% job needs done office. make sure kids wearing mask distance others. need go mall you. chance vaccinated soon. way ask proof. sadly take care looks like whatever issue longer issue. Mainland China ramped vaccinations kicking ass. great thing see. Good bot might want double check claim. 

1984 last time Olympics yielded profit. 

But many national leaders like prestige comes hosting. 
To show off. 

Not everything comes pure economics. tinder sort federal human rights organization something? whatever hell want. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Okok sorry stupid joke I’m vaccinated. kids aren’t. can’t. don’t follow saying. mean, expect spend year half effectively traumatizing millions people instead offering balanced, evidence-based public health messaging? I’m wondering they’re going start vaccinating US military personnel. already require ton vaccines including anthrax shots smallpox. require covid? Exactly this. raise awareness encourage little apathetic it. friends (in 30s) never got around it. said much work, said time. lottery announced Ohio, immediately set appointments.

In meantime, handful know much anti-vax pissed idea lottery still refuse vaccine. top article. Buried article, 11 150. Worst part article mentioned 1800 migrant workers apparently involved plant. 

Shitty journalism   verbatim Wiki definition: 
 
Not sure getting at. Perhaps one people incapable realizing inability.  makes lot sense: vaccine hesitancy driven heavily poor understanding luck statistics.

Ergo, best way target well know way target poor statistical knowledge: lotteries. Never flu shot didn’t side effects either covid shots Sure can. proof have. Youve decided ""vaccine passports"". vaccinated wear mask distance. That's what's happening. Deal makes sense!  people seem know this? Either convinced parents stop caring protecting children. seems bit absurd. gonna weird pivot, US + Europe desirable vaccines exporting. much longer quarantining then? sure change time, i've seen live. also sure look nearby areas. I’m big fan sodium - potassium pumps. Never leave home without them. tell people chose get vaccinated that. idea proof vaccination controversial. think lot parents going continue masking long kids required to.

For reference, started presidency approval ratings near 50%. Post 9/11, would get near 90%. ah yes, smaller countries procreate, adults fall sky there, like suburbs really. cares nobody blaming uk uk variant, shit happens. use percentages size matter. Malta similar youth proportion Europe. also easier store easier distribute ? course, nothing dishonesty expected HCQ pushers. Well, enough. 
You always hear information Covid tests 
accurate. wondered actually could improve them. 
circumstances (no matter realistic are) would specifity higher? 
Which circumstances would increase sensitivity? I’d glad 
helpful answers. Please link source possible! :)  people generally stupid mean social media amplifies extreme voices. see people Twitter Reddit say they’re going wear mask forever, IRL you’re going see large scale. cough Heh, live South Florida. imagine masks feel summer... that's year round me.

I happier mask mandates lifted. feels like big weight shoulders. really, truth lies middle. EU paid upfront instance AZ production upstart new factories priced final price vaccine doses. yes EU paid less instance uk AZ shots end paid factories EU soil. Pfizer/Biontech, clue. know Biontech got ton German research money preceeding years covid. Pfizer vaccine [now higher temperatures, making distribution developing nations easier. Access refrigeration limited extremely rural parts developing nations. got 50¢ thread seem attract lot people *very* masks lockdowns people arent also them. 

And normal posts sub cautious folks.

Its strange phenomenon. Racists!!! Honest question : noise - anyone actually proved conclusively variant 

a) dangerous 'usual flavours' ?

b) vaccines \*not\* work ?

&amp;#x200B;

Seems like media frenzy  moved South African Brazil variants much news. went Target first time since lifted mask mandate vaccinated people. surprised still 60/40 people wearing masks, 75/25 employees.

I wore mine I'm quite comfortable yet taking mask grocery store, people wearing masks not.   main driver producers AZ fucked royally EU general distrust AZ.

The EU bet lot AZ need extreme cooling somewhat proven technology (in human use Ebola vaccines employ tech).However, EU got like third doses expected. Germany order Biontech countries decided redistributed. UK problem supply somewhat stable people actually want AZ. 


Retrospectively likely would paid restrict exports, even would lost supply lipids UK. However, would left rest world without Western vaccines.


Due fact EU whole needs vaccines also typically goes slower million doses drop bucket EU, translates several percent population countries Guess second contract emergency contact AZ started fail delivery goals 80 percent +. share source selling negative tests *at airport*?
I would like law enforcement involved. There’s really argument people odd views individual liberties. Vaccine passports absolutely thing Canada, it’s matter time.

Your rights individual supersede rights society large. people actually can’t get vaccinated medical reasons, false beliefs science allow put safety risk. basically exact opposite China did.  Yes indeed. every man situation. let's face even better end, countries yet receive single shot! Meanwhile USA: masks off, party time, kiss stranger, nothing see here!  wedding last September...they'd waiting long ass time.  Thanks, this. scary sick already. sincerely appreciate information. Good!!! can’t tell much mental health improved since getting first dose! count day shot, still worth it. Looking forward second shot I’m thinking people got az able fully vaxxed sooner got Pfizer moderna. Yes Actually surprised uk let former colony way. Even thousand shots goodwill would gone long way. disease still risk, hence reason case counts much higher Fall. I'm talking kids 12, high schoolers.

Plus, like dozens dying. vaccinated seniors. different illness young. Everyone 16 ample time get vaccinated. Everyone 12 ample time Fall. cases less 10 per 100,000 kids masks. I’m saying modeling studies incorrect (even though many widely inaccurate throughout pandemic). I’m saying headlines articles written based modeling studies, journalists often don’t interpret data correctly correct context. population size Malta, 70% 16 close 70% total population. That's country size suburb. Exactly. Time change. Focus community local production, stop global consumption resources mind much winter, approach summer totally different. Goes something helps keep warm hot sweaty. Also wear glasses, got sunglasses realize annoying fogging is. Thankful timing.  Yes already used ebola among things yes new. also advantage needing less cooling. problem however resolved soon last advantage vector vaccines gone. sure another advantage, vector vaccines look like end road atm. don’t support (domestically) I’m vaccinated.   feel thing far over? 

I guess pessimist. variants scare living shit me. 

I wonder much efficient virus going get. Went brewery New York day mask requirement indoors lifted vaccinated individuals. felt great walk place, order beer, without mask on. Damn, we're back baby. Meh. Cool .. wait bit ? Whatever floats boat guess include prior infection? Travel India basically stopped month ago enter cannot even test free quarantine 


They really try prevent rise another variant cost, e.g. put whole building total lockdown. 3-4 booster shots reordering stuff replace AZ. new contract also includes child vaccines adaptions new variants time. Whatever used given away countries like west balcans.  rules regulations make absolutely fucking sense anymore. vaccinated show legitimate negative covid test able travel. fucks sake. Germany even cases deaths UK last week. Indian variant showing middle nowhere colorado, think Germany yet? One busiest airports/hub world. getting fucking insane European union fucking big time ~300 children died Covid part broader 0-17 age range. many deaths kids closer upper limit age range (already eligible vaccine) many kids 12? 12, many known condition major factor? 

I really think people really overestimating risk young kids. True, might meant. Museum Fire Ants think forever, ok taking time readjust. people young kids, maybe care someone extra vulnerable cancer patient, knows. difficult give once, especially working long keep everyone safe, understand. difficult trust vaccine truly keep safe even trust prevents spreading others. piece cloth helps feel safe little bit long, let be. often worried spreading personally. messaging public health officials great honest. message mask even vaccine thrown us long. sudden change bit unnerving many. 


I area still 90%+ masks even outdoor parks. expect change overnight. Maybe soon see 80% masks, people nervous see numbers continue go down. 70% masks, even nervous, however numbers continue go down. point people dropped masks, see even point case numbers still low/dropping mindset start shift. AstraZeneca vaccine favorite going it, mRNA vaccines surprised everyone stole show. already proven technology

Was really, though? seems new overall. see advance purchase contract negotiated November last year. categorically case. think restricting peoples civil liberties mass vaccination rolled out. personally can't wait get vaccine. barely even notice wearing it

This one gets me. Barely notice arse. can't breathe well it, engage strenuous activity becomes torture.

If hot start sweating, gets damp becomes even harder breathe.

Not mention fogging glasses, fact quickly develop odor wash often.

Seriously, fuck masks. I'm wearing required. myopic view consider direct risks covid. Domestic violence rose sharply pandemic kids trapped abusers without possibility teachers etc notice. Rich-country-poor kids infrastructure participate online classes. Kids parents help schoolwork even disadvantaged before.

After demanding solidarity 14 months them, kids left behind yet again. Otherwise, blame burned whole place down. Apparently one cares anyway. recall EU pretty greedy price policy regarding deal, whereas US took first deal available therefore secured far vaccines.

I keep hearing different reasons... plausible every one.

I'm guessing one ""a bunch medium failures led massive failure"" things. start hold legally liable? Mayor Bloomberg insisted NYC Marathon right Sandy. got cancelled. Woodstock 50 organizers determined hold festival face growing opposition. got cancelled. could go on. call ""percent population fully vaccinated"" rate? got first dose yesterday! really nervous waiting piece cake. even feel needle, side effects except tired, small headache rather stiff/sore arm. One go I'll fully vaccinated :) That's television ya appreciate humor, even without /s think required valid QR codes test results available online.  Add that, average malnutrition course one's lifetime. horrors compound result worse outcome. saw EU bought like 1.8 billion doses Pfizer vaccine.

Doesn't Eurozone population like 600M? Appalling abuse legal system. Raoult total quack. Containment measures mattered more. India cracked hard. relaxed wave happened. well known. 

As I’ve said, covid still spread wildly summer. (Hence US comment.) spreads *more* winter. 

And overcompensated lockdowns social distancing. Something US sucks India got lax worst possible time. ""Their love knew bounds! border patrol disagreed."" choice sadly simple. issue vaccine availability; ability keep usable deliver within timeframe.

The Pfizer vaccine helpful many less developed nations. routine power supply issues rural areas provide necessary refrigeration. transit infrastructure creates many delays. Corruption leads theft spoilage hold (bribe) delays. 

So even Pfizer FDA update allowing five days normal refrigerator temperatures, sufficient get distributed places like Mali Sudan.

As result, developed countries may soon swimming vaccines deploy elsewhere wanted without building power grid roads. 

Hence US giving orders AstraZeneca others. stable longer. funny Europe got us vaccines ol selfish ""best friend"" merica helped receiving aide throughout whole pandemic. One starts p v.

Besides that, little difference.

California apparently work large event companies ""vaccine verification"" program look like. there, matter time California chooses best one requires businesses state implement it.

My bet happen recall election. logic could point US say even though WAAAAAAY people Germany we're ahead single double Vax rates... Germany STILL behind.

What trying say Germany (the EU) fucked bad seems... *did*.  predicted months ago first Covid-themed rom-coms would start showing later year. 

""Coming summer... even mask could keep apart!"" That's hilariously wrong.   care wear masks quietly it. start telling people vaccines good enough necessary safety end basically sending anti-vaxx propaganda different angle. tolerate that.

Then there's contingent wants vaccinated continue wearing masks, even though CDC says necessary. 

I'm willing budge inch either group. No. I’m US sending vaccines, it’s “altruistic”. comes big countries, wether it’s US China European nation, every action political purpose, especially involves countries well them. Again, I’m it’ll help lot poor nations, see is. recall EU pretty greedy price policy regarding deal, whereas US took first deal available therefore secured far vaccines.

Also, Biontech (the developer vaccine) german, Pfizer (the manufacturer) isnt. doubt Biontech much control vaccines sold to. States greater majority vaccinated mask mandates lifted. state greater majority vaccinated mask mandates lifted. say “fucked” hardly anyone actually dies covid without preexisting conditions. things like remote learning, remote work options them. use common sense take proper precautions. survival rate well 99%. country cannot keep restrictions forever. find 50% vaccinated rate reasonable lift restrictions. Additionally many 2 million children extremely low risk anyways. California June 15 restriction lift target similar concept. problem one inherited march, yes race time  companies countries fighting pandemic profits sickening shit. Actually no, makes lot sense, every day delay helps vaccinate people. British rather fast taking everything personally especially Brexit. Yeah tbh that’s totally reasonable, least vaccinated doubt production ramped up, were, used till vaccine teach body create antibodies fight specific infection. may feel sick day two aside effect body/immune system. whole anti-vaccine movement going devoted spreading misinformation dangers vaccines. Don’t believe it, it’s bullshit. 

The best vaccine get whichever get soonest. Yeah AZ vaccine little less effective others it’s still worth getting still considered remarkably effective. Germany 40% population first doses probably overtake USA weeks. AZ delivered promised EU would pretty close USA. American vaccine/raw material export bans slowed initial production EU, catching pretty fast. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

With people describe introversion online, makes sound like extrovert. think social requirements low something different introversion. 

I booming energy mask mandate lifted. felt nice work normally gym, go cafe chat. Simple things kept sane prior pandemic. 

Two things I'll set: favorite sushi place reopening next month, concerts

Everything else stacks top me. knew. officer health Dr. Rosana Salvaterra said virtual briefing Friday socializing primary reason COVID-19 case counts increasing Peterborough they’re decreasing elsewhere seven-day case incidence rate jumped 63 cases per 100,000 people 45 week ago. variant already circulating, fact countries showing concern proves, yet again, everyone opened prematurely. discussion point time pointless anyway... People currently getting vaccinated already received shots eligible.

The Ohio one also retroactive anyone gotten [To eligible win, participants must least 18 older day drawing, Ohio resident, must vaccinated rumored Colorado one Ohio one, rewards everybody got vaccine equally, whether needed incentive not. mean? can't get vaccinated yet super high noradrenaline, serotonin, dopamine levels. Stupid drugs. Working getting them, though. forced get vaccine soon? think body handle side effects. right here, EU trading bloc individual member bloc can't forbid exports even want to. U.S. UK bloc, countries setting export policy. know Indian variant LESS immune escape South African variant. means likely use whatever efficacy vaccine SA variant absolute floor. reason they're saying two doses needed, likely Pfizer requires two doses significant efficacy SA variant. 1 dose Pfizer around 30%, whereas second dose brought 70's.

Now, leave J&amp;J? J&amp;J robust data variants trial. 1 shot J&amp;J efficacy 64% South African variant. previously stated, Indian variant LESS immune escape SA variant. means 64% likely absolute floor J&amp;J Indian variant. knock J&amp;J gets, appear best efficacy variants, least comes single dose.

All long way say, 1 dose J&amp;J likely enough. 2 probably better course, 1 dose probably still 64-70% range Indian variant. get point making? said UK/US added protectionist clauses, EU didn't, seem agreeing?   What’s incorrect? Fallikg behind? catching vaccinating mich faster UK weeks now. Hong Kong would astonished twelve Taiwanese genuinely wanted reunion mainland. What's rush? 🤷🏻‍♂️ No, all, EU willingly allowed exports raw materials finished vaccines anyone met contractual obligation EU. I'm sorry. lost grandma COVID January. days shy 84 really good health. parents lived well mid-90s, us assumed would too. 

I hope dad changes mind. Way go USA keep saving others around world. Small population means smaller numbers make bigger percentage impacts. I’m sure never kind easy safety measure risks one million. guy hourly agenda think I've ever actually encountered ""forever masker"". seen lots people complaining supposedly existing.  April. German citizens residents allowed in, quarantine required. Moderna folks: Anybody else feel oddly buzzed/euphoric couple days muscle aches/fatigue subsided? I’ve feeling slightly high since yesterday, apparently thing people.

Not worst side effect stretch, hope goes away soon. I'd support vaccine passport long travel overseas without stay $3,000 hotel jail.  uni vaccination center set already. Yeah, know 2021 definitely no-go. However, point beyond (and could take years), countries ""let COVID in"" never going away. point might everyone wants vaccine able obtain one think hard they've really conditioned accept zero-COVID know sustainable long-term. South Africa 2: Electric Boogaloo variant aware EUA vaccines vs full fda approval don’t know long term efficacy? nothing safety. Gatorade!  anyone else gone rabidly pro-mask spring summer last year (due widespread use low-covid countries East Asia) exhausted them? Like still wear one inside despite state's mandate ending last Monday, get happy seeing unmasked faces every day city (outdoor mask-wearing fallen 60% 10% past two months anecdotally).  Statement Novavax. Trial participants get proof vaccination. ""didn't add protectionist clauses"" means primarily working home since pandemic began, what's company bringing people back office?

The office sold, new policy work anywhere. pretty democratic honest. employees want go back commuter lifestyle, company happy productivity, selling expensive property subsequently pay taxes / maintenance good too. Yes, long get work done time, boss care sleep?  already live ""show papers"" state. show gubmint-issued passport travel internationally, leaving home, entering destination, leaving destination, returning home. show license ID cops stop driving. show ID get nightclubs buy alcohol cigarettes. list go on. pooled data Pfizer AZ

This seems key  Vaccination nationalism. EU stopped exporting like USA did, would 90+ doses per 100 population-  mean 40% country fully vaccinated that’s you’d expect. Wow, theres much thats incorrect post. wow. recent months, though, it’s become clear coronavirus slippery, shape-shifting foe—and spike appears one malleable traits. Eventually, first generation spike-centric vaccines likely become obsolete. get ahead inevitability, several companies already looking develop new vaccine formulations packed additional bits coronavirus, ushering end monogamous affair spike.

This article takes idea virus eventually, random mutation, create spike protein *almost completely* able evade current immune response still highly infectious. understand it, that's questionable best. limited ways spike protein mutate still actually able able infect human cell. sounds like they're trying develop future vaccines provide broad immunity conferred infection. Lol.

India issue calling last variant UK variant, don’t want name attached even worse variant?

Ok… Actually lot studies show immunity natural infection pretty robust. International image matters people guess. number people getting infected dying must priority 
 government officials regularly used term “UK variant” since  
the mutant British strain started spreading India.

Okay, keep mind.. Good! India needs doses use boosters later. tests means get lower percentage positive, higher absolute number cases. you’re trying monitor pandemic, that’s good thing. proven technology, adenovirus vaccines new. Chinese vaccines use traditional technology doses acquired paid Mexico, produced Argentina. US government nothing it. read article next time. aggravating whole situation measles antibodies. even tested med school alongside required vaccines/ immunities This. test more, pick higher absolute number cases, lower percentage positive. That’s good thing. Would nice CDC given notice time instead dropping bomb nowhere.  Nah, go stores everyone wears masks me. Indian COVID-19 type situation could happen West enough people vaccinated take precautions right home.

In North America many individuals refusing vaccinations social distancing measures. COVID-19 mutate creates North American variant. doses mostly produced Argentina, finished US paid Mexican billionaire, plant Mexico problems getting started.

“The regional project delayed months hiccups preparing bottling plant Mexico, Argentina sent active ingredient United States processing instead.

The first doses regional deal, supported Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim's charitable foundation, due hit streets next week, problems plant Mexico pushed back original March deadline.

When AstraZeneca factory Mexico reaches full capacity expected help relieve pressure providing 150 million doses region year.” U Yeah hash it, still selling it. broker it. Two shots average one variant... Three variants year next 100 years... I'll graduate pharmacology ASAP. That's gold mine ;) Also, masks hide face. I’m extrovert greatly miss non stilted social interactions. Masks completely change dynamic trying talk someone. I’ll wear mask really miss interacting normally people. Cue Sun anti-German idiocy. went shopping today work shoes hard pants first time year half... guess return work stuff really happening.

For primarily working home since pandemic began, what's company bringing people back office?

My office open since July, voluntary basis (except senior leadership direct reports, offices)... starting June, us open office pit monkeys also required start coming 1 day/week (ramping 2-3 days/week fall) yet driver's license pretend makes feel better. vaccine provides significantly protection covid.   make sense, antibodies small parry immunity. measles antibodies still safe measles. Exactly thoughts, got understand anti vaccine market demographics  targeting people. targeting people fence procrastinating ""later"" course nearly done shopping couple employees vicinity started really loud conversation selfish wear mask inside. Directed me, I'm sure. found little obnoxious.

Uh thought trader joes said people wear masks store? Nepal huge outbreak almost vaccines. Good China cancelling trips side. Let’s hope international travellers don’t hop plane COVID. I'm pretty sure would trouble selling someone's private information got via working hospital. Maybe aggregated bunch people's info made non-identifiable would fly. Mexico's GDP per capita less $10,000.

The UK, Germany, Canada, etc., around $45,000.

Just manufacture refrigeration units mean government afford them.

Know place. Dumb fucks  They’d speed rollout used good doses available. know two people got J&amp;J wife’s friend’s husband couldn’t easily get two appointments due variable work schedule got shortly restriction lifted glad able get done one dose. I’m sure plenty 8n similar predicaments. vaccinations, point reinfections either person even know mild. Every study looking previously infected people shown great results. ""Infection"" bad word already got vaccinated. faster body clears virus, less time possibly spread even all. That's plagues Astra Zenecas vaccine. Hence weird half full shot numbers December reach maximum efficacy falling behind Pfizer. Russians worked around using two different strains two shots, everyone knows story second one. Also expert adeno viri must get mRNA info planted top. guess adaption new covid strains might way time consuming. PA's adult first dose percentage 68.9%. Come guys, needed take dose could've something beautiful...  vaccinated start protesting demanding unvaccinated wear mask protect unvaccinated?

I think should, flags banners everything. (plus safe protest streets)  Protests happen touch business owners try force employees situations in. Glad work you.  Altruism. That's upside exponential growth: even stop earlier one day, difference still significant. managed confine transmission early, peaking within 1 month outbreak, within Hubei province.

There’s also account wastage well I’m sure Yes exactly right, remember well Italian: March weeks country highest number deaths world, goes it, think example damage reputation image. reality never been, since Iran official covid toll counted less half real deaths, China slightly tenth... likelihood mutates US small countries like India 10x cases. true all. I’m fully vaccinated support international travel. basic domestic use create problems solve, particularly you’ve reached level vaccination allows restrictions removed. Exactly, I’ve encountered people choose wear mask outside haven’t interaction negative live place mask compliance still quite high. Well, good experience yesterday going maskless BJs, issues. Today went Shop Rite (grocery store NE familiar) literally I'm walking in, old guy told put mask. Yes, again, different cultures. even surprising different attitudes prevail.   Herd immunity happen unless young people get covid get vaccine. That's important. Governments absolutely allow people decide best interests. Governments tend harm good take ""I know whats best you"" approaches. Yeah, article saying cultures different attitude. It’s surprising actually. one saying someone needs wear mask Americans wearing one. saying cultures point wearing mask greater individual’s concern. even predict based culture mask wearing would received.

Ronald Place said briefing ""If math, [the vaccine is] 99.9% effective beneficiaries preventing infection, 99.999% effective preventing hospitalizations 100% effective preventing death,"" Place said. ""That's incredible."" cards reminder slips. pieces paper medical provider information. print one fill home.

There's something fundamentally wrong maki g massively disproportionate amount money combat death. view whether unvaxxed people wear mask also opinion. opinion that's shared public health officials subject matter experts.

(For anyone making fun people wearing masks)
It’s easy wear mask. It’s even easier ream someone still wearing one. Go maskless you’re vaccinated, CDC says it’s mostly safe, stop commenting people aiming 100% protection still. somebody want wear mask to. Especially state literally paying people get vaccinated event outdoors. 

You're one saying asshole behavior. That's opinion. like breath fresh air dude. know young healthy people struggled well week couple unhealthy people runny nose sore throat day two. buddy symptoms loss smell.

Hope get health back soon Masks protect people. infections mainly happening unmasked areas. exception hospital plenty symptomatic covid pts. Hardly anyone infected masked areas everyone mask. infections happening gatherings places people could masked. Nice try, mask police. mask time past year, complicit killing others. You’re ok that? won’t infect anyone return normal? like saying nobody allowed drive people might drive drunk. kids &lt;12 vaccinated think consider anywhere close finding baseline. lot parents going keep taking precautions whole families then.

AZ great us available large numbers us deaths high vaccines scarce, saves hundreds probably thousands lives. longe makes sense rich European nations.

If vaccine British sub would never defend way none 588k deaths either. Awesome, let's see get right then.

If used lower R0 2.2, IFR 0.53, best case scenario allowing spread far wants would

IDK old grandfather is, auto-scheduled appointment 3.5 months 1st dose, like me, either pretty late schedule 70-79 age bracket he's 60-69 age bracket. latter case, assuming chronic illnesses, there's 1.7M people higher priority 2nd dose moment (excluding already got 2nd dose). So, grandfather getting 2nd dose end July worst case scenario.

If he's 70+ chronic illness accelerate vaccination rate less 85% population goes 1st dose, grandfather get sooner. two weeks old completely outdated new CDC guidance.  Yes, be.

Although know, largely propaganda straight untrue. got vaccinated earliest opportunity, mean want live ""show papers"" state.  that’s real answer. 

We already accept vaccinations required travel places active infectious disease outbreaks. You’ve yellow card passport travel places Yellow Fever decades. 

We also already require vaccination participate services protection others. Children transferring new schools present vaccination records, unless prohibited starting classes unless valid exemption. Immigrants prove full current vaccination move country. 

We also already tracked whatever extent would allow people tracked. vaccinated database. Travel movements logged based presenting ID airport domestically. 

As Constitutionality, right freedom movement always included qualification, one justified qualifications always quarantine public health. Additionally, far haven’t seen proposal absolute prohibition travel without vaccine passport. Mainly prohibition air travel.

Fully vaccinated kids luxury given scarce supply vaccines worldwide. wasn’t clear guess. way around. wouldn’t surprised 60% people *already recovered* went get vaccine *after they’d Covid.* know four people got Covid, 100% got vaccine *later.* musing maybe that’s statistic misunderstood. could entirely made up. too. Well ever know would went system vaccines would get financing without priority access attached, really matter debating that. 

The EU divides vaccines based number inhabitants countries. Thats takes longer specific countries EU get vaccinated. 

The UK US that, it. They'll say vaccinated really ""check"".

On hand, approaching pharmacy within store require masks, put one on. sure requirements change pharmacy, would think would fall CDC saying wear medical settings? check see elaborated. mention 80% COVID19 infections asymptomatic first place...Most people likely even know People certainly noticed. looking right things. Doesn’t get reported much though. See edited post. Well done! Thank getting vaccinated :) shitting right? universe CDC making guidelines follow? Nah virus Wuhan nothing worry about....for three months preparing country, nah wear mask good, nah people retirement homes need tested regularly, wait let's send test kits utter shit set us back 2 months...and list goes on.They political wanks scientists point 0 credibility. AFAIK adenovirus vaccines' biggest weakness people become immune carrier virus. mRNA vaccines seriously, seriously awesome there's small tiny silver lining pandemic they're finally seeing light day.  See edited post reason? plausible 60% people infected *previously* later went get vaccinated (in fact I'd hope it'd least many, but...). 60% people getting vaccinated infected *after* vaccinated ludicrous though. happen we'd fourth wave past months would dwarf previous waves combined.  don’t care. doesn’t effect life whatsoever. Seems it’s time stopped giving people crap wearing one wearing one. Unfortunately people live states Governor also feels way. could end situation states implement vaccine passports others ban them. I'm US friends Australia I'd like visit future. However, I've thinking situation plays Aus/NZ regards opening borders point. countries benefited greatly managing pandemic well thus, used locking drop hat cases. populace little prior infection immunity COVID-19 basically non-existent. COVID-19 would spread like forest fire given opportunity. point, they'll either vaccinate entire populations (unlikely) accept COVID-19 going circulate among population. Otherwise, borders need remain essentially closed years.

Does anybody predictions things play Aus/NZ?  It’s still going up, we’re done yet. get 70 still trying get rid severe lockdown.

According local reports, Taiwan capacity test \~20,000 people/day. 

Given Taiwan testing 0.26 people/1000 people (vs 12.42 Singapore 4.08 Hong Kong), think Taiwan able fully contain outbreak things get worse here. pertenctage people want join mainland [barely double stupid. seen happened Hong Kong. Even idea working One Country Two Systems situation dead.

Having hostile neighbor regularly threatening invade country staging war games totally preparing military invade country help either. Agreed. think ROI $1M lottery way better spending $1M TV ads. Depending channel timing, TV ads add really quickly $1M. 

Just context, 30second commercial primetime television, network channels, depending day week, probably cost anywhere $50k - $300k each.  That's myth. signed August pretty much everyone else.

The eu literally decided allow vaccine exports. England US didn't.  Circulating, yes.

At current near disaster levels?

No. “Austrian variant” occurred, call that. move past upset calling variants country discovered bc country great job* handling pandemic. There’s judgement. (At least me, it’s easier keep track saying place emerged).

It would helpful gave names like hurricanes...I'm thinking variant Dave, variant Gladys, variant Clive.... think vaccine passports international travel, large indoor gatherings stuff along lines perfectly logical. think making work flights fairly easy, threaten massive fines get caught random checks. Kinda thing experienced Germany came getting tickets U-Bahn, check ticket every time get hit pretty hefty fine get caught without one. think indoor concerts events would basically impossible check that. definitely contagious, seems vaccines hold better instance sa variant. key get vaccination rates asap hits.

Surprised actually got 3 days fast, tbh expecting June, mean average 33M/day China's incredibly fast pace could actually reach month's end.   Sorry, reply dates showing EU MONTHS late signing contracts AZ Pfizer, removed.

All public domain though. actually really good idea lol. I'm encouraged ""ALL ANTI-VAXXERS GOING TAKE MASKS!!!!!!!!"" bullshit screamed proven false, least experience. Oxford/Astra lot ok really think didn’t circulating already? so, god you’re gullible. Pretty sure (UK) signed deal Oxford uni AZ. don’t think people issue international travel schools since, yes, you’ve always vaccines well.

But think issue people trying add layer wasn’t past. I.e.: proof vaccinations concert, going mall, going grocery store. *never* vaccines, think many people would agree shouldn’t change vaccine.

Most people wouldn’t fight mandatory vaccinations things always required vaccinations, think issue comes trying ban non-vaccinated people things never required vaccination past. That's fine, people mirror behavior seemed think wearing one outdoors general useful many situations not. anxiety. way, continue believing covid dangerous everyone says is. hurting anyone else, right? that's they're comfortable, let live. things I've gotten back post-vaccine, still boundaries I'm keeping now. Taking slow, hard year, feel like flip switch mentally. thought US banned export those, too, J&amp;J built independent European supply chain? science turned anyone. objective take sides. ilk believe it, refer ""science"". yes, clear utility vaccinated people wear masks. soon get children question vaccinated use wear masks school.
Then again, fairly confident chosen vaccinated, vaccinate children (if them), yet go maskless everywhere. true patriot values freedom selfish child lives others. Maybe stoked. wins time vaccination efforts. Closing borders 100 percent European soil impossible. win weeks, might enough vaccine borders up. I'm pro anti-mask. I'm simply following science. Maybe airport, test faked *outside airport still used fly*.

So real situation much better.

FFS remember back April flight India Hong Kong like 50 fucking people test positive covid upon landing MSF best bet help people developing countries. put medical care places otherwise match volunteers communities share language. We’re looking Yorkshire triple mutated variant...never ends. vaccine people getting Germany? think right. think that's see lot people complaining ""forever maskers"" well. people extreme opinions care people wear masks. Yes thats think got India hard. Basically contagious variant hitting population neither vaccinated paid significant death toll bill Luke many others. Pretty much could happen Australia smaller scale open early thing China aware of. Brasil another story .. Proof natural herd immunity never efficient vaccinations put trust Trump like person even stupid Trump! Lmao, guy either lying straight ignorant. Pretty sure German schools general German populace define ""rate"" exactly way defined it. like eat lunch outside. break I’ll put mask walk back work go inside. It’s easier wear instead holding hands last minute get door building. Also mask don’t bother all. Zero percent.

One time walking back work lady came said “you don’t that. wearing mask?” said “what care” kept walking. think makes sense. lot cases realize actually made us want something something. rare cases want something without influence whatsoever. that's fine! say let's get every Draper Peggy Olson find problem... like call false equivalence. countered equally ridiculous false equivalence. Please explain mask wearing choice. Healthcare access correlated healthcare outcomes. UK ahead Canada metrics (total doses administered people one dose). reason vaccinations opening age uptake high. That's say Canada bad, UK behind Canada insinuated comment. Pretty sure still fly - there's mandatory hotel quarantine do. Slow everyone vaccinated.

Every vaccine seems prevent severe symptoms basically variants.

And limit spread well.

So imo careful, everyone 60 got shoots everyone else, wants got least one shot vaccine.

That supposed September, 4 Months.  ""If treatment early on, probably would life instead becoming housebound unable sit up."" autoimmune disorder way. need talk invisible disabilities chronic illnesses raise awareness people get answers.

I wish known autoimmune disorders decade ago - would've saved much suffering. cannot compare drivers license vaccine passport... get drivers license required inject something body, covid passports require inject something body. cannot compare drivers license.. even close. US defeated smallpox requiring everyone get smallpox vaccine tossing jail. Supreme Court says constitutional saying public’s collective rights important anyone’s individual rights.  Like can’t yell fire crowded theater get people killed. - getting downvoted wrong - cases still dropping Israel. woman autoimmune disorder, feel you. Invisible disabilities/ chronic illnesses invalidated time. Even doctors. 

Even subreddit, I've people say ""Are sure COVID fatigue/ lingering symptoms psychosomatic?"" article man whose post-covid symptoms bad could barely shower himself. premise somehow slippery slope “non-zero” risk behaviors, correct? think that’s nonsense, I’ve explained why. Less 1% spike protein mutated since first appeared 18 months ago. Considering mRNA vaccine redesigned within 6 weeks adapt new variant, targeting spike still seems best strategy. new vaccine substantially higher efficacy 95% current vaccines, tall order. read it. understand poster talking about. can’t focus one thing argued. link say know, FACT, first exposure US soil. well educated guesses based positive testing times travel. it. They’re smarter present something can’t proven truth fact. repeatedly ignoring actual issue lost argument. It’s even debate. Period. nearly 40 percent first vaccianations tho, steadily rising couple weeks. getting there. like going bike ride, keeping helmet long walk done cycling. Yeah, safer, make sense. tests speak ongoing now. They've testing 6m 11 year olds since mid-late March. results start July. yeah tested younger kids could available age groups August. I’m vaccinated. Whether people poses effectively risk health. can’t around people aren’t vaccinated, defeats one core reasons mass vaccination first place. warm weather

Lol India AstraZeneca factory Mexico reaches full capacity expected help relieve pressure providing 150 million doses region year. poorly worded. convo Gen-Z, us late 20s millennial get grouped Gen-Z covid stats (ie. 18-29 24-29 groupings see alot). trying make distinction failed. comment reddit minutes waking brain 100%. No, breaking guidance. unvaccinated fools are. I'm kind sick punished them. I'm willing show anyone wants card really untrusting, I'm tired fucking theater. Throwing bodies Ganga also practice giving example culture develop mask wearing practice independent scientific evidence favor use situation. go around telling people do, find useful accurate understanding virus transmitted. large, outdoor transmission super low warrant mask typical cases. keep one person, become necessary situation, default make sense.  propose ensure unvaccinated people remain masked? Two ways:

1. Check vaccine certificates

2. Require everyone wear masks 

If Starbucks isn’t first one need second one. Makes sense?   Since thing “certificate” vaccination status cannot verified. It’s nothing. Everyone must wear masks masks optional. required live life differently immunocompromised? AZ relying US Maryland plant vaccine active ingredient make part production shortfall EU plants. (I try find link discussing this.) US significant bottling capacity allocated AZ vaccine. time Biden administration offered AZ doses India, indicated none stock maybe 10M weeks. 60M AZ doses stock everyone speculated AZ seems abysmal producing vaccines even US. Yeah. retail workers really want mask police? saw worked before, even dealing ignorant, dealing belligerent.

Just get vaccinated go business. basic domestic use create problems solve,

I disagree, solve problem near plague-bearers create problems all. US PEOPLE: able use vaccination proof negative test returning home US international travel? whole travel Covid test big scam. get valid Covid test doctor it’s acceptable travel. one acceptable travel costs $100.00. sad horrifying. 

My minds people India hard times.

Hope increase vaccination help put end misery. think really hard keep new variants oit country, globalised world.
But definitely slow down.

There many connections India Germany. 
Probably Frankfurt Main organise decent quarantine infrastructure there.

There lot connections UK Germany small Airports, lot people. 

The Kent variant dominant Germany probably 1-2 months later UK. 
The Indian variant seems spread London now. 
If spreads Germany 3-5 months, everyone vaccinated. demand employer require vaccination they’re concerned proximity unvaccinated people. Severe anything often fatal Africa.

They lack infrastructure resources. really surprise. physically go regional public health unit get out. sure could done digitally never argued UN vaccinated people remain wearing masks. makes total sense. seem ignore science says vaccinated people don’t need wear masks. 

Why difficult you?  I’m giving example “science” says vaccinated need remain masked cases. CDC call vaccinated ditch masks cases. see photos sick dying Covid-19 patients India US western countries? 3% number based self reporting small sample size medically accurate value based true population nation. way government track citizens are

A QR code scanned cell phone pinging central database provide government anything already know want know cell phone provider 50 different apps already phone. Ironically, find far people complaining others still using masks people say people keep masks on.

I've never met forever masker. meet people whatever reason, extremely bothered others wear masks volition. disagree masks, hundreds people still dying daily tens thousands infected. pandemic categorically Yeah I'm Seattle yet see anyone inside store without mask (except me). Tons people wearing walks empty streets still. Gonna real slow change back normal parts.   one “checking vaccine cards” can’t. faked across country. vaccinated someone else important you. Get vaccinated don’t worry others doing. ""Malta expected reach target vaccinating 70 % population aged 16 COVID-19 middle next week.."" - one dose vaccine enough immunization population even wild type #VOC's #B1351 #B1617. Pretty much reason wear one due job requirements. pretty much dropped masks since getting vaccinated used strictly pro-mask. depends person person. sister got second shot ex 0 side effects. personally sore arm nothing else first shot (moderna) agree! don’t vaccine need mask…I never said otherwise. vaccinated don’t need to…it’s hard totally agree Pallister jerk incompetent, he’s saying isn’t unreasonable. US vaccine surplus. could provide Canada enough doses vaccinate rest Canadian population would barely make dent supply. Even US sharing 10 million Pfizer doses would pretty much guarantee every Canadian age 12 fully vaccinated July. 

Did Ford actually say lol. seems like everytime goes “man people” vibe get “lord idiots” vibe.   debate risk level fact remains cdc guidance 

**the unvaccinated need remain masked up**

If Starbucks isn’t checking vaccine cards need require masks everyone. Otherwise breaking cdc guidance. Nobody position authority answer question frustrating. Everything I've found like ""You're considered fully vaccinated. worry it."" every new article read variants mentions MRNA vaccines. I'm frustrated got J&amp;J available desperate, we're sitting many doses Pfizer people turning noses at. Thank you. soon would guess would feel like crap? make 4 hours shot I'm good. read lot stuff people saying felt bad slept. Well, tough shit. I'm vaccinated, flown plane, went crowded bars, eaten restaurants, grocery shopped without mask, much more. 

They fearful house want. Funny Starbucks listed…

I agree tight confines like train, medical buildings masks make complete sense. However don’t make sense retail settings Neither government policy tons research, seems know, 3rd highest deaths bit states... children 18 knowledge work Starbucks, would love see statistics many immunocompromised people work Starbucks whole. 

No one stopping wearing mask! still can, however vaccinated poses little threat someone vaccinated. unsafe might feeling like crap. Quebec got vaccinated May 19 second dose Sept 8 :( DeSantis almost nothing protect population. see dumb people arguing something idea they’re talking about. actual advocate science would consider evidence instead blindly ignoring it. isn’t placebo. expecting reaction. fact, symptoms shot felt great three weeks. Adverse reactions proven CDC. one three doctors could explain great Ill move on. Im convinced long term effect vaccine. Everyone still need wear masks instances. example mass transit, hospitals, prisons, schools. coming CDC. rates also lower comparable vaccines, pfizer. Hey good luck wish happy pregnancy delivery. everyone get vaccinated. immunocompromised (3% population, millions people) may protected vaccines. Also kids. saying Australia NZ authoritarian? even better number China. Also fear appearing weak? connection long haul covid POTS discussed long hauler community year. I'm kind surprised treated fairly new revelation.

My stepsister diagnosed POTS years ago. go sitting standing suddenly feel like going faint, scary hell, concerned got diagnosis. Thankfully, although really impact life, POTS life-threatening. Muhammad go mountain, mountain comes Muhammad!

Old British proverb. problem heavy physical activity, immediately following Pfizer Moderna first shot? Looking like I'll pretty heavy work right shot next week, wondering reschedule work I'll probably OK till next day.   youngest age groups, vaccine safer getting AstraZeneca


Do studies back up? situation? offered vaccine? told can’t wear mask? 

If vaccinated others doesn’t impact  Thank you! I’m hoping second dose easy first. moved late lifting mask mandates. People fully vaccinated don’t need wear mask! It’s backed science since February. Hopefully workers airport fully vaccinated.  get saying, change fact employees put situation in. They're saying feel safe, feel safe place work. Can't wait see scene couple slide mask engaging hot french kiss session agree them. Starbucks wants comply cdc guidance, **need ensure unvaccinated remain masked up**. 

That means either:

1. Everyone needs wear masks. 

2. Vaccine certificates need checked door. 

Since they’re checking certificates need require masks everyone.

If employees immunocompromised (3% population) going chemo haven’t taken vaccine reason, Starbucks unnecessarily putting risk. Sure, state laws also led charge late historically always moved action late major issue. really appreciate correction, didn’t know that, thank you. like learn new things Reddit! 

My main issue way studies reported opposed studies themselves. particular study, though use data things opening whole, needs context reporting them. poll people wearing masks views? impression could get measurement percentage ppl covid antibodies percentage poop contained lol State laws lead charge make mask mandates, shut business first place….only makes sense state law would lead way back out. Agreed. also many armchair ""doctors"" reddit point long covid symptoms similar anxiety dismiss that. couldn’t agree more. beta blocker, helps still can't sit long without feeling faint. tried graded exercise program designed POTS turns also ME/CFS, exercise also greatly contributed progression illness. used able walk sit exercise, barely without severe consequences. history would never lie. plenty documentations YouTube showing locked Wuhan. also videos show villages blocked entrance stopped anyone outside come in. Also numbers came way earlier anyone else long time numbers way there. Remember time 3000 infections daily looked scary? Yeah, look like tried stay radar. aren’t forced remove masks!! long like. Vaccinated people don’t need wear mask!! uncomfortable idea around people aren’t vaccinated, get vaccinated!! Everyone point. anxiety, *but* medical professionals actually put work determine otherwise, chalk anxiety call day. Live let live bro. feel safer it, fine it. get fresh air without mask outdoors! bother reading article, you? yet statement still rings true. Employees feel like they're comfortable taking masks yet. THEYRE ones would know first hand group regulars refused follow mask mandates, rant anti Vax, etc. low level employees know what's safe they're actually thing.

Edit: also big yikes we're suddenly agreeing state laws lead charge what's right ok odds striking small, also understood hand consequences actions…they wouldn’t fast strike!

No one stopping wearing masks long want. Vaccinated people don’t need wear masks. Dumb take. Everyone told get first one available. data shows j&amp;j ~90% effective 8 weeks. Yeah, makes data useless anyone outside UK. assume they're trying embarrass AZ whatever galling. I'm vaccine passports per se, digital ones pose potential infringements privacy. Now, people would say everyone get vaccinated, agree. thing I'm scared though, digital system show QR code e.g. bouncer club, ping database ensure vaccine status. way government track citizens are. current day age, 3 letter agencies known abuse powers, think trust government data. That’s really accurate. CDC explicitly let business owners make call. 

And importantly clear unvaccinated need remain masked up. unless Starbucks wants check vaccination certificates door, logical conclusion require masks everyone.

It clearly unsound decision let unvaccinated wear masks. Well, September free ride ends. Going lot sad people getting evicted struggling find jobs point. Thats bold assume belong sort ""ilk"". took part vaccine trial ensure safety efficacy vaccine, could shouted alarmist claiming vaccine work need act certain way. 

 

Science objective, vast amounts data says masking vaccination useless. again, forcing choice upon person accommodate baseless fears selfishness. frame way want downvote want arguing antithetical science presented us.  Pallister Ford Kenny’s worst premier’s Covid.

He’ll anything distract ranks

I never felt safe mask utilized social distancing protection, vaccinated really care others around are...I protected...so much better mask. damn business, lost first pregnancy excited find pregnant March 2020, *right before* knew happen.

It’s clearly irrational, it’s easy see they’re like that. comes politicians it’s important watch do, say, seems like pretty much everyone position power wants reopen vaccinations underway.

Personally I’m surprised India’s recent challenges surfaced much sooner 'good news'? isn't. paranoia. following science listening CDC. fear. depressing. billionaires don’t care We're 16 weeks Kuwait us got AZ vaccine. MOH barely enough give second shot us received it. 

I'm honestly doubtful enough brain cells start handing Pfizer/Moderna second shot instead already since relatively ""available"" now, actual studies backing mixing matching came ago...

I know made logical choice taking vaccine available time can't help internally illogically regretting choice looking badly company handling situation since March (I took February). months prepare. still 47 states, every state started amount cases. think ignoring fact millions kids home school parents can't go flip burgers kids sit alone. Also kind business owner writes dollar amounts like that? Yikes.
